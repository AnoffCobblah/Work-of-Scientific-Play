   In  accordance with the Statutes,   notice  of the ensuing Anniversary
Meeting for the election of Council and O<U+FB02>icers was given from the
Chair.
   The President stated that Captain L. L. B. Ibbetson, who by reason
of non-payment of his annual contribution ceased to be a Fellow of the
Society at the last Anniversary, had applied for readmission; and an
extract from his letter to the Council was read, explaining the circum
stances under which, during his absence on the Continent, the omission of
payment had taken place.      Notice was accordingly given that the question
of Captain Ibbetson’s readmission would he put to the ballot at the next

                                       (Abstract.)
       This Catalogue contains all the nebula: and clusters of stars which its
   compiler has been able to <U+FB01>nd anywhere described, and identi<U+FB01>ed in posi
   tion sut<U+FB01>ciently to warrant their inclusion, with exception of a few which,
   having been observed by Lacaille or others with telescopes of very small
   power, have been obviously nothing but insigni<U+FB01>cant groups of small stars
   indistinctly seen. The number of objects comprised in it is 5078, including
   —-1st. 2508 nebulae and clusters described by the late Sir \Vm. Herschel
   in his Catalogues of Nebulae communicated to the Royal Society.                2ndly.
   Those comprised    in the  lists published by    Messier,   discovered by    himself,
   Mairan, Oriani, and others, to the number of 102. 3rdly. Those con
   tained in M. Auwers’s list of “ New Nebulae” (Verzeichniss             nener Nobel
   <U+FB02>ecke)  at the end  of  his  Catalogue  of Sir  VVm.    Herschcl’s   nebulae  (about
   50 in number), and those few of Lacaille’s nebulae which seem entitled to
  be regarded as such from the description given of them.              4thly. A great

  their places being indicated with suf<U+FB01>cient probable precision to allow of

  communicated by M. D’Arrest, of his own discovery, for inclusion in this
 Catalogue; and some few others'(some very remarkable ones) collected
  from various sources, as announced from time to time by their respective
  discoverers.    And 6thly. 15 nebulae not before described, communcated
  by Professor Bond, which are included in a small supplementary list.
 The remainder will be found described and their places (reduced to 1830)
  given in the Catalogue of Nebulae and Clusters communicated to the Royal
                                                     ‘
  Society by the compiler in 1833, and in his Results of Astronomical Ob
  servations at the Cape of Good Hope,’ published in 184 7.
‘     The places of the objects contained in the present Catalogue were in the
 <U+FB01>rst instance brought up by its compiler to the common epoch (1830),
 availing himself, so far as respects the nebulae of Sir Wm. Herschel’s cata
 logues, of a reduction to 1800 of all the individual observations of each
 nebula, by his sister the late Miss Caroline Herschel, which reduction,
 arranged in the form of a catalogue in zones, together with the originals of
 all the “ sweeps” in which the observations are contained, and a synoptic
 register of those of each nebula in separate sheets for reference, with other
‘original papers elucidatory of the above-mentioned documents, as well as
 the whole series of Sir Wm. Herschel’s observations of Messier’s nebulae,
accompany this communication for future reference.
     In order, however, to render the catalogue so compiled available for
future observation, it was considered desirable to bring the whole up to a
later epoch.      The computations necessary for this purpose being very

                                                                       '

 extensive and    of a nature to be safely entrusted to other hands, the Royal
 Society,  on   the application of the compiler, readily and most liberally con
 sented to supply the funds for defraying the necessary expense of this
operation.       On consultation with the Astronomer Royal, it was resolved
that the places having been <U+FB01>rst roughly brought up to 1860, the places so
obtained should be used to compute the precessions for 1880, by the ap
plication qf which to the original places the <U+FB01>nal and exact places for 1860
should be obtained and entered up. This will secure _the availability for
the use of observations, of the present Catalogue, without fear of material
error up to the year 1930 at least. The actual computation was executed
by Mr. Kerschner, one of the computists employed at the Royal Observa
tory, the Astronomer Royal kindly undertaking the arrangement and super
vision of the work. The computations were made on printed forms, and
are preserved for reference.
   The Catalogue is arranged in general order of right ascension-—in'co1
lumns, containing a current general number, four columns of synonyms
and references to the original authorities; the right ascension, precession
in R.A., and the number of observations on which this element relies; a
similar set of columns for the North Polar distance, and a brief descrip
tion, in abbreviated language, of the object, deduced from a careful compan
rison inter se of all the descriptions given in the original observations.
Lastly, are appended two colu1nns,—the         one containing  the total number
of times the object has been seen by Sir Wm. Herschel and by          the author
of the present paper; the other, references to a series of notes      annexed at
the end    of the Catalogue, and to a general list of places where engraved
<U+FB01>gures    of  the objects will be found.
   The notes so appended contain remarks on every particular brought
under discussion as affecting the evidence on which the adopted places
rest, and whatever else may be considered requiring explanation in refere
ence to each object.       In particular they give the results of a very careful
comparison       of the  present Catalogue with the elaborate catalogue (for
 1830) of M. Auwers, already mentioned, of the existence of which the
compiler was not aware till the whole of the computations had been com
pleted and the present Catalogue arranged and copied out.             This com
parison has led to the detection (as might very reasonably be expected)
of several instances of mistaken identi<U+FB01>cation of stars of comparison, and
some few of numerical error, and has so far resulted in the expurgation
                                                                             '

4                            Dr. Hofmann    on Kinone.                [Nov. 19,
     IV. “ Note    on Kinone.”        By A. W. llorsmus, LL.D., F.R.S.
                             Received June 23, 1863.
    The easy and perfect transformation of beta-phenylcne-diamine           into
kinone, which    I  have pointed out in a former communication, has induced
me to examine the action of oxidizing agents upon other derivatives of the
phenyl-series.
    Aniline, when submitted to the action      of a mixture of peroxide of man
ganese    and sulphuric acid, furnishes very appreciable quantities of kinone,
which sublimes, the residue containing the sulphates of ammonium and
manganese.

This equation represents, however, only one phase of the reaction.          The
result, in a measure, depends upon the mode of experimenting:           one part
of aniline, four parts of peroxide of manganese, and four parts of sulphuric
acid diluted with its own bulk of water were found to be appropriate pro
portions.     But the amount of kinone is always limited, the greater portion
of the aniline undergoing further alterations.
     The experiment succeeds much better with benzidine.         On heating the
mixture of this base with the oxidizing agents, torrents of kinone are in
 stantaneously evolved, which condense in the receiver into magni<U+FB01>cent
 yellow needles. The quantity of kinone thus obtained corresponds to the
 amount    of benzidine employed.

 The transformation of aniline into kinone, very naturally suggested the idea
 of examining the behaviour of these two bodies with one another.
     The reddish-brown liquid obtained by dissolving kinone in aniline very
 rapidly solidi<U+FB01>es into a crystalline mass. The crystalline product of the
 reaction proved to be insoluble in water, alcohol, and ether, and several
 solvents which    I tried, so that puri<U+FB01>cation by crystallization became im
 possible; it was therefore found to be convenient to accomplish the re
 action in the presence of a large quantity of boiling alcohol.       The brown
 liquid deposits on cooling reddish brown almost metal-lustrous scales,
 which by washing with cold alcohol become perfectly pure.
     The analysis of this substance shows that it has the following com
 position  :—
                                          (C0  H5):

residue  which is left on evaporating this liquid with hydrochloric acid,
is a mixture of hydrochlorate of aniline and llydrokinone. They are easily
separated by treatment with ether, which dissolves the hydrokinone,
leaving the aniline-salt as an insoluble residue.     The ethereal solution,
when evaporated, yields colourless needles of hydrokinone possessing all
the characteristic  properties which distinguish this remarkable body.
Addition of ferric chloride to their aqueous solution produces at once the
green prisms, with golden lustre of the intermediate hydrokinone.
   The action of kinone upon aniline is therefore represented by the follow
ing equation :—

   The study of this reaction has induced me to repeat an experiment men
tioned by M. Hesse in his beautiful researches on the kinone group*.
   By submitting aniline to the action of c<U+FB01>loranile (tetrachlorkinone),
M. Hesse has obtained a compound crystallizing in reddish-brown scales,_
the general properties of which resemble those of the kinone derivative
above described.   The composition of the compound formed with chlor
anile M. Hesse represents by the formula

    by M. Hesse may possibly <U+FB01>nd a satisfactory explanation in the con
    tamination with toluidine of the aniline which has served for his experi
    ments.    Commercial      aniline invariably contains more or less toluidine.

          I. On Aniline-yellow.” By A. W. HOFMANN, LL.D., F.R.S.
          Received June 29, 1863.
       In  a short  paper submitted to the Royal Society in the commencement
    of last year,  I  have described a few experiments on the remarkable new

    general attention.      This paper had more particularly reference to aniline
    crimson,   the  industrial    production of which, in the hands of Mr. E.
   Nicholson, has reached so high a degree of perfection that the analysis
  "of this compound and of its numerous salts presented no serious di<U+FB01>i
    culty. But the problem was not solved by establishing the formula of
   irosaniline and its salts: by far the more important obstacles remained to
    be conquered; the molecular constitution of rosaniline, on which at that
    time  I had not even been able to offer an hypothesis, and the genesis of
    this well-de<U+FB01>ned triamine from aniline, had still to be traced.       Since that
    time considerable      progress has been made towards the solution of this
    problem.     Some of the latest observations which      I have had the honour
    of submitting to the Royal Society will doubtless help to untie this knot.
    Nevertheless    many doubtful points still remain to be cleared up, and          I
  found it desirable for the better elucidation of the subject to investigate
    simultaneously several of the other arti<U+FB01>cial organic colouring matters, in
    order to trace    if  possible analogies of composition and constitution in
    these substances, which, it was reasonable to hope, would throw some light
   upon the principal subject of the inquiry.
       The present moment appeared to be particularly appropriate             for an
   investigation of this kind.          The International Exhibition has    brought
   together    a  collection   of   these  new bodies, such as no other     occasion
    could possibly have assembled in one place and at one time,              display

    of our time assimilates and, in many cases, anticipates the results      of pure
   science.
       I have commenced        the study    of a few of the new colouring matters
    which several of the distinguished exhibitors of these compounds have
   placed at my disposal—a study which has been greatly facilitated by the
   zeal and experimental skill of a young chemist, Dr. A. Geyger, who has
    assisted me in these experiments.          Owing to the number of these sub

   these researches as they present themselves.                These Notes must neces
   sarily be of a somewhat fragmentary character; but                  I  hope to collect
   the results thus gradually accumulating, and to lay them before the Royal
   Society in more logical order and a more elaborated form.                  I  begin the
  account of this series of experiments with the description of a yellow
  colouring matter which is obtained as a secondary product in the manu
  facture of rosaniline.
      C/Lr_1/8anz'line.—It is well known that even in the most successful opera
  tion, and whatever the process of preparation may be, the rosaniline pro
  duced is only a small percentage of the aniline employed. Together with
  the crimson-colour a large proportion of a resinous substance of feebly
  basic properties is formed, the generally ill-de<U+FB01>ned characters of which
  have hitherto bai<U+FB02>ed all attempts at a thorough investigation.                This mix
  ture contains nevertheless several individual compounds, which may be
  extracted    with boiling water, and subsequently separated by treatment
  with reagents.        Mr. E. C. Nicholson has thus isolated a magni<U+FB01>cent
  yellow colouring matter.         Considerable quantities of this interesting body,
  Mr. Nicholson with his usual liberality has placed at my disposal, for
  which my best thanks are due to him.
     The yellow colouring matter, for which, on account of the splendid
  golden-yellow tint it imparts to wool and silk, and in order to record its
  origin,  I propose the name of chrysaniline, presents itself in the form of a.
  <U+FB01>nely divided yellow powder, closely resembling freshly precipitated chro
  mate of lead, perfectly uncrystalline, scarcely soluble in water, which it just
 colours, easily soluble in alcohol and in ether.             This compound is a well
  de<U+FB01>ned organic base, which forms with the acids two series of crystallized
 saline compounds.         The most characteristic salts of chrysaniline are the
 nitrates, more especially the mononitrate, which is di<U+FB02>icultly soluble in
 water, and crystallizes with facility.           It was from this compound, puri<U+FB01>ed
 by   -half  a  dozen   crystallizations,    that    I  prepared the chrysaniline for
 analysis. An aqueous solution of the pure nitrate decomposed with am
 monia. yields the chrysaniline in a state of perfect purity.            The analysis of
 this substance, dried at 100°, has furnished results which may be trans
 lated into the formula
                                        (3.. H11   N.
 This expression is corroborated by the examination of several salts, more
 especially the beautiful compound which this base produces with hydro
chloric acid.

For analysis these salts were dried at 100° or         120°, at which temperature
they remain     quite unchanged.        \Vhcn    heated  more strongly they lose
hydrochloric acid. When the diacid chloride is maintained for a fortnight
between 160° and 180°, the weight of the salt again becomes constant.
The residuary yellow crystalline powder, differing from the original hydro
chlorate only by its somewhat diminished solubility in water, was by ana
lysis found to be the pure monacid hydrochlorate of chrysaniline,

The crystalline compounds which chrysaniline forms with hydrobromic
acid and hydriodic acid are perfectly analogous to the salts produced by
hydrochloric acid.     I have not analyzed them.
    The nitrates qf chrysaniline are the <U+FB01>nest salts of this base; these
compounds crystallize with the utmost facility in ruby-red needles, which
are remarkably insoluble in water. A dilute solution of nitric acid (1 grm.
of HNO3 in a litre of water), when mixed with moderately dilute solutions
of the chloride, yields immcdiatelya crystalline precipitate, so that soluble
chrysaniline salts might be used as a test for nitric acid.          For the same
reason nitric acid is conveniently employed in separating chrysaniline from
the crude liquid obtained by boiling out the secondary products of the
manufacture of rosaniline.        Nevertheless the preparation of the nitrates
presents unusual difficulties, and       I have lost much time in endeavouring
to <U+FB01>x the conditions under     which     the monacid and the diacid salts may be
separately produced.     On boiling an excess of free chrysaniline with dilute
nitric acid, a solution is obtained depositing, on cooling, needles which are

 But here also analysis exhibits slight discrepancies, indicating the presence
 of traces of the former compound.          By treatment with water the dinitrate
 gradually loses its nitric acid, and after two or three crystallizations it is
 converted into the mononitrate.
     The sulphate is very soluble, scarcely crystalline.
     The platinum-salt is a splendid scarlet crystalline precipitate, which,
 from hot and rather dilute solutions containing much free hydrochloric

      Received June 30, 1863.
   Among the several stages which mark the development of the industry
of coal-tar colours, the discovery of the transformation of aniline-red into
aniline-blue will always hold a prominent position. This transition, for
the <U+FB01>rst time observed by MM. Girard and De Laire *, two young French
chemists of M. Pelouze’s Laboratory, and subsequently matured by M.
Persoz, De Laynes, and Salvétat         has become the foundation of an
                                                      1',
enormous industrial production, which, having received        powerful im              a
pulse by MM. Renard Brothers and Franc in France, and more recently by
Messrs. Simpson, Maule, and Nicholson in this country, has rapidly attained
to proportions of colossal magnitude.
   The transformation of aniline-red into aniline-blue    accomplished by a.    is
process of great simplicity, and consists, brie<U+FB02>y expressed, in the treat
ment at     high temperature of rosaniline with an excess of aniline.
            a                                                             The
mode of this treatment     by no means
                                 is    indi<U+FB01>erent.    Rosaniline itself cannot
in this manner conveniently be converted into the blue colouring matter;
the transformation   is, however, easily accomplished by heating rosaniline
salts with aniline, or, vice versd, rosaniline with salts of aniline.   Again,
the nature of the acids with which the bases are combined         by no means          is
without in<U+FB02>uence upon the result of the operation; manufacturers give
a decided preference to organic acids, such as acetic or benzoic acids.

   phenomena         which characterize the transition of rosaniline into its blue
   derivative; again, the several processes of puri<U+FB01>cation to which the crude
   product is submitted have thrown much light upon the chemical character
   of the compound.
       MM. Girard          and De Laire, whose names are so intimately associated
   with the development of the new colour-industry, have pointed out that the
   passage from red to blue is attended by an evolution of torrents of am
   monia; and Mr. Nicholson, who combines the genius of the manufacturer
   with the habits of the scienti<U+FB01>c inquirer, has ascertained that the blue
   colouring matter is invariably a saline compound of a base itself colourless,
   like rosaniline.         But the relations between the two colourless bases, and
   consequently the nature of the reaction by which rosaniline is converted
  into the blue colouring matter, had hitherto remained unknown.
      It was therefore with great pleasure that I accepted the kind offer of my
  friend Mr. Nicholson to supply me with the necessary materials for the
  elucidation of this question.
      The salt transmitted to me, and which Mr. Nicholson had prepared
  himself, was the chloride.
      Hydrochlm-ate.—This compound is an indistinctly crystalline powder
  of a bluish-brown colour, which at 100° becomes pure brown.                                 It is
  perfectly insoluble in          water,   cold or boiling—so much so, indeed, that it
  imparts     no    colour     to  the  water   with  which it is washed.         It is likewise
  insoluble in ether, but dissolves, although with dif<U+FB01>culty, in alcohol,
  which assumes the magni<U+FB01>cent deep-blue tint characteristic of this colour
 ing matter.           The boiling saturated alcoholic solution deposits the chloride
 on cooling in the form of imperfect crystalline granules.                        The alcoholic
 solution,     when       evaporated,     leaves  the   compound       as a   thin    <U+FB01>lm, which
 re<U+FB02>ects the light with ‘a peculiar metallic, half-golden, half-coppery lustre.
      The hydrochlorate has the same composition whether dried in vacuo
 or at 100°. Several analyses made with specimens of different preparations
 lead unmistakably           to the expression

no di<U+FB01>iculty.        This salt dissolves in alcoholic           ammonia,    giving rise to a
wine-yellow      solution.        This liquid contains the         base   in the free state,
together with chloride of ammonium.                     On ebullition the blue colour re
appears, the salt being reproduced              with    evolution of ammonia.       Addition
of   water, on the other hand, produces             _a  white or greyish precipitate, con
sisting of tripkenylic rosaniline.              The best mode of procuring this com
pound in a state <U+FB01>t for analysis is to pour the concentrated solution of the
hydrochlorate in ammoniacal alcohol into water, when the base separates
as a curdy mass which soon collects upon the surface of the liquid.
During the process of washing, and especially of drying, even in vacuo,
the greyish powder gradually assumes a blue tint. _ The vacuum-dry sub-'_
stance, when exposed to 100°, assumes a deep brown colour, which it retains
on cooling; at 100° it slightly fuses, but does not change weight.
    Triphenylic rosaniline shows a tendency to crystallize, but hitherto have           I
not been able to obtain it in distinct crystals.               The solution in alcohol and
also in ether (which dissolves the base with the greatest facility) have,
 even on spontaneous evaporation, deposited the base in the form of an
 almost amorphous residue.
    Analysis assigns to this base the composition which corresponds to that
 of the hydrochlorate previously examined, namely
                       Gas Has    Na  0:020 His     (Co H5)s Na! H2     0'
 Triphenylic rosaniline is thus seen to separate from its saline combinations
 in the state of hydrate, exactly like rosaniline itself.
     I have endeavoured to obtain further con<U+FB01>rmation of these results by the
 analysis of several salts of triphenylic rosaniline.                These salts were inva
 riably prepared by       treatment     of  the  free   base  with  the  free acids.     They
 resemble in their properties the hydrochlorate--so much so, indeed, that
 they could not possibly be distinguished without analysis.                      The nitrate
 is perhaps   a  little  more,     the  sulphate   a  little less  soluble  in  alcohol   than
 the hydrochlorate.          The following salts were submitted to analysis :—

    Action of reducing agents upon Triphenylic Rosam'line.—Remembering
the facility with which rosanilinc is attacked by reducing agents, and the
valuable help which the examination of the leucaniline thus produced
afforded in establishing the formula of rosaniline,       I  was led to study the
deportment of the triphenylic derivative under similar circumstances. This
substance indeed is readily reduced both by nascent hydrogen and by sul
phide of ammonium.
    The alcoholic   solution  of the chloride, when left in contact with zinc
and hydrochloric acid, is rapidly dccolorizcd.            The clear liquid when
mixed with water yields a white, scarcely crystalline precipitate, which may
be freed from chloride of zinc by washing, and separated from accidental
impurities by solution in ether, in which it is easily soluble.
    If  the reduction be effected by sulphide of ammonium, the product is
apt to be contaminated with sulphur and secondary products. In this case
the separation has to be accomplished by treating the crude mass obtained
in the reaction with bisulphide of carbon, which dissolves both the sulphur
and the product of the reduction, leaving behind a brown resinous sub
stance, the nature of which is not yet investigated.          The mixture remain
ing after the evaporation of the bisulphide of carbon is repeatedly boiled
with soda, which dissolves the sulphur; the residuary compound is then
 <U+FB01>nally puri<U+FB01>ed by solution in ether, from which it is deposited on spon
 taneous evaporation in the form of a friable resin.
    Unfortunately this compound is no longer basic, so that it was im
 possible to combine it with acids; but its combustion has furnished numbers
 agreeing exactly with the composition assigned to it by theory, namely
                         Gas Has  Na=C2o His (Ca H5): Na’
 The compound accordingly        is triphenylic leucaniline.    It will be observed
 that the triphenylic derivative, like leucaniline itself, is anhydrous—a
 constancy of behaviour in the normal and derived compounds which has
 already been pointed out in the case of rosaniline and its phenylic deriva
 tive.    Under the in<U+FB02>uence of oxidizing agents, the hydrogenetted body is
 rapidly reconverted into the compound from which it has been obtained.
 The experiment succeeds best with platinum-chloride. The colourless
 solution of triphenylic leucaniline, when boiled with a few drops of dichlo
 ride of platinum, immediately assumes the splendid blue colour which
 distinguishes  the salts  of the non-hydrogenetted base.
    The transformation     of aniline-red into aniline-blue possesses   a variety of
 interests.   A lively imagination      might  feel tempted to speculate on the
 relation between colour and composition; but there are other questions
 claiming more immediately the attention of the experimentalist.
     Up to the present moment chemists were unacquainted with a method
 of pltenylation. The chloride, bromide, and iodide of the phenyl-series
 have been but imperfectly studied; but we are su<U+FB02>iciently acquainted with
 them to know that they are far from possessing the plastic character of
 the corresponding      compounds of the methyl- and ethyl-series, which

confers such value upon these substances as agents of research. We are
unable to substitute phenyl for hydrogen by processes borrowed from the
experience gathered in experimenting with the ordinary alcohols.              Diphe
nylamine    and  triphenylamine     are substances  existing  at present only in the
conception of the chemist.          It was reserved for the peculiar,       I  might
almost say instinctive mode of experimenting belonging to industry to <U+FB01>ll
up this blank.
    The transformation of rosaniline into aniline-blue suggests some other
questions which must not altogether remain unnoticed here, although                I
hope to enter more fully into this subject elsewhere.              Does this trans
formation simply involve an interchange between the hydrogen and phenyl
atoms, or does the rosaniline molecule lose ammonia, which is replaced by
aniline '!
    I  do not pretend to answer this question; but      I  beg leave to record some
experiments    as materials towards the solution      of the problem.
           Met/tylic, Ethylic, and Amylic Derivatives        of Rosaniline.
The interpretation      of the results delineated in the previous pages legiti
 mately suggested the study of the behaviour of rosaniline under ordinary
processes of substitution—in other words, the treatment of this base with
 the iodides of methyl, ethyl, and amyl. I will not describe the pleasure
 with which I observed the intense blue colour of the mixture of rosaniline
 with these iodides when, after a day’s digestion,         I took the sealed glass
 tubes from the boiler.      The action of iodide of methyl and ethyl is readily
 accomplished at 100°      C.;  iodide of amyl requires a temperature of from
 150° to 160°.      The presence of alcohol facilitates the reaction.
     Up to the present moment I have only examined in detail the action
 of iodide of ethyl. The product of this action is an iodide which dissolves
 with a magni<U+FB01>cent blue colour in alcohol.          The tinctorial powers of this
 solution are scarcely inferior to that of rosaniline itself; and industry will
 probably not disdain to utilize this latest indication of science.
     The blue ethylated derivative of rosaniline, as might have been ex
 pected, presents in its properties greater analogies with rosaniline itself
 than the triphenylic compound.         This analogy suggested di<U+FB01>iculties in the
 separation of the two substances which it appeared better to avoid.             The
 iodide produced by the reaction was therefore at once decomposed by soda,
 and the ethylic derivative, together with the unaltered rosaniline, again
 submitted to the action of iodide of ethyl. After this process had been
 once more repeated, the alcoholic solution of the <U+FB01>nal product was preci
 pitated by water, which separated a soft resin-like substance, solidifying
 on cooling with crystalline structure, and exhibiting a very peculiar
 metallic lustre intermediate between those presented by the salts of ros
  aniline and of its phenylic derivative.        Crystallization from dilute spirit
  furnished the iodide in the pure state.       The results obtained in the com
 bustion and iodine determination       of this substance agree with the formula

showing that the frequent repetition of the process of ethylation had pro
duced, not the Izydriodale of triethylic rosaniline, but the etllyliodate of
this   substance,——a   result which appeared particularly welcome, inasmuch
as it  threw   at the same  time considerable light upon the degree of substi
tution which belongs to rosaniline itself.
   The facts elicited by the study of the action of iodide of ethyl upon
rosaniline    open a new <U+FB01>eld of research,_ which promises a harvest of re
sults.   The question very naturally suggests itself, Whether the substitution
for hydrogen in rosaniline of radicals other than methyl, ethyl, and amyl,
may not possibly give rise to colours differing from blue; and whether
chemistry may not ultimately teach us systematically to build up colouring
molecules, the particular tint of which we may predict with the same
certainty with which we at present anticipate the boiling-point and other
physical properties of the compounds of our theoretical conceptions?
   This idea appears to have <U+FB02>oated in the mind of M. E. Kopp when,
with remarkable sagacity, he concluded his paper on Aniline-red* in the
following terms 2-“ The hydrogen of this substance being replaceable
also by methyl, ethyl, and amyl, &c., we may anticipate the existence of a
numerous series of compounds, all belonging to the same type, and which
might constitute colouring matters either red, or violet, or blue.”
   Conceptions which only two years ago appeared little more than a
scienti<U+FB01>c dream, are now in the very act of accomplishment.
   I   propose to continue these researches, and intend in a later com
munication to submit to the Royal Society the results obtained in the
study of two other colouring matters derived from rosaniline, viz. aniline
green and aniline-violet.

fessor William Thomson (made in 1858, but not yet published), as con
taining the demonstration of the general principles of the <U+FB02>ow of a liquid
past a solid body.
     3. Every <U+FB01>gure of a solid, past which a liquid is capable of <U+FB02>owing
smoothly, generates an endless series of water-lines, which become sharper
in their forms as they are more distant from the primitive water-line of the
solid.      The only exact water-lines whose forms have hitherto been com
pletely investigated, are those generated by the cylinder in two dimensions,
and by the sphere in three dimensions.              In addition to what is already
known of those lines, the author points out that, when a cylinder moves
through still water, the orbit of each particle of water is one loop of an
 elastic curve.
     4. The pro<U+FB01>les of waves have been used with success in practice as water
 lines for ships, <U+FB01>rst by Mr. Scott Russell (for the explanation of whose
 system the author refers to the Transactions of the Institution of Naval
 Architects for 1860-62), and afterwards by others.               As to the frictional
 resistance of vessels having such lines, the author refers to his own papers
 —one read to the British Association in 1861, and printed in various engi
 neering journals, and another read to the Royal Society in 1862, and printed
  in the Philosophical Transactions.        Viewed as plane water-lines, however,
  the pro<U+FB01>les of waves are not exact, but approximate; for the “ solitary wave
  of translation,” investigated experimentally by Mr. Scott Russell (Reports
  of the British Association, 1844), and mathematically by Mr. Earnshaw
  (Camb. Trans. 1845), is strictly applicable to a channel of limited dimen
  sions only, and the trochoidal form belongs properly to an endless series of
  waves, whereas a ship is a solitary body.
      5. The author proceeds to investigate and explain the properties of a
  class of water-lines comprising an endless variety of forms and proportions.
  In    each series of such lines, the primitive water-line is a particular sort of
  oval, characterized by this property, that the ordinate at any point of the
  oval is proportional to the angle between two lines drawn from that point
  to two foci.      Ovals of this class ditfer from ellipses in being considerably
  fuller at the ends and <U+FB02>atter at the sides.
      6. The length of the oval may bear any proportion to its breadth, from
  equality (when the oval becomes a circle) to in<U+FB01>nity.
       7. Each oval generates an endless series of water-lines, which become
  sharper in <U+FB01>gure as they are further from the oval*.                In each of those
   derived lines, the excess of the ordinate at a given point above a certain
   minimum value is proportional to_ the angle between a pair of lines drawn
   from that point to the two foci.
       8. There is thus an endless series of ovals, each generating an endless
   series of water-lines; and amongst those <U+FB01>gures, a continuous or “fair”
   curve can always be found combining any proportion           of length to breadth,
      *  As a convenient and signi<U+FB01>cant name for these water-lines, the term " Oiigenous
   Nedids” is proposed (from 'Qoyem)s, generated from an egg, or
                                                                 oval).

from absolute bluifness to a knife-edge.
    9. The lines thus obtained present striking likenesses to those at which
naval architects have arrived through practical experience ; and every suc
cessful model in existing vessels can be closely imitated by means of them.
    10. Any series of water-lines, including the primitive oval, are easily and
quickly constructed with the ruler and compasses.
    11. The author shows how to construct two algebraic curves traversing
certain important points in the water-lines, which are exactly similar for
all water-lines of this class. One is a rectangular hyperbola, having its
vertex at the end of the oval.          It traverses all the points at which the
motion of the particles, in still water, is at right angles to the water-lines.
The other is a curve of the fourth order, having two branches, one of which
traverses a series of points, at each of which the velocity of gliding of the
particles of water along the water-line is less than at any other point on
 the same water-line; while the other branch traverses a series of points, at
 each of which the velocity of gliding is greater than at any other point on
 the same water-line.
    12.  A  certain point in the second branch of that curve divides each series
 of water-lines into two classes,—those which lie within that point having
 three points of minimum and two of maximum velocity of gliding, while
 every water-line which passes through or beyond the same point has only
 two points of minimum and one of maximum velocity of gliding.                Hence
 the latter class  of lines cause less commotion in the water than the former.
    13. On the water-line     which traverses the point of division itself, the
 velocity of gliding changes more gradually than on any other water-line
 having the same proportion of length to breadth.          Water-lines possessing
 this character can be constructed with any proportion of length to breadth,
 from 4/§_(which gives an oval) to in<U+FB01>nity.          The <U+FB01>ner of those lines are
 found to be nearly approximated to by wave-lines, but are less hollow at
 the bow than wave-lines are.
    14. The author shows how horizontal water-lines at the bow, drawn
 according to this system, may be combined with vertical plane lines of mo
 tion for the water at the stern, if desired by the naval architect.
    15. In this, as in every system of water-lines, a certain relation (according
to a principle <U+FB01>rst _pointed out by Mr. Scott Russell) must be preserved
between the form and dimensions of the bow and the maximum speed of
the ship, in order that the appreciable resistance may be wholly frictional
and proportional to the square of the velocity (as the experimental re
searches of Mr. J. R. Napier and the author have shown it to be in well
formed ships), and may not be augmented by terms increasing as the fourth
and higher powers of the velocity, through the action      of vertical disturbances
 of the water.

                                   (Abstract.)
    After referring to a former paper in which he had shown that, in the
Great Indian Arc of meridian, deflections of the plumb-line amounting to
as much as 20" or 30" would be produced if there were no sources of com
pensation in variations of density beneath the surface of the earth, and
after alluding to a remarkable local de<U+FB02>ection which M. Otto Struve had dis
covered in the neighbourhood of Moscow, the author proceeds to consider,
in the <U+FB01>rst instance, the eifect of local attraction in mapping a country
according to the method followed by geodesists, in which differences of
latitude and longitude are determined by means of the measured lengths of
arcs, by substituting these lengths and the observed middle latitudes in the
known trigonometrical formulae, using the mean <U+FB01>gure of the earth, although
the actual level surface may differ from that belonging to the mean <U+FB01>gure
in consequence of local attraction.     He concludes that no sensible error is
thus introduced, either in latitude or longitude, if the are do not exceed
l2§° of latitude or 15° of longitude in extent, but that the position of the
map thus formed on the terrestrial spheroid will be uncertain to the ex
tent of the de<U+FB02>ection due to local attraction at the station used for <U+FB01>xing
that position.    In the Great Indian Arc this displacement might amount to
half a mile if the de<U+FB02>ections were as great as those calculated from the
attraction of the mountains and the defect of attraction of the ocean, irre
spective of subjacent variations of density; but the author shows in the
next two sections that some cause of compensation exists which would rarely
allow the actual uncertainty to be of any considerable amount, unless the
station used for <U+FB01>xing the map were obviously situated in a most disadvan
tageous position.
   The author then proceeds to examine the effect of local attraction on the
mean <U+FB01>gure of the earth, considering more particularly the eight arcs which
have been employed for the purpose in the volume of the British Ordnance
Survey.     He supposes the reference station of each arc to be affected to
an unknown extent by local attraction, and obtains formulae giving the
elements of the mean <U+FB01>gure obtained by combining the eight arcs, these
formulae involving eight unknown constants expressing the deviations due
to local attraction at each of the selected stations.   By substituting reason
able values for the unknown de<U+FB02>ections, he shows that local attraction s
competent    to affect the deduced mean <U+FB01>gure to a very sensible extent.

1863.]          Mr. Glaisher on the Storm    of October 30, 1863.            19
    He then institutes a comparison between the results afforded by those
three   of the eight arcs which are of considerable extent, namely, the Anglo
Gallic, Russian, and Indian Arcs. For each arc in particular he deduces
values of the principal semiaxes of the earth, involving an unknown con
stant ekpressing the effect of local attraction at the reference station of the
are.    In  order that the three pairs of semiaxes should agree, there are
four equations to be satis<U+FB01>ed by means of three disposable quantities
(namely, the three unknown attractions).        On combining these four equa
tions by the method of least squares, the unknown de<U+FB02>ections come out
extremely small, and the values of each semiaxis deduced for the three arcs
separately come out very nearly equal to one another, and therefore to their
mean.      These mean values the author ventures to assume are the mean
semiaxes of the earth.     They are  as follows :—
                a=20926l80, b=20855316 feet, giving @=,,‘<U+FB01>,
where a is the equatorial, and 6 the polar semiaxis, and e the ellipticity.
    The author concludes with certain speculations respecting the constitution
 of the earth’s crust. On adopting the mean <U+FB01>gure determined as above
 explained, the errors of latitude to be attributed to local attraction at each
 of the <U+FB01>fty-<U+FB01>ve stations of the eight arcs, which will be found at p. 766 of
 the Ordnance Survey volume, come out very small.          With respect to the
 Great Indian Arc, it is especially remarkable that the residual de<U+FB02>ections
 are insigni<U+FB01>cant, while those calculated from the action of the causes visibly
 at work are considerable.     It would seem as if some general cause were at
 work to increase the density under the ocean, and diminish the density under
 mountainous tracts of country.       The author conceives that, as the earth
 cooled down from a state of fusion su<U+FB01>iciently to allow a permanent crust
 to be formed, those regions where the crust contracted became basins into
 which the waters ran, while regions where expansion accompanied solidi<U+FB01>
 cation became elevated without any consequent increase in the total quantity
 of matter in a vertical column extending from the surface down to a given
  surface of equal pressure in the yet viscous mass below.          The author
  considers that the deviations of latitude at the other principal stations of
 the measured arcs, if not positively con<U+FB01>rmatory of, are at least not opposed
 to this view.
 IV. “On       the Meteorological Results shown by the Self-registering
        Instruments at Greenwich during the extraordinary Storm of
        October 30, 1863.”       By JAMES Gnarsnna, F.R.S., F.R.A.S., &c.
        Received November 23, 1863.
     In  the year 1841 Osler‘ s anemometer was erected at the Royal Obser
 vatory, Greenwich, and from that time, up to the year 1860, the greatest
 pressure on the square foot recorded was 25 lbs.       In February 1860 one
  of 28 lbs. was registered, which was the greatest up to October 30 of the
  present year; on that day a pressure of no less than 294,- lbs. took place

20           Mr. Glaisher  on the Storm    of October 30, 1863.     [Nov. 26,
 during a heavy squall of wind and rain, which passed over the observatory
 at 3h. 30m. P.M.       At this time, moreover, the readings of the several
 other self-registering meteorological instruments at the Royal Observatory,
 Greenwich, exhibited very large changes, and of so remarkable a character,
 that the Astronomer Royal expressed        a  wish that I should bring them
 under the notice of the Royal Society.        The following are extracts from
 the several registers of the day mentioned :—
     At 6h. A.M., on October 30, the barometer read 29'32 in., and it com
 menced falling slowly after this time, reaching 29'30 in. at 8h. A.M.     The
 decrease   then  became  more  decided,   and  a steady fall was experienced ;
 29'l0 in. was reached by Ogh. r=.u., and 2896 in. by 2b. v.m.; from
 2h. P.M. to 3§h. P.M. the decline was very rapid; and the minimum
 reading, 28'80 in., was reached at the latter time.
     After 3h. 30m. P.M. the barometer turned to increase rapidly; at
 3h. 39m. run. it read 28'85 in.; at 411. P.M., 28-92 in.; 4h. 20m. P.M.,
 2900 in.; at 5h. v.M., 2907 in. ; and afterwards a gradual increase took
 place to 29'30 in. by llh. P.M.
     At 8h. A.‘M., with the <U+FB01>rst indications of decided barometric fall, the
 wind commenced to blow strongly from S.\V. ; at 8h. 20m. mu. it had
 reached a force of llb. on the square foot; shortly after, 2 lbs., and at
 8h. 30m. A.M. 3 lbs. A force of 1% lb. to 3 lbs generally prevailed,
 till 9h. 25m. A.M.; at 9h. 30m. A.M. a gust of short duration was ex
 perienced of 15 lbs., which produced a decline of temperature of 2°. From
 9h. 35m. A.M. to 9h. 50m. A.M. the pressure of the wind varied between
 3 lbs. and 5lbs.; from 1% lb. to 3 lbs. from 9h. 59m. A.M. to 0h. 45m. P.M.;
there was no pressure for two or three minutes about Oh. 50m. P.M. ; the
wind then again commenced blowing strongly, reaching 4 lbs. at 0h. 55m.
 P.M., and from 3 lbs. to 5 lbs. from lh. ran. to 1h. 15m. P.M., the
pressure was generally 2 lbs. to 4 lbs. from 1h. 15m. P.M. to 2h. P.M.;
from 2h. 0m. P.M. to 2h. 45m. P.M. it varied between ,} lb. and 21bs. ; the
wind again commenced blowing strongly, reached 3% lbs. at 2h. 50m. P.M.,
4 lbs. at 3h. P.M., 5 lbs. at 3h. 10m. I’-M., 7 lbs. at 3h. 16m. P.M.,
 12 lbs. at 3h. 20m. P.M., 13 lbs. at 3h. 23m. P.M., 11 lbs. at 3h. 26m.
P.M., 17 lbs. at 3h. 29m. P.M., and 29% lbs. at 3h. 30m. P.M. ; then declined
suddenly, pressing with forces varying between 6 lbs. and 9 lbs. from
3h. 35m. P.M. to 3h. 45m. P.M., and 4lbs. to 6 lbs. from 3h. 45m.
1>.1vr. to 4h. P.M.;    another gust at 4h. 10m. 1=.1vr. reached 81bs.; again
declined to 4lbs. at 4h. 15m. P.M.; after this time, till 5b. 9.14., the
pressure varied between 2 lbs. and 4 lbs., between 2 lbs. and 3lbs. from
5h. P.M. to 6h. P.M., from glb. to 2 lbs. (with occasional lulls) from
 6h. P.M. to 7h. P.M., from 2lbs. to 4lbs. from 7h. P.M. to 9h. P.M. ;
scarcely any pressure was recorded between 9h. P.M. and 10h. P.M., and
from 10h. P.M. to 11h. P.M. the amount varied between 1% lb. to 3 lbs.
    At the time of the great gust, viz. 3h. 30m.-1>.M., the barometer
reached its minimum, 28'80 in. ; the temperature declined rapidly (from

  1863.]                       Anniversary Meeting.
  53%° at 3h. 15m. P.M. to 46° by 4b. P.m., and to 43° by 5h. P.M.); and
  the direction of the wind immediately changed to the amount of 90°, follow
  ing the direction'of the sun, or from S.S.W. to W.N.W.
      At  the Radcliffe Observatory, Oxford, the barometer-reading at 6h. A.M.
  was 29'l8 in., and de_creased to 2880 in. at 2h. 30m.; it then suddenly
'
  increased to  2885 in. at 2h. 35m., and to 29'25 in. byllh. P.M. At 2h.
  the direction of the wind was S. ; at 3h. 30m. it was W., and continued W.
  till 4h. 30m., and then returned to S.W. by 5b. The temperature at 2h.
  was 51°, declined to 43° at 2h. 30m., and to 41° by 5h.
      The general changes of temperature agree very closely with those at
   Greenwich ; but, as in the case of the barometer, those at Oxford pre
   ceded those at Greenwich by one hour nearly.
      The general fact frequently noticed of a change in the direction of the
   wind simultaneously with a sudden and great pressure, and for the most
  part in one direction (that is to say, in the direction of the sun’s motion,
  or   N. to E. to S.), is very remarkable, and not easily accounted for.

    The PRESIDENT then addressed the Society             as follows :—
        GENTLEMEN,
 WHEN      I   had  last the honour of addressing          you at the Anniversary
 Meeting in 1862,        I  acquainted you that a communication           had been
 received by your President and Council from the Duke of Newcastle,
 Her Majesty’s principal Secretary of State for the Colonies, requesting the
 opinion of the Royal Society on the scienti<U+FB01>c importance of the results to
 be expected from the establishment of a Telescope of great optical power
 at Melbourne, in the Colony of Victoria, for the observation of the nebulae
 and multiple stars of the Southern Hemisphere.             The communication was
 founded on a despatch from Sir Henry Barkly, K.C.B., Governor of Vic
tor ia, soliciting on his own part and on that of the Visitors of the Melbourne

1863.]                        Presz'dent’s Address.                         23
Observatory, the opinion of the Royal Society on this subject, and also on
the most suitable construction of the telescope, both as to the optical part
and the mounting, its probable cost, and the time required for its com
pletion.  It had happened that in 1853 the Royal Society and the British
Association had united in an earnest representation to Her Majesty’s
Government of the scienti<U+FB01>c importance of establishing in some convenient
locality in Her Majesty’s dominions, from whence the southern nebulae and
multiple stars could be observed,a telescope of the requisite optical power;
and in a preparatory correspondence, which was printed at the time, and
in which the principal persons interested in such researches had partici
pated, the best form of telescope, its probable cost, and all particulars
relating to    it,
                had been largely discussed.    The representation thus con
curred in by the two principal scienti<U+FB01>c bodies of the United Kingdom was
not successful in securing the desired object; but the correspondence then
printed was still <U+FB01>tted to supply in great measure in 1862 the information
 on which the President and Council could ground their reply.       The dis
 cussion in 1853 had terminated in the appointment of committee, con
                                                            a
sisting of the Earl of Rosse, Dr. Robinson, and Messrs. Lassell and Warren
 de la Rue, to superintend the construction of the telescope, in the event of
the recommendation       of the two Societies being favourably received.   But
asit  was possible that the opinions previously entertained might have been
in some degree modi<U+FB01>ed by subsequent consideration or by more recent
‘experience, the correspondence with those gentlemen was reopened, and
their replies have formed     a  second correspondence, which, like the <U+FB01>rst,
 has been printed for the informationof those Fellows of the Society who
 take  aspecial interest in the subject. Availing themselves of these valuable
 communications, the President and Council replied to the Colonial Ot<U+FB01>oe
by a report dated December 18, 1862.      They have been since informed
that copies of the  report and of  the correspondence have been sent to
Melbourne for the information of the gentlemen with whom the proposition
originated.
  It   is       possible that the thoughtful discussions embodied in the
            quite
correspondence referred to may be found to have       prospective value not
                                                       a
limited to the occasion which has given rise to them.   The considerations
which apply to telescope for the observation of the Southern Nebulae at
                     a
Melbourne are no less applicable to one which might be established on        a
site from whence     great part of the Southern Nebulae could also be ob
                     a
served (as well as those of our own hemisphere), but enjoying the immense
advantage conferred by elevation into the higher and less dense strata of
the atmosphere.     Such sites are to be found in the Nilgiris at elevations of
several thousand feet, combining also convenient accessibility and proximity
to the resources of civilized life.   It may be hoped that at some not
distant day the subject will receive the consideration which deserves from
                                                              it
those who are entrusted with the government of that now integral part of
the British empire.

24,                              Anniversary Meeting.                   [Nov. 80,
    Having learnt that       a series of pendulum experiments at the principal
stations of the Great Russian Arc were in contemplation, I availed myself
of an opportunity of informing M. Savitsch, by whom the operations were
to be conducted, that the Invariable Pendulums which had been employed
in the English experiments were now in the possession of the Royal Society,
and, being unemployed, would,          I  was persuaded, be most readily lent   by
the Society on an application to that effect being made.          The constants  of
these instruments,       including the coef<U+FB01>cient in the reduction to   a vacuum,
having been most carefully determined, they were ready, with the clocks
and stands belonging to them, for immediate use, and would have the
further advantage, that experiments made with them in Russia would be
at once brought into direct connexion with the British series extending
from 79° 50' N. to 62° 56' S. latitude.            The communication was most
courteously received and replied to.         It appeared, however, that a detached
invariable pendulum had been already ordered by the Russian Government
from    M. Repsold, of Hamburg, shorter than the English pendulums for
convenience in land transport, and with two knife-edges and two <U+FB01>xed
lenses, symmetrical in size and shape but one light and the other heavy,
 and so arranged that the times of vibration should be the same on either
knife-edge in air of the same temperature and density.             M. Savitsch ex
pressed his desire to bring this pendulum in the <U+FB01>rst instance to Kew,
and to secure thereby the connexion of his own with the English series,
where also he would have the opportunity of testing the exactness of the
correction for buoyancy by vibrating his pendulum on both its knife-edges
in the vacuum-apparatus which is now established at Kew.
    It  is much to be desired that a similar series of pendulum experiments
 to those about to be undertaken        in Russia should be made at the principal
 points of the Great Indian Arc; and the steps which are understood to
 be in progress in providimg new instruments for the veri<U+FB01>cation of the
 astronomical and geodesical operations of the Trigonometrical Survey of
 India, and to give them a still greater extension, would seem to present a
 most favourable opportunity for the combination of pendulum experiments.
 In such case the pendulums of the Royal Society might be made available
 with excellent effect.
     The large     size   of our printed volumes in the present year gives no
 unfavourable and, I think, no unfair idea of the present scienti<U+FB01>c activity
 of the Society; for I believe it may be safely said that our Council has not
 been less vigilant and cautious than heretofore in the selection of the papers
 to be printed.       Although much care has been given to keeping the ex
 penses    of illustration within reasonable bounds, the cost of the Society’s
 publications has been this year unusually high ; yet         I  am glad to be able
  to state that our whole expenditure within the year has fallen within our
  income.     With your permission,       I will brie<U+FB02>y advert to a few of the sub
 jects which     have   occupied the Society’s attention in the past year.

 1863.]                        President’s Address.                            25'
     The researches of Kirchhoff and Bunsen have rendered it in a high degree
 probable that we shall be able to obtain much insight into the chemical
nature of the atmospheres of the brighter <U+FB01>xed stars, by observing the dark
 lines in their spectra and comparing them with the bright lines in the
 spectra of elementary, and perhaps also of compound, bodies in the state
of incandescent gas or vapour.       The interest of such an inquiry is obvious;
but the di<U+FB01>iculties involved in it are very great. The quantity of light
coming from even such a star as Sirius is so small, that without the use of
a powerful telescope the spectrum obtained would be too faint to bear
su<U+FB02>icient enlargement to show properly the <U+FB01>xed lines.            The apparent
diurnal motion of the stars causes much embarrassment, unless the
instrument be mounted equatoreally, and furnished with a clock move
ment. The control of the experiments on incandescent bodies requires
a thorough knowledge of chemistry,           so as to avoid being misled by
impurities   in the substances  examined,   and to be prepared to interpret de
compositions or combinations which may take place under unusual circum
stances, and which may be manifested only by their effects.         Nor can the
astronomical and physical parts of the inquiry be well dissociated, so as to
be separately undertaken by different individuals; for the most elaborate
drawings can hardly convey a faithful idea of the various aspects of the
different dark and bright lines, which yet must be borne in mind in in
stituting  a comparison    in cases of apparent coincidence.     It is fortunate,
therefore,   that the inquiry has been taken up by two gentlemen working
in concert. In a short paper read to the Society on the 26th of last
February, and published in the Proceedings, Mr. Huggins and Dr. Miller
have described and <U+FB01>gured the spectra of three of the brighter stars; and
this part of the inquiry will doubtless be continued.          In a paper since
presented    to the Society,   Mr. Huggins describes the means employed for
practically determining with accuracy the positions of any stellar lines
which may be observed, with reference to known points of the spectrum,
and has given beautiful maps of the spectra of twenty-four of the ele
mentary bodies under the action          of the inductive discharge, reserving
others for a future communication.        When the inquiry is completed, it is
possible   that we may obtain an amount of knowledge, respecting the
constitution of those distant heavenly bodies, of which we have at present
little conception.
    Professor Tyndall has given us the fourth of a series of papers upon the
relation of Gases and Vapours to Radiant Heat. In the course of these
inquiries, he has shown that the different aériform bodies, even though
colourless, exert very different degrees of absorptive action on the rays of
heat,—-and that certain portions of these heat-rays are more powerfully
 absorbed than others—rays from objects at a low temperature being more
 easily absorbed than those from objects at an elevated temperature.          He
 has also proved    that  gases  radiate as well as absorb, and, in conformity

  with what is known in the case of solids, that in gaseous media also there
 is equality in the powers of radiation and absorption.        Bodies which exert
  an absorbent effect in the liquid form preserve it in the gaseous state.      If
 further experiments should con<U+FB01>rm Prof. Tyndall's views upon the absorp

 results must materially modify some of the views hitherto held upon the

     The Bakerian Lecture, by Mr. Sorby, is entitled by him “ On the Direct
 Correlation of Mechanical and Chemical Forces.” In this paper are em
 bodied a series of observations upon the in<U+FB02>uence of pressure upon the
 solubility of salts, in which he has obtained results analogous to the changes
 observed in the freezing-point of liquids under pressure.       He <U+FB01>nds, in cases
 where, as is usual, the volume of the water and the salt is less than the
 volume of the water and the salt separately, that the solubility is increased
 by pressure, but that, in cases where (as when sal-ammoniac is dissolved in
 water) the bulk of the solution is greater than that of the water and salt
 taken separately, the solubility is lessened by a small but measurable
 amount.     On the contrary, salts which expand in crystallizing from solu
 tion  must,  under pressure, overcome mechanical resistance in that change ;
 and as this resistance is opposed to the force of crystallization, the salt is
 rendered more soluble.         The extent of the in<U+FB02>uence of pressure, and the
 mechanical    value  of the force of crystalline polarity, were found to vary in
 different salts.    Mr. Sorby also indicates the results of the action of salts
 upon certain carbonates under pressure, and purposes            pursuing his re
_searches upon chemical action under pressure.        This paper may therefore
 be regarded as the <U+FB01>rst of a series upon a highly interesting and important
 branch of investigation, for which Mr. Sorby appears to be specially <U+FB01>tted,
 from his combining       the needful  geological  knowledge    with the skill in
 manipulation    required in the physical and chemical part of the inquiry.
    The examination of the bright lines in the spectra of electric discharges
 passing through various gases, and between electrodes of various metals,
 has of late years attracted very general attention.         Each elementary gas
 and each metal shows certain well-marked characteristic lines, from the
 presence or absence of which it is commonly assumed that the presence or
 absence of the element in question may be inferred.            But the question
 may fairly be asked, Has it been established that these lines depend so
 absolutely on chemical character that none of them can be common to two
 or more different bodies? Has it been ascertained that, while the chemical
 nature of the bodies remains unchanged, the lines never vary if the circum
 stances of mass, density, &c. are changed’!        What evidence have we that
 spectra  are   superposed,   so that we   observe the   full sum of the spectra
 which the electrodes and the medium would produce separately’!
    To examine these and similar questions in the only unimpeachable way

   (that of actual experiment) formed the object of a long and laborious re
  search by Dr. Robinson, the results of which are contained in a paper
  in our Transactions.         In the course of this research, Dr. Robinson had
~
  occasion to take careful ‘measures of the positions of all the bright lines
  visible (and not too weak to measure) in a great number of spectra --those,
  namely, of the induction discharge passing between electrodes of twenty
  different metals, as well as graphite, most of which were observed in each of
  <U+FB01>ve different gases (including air), and for each gas separately at the atmo
  spheric pressure and at the low pressure obtained by a good air-pump.
      On taking an impartial survey of this great assemblage of experimental
  facts, Dr. Robinson inclines to the opinion that the origin of the lines is
  to be referred to some_yet undiscovered relation between matter in general
  and the transfer of electric action; and that while the places of the lines
  are thus determined independently of particular circumstances, the bright
  ness   of the lines is modi<U+FB01>ed, according to the special properties of the
  molecules which are present, through a. range from great intensity down
   to a faintness which may elude our most powerful means of observation.
      By a discussion of the results of the magnetic observations maintained
  for several years past at the Kew Observatory with an accuracy previously
  unattained,    and by combining these with the earlier results of the observa
  tions at the British colonial observatories,I have been enabled to trace and,
  as   I  believe, satisfactorily to establish the existence of an annual variation
  in the three elements of the earth’s magnetism, which has every appear
  ance of being dependent upon the earth’s position in her orbit relatively
  to the sun. ' Substantiated by the concurrent testimony of observations in
  both hemispheres, and in parts of the globe most widely distant from each
  other, this conclusion furnishes an additional evidence of a cosmical mag
  netic relation subsisting between the earth and other bodies of the solar
  system, and thus extends the scope and widens the basis of sound induc
   tion upon which the permanent relations of magnetical science must rest.
      To Dr. Otto Torell, Professor of Zoology in the University of Lund, we
   are indebted for a communication of much interest, informing us of the
   progress made by an expedition appointed by the Swedish Government at
   the recommendation of the Royal Academy of Sciences at Stockholm, to
   execute a survey preliminary to the measurement of an arc of the meridian
   at Spitzbergen.      The objects of the preliminary survey were to ascertain
   whether suitable angular points for a triangulation could be found from
   Ross Island at the extreme north, to Hope Island at the extreme south of
   Spitzbergen, and to determine on a favourable locality for the measure
   ment   of  a base-line.    The result of the <U+FB01>rst year’s exploration has been
   the selection    of stations, on hills of moderate height and easy access
   from the coast, for nine triangles shown in the sketch accompanying Dr.

     Swedish naturalists are not likely to undervalue the interest attaching
to careful examinations of the constancy or variation of the elevation of
land above the sea-level; and         I may therefore venture to refer them to a
paper in the Phil. Trans. for 1824 (Art. xvi.), written from Spitzbergen
itself in July 1823, containing the particulars of a barometrical and trigo
nometrical determination of the height (approximately 1644 English feet)
of the well-de<U+FB01>ned summit of a conspicuous hill in the vicinity of Fair
haven.       The barometrical comparison was repeated on several days, the
barometer on the summit of the hill being stationary, and the observation
of the two barometers strictly simultaneous, the stations being visible from
 each other      by  a telescope.    The height as given by the two methods,       .
 baromctrical and trigonometrical, was in excellent accord.          The hill may
 be identi<U+FB01>ed with certainty by the plan which accompanies the paper
 referred to: it is of easy access, and may be rexneasured with little dii<U+FB01>
 culty.
     It will  be remembered     that a few years ago the attention  of the Royal
 Society was called by the Foreign O<U+FB02>ice to the circumstance of several
 glass bottles with closed necks having been found on the shores of the
 west coast of Nova Zembla, leading to a conjecture that they might a<U+FB01>'ord
 some clue to the discovery of the missing ships of Sir John Franklin's
 Expedition.       The inquiries instituted by the Royal Society traced the
 bottles in question to a recent manufacture in Norway, where they are
 used as <U+FB02>oats to the <U+FB01>shing-nets employed on that coast.             These <U+FB02>oats,
 accidentally separated from        the  nets, had been carried by the stream
 current which sets along the Norwegian coast round the North Cape, and
 thus afforded evidence of the prolongation of the current to Nova Zembla.
 The Swedish Expedition, in the course of its summer exploration, found
 on the northern shore of Spitzbergcn several more of these bottle-<U+FB02>oats,
 some of which even bore Norwegian marks and names, supplying evidence,
 of considerable geographical interest, of the extension of the Norwegian
  stream-current to Spitzbergen, either by a circuitous course past the shores
 of Nova Zembla, or by a more direct otfshoot of which no previous know
 ledge existed.       It is thus that step by step we improve our knowledge of
  the currents which convey the waters of the more temperate regions to the
  Polar seas and produce effects which are traceable in many departments of
  physical geography.
     The application       of gun-cotton to warlike purposes      and engineering
  operations, and the recent improvements       in its manufacture, have been the
  subject   of  a Report prepared by a joint Committee of the Chemical and
  Mechanical Sections of the British Association, consisting chie<U+FB02>y of Fellows
  of the Royal Society.       The Report was presented at the Meeting in New

castle in September last, and is now in the press.        The Committee had
the advantage of personal communication with General von Lenk, of the
Imperial Austrian Artillery, the inventor of the system of preparation and
adaptation by which gun-cotton has been made practically available for
warlike purposes in the Austrian service. On the invitation of the Com
mittee, and with the very liberal permission of the Emperor of Austria,
General von Lenk visited England for the purpose of thoroughly explaining
his system ; and we have in the Report of the Committee the information,
thus gained directly from the fountain-head, of the results of his experi
ence in the course of trials extending over many years, together with
additional investigations by individual members of the Committee.
   The advantages which are claimed for gun-cotton over gunpowder for
ordnance-purposes and mining-operations are so many and so important as
to call imperatively for the fullest investigation.    Such an inquiry, how
ever, in its complete sense, is both beyond and beside the scope and pur
poses of a purely scienti<U+FB01>c body; and the British Association have done
well (whilst reappointing the Committee to complete certain experiments
which they had devised with the view of clearing up some scienti<U+FB01>c points
which are still more or less obscure) in pressing on the attention of Her
Majesty’s Government the expediency of instituting under its own auspices
a full and searching inquiry into the possible applications of gun-cotton
in the public service.
   The absence of smoke, and the entire freedom from the fouling of the
gun, are points of great moment in promoting the rapidity of <U+FB01>re and
the accuracy of aim of guns employed in casemates or in the between decks
of ships of war; to these we must add the innocuous character of the pro
ducts of combustion in comparison with those of gunpowder, and the far
inferior heat imparted to the gun itself by repeated and rapid discharges.
With equal projectile effects, the weight of the charge of gun-cotton is but
one-third of that of gunpowder; the recoil is stated: to be reduced in the
proportion of 2 to 3, and the length of the gun itself to admit of a dimi
nution of nearly one-third. These conclusions are based on the evidence
of long and apparently very carefully conducted courses of experiment
in the Imperial Factory in the neighbourhood of Vienna. The results
appear to be especially deserving the attention of those who are engaged
in the important problems of facilitating the employment of guns of large
calibre and of great projectile force in the broadsides of our line-of-battle
ships, and in reducing, as far as may be possible, the dimensions of the
ports.
   In  the varied applications of explosive force in military or civil engineer
ing, the details of many experiments which bear on this branch of the
inquiry are stated in the Report of the Committee, and appear to be
highly worthy of consideration and of further experiment.
    It cannot be said that the advantages now claimed for gun-cotton are
altogether a novel subject of discussion in this country.           When the

material was <U+FB01>rst introduced by Schénbein in 1846, its distinctive qualities
in comparison with gunpowder were recognized, although at that period
they were far less well ascertained by experiment than they are at present.
To the employment of gun-cotton as then known there was, however, a
fatal drawback in its liability to spontaneous combustion.       The elaborate
experiments of General von Lenk have shown that this liability was due to
imperfection in its preparation, and ceases altogether when suitable pro
cesses are adopted in its manufacture.         Perfect gun-cotton is a de<U+FB01>nite
chemical compound; and certain processes for the removal of all extra
neous matter and      of every trace of free acid are absolutely indispensable.
But when thus prepared it appears to be no longer liable to spontaneous
combustion,     it can be transported from place to place with perfect secu
rity, or  be stored   for any length of time without danger of deterioration.
It is not impaired by damp—--and may be submerged without injury, its
original qualities returning unchanged on its being dried in the open air
and at ordinary temperatures.
    A scarcely less important point towards the utilization of gun-cotton
and the safety with which it may be employed in gunnery is the power of
modifying and regulating its explosive energy at pleasure, by means of
variations in the mechanical structure of the cartridge, and in the relative
size of the chamber in which it is <U+FB01>red.
    The experiments made by the Austrian Artillery Commission, as well as
 those for blasting and mining, were conducted on a very large scale ; with
 small arms the trials appear to have been comparatively few.
    There can be no hesitation in assenting to and accepting the concluding
 sentence   of the Committee’s report.     “The  subject has neither chemically
 nor mechanically received that thorough investigation that it deserves.
 There remain many exact measures still to be made, and many important
 data to be obtained.      The phenomena attending the explosion of both
 gun-cotton and gunpowder have to be investigated, both as to the tempe
 ratures   generated in the act of explosion and the nature of the com
 pounds which result from them, under circumstances strictly analogous to
 those which occur in artillery practice.”
     I proceed   to announce the awards which the Council has made        of the
 Medals in the preent year;         and to state the grounds    on which those
  awards have been made.
    The Copley Medal has been awarded to the Reverend Adam Sedgwick, for
 his observations and discoveries in the Geology of the Palaeozoic Series of
  Rocks, and more especially for his determination of the characters of the
  Devonian System, by observations of the order and superposition of the
  Killas Rocks and their Fossils, in Devonshire.
     Mr. Sedgwick was appointed Woodwardian Professor of Geology in the
  University of Cambridge in the year 1818, since which time, up to _a
  recent period, comprising an interval of upwards of forty years, he has

devoted himself to geological researches with an ability, a persistent zeal,
and untiring perseverance which place him amongst the foremost of those
eminent men by whose genius, sagacity, and labours the science of Geology
has attained   its present high position.         To duly appreciate his earlier
work as a geological observer and reasoner, we must recall to recollection
the comparative      ignorance which prevailed forty or <U+FB01>fty years ago, to the
dispersion of which his labours have so largely contributed.          Geology was
then beset by wild and untenable speculations on the one hand, whilst on
the other even its most calm and rational         theories were received by many
with distrust or with ridicule—and by others with aversion, as likely to
interfere with those convictions on which the best hopes of man repose.
    Under such circumstances Geology needed the support and open advo
cacy of men who, by their intellect and acquirements, and by the respect
attached to their individual characters, their profession, or social position,
might be able on the one hand to repress wild fancies, and on the
other to rebut the unfounded assertions of those who opposed the dis
cussion of scienti<U+FB01>c truth.       Such a man was Professor Sedgwick, and
 such was the influence he exerted.        It may be well to make this allusion
 on an occasion   like  the present,  because  it often happens, not unnaturally,
 that those who are most occupied with the questions of the day, in an ad
 vancing science, retain but an imperfect recollection of the obligations due
 to those who laid the <U+FB01>rst foundation of our subsequent knowledge.
    More than forty years have passed since Professor Sedgwick began
 those researches among the older rocks of England which it became the
 main purpose of his life to complete.          In 1822 was begun that full and
 accurate survey of the Magnesian Limestone of the North of England
 which to this day holds its high place in the estimation of geologists as the
 foundation of our knowledge of this important class of deposits, whether
 we regard their origin, form of deposition, peculiarities of structure, or
 organic contents.
    Contemporaneously with this excellent work, he examined the Whin
 Sill of Upper Teesdale, showed its claims to be treated as a rock of fusion,
 and discussed the perplexed question of its origin.
    Advancing to one of the great problems which occupied his thoughts
 for many years, he combined in 1831 the observations of the older rocks
 of the Lake Mountains which he had commenced in 1822, and added a
 special memoir on the great dislocations by which they are sharply de<U+FB01>ned
 and separated from the Pennine chain of Yorkshire.             Memoirs followed
 in quick succession on the New Red Sandstone of the Vale of Eden; on
 the strati<U+FB01>ed   and unstrati<U+FB01>ed     rocks of the Cumbrian Mountains, and on
 the Limestone    and Granite Veins near Shap.           Thus, thirty years since,
 before the names of Cambrian and Silurian were ever heard, under which
 we now thankfully class the strata of the English lakes, those rocks had
 been vigorously assailed and brought into a lucid order and system which
 is to this day unchanged, though by the same bands which laid the

   foundations many important additions have been made, one of signal value
   in 185l—the lower palaeozoic rocks at the base of the carboniferous chain
   between     Ravenstonedale  and Ribblesdale.    Perhaps no district in the
  world affords an example of one man’s researches begun so early, con
  tinued so long, and ending so successfully.      By these persevering efforts,
   the Geology of the Lake district came out into the light; and there is no
   doubt, and can be no hesitation in ascribing to them the undivided honour
  of the <U+FB01>rst unrolling of the long series of deposits which constitute the
  oldest groups of British Fossiliferous Rocks.
       Still more complete, however, was the success of that work which was
  undertaken immediately afterwards on the coeval rocks of Wales; by
  which Professor Sedgwick and Sir Roderick Murchison, toiling in separate
  districts, unravelled the intricate relations of those ancient rocks, and de
  termined     the main features of the successive groups of ancient life which
  they enclose.    These labours began in 1831-32, and in 1835 the two great
  explorers    had advanced so far in their research as to present a united
 memoir to the British Association in Dublin, showing the progress each
 had made in the establishment of the Cambrian and Silurian systems, as
 they were then called; Professor Sedgwick taking the former, and Sir
  Roderick Murchison the latter for his special <U+FB01>eld of study.
      In 1843 Professor Sedgwick produced two memoirs on the structure of
 what he then termed the Protozoic rocks of North Wales. Many excel
 lent sections were given in detail in these memoirs; those exhibiting the
 structure of the western part of the district about Carnarvonshire being
principally taken from his observations in 1831-32, while the more
 detailed sections of the eastern part were from those of 1842-43.        These
 two papers gave the complete outline or framework, as it were, of the
geological structure of this intricate region.      In several subsequent years
he continued to <U+FB01>ll up this outline with further details, observed almost
entirely by himself, giving numerous general and local sections, by which
be determined the dip and strike of the beds, normal and abnormal, and
all the great anticlinal and synclinal lines on which the fundamental
framework depends.
     Further and still minuter details were subsequently given, as was to be
expected, by the Government Surveyors; but the general arrangement,
<U+FB01>nally recognized on the map of the Survey, is essentially the same as
that previously worked out by his unaided labours.
     It was a principle always advocated by Professor Sedgwick, that the
geological structure of a complicated district could never be accurately
determined by fossils alone without a detailed examination of its strati<U+FB01>ca
tion. He always proceeded on this principle; nor (from the paucity of
organic remains) would it have been possible on any other principle to
have determined the real geological character of those older districts which
be investigated so successfully.     His arrangement and nomenclature of the

Palaeozoic Rocks,” 1855.       It possesses the weight which must always be
recognized as appertaining to the authority of the geologist who, by his
own labours, <U+FB01>rst solved the great problem of the physical structure of the
district.
    There are other important memoirs of Professor Sedgwick’s of which
time forbids more than a very passing notice.           The memoir “On the
Structure of large Mineral Masses,” published in l83l, was the <U+FB01>rst, and
remains to this day the best descriptive paper which has yet appeared on
joints, planes of cleavage, nodular concretions, &c.
    Always attentive to the purpose of preparing a complete and general
 classi<U+FB01>cation of the Palazozoic Strata, Professor Sedgwick at an early
period in his career printed a memoir
                                             “ On the Physical Structure of the
Older Strata of Devon and Cornwa ;” and another “On the Physical
 Structure of the Serpentine District of the Lizard.” Of later date are
several papers written by him, conjointly with Sir Roderick Murchison,
respecting the Devonian System.          The principal of these, published in
  1840, comprised the work of several previous years, and made known the
 true nature of the Calm Beds of North Devon, as belonging to the Car
 boniferous series, and their position in a trough of the subjacent rocks,
 which rocks, on account of their position and their organic contents, were
 concluded to belong to the Devonian, or Old Red Sandstone period, a con
 clusion which was at <U+FB01>rst controverted, but was ultimately admitted.         In
 another    memoir   by  the same  authors    in 1828, they conclude   that  the
 coarse old red conglomerate along the north-western coast of Scotland and
 in Caithness is of about the same age as the Old Red Sandstone of South
 Wales and Herefordshire, and therefore of the Devonian period. They also
 published in 1840 an account of their general observations on the Palaeo
 zoic Formations of Belgium and the Banks of the Rhine, the results of
 which were considered to harmonize with those derived from other localities.
 Finally, we may notice another joint memoir by these authors in 1830,
 “On the Structure of the Eastern Alps,” which, however, had no imme
 diate relation to the researches on the Palseozoic formations.
    It will be observed that the memoirs which have been noticed are for
the most part pervaded by a certain unity of purpose.        The investigations
 were not on points of merely local interest, but were essential for the
 elucidation of the geological history of our planet during those early
 periods of which the records are most di<U+FB01>icult to unfold.        Few persons
 perhaps can have an adequate idea of the dit<U+FB01>culties he had to contend
 with when he <U+FB01>rst entered North Wales as a geologist.             Geologically
 speaking,   it was  a  term  incognita   of  which he  undertook to read the
 geological   history before any one had deciphered the characters in which
 it is written.    Moreover, besides the indistinctness and complexity of the
 strati<U+FB01>cation, and the obscurity which then prevailed as to the distinction
between planes of stratification and planes of cleavage, there was also the

   di<U+FB01>iculty of what may be called “ mountain geometry”—that geometry by
   which we unite in imagination lines and surfaces observed in one part of
   a complicated mountain or district with those in another, so as to form a
   distinct geometrical conception of the arrangement of the intervening
   masses.    This is not an ordinary power; but Mr. Sedgwick’s early mathe
   matical education was favourable to the cultivation of it.    We think it ex
   tremely doubtful whether any other British geologist forty years ago could
   have undertaken, with a fair chance of success, the great and difficult work
   which he accomplished.
      Such are the direct and legitimate claims of Professor Sedgwick to the
   honour conferred upon him by the award of the Copley Medal.          But there
  are also other claims, less direct, but which it would be wrong to pass
  altogether unnoticed.       It is not only by written documents that know
  ledge   and  a  taste for its  acquirement are disseminated; and those who
  have had the good fortune to attend Professor Sedgwick’s lectures, or may
  have enjoyed social intercourse with him, will testify to the charm and
  interest be frequently gives to geology by the happy mixture of playful
  elucidation of the subject with the graver and eloquent exposition of its
  higher principles and objects.
        PROFESSOR Snnowrcx,
     Accept this Medal, the highest honour which it is in the power of the
  Royal Society to confer, in testimony of our appreciation of the importance
 of the researches which have occupied so large a portion of your life, and
 which have placed you in the foremost rank of those eminent men by
 whose genius and labours Geology has attained its present high position in
 our country.
     The Council has awarded       a Royal Medal to the Reverend Miles Joseph
 Berkeley for his researches in Cryptogamic Botany, especially in Mycology.
     Mr. Berkeley's labours as a cryptogamic botanist for upwards of thirty
 <U+FB01>ve years, during which they have been more especially devoted to that
 extensive and most di<U+FB02>icult order of plants the Fungi, have rendered him,
 in the opinion of the botanical members of the Council, by far the most
 eminent living author in that department.        These labours have consisted
 in Large measure of the most arduous and delicate microscopic investiga
 tion. Besides papers in various journals on Fungi from all parts of the
 globe, and in particular an early and admirable memoir on British Fungi,
 the volume entitled ‘ Introduction to Cryptogamic Botany,’ published in
‘I857, is one which especially deserves to be noticed here. It is a
 work which he alone was quali<U+FB01>ed to write.             It is full of sagacious
 remarks and reasoning; and particular praise is due to the special and con
 scientious care bestowed on the veri<U+FB01>cation of every part, however minute
 and    di<U+FB02>icult, upon which its broad generalizations are founded.         Mr.
 Berkeley’s merits are not con<U+FB01>ned to description or        classi<U+FB01>cation; there
                                                                   n 2

  are facts of the highest signi<U+FB01>cance, which he has been the <U+FB01>rst to indicate,
  and which in many cases he has also proved by observation and by experi
  ments.    We refer to his observations on the development of the reproduc
 tive bodies of the three orders of Thallogens (Algae, Lichens, and Fungi),
 and on the conversion     under peculiar conditions  of certain forms of their
 fruit into others ;—to the exact determination of the relations, and some
 times of the absolute speci<U+FB01>c identity of various forms of Fungi previously
 referred to different tribes; and to the recognition, in many species and
 genera, of a diversity of methods of reproduction in giving origin to parallel
 series of forms. As intimately connected with the life-history of Fungi, the
 intricate subject of vegetable pathology has been greatly elucidated by him ;
 and he is indeed the one British authority in this department.        His inti
 mate acquaintance with vegetable tissues, and with the effects of external
 agents, such as climate, soil, exposure, &c., has enabled him to refer many
 maladies to their source; and to propose methods, which in some cases
 have proved successful, of averting, checking, and even curing diseases in
 some of our most valuable crops.         In this line of research he has also
 demonstrated, on the one hand, that many so-called epiphytal and parasitic
 Fungi are nothing but morbid conditions of the tissues of the plant; on the
 other hand, that microscopic Fungi lurk and produce the most disastrous
 results where their presence had been least suspected.
        Ma. BERKELEY,
     I present you with this Medal, in testimony of the high opinion which
 the Botanical Members of the Council of the Royal Society entertain of
your researches in Cryptogamic Botany, especially Mycology; in which
latter department     your writings entitle you, in their judgment, to   be con
 sidered as the most eminent living author.
    The Council has awarded a Royal Medal to John Peter Gassiot, Esq.,
for his researches on the Voltaic Battery and Current, and on the Discharge
of’ Electricity through Attenuated Media.
    These contributions, most of which are recorded in our Transactions, are
of high value, and in some respects peculiar.      Their experimental part has
been conducted on a scale      of magnitude and power unmatched since the
days    of Davy  and of Children, with apparatus of the highest perfection, and
with consummate dexterity and skill; and the discussion and interpretation
of the facts observed are characterized by sound theory and sober judgment.
    It would trespass too much on your time were       I to give a detailed ac
count of them, and      I shall only select a few which are examples of what
                                                                                '
Bacon has called “ Instantise Crucis,” such as, when the mind is undecided
between several paths, point out the true one.
    1. The <U+FB01>rst decides a question which was long debated with great ve
hemence, whether the energy of the Voltaic Battery arises from the contact
of its metals, or from chemical action. The <U+FB01>rst of these opinions was
mainly supported by the fact that, when two dissimilar metals are made to

 ‘1863.]                     President’s Address.                                 37
 touch, they show signs of opposite electricities when separated.         Mr. Gas
 siot showed, in 1844, that the same occurs when the metals are separated
 by a thin stratum of air without having been in previous contact.
    2. The identity of voltaic with frictional electricity was denied by many,
 because it gave no spark through an interval of air.            Davy had indeed
 asserted the contrary in his ‘Elements of Chemical Philosophy,’ but his
 statement seems to have been doubted or unheeded.             Mr. Gassiot, in the
 Transactions for 1844, has put the fact beyond dispute; he showed that
 by increasing the number of cells and carefully insulating them, sparks can
 be obtained even with the feeblest elements.           With 3520 cells, zinc and
 copper excited with rain-water, he obtained sparks in rapid succession
 through -515th of an inch of air; and a little later added to this a fact of still
 higher signi<U+FB01>cance, that by exalting the chemical action in the cells, the
 same or even greater effect could be produced by a much smaller series.
 The battery of 500 Grove’s cells which was constructed for these experi
 ments is probably in some respects the most powerful that was ever made.
    3. The currents produced by electric or magnetic induction are of the
highest interest, and the employment of them as a source of electric power
is almost daily enriching physical science with precious results.            In this
new <U+FB01>eld Mr. Gassiot has been one of the most successful explorers.               So
early as 1839 he showed that the induction current gives a real spark, and
he found that in the <U+FB02>ame of a spirit-lamp it could strike at a distance of
=}ths of an inch.
    4. The splendid phenomena produced by the discharge of the induction
current through rare<U+FB01>ed gases or vapours are well known; in particular
the strati<U+FB01>cation of the light. The cause of this is not yet fully understood,
but Mr. Gassiot has made some very important additions to our knowledge
of it in the Bakerian Lecture for 1858 and his subsequent communications
to the Society.     Among these may be named his explanation of the occa
sionally reversed curvature of the strata, and his discovery of the Recipro
cating discharge, which, seeming single, is composed of two, opposite in
direction, but detected by the different action of a magnet on each of them
a beautiful test, which is of wide application in such researches.           Again,
the Torricellian vacuum which he used at <U+FB01>rst, even when absolutely free
from air, contains mercurial    vapour: by applying to his tubes a potent
freezing   mixture,  he  found   that as this vapour condensed, the strata
vanished,   the light and transmission     of electricity decreased, till at  a very
low temperature both    ceased   entirely.    It follows from this that a perfect
vacuum does not conduct—-a fact       of cosmical importance, which had been
surmised before, but not proved; and the desire of verifying this discovery
led him to a means of far higher rarefaction.         Atube containing a piece of
fused hydrate of potassa is <U+FB01>lled with dry carbonic acid, exhausted to the
limit of the air-pump’s power, and sealed; then by heating the potassa,
the residual carbonic acid is mostly, or even totally absorbed.          Vessels so
exhausted, though still containing vapour of potassa, and perhaps of water,
have a better vacuum than had been previously obtained, and often cease

  to conduct    till a little of the alkali is vaporized by heating them, and the
  gradual progress of the exhaustion gives a wide range of observation.
     5. The current of an induction machine is necessarily intermittent, and
  it has been    supposed that the strata are in some way caused by the inter
  mittence, and are possibly connected with the mode of action of the contact
  breaker.    Mr. Gassiot has, however, shown that they are perfectly developed
  in the discharge of an extended voltaic battery through exhausted tubes.
  The large water-battery        already mentioned shows them in great beauty;
  the discharge, however, is still intermittent.
     6. The same appearance is exhibited         by a Grove’s battery of 400 well
  insulated cells;     but in this case a new and remarkable phenomenon pre
  sents itself.   At <U+FB01>rst the discharge resembles that obtained from the water
  battery, and is like it intermittent; but suddenly it changes its character
  from intermittent to continuous (so far at least as can be decided by a revolv
  ing mirror), and everything indicates that we have now the true voltaic arc.
 The discharge is now of dazzling brilliancy, and is strata:/Fed as before, whence
 it appears that strata are capable of being produced by the true are discharge.
     7. This change is accompanied by a remarkable alteration in the heating
 of the two electrodes. Mr. Gassiot had previously shown that, in the ordi
 nary voltaic arc, formed in air of the usual pressure, the positive electrode
 is that which is the more heated, whilst in the discharge of an induction
 machine, whether sent through air at the ordinary pressure between elec
 trodes of thin wire, or through an exhausted tube, it is the negative.        The
 discharge through the large Grove's battery, so long as it was intermittent,
 agreed with the induction discharge in this character as in others, that the
 negative electrode was that which became heated ; but when the discharge
 suddenly and spontaneously passed from the intermittent to continuous,
 the previously heated negative electrode became cool, and the positive was
 intensely heated.
     These brief references will su<U+FB01>ice to show what a high place Mr.
 Gassiot holds amongst those who are investigating this new track, which
 promises such great advance in our knowledge of those molecular forces
in the study of which all physical science must ultimately centre.           I may
 be permitted to add, that in his whole career he has sought not his own
 fame, but the advancement of science ; he has rejoiced as much in the dis
coveries of others as in his own, and aided them by every appliance in his
power.      I   mnnot refrain from mentioning a recent instance in which this
liberal and unsel<U+FB01>sh spirit has been strikingly exhibited.         He has had exe
cuted a grand spectroscope, furnished with no less than nine faultless prisms,
a design in which he has been ably seconded by the skill of the optician
Mr. Browning, to whom the construction was entrusted. This magni<U+FB01>cent
instrument he has placed at the disposal of any Fellow of the Society who
may happen to be engaged in researches requiring the use of such powerful
apparatus.       The instrument is at present at the Kew Observatory, where
it is in contemplation to undertake the construction of a highly elaborate
map    of the spectrum.

        WILLIAM HUGGINS, Esq., F.R.A.S.                 Communicated by Dr.
        W. A. MILLER, V.P. and Treas. R.S. Received November 5,
         1863.
                                   (Abstract.)
     The author has been engaged for some time in association with Prof.
 W. A. Miller in observing the spectra of the <U+FB01>xed stars. For the purpose
 of comparing the spectra of these with the spectra of the terrestrial
 elements, no maps of the latter were found that were conveniently available.
 Kirchhoff’ s maps and tables, besides their partial incompleteness, were not
 suited for night work when the sun could not be simultaneously observed.
     The author adopts the lines of the spectrum of common air as the <U+FB01>ducial
 points of a standard scale to which the spectra of the elements are referred.
 The air-spectrum has the advantage of being always visible with the
 spectra of the metals without increased complication of apparatus.
     The observations were made with a spectroscope of six prisms of heavy
 glass of large size.   The total deviation of the light with this train of
prisms is for the D my about 198°. The telescope and the collimator
have both an aperture of 1'7 inch.       The focal length of the telescope is
 l6'5 inches. The measures were partly taken from the readings of a
<U+FB01>nely divided arc of brass, which the arm carrying the telescope traverses,
and partly from the readings of a wire micrometer attached to the eye-end
of the telescope. The scale of measurement adopted gives <U+FB01>ve divisions
for the interval between the components of the double line D. The
excellent performance of this instrument is shown by the great distinctness
of the <U+FB01>ner lines of the solar spectrum.     All    those mapped by Kirchhoff

  44               Mr. Simpson—Acids from           the Cyanides       [Dec. 10,
 of which   a battery  of nine Leyden jars was introduced.       The Leyden jars
 are arranged in three batteries of three jars each, and the batteries connected
 in series.
     The relative   intensities  and   distinctive  characters  of the lines are
 represented    by <U+FB01>gures     and letters,  placed against the numbers in the
 Tables.
     The spectrum, which extends from a to H, is divided, and forms two
 maps.     The air-spectrum and the principal solar lines are placed at the
 top of each map, and below these the spectra of the following metals :—
 Sodium, potassium, calcium, barium, strontium, manganese, thallium,
 silver, tellurium, tin, iron, cadmium, antimony, gold, bismuth, mercury,
 cobalt, arsenic, lead, zinc, chromium,     osmium, palladium, and platinum.
     The lines of the air-spectrum are referred to the components of air to
 which they severally belong.        An unexpected result was observed: two
 strong lines of the air-spectrum, one of them a double line, were seen to be
 common to the spectra of oxygen and nitrogen. These gases were obtained
from different sources wlth identical results.         The strong red line of the
air-spectrum is shown to be clue to the presence of aqueous vapour, and to
 coincide with the line     of hydrogen.      The carbonic acid in the air is not
revealed by spectrum analysis.
     Three pairs of lines and one band of haze are given in the sodium spec
 trum in addition to the double D line.          As these might be due to impu
rities of the commercial sodium employed, the observation was con<U+FB01>rmed
by an amalgam of sodium prepared by the voltaic method from pure
 chloride of sodium.     Two of these pairs of lines have been recognized in
 the spectrum of a saturated solution of pure nitrate of soda.
    The two, stronger pairs appear to agree-in position with solar lines having
the following numbers in Kirchho<U+FB02>”        s scale :—864'4 and 86 7'1, and ll50'2
and ll54'2.
    The spectrum from electrodes of potassium contains many new lines.
 For the spectra of calcium, lithium, and strontium, metallic calcium,
lithium, and strontium were employed.
    Barium was mapped from an amalgam of barium prepared by electricity
from chloride of barium.
     The following metals were employed in the form of electro-deposits upQIl
platinum :—manganese, silver, tin, iron, cadmium, antimony, bismuth,
cobalt, lead, zinc, and chromium.          Care was taken that the other metals
should be reliable for purity.

        of the Di- and Tri-atomic Alcohols.” By MAXWELL S1M1>soN,
        A.B., M.B., F.R.S.       Received November 7, 1863.
    From every glycol it is possible to obtain two radicals—one monatomic,
the other diatomic.       From every glycerine it is possible to obtain three

 1863,]        of 0.z'y-radicals of Di- and Tri-atomic Alcohols.                           4:5
radicals, which are respectively mono-, di- and tri-atomic.                 The compounds
which these radicals form with the metalloids have been long since
prepared and thoroughly studied.                 Our knowledge of the compounds
which they form with cyanogen, whose behaviour so much resembles the
metalloids, is not in so forward a state.           At present we are only acquainted
with a few of the cyanides of those of them which are destitute of oxygen,
and the acids they form when submitted to the action of potash.                           The
object   of the present investigation is to extend our knowledge in this
                                    I
direction. With this view propose to myself the following questions :—
Is it possible to prepare also the cyanides of the oxy-radicals of glycol or
glycerine’! And if it be possible, is the action of potash on these cyanides
analogous to its action on the ordinary cyanides? If the foregoing questions
be answered in the a<U+FB01>irmative, we shall then be able to obtain in this way,
from every glycol, two, and from every glycerine three acids.                     A glance at

 Clo HB 01,, in the glycerine        series, which   I  succeeded in preparing in the
following manner z--
    A  mixture of ohe equivalent of dichlorhydrine and two equivalents of
 pure cyanide of potassium, together with a quantity of alcohol, was
 maintained at the temperature of 100° Cent. for twenty-four hours in well
 closed soda-water bottles.          At the expiration of this time it was found that
 all the cyanide of potassium had been converted into chloride.                           The
 contents of the bottles were then <U+FB01>ltered, and to the <U+FB01>ltered liquor, which
 no doubt     contained       the body C,,H,,O2 Cy2 in solution, solid potash was
 added.     To this, heat was applied in such a manner as to prevent the
 escape of the alcohol by evaporation; and its application continued till
 ammonia ceased to be evolved.              As soon as this was observed, the alcohol
 was   distilled   oil",   and   the   residue  treated    with nitric       acid, which was
 afterwards removed by evaporation at a low temperature.                      The nitric acid
 accomplishes two objects : it destroys in a great measure the tarry matter
 which is present in large quantity, and at the same time sets free the

 46               Mr. Simpson--Acids from               the C3/anides        of      [Dec. 10,
 organic acid combined with the potash.              The free acid was then separated
 from the nitrate of potash by means            of alcohol.
 ~' On evaporating the alcohol a dark-coloured residue was obtained, which
 was dissolved in hot water and treated with chlorine.                    Finally a silver-salt
 of the acid was prepared by        the  following  kind    of fractional      precipitation :—
 About one-third of the neutralized acid was <U+FB01>rst precipitated by the
 cautious addition of a solution of nitrate of silver.                  The liquor was then
 <U+FB01>ltered, and the remainder          of  the  acid was   converted       into the silver-salt
                    I
 By these means obtained, instead of a brown, a perfectly white precipitate,
 which yielded an acid in colourless crystals when decomposed by sulphu
 retted hydrogen. Dried at 100° Cent. these crystals gave on analysis
 numbers which agree tolerably well with the formula C“, HB 0,0, as will be
 seen from the following Table :—

    These analyses were performed on specimens prepared at different times.
This acid is soluble in water, alcohol, and ether.                It  has a pure acid taste.
It  melts at about 135° Cent., and at a higher temperature suffers decompo
sition. The free acid gives an abundant white precipitate with acetate of
lead, soluble in strong acetic acid.            It is not precipitated by lime-water.
The neutralized acid yields a bulky white precipitate with corrosive subli
mate, and a pale brown with perchloride of iron.                        Copper salts give a
bluish-white precipitate.          Chloride of barium is not affected.             The forma
tion of this acid may be explained by the following equation :
            0, H,o,cy,+2                                              O,°+2NH,.

    I  have also analyzed the silver-salt of this acid.             As it suffers decompo
sition at the temperature of boiling water,                  I was obliged to effect its
desiccation by placing it in vacuo over sulphuriciacid.              It is slightly soluble in

an oily residue was obtained, which was washed with a solution of car

     This ether suffers partial decomposition during distillation; hence the
discrepancy between the theoretical                  and experimental numbers in the <U+FB01>rst
analysis.    The specimen which served for the second was not distilled at
all, but simply puri<U+FB01>ed by solution in ether.      It is a colourless neutral oil
with a very acrid taste. It is somewhat soluble in water.            Heated with
solid potash it yields alcohol, and the acid is regenerated.        regret to say          I
I  have not succeeded in obtaining the cyanide (C6 HB 02 Cyz), which gene
rates this acid, in a state of purity.
    The compositions of the ether and silver-salt of this acid prove it to be
bibasic.    It is highly probable that the basicity of an acid produced in
this way depends on the atomicity of the radical in the cyanide which
generates it.      If
                    this be so, the cyanides of the mono-, di- and tri-atomic
radicals of the glycols and glycerines should then yield by decomposition
with potash respectively mono-, bi- and tri-basic acids. If it would be pos
sible to prepare the acid C8 H8 08 from the cyanide C6 H7 04 Cy, it would
be interesting to examine its bearing on this point.      Would it prove mono
basic or bibasic?

type it is thus written :—

   WVe may now,     think, safely answer in the af<U+FB01>rmative the questions put
                    I
at the commencement of this Paper.       The cyanides of the oxy-radicals of
the di- and tri-atomic alcohols can be formed, and the action of the potash
on these cyanides         is   analogous to its action on the ordinary cyanides.

    The foregoing research was <U+FB01>nished many months ago, but I delayed
publishing it in the hope of being able to announce at the same time the
formation of lactic acid by a similar process.      I <U+FB01>nd, however, from the
‘Annalen der Chemie und Pharmacie' of last month that I have been
anticipated by Wislicenus, who has succeeded in forming lactic acid in the
manner     I have just described.
                              December 17, 1863.
              Major-General SABINE, President, in the Chair.
    The following communications     were read :—
 I. “First Analysis        of 177   Magnetic Storms, registered by the
        Magnetic Instruments in the Royal Observatory, Greenwich,
        from 1841 to 1857.” By Gaonor. BIDDELL Amy, Astronomer
        Royal.     Received November 28, 1863.
                                   (Abstract.)
     The author <U+FB01>rst refers to his paper in the Philosophical Transactions,
 1863,
          “ On the Diurnal Inequalities of Terrestrial Magnetism as deduced
 from Observations made at the Royal Observatory, Greenwich, from 1841
 to 1857.”      These results were obtained by excluding the observations of
 certain days of great magnetic disturbance; it is the object of the present
 paper to investigate the results which can be deduced from these omitted
 days.
     The author states his reasons for departing from methods of reduction
 which have been extensively used, insisting particularly on the necessity of
 treating every magnetic storm as a coherent whole.       And he thinks that
 our attention ought to be given, in the <U+FB01>rst instance, to the devising of
_methods by which the complicated registers of each storm, separately con
 sidered, can be rendered manageable; and in the next place, to the discus
  sion of the laws of disturbance which they may aid to reveal to us, and to
 the ascertaining of their effects on the general means in which they ought
 to be included.
     The author then describes the numerical process_(of very simple cha
  racter) by which, when the photographic ordinates have been converted
  into numbers, any storm can be separated into two parts, one consisting of
  waves of long period, and the other consisting of irregularities of much
  more rapid recurrence.      He uses the term “ Fluctuation” in a technical
  sense, to denote the area of a wave-curve between the limits at which the
  wave-ordinate vanishes.      The Waves, Fluctuations, and Irregularities, as
  inferred from separate treatment of each storm, constitute the materials
  from which the further results of the paper are derived.
      Table I. exhibits the Algebraic Sum of Fluctuations for each storm, with
  the Algebraic Mean of Disturbances, and Tables II. and III. exhibit the

Aggregate or Mean for each year, and the Aggregate for the seventeen years.
The Aggregate for the Northerly Force is negative in every year. That for
the Westerly Force is on the whole negative ; the combination of the two
indicates that the mean force is directed about 10° to the east of south.
That for the Nadir Force appears negative, but its existence is not certain.
     Some peculiarities of the numbers of waves with different signs are then
pointed out.       For Westerly Force and also for Nadir Force, the numbers
 of +waves and —waves are not very unequal; but for Northerly Force
there are 177+waves and 277-—waves.                 In Nadir Force it is almost an
even chance whether a storm begins with a. +wave or with a —wave ; and
the same with regard to its ending; in Westerly Force the chances at
beginning and ending are somewhat in favour of a +wavc ; but in Northerly
 Force two storms out of three begin with a ——wave, and ten storms out of
 eleven end with a —wave.
     The beginnings and ends of the storms          are also arranged  by numeration
 of the combination of waves of di<U+FB02>erent character in the diiferent elements
 (as, for instance, Westerly Force + with Northerly Force —, Northerly
 force + with Nadir Force +, &c.) ; but no certain result appears to
 follow, except what might          be expected    from the special preponderances
 mentioned      above, leaving   the     relative  numbers of the combinations        a
 matter of chance in other respects.
     Tables IV., V., VI. exhibit the Absolute Aggregates of Fluctuations and
 Absolute Means of Disturbances without regard to sign.               In interpreting
 these   it is remarked  that  the   large  —   mean  force in the northerly direction
 necessarily increases the Aggregate and diminishes the Number of Waves.
 With probable fair allowance for this, it appears that the Numbers of Waves
 are sensibly equal, that the Sums of Fluctuations are sensibly equal, and
 that the Means of Disturbances are sensibly equal for Westerly Force and for
 Northerly Force. But the Number of Waves for Nadir Force is less than
 half that for the other forces    ;   while the Sum of Fluctuations is almost three
 times as great as    that for the others, and the Mean of Disturbances almost
 three times as great.
     Attempts are made to compare the epochs of the waves in the diiferent
  directions, but no certain result is obtained.
     Tables VII., VIII., IX. exhibit for each storm, and for each year, and
  for the whole period the Number of Irregularities, the Absolute Sum of
  Irregularities, and the Mean Irregularity. It appears that the value of Mean
  Irregularity is almost exactly the same in the three directions, that the
  number of irregularities is almost exactly the same in Westerly Force and in
  Northerly Force, but that the number in Nadir Force is almost exactly
  half of the others.
     It is certain that the times of Irregular-ities in the Westerly and Northerly
  directions do not coincide.       There appears some reason to think that Nadir
  Irregularities frequently occur between Westerly Irregularities.
     In Table X. theAggregates of Fluctuations and Irregularities are arranged

 by months, but no certain conclusions follow. In Table XI. the Wave
 disturbances and the Irregnlarities are arranged by hours ; for the Wave
 disturbances results are obtained which may be compared with those of
previous investigators; in Table XII. it is shown that these may be repre
 sented by a general tendency of wave-disturbances, different at different
 hours, which general tendency is itself subject to considerable variations.
For the Irregularities it is found that the coe<U+FB01>icient is largest in the hours
at which storms are most frequent.         It does not appear that any sensible
correction is required to the Diurnal Inequalities of the former paper on
 account of these disturbed days.
    The author then treats of the physical inference from these numerical
 conclusions.       And in the <U+FB01>rst place he states his strong opinion that it is
 impossible to explain the disturbances by the supposition           of de<U+FB01>nite
 galvanic currents or de<U+FB01>nite magnets suddenly produced in any locality
 whatever.       The absolute want of simultaneity (especially in the Irregu
 larities), and the great difference of numbers between the \Vaves and Irregu
 larities for the Nadir Force (in which the Irregularities are just as strongly
 marked as in the Westerly and Northerly, and the \Vave-disturbances are
 much more strongly marked), and those for the other Forces, appear fatal
 to this.
     It is then suggested that the relations of the forces found from the
investigations     above, bear a very close resemblance to what might be ex
pected     if we  conceived a <U+FB02>uid (to which for facility of language the name
 “Magnetic       Ether” is given) in proximity to the earth, to be subject to
occasional currents produced by some action or cessation of action of the
sun, which currents are liable to interruptions or perversions of the same
kind    as those    in air and water.   He shows that in air and in water the
general type of irregular disturbance is travelling circular forms, sometimes
with radial currents, but more frequently with tangential currents, some
times with increase of vertical pressure in the centre, but more frequently
with decrease of vertical pressure; and in considering the phenomena
which such travelling forms would present to a being over whom they
travelled, he thinks that the magnetic phenomena would be in great
measure imitated.                                                        .
    The author then remarks that observations at <U+FB01>ve or six observa
tories, spread over a space less than the continent of Europe, would pro
bably suffice to decide on these points.        He would prefer self-registering
apparatus, provided that its zeros be duly checked by eye-observations, and
that the adjustments of light give sufficient strength to the traces to make
them visible in the most violent motions of the magnet.            For primary
reduction he suggests the use of the method adopted in this paper, with
such small modi<U+FB01>cations       as experience may suggest.

II.     “ On the Sudden Squalls of 30th October and 21st November
         1863.” By BALFOUR. STEWART, M.A., F.R.S., Superintendent of
        the Kew Observatory.                Received December 10, 1863.
   The 30th of October was windy throughout, and in the afternoon there
was a very violent squall.
   The barograph at the Kew Observatory, as will be seen from Plate I.
which accompanies this communication, records a very rapid fall in the
pressure of the atmosphere, which appears to have reached its lowest point
about 3“ 9”‘ P.M., G.           M. T.      At this
                                       moment, from some cause, possibly a
very violent gust of wind, the gas-lights in the room which contained the
barograph Went out, and were again lit in a quarter of an hour. During
this interval the barometer had risen considerably; and indeed the baro
graph curve, although unfortunately incomplete, presents the appearance
of an extremely rapid rise. It may therefore perhaps be supposed that
there was a very sudden increase of pressure accompanied with a violent
gust of wind at the moment when the gas went out, which would be about
3" 9"‘ P.M., as above stated.
   In       a   paper     communicated       to the Royal Society on November          23,
Mr. Glaisher has remarked                that at Greenwich the time of maximum         de
pression of the barometer was 3h              30'n   P.M., while at the Radcliffe Observa
tory, Oxford, it was 2h 30'“ RM.                  This would indicate
                                                                of the  a progress
storm from west to east, in accordance with which Kew should be some
what before Greenwich              as regards the time    of maximum depression. This
anticipation       is therefore        con<U+FB01>rmed   by the record   of the Kew barograph
which has been given above.
  The indications of the Kew self-recording electrometer during this squall
show that about 2" 39'“ P.M. the electricity of the air, which before that
time had been very slightly negative, became rapidly positive, then quickly
crossed to negative, became positive again, and once more crossed to nega
tive about 3h 3”‘ P.M., recrossing again from strong negative about 3" 51"‘
P.M., after which it settled down into somewhat strong positive.
   It   is well,        however,   to state (what may also be seen from Plate           1.)
that the variations         of this instrument between 3" 3m P.M. and 3h 51'11 P.M.
were so rapid as not to be well impressed upon the paper.
  At Kew there      often occasion to move the dome, so that we cannot
                           is
well have an instrument which records continuously the direction of the
wind but we have Robinson’s anemometer, which records the space tra
        ;                   a
versed by the wind, and thus enables us to <U+FB01>nd its velocity from hour to
hour, though not perhaps from moment to moment.           A reference to
Plate   will show an increase in the average velocity of the wind during
        I.
this squall.
   A    somewhatsimilar squall took place in the afternoon of Saturday,
November 21st, about    o’clock.   4

ragged) fall   of the atmospheric pressure, which reached its minimum about
 4" 45''‘ ran.    There  was then a very     abrupt and nearly perpendicular          rise
 of about <U+FB01>ve hundredths of an inch of pressure, or rather less, after which
the rise still went on, but only more gradually.
    Through the kindness of the Rev. R. Main,              of the Radcliffe Observa
tory,  I have   been favoured with a copy of the trace afforded by the Oxford
 barograph    during this squall, in which there appears a very sudden rise of
nearly the same extent as that at Kew, but which took                   place about four
o’clock, and therefore, as on the previous occasion, somewhat sooner than
at Kew.      This change of pressure at Oxford was accompanied by a very
 rapid fall of temperature of about 8° Fahr.
    The minimum atmospheric pressure at Kew was 29'52 inches, while at
 Oxford it was 29'28 inches.
    It will be seen from the Plate that at Kew the electricity of the air fell
rapidly from positive to negative about 4"         30”‘ P.M., and afterwards        <U+FB02>uctu
ated a good deal, remaining, however, generally negative until 5" 22"‘ P.M.,
when it rose rapidly to positive.
    We see also from the Plate that there was an increase in the average
velocity of the wind at Kew during the continuance of this squall.                     To
conclude, it would appear that in these two squalls there was in both
cases an exceedingly rapid rise of the barometer from its minimum both at
Oxford and at Kew, this taking place somewhat sooner at the former
 place than at the latter; and that in both cases the air at Kew remained
negatively electri<U+FB01>ed during the continuance of the squall, while the
average velocity of the wind was also somewhat increased.
    The Society then adjourned         over the     Christmas recess to Thursday
January 7, 1864.
“On      the Equations     of Rotation of a Solid Body about a Fixed

       March 21, 1863.*
    In treating the equations of rotation of a solid body about a <U+FB01>xed point,
it is usual to employ the principal axes of the body as the moving system
of coordinates.     Cases, however, occur in which it is advisable to employ
other systems; and the object of the present paper is to develope the funda
mental formulae of transformation and integration for any system. Adopt

quantities F, G, H, which will facilitate transformations                 hereafter to be

arbitrary constants, due to the action of disturbing forces, when, as in the
case of nature, those forces are small.             With a view to this, it will be con

1§6§,]      Sir J.  _South..+.- Vibrations caused by Railway Trains.             65
“Experiments, made at Watford, on the Vibrations occasioned by
       Railway Trains passing_'through a Tunnel.”                   By Sir JAMES
       SOUTH, LL.D., F.R,.S., &c., one of the Visitors of the Royal Ob
       servatory of Greenwich.          Received   June  17', 1863*.
    In  the year 1846 an attempt was made to obtain the consent of the
Lords of the Admiralty to run a railway through Greenwich Park, distant
only 860 feet from the Royal Observatory,           which would_in the opinion of
many competent judges have been most injurious to that Establishment.
                                                       I
Such consent their Lordships refused; but as was assured on high au
thority that this attempt was to be repeated, and that too with the fullet
con<U+FB01>dence of success on the part of its projectors and supporters,          I deter
mined to make experiments which might hear more decisively on the
question of railway tremors, as affecting that Observatory, than those pre
viously made by myself and others.
     For this purpose it seemed indispensable that the station selected for
making them should geologically resemble that of Greenwich, and that
the astronomical means employed to detect the existence and determine
the intensity of the tremors should be, optically, at least equal to the te
lescope of the Greenwich Mural Circle.
     As much importancejwas attributed by the advocates of this railway to
 the supposed power of a tunnel to render the vibrations imperceptible, it was
 also desirable that it should be one of the conditions of these trials.
                                                                         I
     Having but little more than a popular knowledge of geology, relied on
 my old and valued friend the late Mr. Warburton, who had recently been
 President of the Geological Society, to guide me in the choice of a station;
 and it was on his authority that
                                '
                                       I  <U+FB01>xed on the Watford Tunnel and its im
 mediate vicinity.
     There, under a light gravelly soil of 18 or 20 inches deep, lies a bed of
 gravel of considerable but variable thickness, sometimes compact, at other
 times loose, and immediately under it chalk with occasional <U+FB02>ints.
     The tunnel, of which the bearing is 41° 19' to N.W. of the meridian,
  and by my measurement is 1812 yards long, passes principally through
  chalk ; its arch is about 24 feet in diameter, the crown of it being about
  21‘5 feet above the rails.       The thickness of the brickwork is about 18
 inches; the mean thickness of the chalk above the crown of the arch
  about 50 feet, whilst that of the gravel, though subject to great irre
  gularity, may perhaps be regarded as 14 feet. If so, we have outside the
  tunnel above the horizontal plane of the rails 87 feet of chalk, <U+FB02>int, gravel
  and soil, constituting an assemblage of which the power of transmitting
  tremors must be comparatively feeble.
     There are <U+FB01>ve shafts in the tunnel, four        of which are circular, 8'5 feet
  diameter, and one quadrangular,        about 26 feet by 34.

  66                Sir  J. South— Vibrations caused by Railway             [l863.
     The tunnel runs under the park of the Earl of Essex ; and though had     I
  not the honour of a personal acquaintance with the Noble Earl, nor any
  introduction to him, yet on learning my objects he transmitted to me by
  return of post, from Carlsbad, a carte-blanche to erect my observatory
  wherever    I pleased, though it were in the very heart of his choicest game
 preserves.      To him therefore is mainly due whatever bene<U+FB01>t may accrue to
  science or to the Royal Observatory from the experiments recorded in this
 communication.
     The point    I selected was 302 yards distant from the centre of the line ;
 and the perpendicular from it on the axis of the tunnel meets that at a
 point 567 yards from the southern or London end of the tunnel, 1245
 yards from the Tring or north end, and 59-4'5 from the fourth shaft. This is
                                           I
 the centre of the Observatory which erected there: it is of wood, as small
 as is consistent    with the necessary accommodation, both for portability and
 that it might     be less agitated by the wind.
     It is quadrangular, 12 feet by 10, and its length is in the meridian; the
 eaves are 8'5 feet, and the ridge of the roof 10 feet above the <U+FB02>oor, this
 last being 4 inches above the ground, which is nearly level with that over the
 tunnel.     The roof is covered with tarpaulins very well secured, so as not
 to be torn by a gale of wind. In the south and west sides are four windows,
which can be opened or shut at pleasure, to light the Observatory by day, or
to see powder or other signals at night. In the roof is no opening; but in its
northern side there is one which can be shut as required: it is little larger
than what is absolutely necessary to allow the re<U+FB02>ected rays from the Pole -star
to pass uninterruptedly to the observer’s eye through its whole revolution.
    At its centre, parallel with its sides and resting on the undisturbed gravel
4 feet below the surface, is a mass       of brickwork laid in excellent Roman
cement, 8 by 3'5 feet at bottom, 7 by 3'5 at top, its length running east and
west.     On this stand two piers of similar brickwork, 18 inches by 14, and 46
inches higher than the <U+FB02>oor : they are capped by two Portland stones of
similar horizontal section 8 inches thick.        In the interior faces of these
stones are <U+FB01>rmly <U+FB01>xed the Y-plates, which carry the Ys on which the in
strument’s     pivots rest.
    Eighteen inches north of the brick massive, but in the same plane with
its base, is the centre of the base of another pier, brought up also in Roman
cement, 24 inches from        N. to S., 18 from  E. to W. ; and it rises l2inches
above the <U+FB02>oor.         The upper surface is perfectly horizontal, and serves to
support a vessel which contains mercury.          Both this pier and the massives
are insulated from the <U+FB02>oor, and touch the ground only at their bases.
The mercury-vessel was 18 inches by 4;}, with its length in the meridian.
    The transit-instrument of the Campden Hill Observatory is far too pre
cious to be exposed to the risks of such an expedition ; Itherefore had one
constructed which might be considered an excellent substitute. The object
glass (which under favourable circumstances will bear a power of 1000) is
87 inches focus and 4'75 aperture.         The transverse axis is 31 inches ; and

the Y has su<U+FB01>icient azimuthal motion to enable me to follow the Pole-star
in its whole course, so that at any hour (if clear) could have the re<U+FB02>ectedI
image of the star in the mercurial vessel ready to testify against the tre
mors caused by a train.
   Supported by timber passing into the ground, but unconnected with the
<U+FB02>oor and convenient to a writing-desk which occupies the S.E. angle of the
building, stands a journeyman clock. It is set by my excellent gold pocket
chronometer, Molyneux No. 963, and rarely deviates from that more than
one- or two-tenths of a second in three or four hours.        The clock of the
Watford Station was compared with the chronometer, going and generally
returning, for the purpose of identifying particular trains.
   These details will, I hope, suffice to prove that every precaution was taken
to obtain accurate results, and that those which                       I
                                                      did obtain may be fairly
considered    as identicalwith what would have been found in a <U+FB01>rst-class
observatory under the same circumstances of locality and traffic.
    Iwas at my post to commence observations on December 22nd, 1846 ;
but that and the three following nights were starless. The 26th was <U+FB01>ne, but,
owing to the irregularity of the trains, and the want of well-organized signals,
I could only satisfy myself that all was in good working order, and that the
trains caused great disturbance. For thirteen following nights was at my                                  I
post, but in vain; all was dark, with the thermometer from 22° to 31°.
   On January 11th, l847, it cleared, and                       I
                                                  observed seven trains with
decisive results, being able to announce their presence before it was known
to my assistants, who were on the watch outside the observatory.

still parallel to No. 3. As the tremors became more distant, these trans
formations of the image take place in a reverse order, until the star
resumes its original disk-like form.
   These results were strongly conspicuous even in a fully illuminated <U+FB01>eld,
and equally so whether the magnifying power was 60, 200, or 750.        The
phenomena are very striking, from the contrast between the smallerimages,
which are blue, while the larger ones are reddish, and from the sudden
way  in which they break out.
   The nights of the 13th and 14th were <U+FB01>ne, and so thoroughly con<U+FB01>rmed
my previous observations that I felt it my duty to lose no time in informing
the late Lord Auckland, then First Lord of the Admiralty, of the preceding
details and of my conclusions from them, that a tunnel did not prevent
great tremors from being propagated from it when a train was traversing
it,   certainly to the distance of 643 yards, and probably much further.
      The impression which these facts made on his Lordship he expressed
in the following letter.
       Copy   of
               a   Letter from the Earl of Auckland to Sir James South.
                                        “Admiralty, January 26th, 1847
   “Sm,—I have to return you many thanks for the very interesting
report which you sent to me of your experiments upon the distance to
which the vibration caused by steam-carriages within     tunnel extend;
                                                                    a

   “ To Sir James South, (Ye, <§-c.”                     “AUCKLAND.”
      The reserve with which  spoke of that further distance arose from the
                                 I
circumstance that   was
                     I  not  in possession of the exact measurements of the
tunnel and the position of its shafts.   had twice applied for them in vain
                                            I
to the railway authorities, and was obliged at last to execute the measures
myself *. This consumed some time, and the observations were not com
pletely resumed      till February 24, 1847.
   The process was this. About 600 yards before the entrance of the
tunnel   rocket was <U+FB01>red as
          a                   signal for attention.
                                    a                At the instant that the
engine passed the south end of the tunnel, one of Lord Essex’s game-keepers
<U+FB01>red one barrel of his gun, and the other about a second after, which was
necessary    distinguish this from the shots of poachers, who were often at
              to
 *   This delay was not occasioned by any want of courtesy on the part of the Directors
or other o<U+FB02>icers; from whom, especially from Mr. Creed, their Secretary, received the
                                                                          I
heartiest cooperation. He not only directed all the of<U+FB01>cers along the line to aid as far
as possible my investigations, but pressed on me free passes for myself and my assistants.
I was also indebted to Captain Bruyeres for the character of the trains, and to Mr. Stubbs,
the Superintendent of the Watford Station, for the zeal with which he followed out the
Secretary’s instructions at much personal inconvenience.

1863.]                        Trains passing through a Tunnel.                                     69
work around me. Similar shots were <U+FB01>red when the engine was at the centre
of the 4th shaft (which could be seen from above). T he times of these sig
nals were taken by an assistant.                   During this time        I  was at the telescope,
and noticed the second when any peculiar phase of disturbance appeared.
    The computation of the distance of the engine from the eye at a given time
is very simple.           From the known distance of the south end of the tunnel and
the 4th shaft from the eye, we know the times taken by the sound of the gun
to reach the observatory.                The temperature was during the whole series so
near 32° that the velocity           of sound for that temperature, 363-13 yards, may
be used without sensible error.                   The effect of wind must also have been
insensible.          Hence the signal from the south entrance was                     18-77 too late,
that from the shaft           l"84.
    Correcting the times and dividing by their difference the distance of the
 shaft from the entrance, 1162 yards, we have the velocity of the train (which,
 however,        I   have given in miles per hour, as affording a more familiar
 measure       of the disturbing power).                  Then the di<U+FB02>'er-enee of the time of
 phase and corrected time of entrance gives the place                          of the engine on the
 line, and the perpendicular is given.
    In    the following record of the observations, the <U+FB01>rst column contains the
 number, the second the times, the third the facts observed, and the fourth
 gives the distance, then follow occasional remarks.                          In the disturbances,
 I  specially      recorded     as  most     de<U+FB01>nite      the  cross   (4),   and   the arrangement
 of bars of parallel stars (5). The slighter disturbances which precede or
 follow the former were seldom entered, though quite sensible.

   That these results may be more easily appreciated,     I have condensed the
most important of them into the preceding Table, which gives in one view
the distance at which that amount of disturbance begins and ends which
produces the cross, that at which the far greater one occurs causing the
appearance (5) (a system of three or more parallel rows) wherever it does
appear, and the velocities and weights of the trains when known.
    It is evident from this Table that the tremor which is sufficient         to
produce that disturbance of the mercury which shows a cross of stars is
propagated to considerable distances—in one case to 117 6 yards; and 24
per cent. of the entire are above 1000.      Such distances do not pass the
northern end of the tunnel, but go far beyond the southern. In the latter case
the vibrations are excited while the train is in an open cutting ; and those
who suppose that the tunnel has much power in deadening them would of
course expect that they would be sensible at a greater distance than at the
other end.      This does not seem, however, to be the case : and the Table
shows that in this respect there is very little difference, if we take into
account another cause of inequality, namely, that the tremor is manifested
further at the exit than at the entrance of the train.      The column headed
          ”
“Exit shows by s. that:the exit was at the South end, and the entrance
at the North.
    Now, when the observations are examined where both were noted, we <U+FB01>nd
that the limit of the cross is greater at the exit than at the entrance in 29
out of 39, or 74 per cent. of s., and 12 out ofl6, or 75 per cent. of N. The
reason of this, I suppose, is that the long-continued action of the train on
the rails tends to produce a greater and more prolonged undulation in the
mercury.
    But the equal percentage shows that there is really no protecting power
in the tunnel against the lateral propagation of tremors, whatever may be
 the   case immediately  above the crown.
    In   general one might expect trains to produce disturbance in proportion
to their speed and their weight.     To a certain degree this is true; but the
exceptions are sufficient to show that other in<U+FB02>uences must be taken into
consideration.      Examples of high speed with comparatively small effect
are afforded by the observations on March 18, II. ; 19,       III. ; and 29, V.
    Others of the reverse conditions are given by February 24, I., II. ;
 March 18, VI. ; and specially March 16, III., in which with a velocity of
 only 11-4 miles the cross was shown at 1110 yards.             This it may be
 remarked is a decisive proof that any plan of protecting an observatory by
 slackening the speed of trains passing near it is entirely useless, even if it
 could be enforced.
     It is probable that one cause of this high disturbing-power in slow trains
 is that already referred to, the long-continued accumulation of vibration,
 the quick ones passing beyond distance before the mercury has got into full
 vibration,   the others having full time to do their work though with less
 intrinsic force. On this account also long trains are more disturbing than
 short.

       The engine is not       so paramount        a disturber    as might    be expected,—the
   heaviest, and even a pair            of them, not causing more tremor than occurs
   with the smaller       ones.
       In taking    the cross    of stars   as the test   of disturbance,    I must observe that
   I do so,  not    because it is the earliest which appears, but because it marks
   distinctly  an    agitation greater than what is likely to occur at an observa
   tory subject to ordinary perturbations.                These produce in such a mercury
   vessel as   I  used a single line of stars perpendicular to the length of the
   vessel.  It  should seem that then only one set of undulations <U+FB01>t to produce
   these images is excited in the mercury, the direction of which is regulated by
   the sides of the vessel *. The existence of the cross shows that a second set
   of waves perpendicular to the <U+FB01>rst has been developed                 :  this always happens
   if the sides of the vessel are equal; and its occurring when they are so un
   equal as in the present case seems to indicate a corresponding excess of the
  power which causes them.             If the agitation be still greater, it seems as if each
   of the images which form the cross became the origin of a row of secondary
  images, the result of which is the form (5), a series of parallel rows of stars
  varying from two to ten, or even <U+FB01>lling the whole <U+FB01>eld. This token of ultra
  disturbance      is con<U+FB01>ned between lines making angles of 45° with the per
  pendicular     to the rails—in other words, to distances under 427 yards, and
  when the train is nearly in the centre of the tunnel.                    It is (except in two
  instances) only      seen  when    the   cross  is visible  beyond 1000 yards: when the
 agitation    is  still further   increased     the  images    vibrate in every direction, and
 with yet more of it the whole becomes a mass of nebulous light; of both
 which some examples may be found in these observations.
      The opinion maintained by the late Mr. Robert Stephenson, that much
 of these railway tremors were due to the sound of the train, although not
 probable, induced me to try some experiments by <U+FB01>ring cannon,                         maroons,
 and rockets at various distances.
     One of these cannons (for           I  had two, each a} of a pound calibre) heavily
 loaded, at 300 yards produced (5), cross, and line simultaneously with my
 hearing the reports; but all disturbance was over in about 1'5 second. At
 2020 yards there was the cross synchronous with the report, and of the
 same momentary character; and even at 3000 yards the cross could be
traced.      This seems to have been due to the momentary impulse of the
 sound-wave, for the continuous roar of two-pound rockets <U+FB01>red at 82 feet
from the mercury, though very loud, disturbed it very little; while the ex
plosions of eight ounces of powder in their heads about 800 yards above the
ground produced all, the (5), cross, and line. A still more interesting expe
riment was, <U+FB01>ring the cannon in the tunnel at the point where the perpen
dicular from the observatory met it. In this case two disturbances were
seen—one propagated through the ground, the other through the air with
about a second of time interval. The sound probably made its way chie<U+FB02>y

    I should have prosecuted         these researches further, especially in reference
 to the velocity       with which these tremors are propagated through the

 contented myself with reducing the observations            I had made.       As, how-
 ever, the Railway Moloch seems never likely to be satiated with victims,
 and as the observatories of Oxford, Armagh, and again that of Greenwich
 have been marked for sacri<U+FB01>ce, it seems to me a duty to place before the
 public the facts which had been collected at a great expense of lab0ur,:and
 some pecuniary outlay.

 the actual truth; and in addition to their bearing on practical astronomy,             I

     The Swedish Diet has given the necessary money to complete the survey
 for the measurement of an Arc of the Meridian at Spitzbergen.
     When the proposal was submitted to the Diet by our Government, at the
 instance of the Academy of Sciences at Stockholm, it was passed without
 opposition in the three <U+FB01>rst houses of the Diet (viz. the Nobles, the Clergy,
 and the Burghers). In the fourth house (the Peasants), only one Member
 opposed the proposal, on the ground of the high amount of the Budget. He
 was replied to by seven or eight other Members, advising that the house
 should not oppose a grant which had for its object to advance science.                In

 seconds. The mercury showed the usual intense disturbance when the mortar was <U+FB01>red,
 and also at the explosion of the maroons in the air. But there was also an intermediate
 disturbance which I cannot explain but by supposing it to be as it were an echo of the
 earth-wave caused by the discharge of the mortar and re<U+FB02>ected from the masonry of the
 tunnel. I showed it to the Marquis of Blandford, to Lord Alfred Churchill, and to Pro
 fessor James M“Cullagh; unfortunately the nights Dr. Robinson and Mr. Warburton ac
 companied me to Watford, not a single star was visible.  On repeating the experiments
 at Campden Hill, nothing of the sort occurred.

                                       (Abstract)
    When about to undertake a voyage to the Arctic Sea in 1857, in the
yacht ‘Fox,’ in search of the ships of Sir John Franklin’s expedition,
Captain M‘Clintock requested that the Royal Society would supply him
with such information and instructions as might enable him to make the
best use of the opportunity which the voyage was likely to afford for the
prosecution of rnagnetical and meteorological observations.
    As the present communication is limited to a discussion          of the hourly
observations     of the declination      made by Captain M‘Clintock and his
officers from December       1, 1858 to March 31, 1859 inclusive, the portion
of the instructions with which Captain M‘Clintock was supplied which
relates to such observations forms an appropriate introduction.            It is fol
lowed by a full statement from Captain M‘Clintock himself of the circum
stances   under which an observatory was established on the ice at a distance
of 220 yards from the ship, and hourly observations maintained during
<U+FB01>ve months of the arctic winter, being only discontinued when, on the
return of a more genial season, the services of both o<U+FB01>icers and sailors were
required in prosecuting the more immediate objects of the expedition.
    On the return of the ‘Fox’ to England, the observations were sent,
through the Royal Society, to the Woolwich establishment for the reduc
tion and publication of magnetic observations.            The results of the ob
servations treated of in this paper are discussed in comparison with those
obtained    from similar observations made by Captain Maguire and the
o<U+FB01>icers   of H.M.S. ‘Plover      ’

in the winters of 1852-53, and 1853-54, published in the Phil. Trans.
for 1857, Art. xxiv.
   The <U+FB01>rst point established conclusively by this comparison    that, after       is,
due allowance has been made for the difference in the antagonistic force of
the horizontal portion of the earth’s magnetism by which any disturbing
action  on the declination-magnet          is    opposed   at   the      two stations,    the
intensity of the disturbing force     is
                                      considerably         less at Port Kennedy than
at Point Barrow——that   is to say, less at the station which  nearest to the
                                                                          is
points of 90° of dip, and of the maximum of the total terrestrial magnetic
force, than at the station which      more distant from those points.
                                      is                                The
indication thus derived from the magnetic record at the two stations
accords with the fact of the far greater frequbncy of the aurora at Point
Barrow, where in the two winters its appearance       recorded on six days
                                                                is
out of every seven, whilst the proportion at Port Kennedy    not more thanis
one day in four.
  For the purpose of examining the periodical laws of the disturbances at
Port Kennedy, those which exhibited the largest differences from their
respective normals of the same month and hour, amounting to between
one-fourth and one-<U+FB01>fth of the whole body of the hourly observations, were
separated from the others, and were subjected to analysis in the customary
manner.    It  isthus shown that both at Port Kennedy and at Point
Barrow the disturbances so treated form themselves into distinct categories
of easterly and westerly de<U+FB02>ection,—the curve representing the easterly
de<U+FB02>ections having the same general form and single maximum as that of
the easterly de<U+FB02>ections at Kew, exhibited in P1. XIII. <U+FB01>g.     of the Phil.    1
Trans. for 1863, Art. XII. and the westerly curve having the same general

ing the westerly de<U+FB02>ections at Kew.
  A   remarkable correspondence      pointed out in regard to the hours at
                                       is
which the maxima of easterly and westerly de<U+FB02>ection take place at Port
Kennedy and Point Barrow. The maximum of easterly de<U+FB02>ection occurs
at the same hour   of absolute time at the two stations and the maximum
                                                                     ;
of westerly de<U+FB02>ection at the same hour of local time at the two stations.
   The author concludes by taking       general review of the phenomena of
                                           a
the solar-diurnal variation, particularly in the vicinity of the dip of 90°,
where the geographical and magnetical directions of the magnetic needle
are often strongly contrasted. At Port Kennedy the normal direction of
the magnet    is35° to the east of south, and at Point Barrow 41° to the
west of north: the contrast at the two stations in this respect therefore            is
nearly as great as can exist in any part of the globe, wanting only 6° of
180°, or   of being diametrically opposite.   The solar-diurnal variation at
these stations furnishes an apt illustration of the author's exposition.
   He further takes the occasion of the phenomena of the disturbance
diurnal variation at Port Kennedy, and at Nertschinsk        Siberia, to show
                                                                         in

    As  a  portion of this paper has already appeared in the Proceedings,’
 vol. xii. p. 633, I shall con<U+FB01>ne myself in this abstract to briefly noticing
 the additional observations which       I   have subsequently made.

 we are acquainted.

    From a numerous series of experiments             I  have just completed, I <U+FB01>nd that
 the garancine from munjeet has about half the tinctorial power of the geran
 cine made from the best madder, viz. Naples roots. . These, however,
 yield only_about 30 to 33 per cent. of garancine, while munjeet, accord
 ing to my friend Mr. Higgin of Manchester, yields from 52 to 55 per cent.
 The actual amount of colouring matter in munjeet and the best madder are
very nearly the same; but the inferiority of munjeet as a dye-stuff results
 mainly from its containing only the comparatively feeble colouring matters
purpurine and munjistine. The latter in large quantity is positively in
jurious; so much is this the case, that when the greater part of the mun
jistinc is removed from munjeet-garaneine by boiling water, it yields much
 richer shades with alumina mordants.

       Nerves in an Acephalous Fostus.” By ROBERT JAMES LEE,
       Esq., B.A. Cantab.        Communicated by ROBERT LEE, M.D.

       January 20, 1864.
                                  (Abstract.)
    The author observes that hitherto no account has been given of the
 origin and distribution of the par vagum or pneumogastric nerve in any
instance of a foetus born with brain entirely or partially wanting.      This
reason has been thought sufficient‘ for communicating to the Royal Society
the description of a dissection of the pneumogastric and sympathetic nerves
in a foetus born at the full period, in which the cerebellum and medulla
oblongata were absent.      At the time of birth it cried, moved, and for the
space of one hour might be said to live.       All the thoracic and abdominal
viscera were found properly formed, and the upper and lower extremities
properly developed. The eyes, nose, and month were present. The head,
when regarded as a whole, seemed as though the posterior and superior
parts had been entirely removed, thus leaving the spinal cord and base of
the skull exposed.     Some tough cerebral matter, covered only by a dense
membrane, was seen in two small masses exposed in the cranium, not con
tinuous with the spinal cord (which terminated abruptly at the base of the
cranium and was entirely exposed at this point), but separated from it by a
bony prominence arising from the <U+FB02>oor'of the cranial cavity.
    After the removal of the extremities, the abdomen was opened and the
 viscera of the abdominal cavity removed.      The anterior halves of the ribs

were cut away, and the thorax with its contents washed and immersed in
alcohol. The dissection was conducted in that liquid, with the assistance
of an ordinary lens magnifying six diameters.
    The pneumogastric nerve having been traced down the neck and thorax,
was found to be distributed in the usual way.            Its several ganglia, its
communications     with the sympathetic,      and its branches to the larynx,
trachea, bronchi, and oesophagus, appeared in no respect ditferent from
what is their usual condition in a perfectly formed foetus of the same age.
    Certain ganglionic enlargements formed on the superior laryngeal and
recurrent nerves were likewise seen as they have been described by Dr.
Robert Lee. Respecting these two principal branches of the pneumogastric
in the neck, the author observes that, if they be separately examined, each
will be found to be composed of two portions-—one descending, the other
ascending—wh.ich unite and form a single cord to be again divided into
many <U+FB01>laments for the supply of various parts.           From this he concludes
that the pneumogastric is not derived from the brain; for otherwise we
should expect to <U+FB01>nd branches from it composed only of descending <U+FB01>bres,
whereas we <U+FB01>nd its two chief branches equally made up of <U+FB01>bres from above
and from below.
    The hypoglossal, glossopharyngeal and communicating branch of the
accessory of the eighth pair were disposed as usually.
    The sympathetic nerve was also dissected in the neck and thorax, and
found to present its usual arrangement; but, besides its commonly recog
nized ganglia, the author discovered certain other bodies connected with
it in the thorax, which he considers to be nervous ganglia, and which he
thus describes   :-“ Just beneath    the costal pleura some small stellate bodies
are seen lying internal   to the ganglia of the sympathetic, and at variable
 distances from them.     Their  size is that of  a small pea, colour  pink, and
 structure apparently nervous. From the circumference of one of them, <U+FB01>ne
 vessels or nervous tubes are seen to radiate and join in some cases the ganglia
 of the sympathetic. In the angles of the rays are some pigmentary particles
 of brown colour, not connected, however, with the central mass. Many of
 these bodies are found in different parts of the thorax; and there can be no
 doubt of their nature, from their intimate connexion with the sympathetic.”
    The dissection of the nerves supplying the stomach, liver, and alimentary
 canal was completed in those viscera removed, with the heart and lungs,
 from a fcetus of six months in which neither brain nor spinal cord were
 present.
    The stomach had numerous <U+FB01>laments ramifying on its surface, which
 could be traced down to the lining membrane.             Similarly the liver was
 found to be pervaded with numerous <U+FB01>bres which followed generally the
                                                                           '
 course of the blood-vessels.
    Portions of the intestinal canal of the foetus <U+FB01>rst described were
 examined ; so that there is every reason to believe that this foetus was sup
 plied with nerves in the neck, thorax, and abdomen in the same manner as

one endowed with those parts thought most essential to life, the cerebellum
and medulla oblongata.
                       paper was communicated, the author has had the
     Since the foregoing
opportunity of examining two anencephalous fmtuses which had been pre
served for many years in the Museum of St. George’s Hospital.   In the
<U+FB01>rst specimen examined the bones forming the roof and sides of the cranium
were wanting, as well as the greater part of the basis behind the foramen
magnum; the brain was absent, and the bony cavity was not formed.
   In this instance nerves were seen passing through foramina in the basis
of the cranium.     There was no spinal canal, though a membrane from
which nerves proceeded occupied the position of the spinal cord.   At the
commencement of this there was a round body of the size of a small bean,
of nervous substance, which was exposed most clearly before the prepara
tion was removed from the bottle in which it had been preserved.       The
connexion was easily seen between this body and the spinal membrane, and
nerves proceeded from its under surface in different directions.
   There were small pieces of cartilage, apparently portions of vertebrae,
found here and there in the spinal region, but there was no sacrum, and
the rectum was exposed.
   Such were the general appearances presented by this foetus.    In other
respects it was well developed. The large venous and arterial vessels were
seen to       supply appropriate parts.
    The pneumogastric nerves were traced by following their branches in the
neck upward and downward.       That on the left side was seen perforating the
<U+FB02>oor of the cranium, with a ganglionic enlargement formed on it soon after
it issued from the canal, and thence passing downwards to supply the usual
organs.    The nerve on the right side was not clearly traced through the
<U+FB02>oor of the cranium; but as there was an opening corresponding to that on
the left side, there is no reason to doubt the similarity between the two
nerves.
  A  question which naturally presented itself on perceiving the small round
body described above, was whether this might not correspond to the medulla
oblongata.   That this is not probable appeared from the fact that the
pneumogastric nerves left the cranium at a distance of nearly two inches
from    it,
       and no connexion could be seen to exist between them and that
body.  No history has been preserved of this foetus; so that whether       it
showed any signs of independent existence cannot be ascertained.
  The distribution of the nerves in the thorax presented nothing very
abnormal, the various parts being supplied with their proper branches. The
sympathetic nerve was of small size on both sides, and its extent greatly
diminished.
  The second of these dissections bore some resemblance to the fostus
described in the paper, with the exception that there was no trace of cere
bral matter whatever.      membrane from which nerves proceeded was all

osseous covering.    The deep groove bifurcated at the cranial extremity into
grooves of half its size, which took a direction at right angles to that of the
former. The left pneumogastric nerve was seen passing through the base
of the cranium to the surface, where it appeared to have come from the
membrane from which other nerves proceeded.           After descending to the
cervical region  and  giving off the recurrent,  the  principal branch was not
continued to the lungs and cesophagus, but directly to the ganglion of the
sympathetic in the upper part of the thorax, so that the sympathetic
chain of ganglia in the thorax appeared to be simply a continuation of the
pneumogastric.      To compensate for this absence of nervous supply on the
left side, the nervous plexuses on the roots of the lungs were found to be
 enormously increased on the opposite side. A large branch ascended from
 the solar plexus and united with the divisions of the right pneumogastric.
 The splanchnic on this side was large, and was composed of <U+FB01>laments
 from the upper thoracic ganglia, not merely from those below the sixth.
 The action of the heart and the functions of the liver, kidneys, and other
 organs must have continued during the uterine existence of the fmtus.
     The author expects to be a<U+FB01>brded further means of prosecuting his
  dissections of the nerves of acephalous monsters, in which case he will
 communicate the results of his examinations to the Royal Society.

appear in the sequel that these assertions, when tested by experiments on
instruments with <U+FB01>xed tones, are all incorrect.

ditions to be ful<U+FB01>lled by a perfect scale, the least number of <U+FB01>xed tones
required, and the practical means of producing them uncurtailed without
inconvenience to the performer, although instruments which produce a
limited number of just tones have been practically used by Gen. Perronet
Thompson, Mr. Poole, Prof. Helmholtz, Prof. Wheatstone, myself,'and
others.     This is therefore the subject of the present paper.
    The following notation is employed. 1 have introduced it for the purpose
of supplying a want which has been greatly felt by all writers on the theory
of music. It is founded on the principle of retaining the whole of the
usual notation    unaltered,   but restricting its signi<U+FB01>cation    so as to prevent
ambiguity,    and introducing the smallest possible number of additional signs
to express the required shades of sound with mathematical accuracy,
selecting such signs as are convenient for the printer, and harmonize with
the ordinary notation of accidentals on the staff.
    A letter, as C, called a note, will represent both a certain tone and its
pitch, de<U+FB01>ned to be the number of double vibrations in one second, to
 which the tone is due.         The letters 1), E, F, G, A, B represent other
 tones and pitches, so that

 middle c,” usually written on the leger line between the treble and bass
 staves;   and the other letters are noted on the staff as usual in the scale       of

perament, it is most convenient to use ordinary logarithms to <U+FB01>ve places,
because the actual pitches, and the length of the monochord (which is the
reciprocal of the relative pitch), can be thus most easily found. In Table I.
the principal intervals are given as fractions, logarithms, and degrees.                If
we call 0005658 one degree, then 53 degrees=0'30l04=log                     2—~0'00001,
and 31 degrees=0'17608=log 1;-—'0'0000l.                   If we moreover represent
the   addition  and  subtraction    of 000035     (or  one-sixteenth    of a degree) by
an acute or grave accent respectively, then 17' degrees=0'0969l=log                     %,
and   1‘ degree=0'00533=log1}},-—0'00007. Two numbers of degrees which
differ by a single accent of the same kind, as 17', 17" represent notes whose
real interval is a schisma (thus e has 17’ degrees; and dx, =1]'e, has
 17" degrees), having a difference of logarithm=0'00049 or 0’ degrees
 +0'000l4. By observing this, degrees may be very conveniently used
for all calculation of intervals between tones of pitches represented by
2" . 3" . 5*’.     Table IV. contains a list of tones which differ from each
other by a schisma, and will be useful hereafter.
    The conditions of a perfect musical scale are not discovered by taking
all the tones which can be expressed by one of Euler’s “exponents,” nor
by forming all the tones which are consonant with a certain tone, and then
all the tones consonant with these, as Drobisch has done. Such processes
produce many useless, and omit many necessary tones.                      Since modern
music     depends on the relations of harmonies, and not on scales, it is
necessary to <U+FB01>nd what consonant chords of three tones are most closely
connected *.
    Three tones whose pitches are as 4          : 5 : 6, or  10:  12 : 15 form a    major
or minor consonant chord respectively.             The   same  names are used when
any one or more       of the pitches is multiplied or divided by a power of             2,
notwithstanding the dissonant           effect in some cases.       Thus, 0' : E : G=
4  : 5 : 6 is a major, and c : ‘tel? :_q=l0: 12: 15 is a         minor chord, and the
same names are applied to e :5]2 : c‘=5 : 2 X 6: 2’ X 4, and G:1'el7 : c’=
 15 : 2 x 12 : 22 x 10, although these chords are really dissonant (Helmholtz,
db.  p. 333-4).      I  shall consequently use a group of capitals, as CE G, to
represent    a major   chord,  and a group of small letters, as c Tebg, to represent
 a minor chord, irrespective of the octaves.           The three notes in this order,
 being the <U+FB01>rst, third and <U+FB01>fth of the major or minor scale commencing
with the <U+FB01>rst, are called the <U+FB01>rst, third and <U+FB01>fth of the chords respectively.
 Both chords contain a <U+FB01>fth, a major and a minor third.               If  the interval of
 the  <U+FB01>fth  is contained     by the same tones in a major and minor chord, as
    * There   are consonant chords of four tones, such as g      b d’ 5 f ’, and these are
 insisted on by Poole (loc. c1't.); but, though they are quite consonant and agree
 able, and much pleasanter than the dissonant chords by which they are replaced,
 such as g b difz, they do not form a. part of modern music, for reasons clearly laid
 down by Helmholtz (op. cit. p. 295). Dissonant chords must always arise from the
 union of tones belonging to two consonant chords, or from the inversions of con
 sonant chords; and therefore their tones are determined with those of the others.

I  term the system   of the <U+FB01>rst tone of the tonic chord of the original pri
mary major scale, which tone may be called the tonic of the system.
    A piece of music is written in a certain system, determined by the com
pass or quality of tone of the instruments or voices which have to perform
 it,and rarely exceeds that system*.    It only in the system that the true
                                                        is
relation of the tones of     piece of
                                   a  music, the course and intention of the
modulation, and the return to the original key or scale can be appreciated.
I have not yet found these relations fully expressed in any theoretical work
on music; but their full expression was necessary to the solution of the
problem here proposed.
   It will be found practically that only 11 systems are used in music.
These are, in dominative order, the systems of IDl7, 17, Eb, Bb, F,  G,                         C,
D, TA, TE, 1B, which contain the 11 keys of the same name, together
with the    keys of 1Cl7, 1Gl7, and TF1;-, 'l‘C11:.

which must be contained in        perfect musical scale of <U+FB01>xed tones, or the

     On examination         will be found that these six columns contain 72 dif

ferent notes.          Hence the extent of   perfect scale

the octave.       It   is   therefore   six times as extensive as the equally tempered

                                                           required. The      is
most obvious    that proposed by Euler, in the passage already quoted,
                      is
namely, the use of certain tones for others which di<U+FB02>'er from them by a
comma or diaschisma.              Such substitution within the same chord creates
intolerable dissonance.         But in melody and in successions of chords    might        it
seem feasible.        I    have had   concertina

                                    are played as G

 in passing from the chord of A to that of D, as in the ordinary cadence,
 the note A has to be changed into TA.                  If
                                               A is the highest or lowest note
 in the chords, the effect is decidedly bad.    The <U+FB02>atness of the “leading
 note” 1011, in place of C11, although only a comma in extent, is felt as
 annoying in the succession ic<U+FB01>, d. The result is such that it would not be
 worth while to invent new instruments with such a defect in common scales.
 On the same instrument                I
                              have the three chords of the major scale of A
 tuned as D F1; TA, A ICj,tE', E 1G3 B, in which the subdominant chord is
now a comma too sharp.        As the subdominant is a much less important
chord than the dominant, the effect is better, but trouble arises from having
occasionally to alter the tonic note A itself. Even the dissonance of the
dominant seventh, when played as E IGi$Bd is pereeptibly harsher than
the correct Ej:G#B.’;d (both forms lie on the instrument), although the
added seventh d now forms a true minor third with the <U+FB01>fth B, whereas
the correct note Id forms a dissonant Pythagorean minor third with the
same note B.     When, however, the <U+FB01>rst E is omitted, the chord of the di
minished <U+FB01>fth $G:)$ B id is not so pleasant as 1G# B d. Again, on the same
instrument, instead of having 1D 1F4‘,t A, as the synonymous major of

importance.     Again,          I
                          am obliged to modulate from D major to id minor
instead of d minor.     Even here the error of a comma is perceptible.     The
general result, therefore, is that commatic substitution, even within the same
melody or succession of chords, is inadmissible in just intonation.
   Professor Helmholtz (op. cit. pp. 433 & 484) has suggested what may
be termed schismatic substitution, or the use of one note for another which
only diifers from it by a schisma, the eleventh part of a comma.       Having
one concertina           tuned to equal temperament, and another to just intervals,
the equation           ][g= 15g has enabled me to test this suggestion by practice.
I  <U+FB01>nd that in slow chords, the altered <U+FB01>fth c 159, the altered major third
159 6, and the altered minor third e jhg are all decidedly,       though only
slightly, dissonant.    In rapid chords the effect would be necessarily much
less perceptible.    Such chords as U E “G, e by b are far superior either to

capitals red*.  By this arrangement the <U+FB01>ngering of every key would be
the same.    The performer would disregard the signature except as naming
the pedal, and play as if the signature were natural.   Table V. would
inform him whether the accidentals belonged to the key, its dominant, or
any other     key; and if they indicated another key, he would change                                            -the
pedal.     It wouldbe convenient to mark where a new pedal had to be used ;
but no change would be required in the established notation §.
   Mr. Poole’s organ, which suggested the above arrangement, has 11 stops,
from 517 to 51$, and only 12 manuals, which appear to be associated with
the following tones on each stop                      :
           Black . .             12           (123)                    (/lit)        151;             5'/b

The two manuals whose notes are put in parentheses are inadequately de
scribed.  Mr. Poole’s scale. does not include the synonymous minor chords,
which he plays by commatic substitution.                             ,
   Another method of realizing such a scale is by additional manuals and
additional boards of manuals.     Thus three boards of manuals, each with
23 manuals,        containing         the tones in Table                  V. cols.   III.      to   VIlI.,   lines 4
  '  On examining Table II. it will be found that 10 different tones lie on each
pair of manuals, so that there are only 70 different tones. The two missing tones
are, necessarily, 'I'1'_/'11 (the acute fourth of the key of 1'0 it), and Iibb (the grave
seventh of the key of IO'l7) ; and to this extent the scheme is defective. It would
probably be more convenient to the instrument-maker to use all the 70 tones in this
arrangement than to take the inferior number 45 due to schismatic substitution.
A full-sized harmonium at present employs from 48 to 60 vibrators to the
octave, so that the mechanical difficulties to be overcome in introducing 70 are
comparatively slight. By omitting the two very unusual keys of Id? and 1'O'1$,

II. “ On     the Great Storm of December 3, 1863, as recorded by the
       Self-registering Instruments at the Liverpool Observatory.”            By
       Jomv HARTNUP, F.R.A.S., Director of the Observatory.                Com
       municated by General SABINE,          P.R.S.      Received January 21,

[This Paper is accompanied by a diagram, which is deposited, for reference,
   in the Archives of the Royal Society, and of which the author gives the
   following explanation.]
   The accompanying diagram exhibits the strength and direction of the
wind, the height of the barometer, and the rain-fall for three days pre
ceding, two days following, and during the great storm of December 3,
1863, as recorded by the self-registering instruments at the Liverpool Ob
servatory.     The barometer-tracing is a facsimile of the original record pro
duced by King’s self-registering barometer; the force and direction of the
wind and the rain-fall have been taken from the sheets of Osler’s anemo
meter and rain-gauge; the time-scale for the anemoineter has been slightly
increased to adapt it to that of the barometer, and the scale of wind-pres
sure   for each <U+FB01>ve pounds has been made uniform, instead of leaving the
spaces greater or less according to the strength of the springs as in the
original record.     The tracings of the recording-pencils for the direction of
the wind and the rain-fall are faithfully represented, but it is scarcely
possible to copy the delicate shadings and every gust recorded on the
original sheets by the pencil which registers the force of the wind ; all the
heavy pressures are, however, correctly represented, and may be taken from
the diagram as accurately as from the original sheets.         The <U+FB01>gures at the
bottom     of the diagram     show the    readings  of the dry- and wet-bulb
thermometers and the maximum         and minimum thermometers        as recorded
at the   Observatory during the six days; the wet- and dry-bulb thermo
meters were read each day at 8 and 9 A.M. and at 1, 3 and 9 ram. ; the
registering dry thermometers were read and readjusted each day at l !'.M.
The time marked on the diagram for all the instruments is Greenwich
mean time.
    For four days previous to the 30th of November the barometer had been
high and steady, the readings ranging from 30'l3in. to 30'33 in., the
latter at noon on the 29th being the highest; from this time to midnight
 the fall was slow and pretty uniform; from midnight November 29 to
 midnight December 5 the changes of barometric pressure, the strength and
 direction of the wind, and the rain-fall are shown on the diagram. The fall
 of the barometer on the day of the great storm was rapid from midnight to
 6 mm. ; heavy rain and hail fell from 3,1 30"‘ to 7" 20"‘; and from 5" 50”‘ to
 6" 45”‘ it was nearly calm, during which time the wind shifted from E.

or three minutes ; the barometer, being at its minimum, suddenly rose about
three-hundredths   of an inch, and during the heaviest part of the storm it con
tinued to rise at the rate of about one-tenth of an inch an hour.     The oscil
lations in the mercurial column, as will be seen by the diagram, were large
and frequent during the storm, one of the most remarkable being imme
            10‘1 A.M. and nearly coincident with two of the heaviest gusts
diately after
of wind; the depression in this case amounted to between four and <U+FB01>ve
hundredths of an inch, the rise following the fall so quickly that the clock
moved the recording-cylinder only through just sufficient space to cause a
double line to be traced by the pencil.

       Observatory,   and BALFOUR.           STEWART, M.A., F.R.S. g Received
       January 14, 1864.
   The National Portuguese Observatory established at Lisbon in connexion
with the Polytechnic School, and under the direction of Senhor da Silveira,
has not been slow to recognize the advantage to magnetical science to be
derived from the acquisition of self’-recording magnetographs. Accordingly
 that institution being well supported by the Portuguese Government, de
spatched Senhor Capello, their principal observer(one of the writers of this
communication), with instructions to procure in Great Britain a set of self
recording magnetographs after the pattern of those in use at the Kew Ob
servatory of the British Association.
                                                                                            '
   These instruments were made by Adie of London, and when completed
were sent to Kew for inspection and veri<U+FB01>cation, and Senhor Capello resided
there for some time in order to become acquainted with the photographic
processes.    The instruments were then taken to Lisbon, where they arrived
about the beginning of last year, and they were forthwith mounted at the
Observatory, and were in regular operation by the beginning of July last.
   It had been agreed by the writers of this paper that the simultaneous
magnetic records of the two observatories at Kew and Lisbon should occa
sionally be compared together, and the opportunity for such a comparison
soon presented itself in an interesting disturbance which commenced on the
15th of July last.      The curves were accordingly compared together, and
the  results are embodied  in the present communication.
   We shall in the <U+FB01>rst place compare the Kew curves by themselves, se
condly the Lisbon curves in the same manner, and lastly the curves of the
two Observatories   together.
                          Comparison       of Kew      Curves.
   The disturbance, as shown by the Kew curves, commenced on July 15th,
at 9h l3""5 G.M.T., at which moment the horizontal-force curve recorded
an abrupt augmentation of force.            The vertical component of the earth’s
magnetic force was simultaneously augmented, but to a smaller extent                      ;
while only a very small movement was visible in the declination curve.

   The disturbance, which began in this manner, continued until July 25th,
if not longer; but during the period of its action there was not for any of the
elements a very great departure from the normal value ; probably in this
respect the declination was more aifected than either of the other com
ponents.
   While frequently there is an amount of similarity between the different
elements as regards disturbances of long period, yet there is often also a
want of likeness.          If, however, we take the small but rapid changes of
force, or peaks and hollows, as has been done by one of the writers of this
paper in a previous communication to the Royal Society (Phil. Trans. 1862,
page 621), we shall <U+FB01>nd that a disturbance of this nature which in
creases or diminishes the westerly declination at the same time increases or
diminishes both elements of force.                  This will be seen more distinctly from
the following Table, in which +:denotes an increase and —— a diminution of
westerly declination, horizontal, and vertical force respectively, and the pro
portions are those of the apparent movements of the elements on the pho

    From this Table it will be seen that the signs are always alike for the
different elements, and also that the small and rapid movements of the
horizontal force are double of those of the vertical force—a result in con
formity with that already obtained by one of the writers in a previous com
munication.     On the other hand, the declination peaks and hollow do not
hear an invariable proportion to those of the horizontal and vertical force,
but present the appearance of a daily range, being great in the early morn
ing hours, and small in those of the afternoon.     Indeed this is evident by
a mere glance at the curves, which, it so happens, present unusual facilities
for  a comparison   of this nature.
                         Comparison  of Lisbon Curves.‘
    1. Declination- and vertical-force curves.—The peaks of the waves, or
the elevations in the curve of declination,   are always shown in hollows or
depressions in the vertical-force curve, and vice versd. We have never seen
an instance to the contrary either in the curves under comparison or during
the whole time of the operation of these instruments.              This curious
relation is exhibited in a Plate appended to this communication, from
which it will be seen that we have not only a reversal, but also a very
nearly constant ratio between the ordinates of the two curves. At Lisbon
therefore an increase of westerly declination corresponds to a diminution of
vertical force, and vice versd; also an almost constant proportion obtains
between the corresponding changes of these two elements.
    2. Bi<U+FB01>lar and Declination Curves.—July         15.  A great disturbance,
which at 8,1 37'“ Lisbon mean time, or 9" l3“"5 Greenwich mean time,
 abruptly and suddenly augmented the horizontal force.
    The curve of the declination continues nevertheless nearly undisturbed
 for about 30 minutes after this, and only at 9h 4l‘“'5 G.M.T. it com
 mences to descend very slowly.
    July I6.—At about 13“ 6'“ G.M.T., avery regularly shaped prominence
 of some duration occurs in the declination, but is quite invisible in the hori
 zontal force.
    July  17.——We    see in the bi<U+FB01>lar curve half-a-dozen small peaks repro
 duced in the declination in the same direction, but to a smaller extent.
    July l8.—One or two accordant peaks. A large prominence of some

     July 23.-—The       same appearance of the horizontal-force curves.         One
 remarks    on 22nd and 23rd that the small peaks of the declination and
 horizontal-force are more numerous and more developed in the morning
 hours.
     July  24.—.-igreement between the small peaks.           A strong disturbance
 about 10%“ G.M.T., no agreement between the waves. A well-marked pro
 minence of declination (15?) does not alter at all the horizontal-force curve.
    We derive the following conclusions from the comparison which we
 have made between the Lisbon curves :—
     l. The waves and the peaks and hollows of declination are always repro
 duced at the same instant in the vertical force, but in an opposite direction ;
 that is to say, that when the north pole of the declination-needle goes to
 the east, the same pole of the vertical-force magnet is invariably plunged
 below the horizon, and vice verati.         During <U+FB01>ve months of operation of
 these instruments there has not been an example of the contrary.
    2. The more prominent disturbances of the horizontal force do not              in
 general agree with those of the declination or vertical force either in dura
 tion or time.
    It is certain that when one of the two elements (bi<U+FB01>lar or declination) is
 disturbed, the other is also; and sometimes one appears to see even for
 several periods of one of the curves, an imitation of the general march of
 the other; but when this is examined a little more minutely, and rigorous
 measures are attempted, one easily perceives that the phases do not arrive
 at the same time, but sometimes later and sometimes earlier, without any
 <U+FB01>xed rule.
    In  the    same    curve one generally sees contradictions       of this kind.
 Nevertheless    it is certain that the agreement in direction and time is more
complete when the elevations or depressions are of shorter duration.
    3. The small peaks and hollows are generally simultaneous for the
three curves.       The direction of these is the same for the horizontal force
and declination, while that for the vertical force is opposite.
    The ratio in size of the peaks and hollows is generally variable between
the horizontal force and the declination,         while  it is always constant be
tween the latter and the vertical force.
    Our next deduction requires a preliminary remark.           It has been shown
by General Sabine, that if the disturbances of declination at various places
be each divided      into two categories, easterly and westerly, these obey      dif
ferent laws     of daily variation, this difference not being the     same   for all
stations.
   This would     seem to indicate   that for every station there  are at least two
simultaneous disturbing       forces acting independently,   and superposed upon
one another.
   This interesting conclusion, derived by General Sabine, appears to be

    declination       is,
                   .in units of force, between 26 48 and 26 : 36.   This would

    the magnetic meridian and almost horizontally.

     From this Table it will be seen that while this proportion is variable, yet
 one may generally regard the disturbing force at Kew as greater than that
 at Lisbon in the proportion of 1'8 to 1.
     2. Declination (east and west disturbing force).-The declination
 curves for Kew and Lisbon are very like each other, and the waves as well as
 the peaks and hollows are for the most part simultaneously produced in the
two collections of curves.         Since, however, at Kew the waves are greater,
one does    not always     easily perceive the resemblance.                       Certain peaks or
waves very prominent       at Kew, are reproduced but slightly at Lisbon; but
a careful scrutiny shows that all, or very nearly all, of the Kew waves and
peaks occur at Lisbon also.
    In Table IV. we have a comparison of the principal points of the decli-                         ._
nation-curves with respect to time.              From this Table it will be found that
the average difference between the local times of corresponding points is
34""0, that due to difference       of longitude being 35’“'3.
   The following Table exhibits approximately the proportion between the
disturbance-waves of the declination at Lisbon and at Kew.

      It  would thus appear that the declination at Kew, judging from the waves,
  is subject to greater disturbing forces than at Lisbon in the proportion of
   1'6 : 1.  This ratio is not, however, quite so great as that for the hori
  zontal force.
      3.  Vertical disturbing force.—The curves of vertical force are nearly
  quite dissimilar.          Sometimes the general march of the curves appears to
  coincide during some time; but in these cases we do not <U+FB01>nd an appre
  ciable general agreement for the majority of the various points of the wave.
      On the other hand, the small peaks and hollows of the Kew curves are
  generally reproduced in those of Lisbon, but in the opposite direction, that
 is to say, a sudden augmentation of the vertical force at Kew corresponds
  to a sudden diminution of the same at Lisbon, and vice versd.
     In Table VI. we have a comparison of the principal points of the vertical
 force curves with respect to time.

    From this Table it will be seen that the average difference between the
local times of corresponding points is 33""l, while for the horizontal force
this was 34“"3, and for the declination 34'‘‘'(), the mean of the three being
33““8.      The measurements from which these numbers were obtained were
made at Lisbon independently for each element : another set of measure
ments, made at Kew, but of a less comprehensive description, gave a mean
difference in local time of 33"“ 7, which is as nearly as possible identical
with the Lisbon determination.       We have already observed that we attri
bute the dilference between 33‘“'8 and 35“"3, the true longitude-difference
of local times, to instrumental errors, and not to want of simultaneity in the
corresponding    points.
    In Table VII.   we have  a comparison in magnitude and sign of the peaks
and hollows at the two stations.
    From this Table it will be seen that the magnitude of these is generally
greater at Kew than at Lisbon.       The curious fact of the reversal in direc
tion of the vertical-force peaks between Kew and Lisbon has been already
noticed.
    We shall now in     a few words   recapitulate   the results which we have
 obtained.
    1.   In  comparing the Kew curves together for this disturbance, the
 peaks and hollows of the horizontal force always hear a de<U+FB01>nite proportion
 to those of the vertical force, the proportion being the same as that ob
 served in previous disturbances.    On the other hand, the declination peaks
 and hollows do not hear an invariable proportion to those of the other two
 elements, but present the appearance of a daily range, being great in the
 early morning hours, and small in those of the afternoon.        The peaks and
 hollows are in the same direction for all the elements.
    2. In comparing the Lisbon curves together, the elevations of the decli
 nation-curve always appear as hollows in the vertical-force curve, and vice
 rerari, and there is always a very nearly constant ratio between the ordi
 nates of the two curves.      The horizontal-force curve, on the other hand,
 presents no striking likeness to the other two.        We conclude from this
 that there are at least two independent disturbing forces which jointly in
 <U+FB02>uence the needle at Lisbon, but that the declination and vertical-force
 elements are chie<U+FB02>y in<U+FB02>uenced by one force.
    The peaks and hollows are generally simultaneous for the three curves.
 The direction of these is the same for the horizontal force and declina
 tion, while that for the vertical force is opposite.    The ratio in magnitude
 of the peaks and hollows is generally variable between the horizontal force
 and the declination, while it is always constant between the latter and the
 vertical force.
    3. When the Kew and Lisbon curves are compared together, there is a
 very striking likeness between the horizontal-force curves, one perhaps
 somewhat less striking between the declination-curves, and very little like
 ness between the vertical-force   curves.    It is perhaps worthy   of note that

the Lisbon horizontal-force   curve, in which we may suppose two indepen
dent forces to be represented, is probably on the whole the most like the
corresponding Kew curve.       Corresponding points occur at the same abso
lute time for both stations.
     The disturbance-waves for the horizontal force and declination are
greater at Kew than at Lisbon.
    The Kew peaks and hollows are simultaneously produced at Lisbon in all
the elements, but to a smaller extent than at Kew; also the direction is
reversed in the case of the vertical force, so that a sudden small increase of
vertical force at Kew corresponds to a diminution of the same at Lisbon.
    The writers of this paper are well aware that before the various points
alluded to in their communication can be considered as established, a more
extensive comparison of curves must be made.         But as the subject is new
and of great interest, they have ventured thus early to make a preliminary
communication to the Royal Society.       They will afterwards do all in their
power to con<U+FB01>rm their statements, which in the meantime they submit to
this Society as still requiring that proof which only a more prolonged in
vestigation can afford.

   “Experiments to determine the e<U+FB01>'ects of impact, vibratory action,
         and a long-continued change of Load on Wrought-iron Girders.”
         By WILLIAM FAIRBAIRN, LL.D., F.R.S. Received January 20,
         1864.
                                    (Abstract.)
      The author observes that the experiments which were undertaken, nearly
  twenty years ago, to determine the strength and form of the Tubular Bridges
  which now span the Conway and Menai Straits, led to the adoption of cer
  tain forms of girder, such as the tubular, the plate, and the lattice girder,
  and other forms founded on the principle developed in the construction of
  these bridges.   It was at <U+FB01>rst designed that the ultimate strength of these
  structures should be six times the heaviest load that could ever be laid upon
  them, after deducting half the weight of the tubes.      This was considered
  a fair margin of strength ; but subsequent considerations, such as generally
  attend a new principle of construction with an untried material, showed the
  expediency of increasing it; and instead of the ultimate strength being
  six times, it was in some instances increased to eight times the weight of
 the greatest load.
     The proved stability of these bridges gave increased con<U+FB01>dence to the
 engineer and the public, and for several years the resistance of six times
 the heaviest load was considered an amply su<U+FB02>icient provision of strength.
     But a general demand soon arose for wrought-iron bridges, and many were
 made without due regard to <U+FB01>rst principles, or to the law of proportion ne
 cessary to be observed in the sectional areas of the top and bottom <U+FB02>anges,
 so clearly and satisfactorily shown in the early experiments.     The result of
 this was the construction of weak bridges, many of them so ill-proportioned
 in the distribution of the material as to be almost at the point of rupture
 with little more than double the permanent load.        The evil was enhanced
 by the erroneous system of contractors tendering by weight, which led to
 the introduction of bad iron, and in many cases equally bad workmanship.
     The de<U+FB01>ciencies and break-downs which in this way followed the <U+FB01>rst
successful application of wrought iron to the building of bridges led to
doubts and fears as to their security.      Ultimately it was decided by the
Board of Trade that in wrought-iron bridges the strain with the heaviest
load should not exceed 5 tons per square inch ; but on what principle
this standard was established does not appear.
    The requirement of 5 tons per square inch did not appear sufficiently
de<U+FB01>nite to secure in all cases the best form of construction.         It is well

122             Mr. Fairbairn—E.z1reriments     on the E<U+FB01>ects          [Feb. 4,
known that the powers of resistance to strain in wrought iron are widely
diiferent, according as we apply a force of tension or compression ; it is even
possible so to disproportion the top and bottom areas of a wrought-iron
girder calculated to support six times the rolling load, as to cause it to yield
with little more than half the ultimate strain or 10 tons on the square inch.
For example, in wrought-iron girders with solid tops it requires the sectional
area in the top to be nearly double that of the bottom to equalize the two
forces   of tension and compression; and unless these proportions   are   strictly
adhered to in the construction,  the 5-ton strain per square inch is afallacy
which may lead to dangerous    errors.    Again, it was ascertained from direct
experiment that double the quantity of material in the top of a wrought
iron girder was not the most e<U+FB01>'ective form for resisting compression. On the
contrary, it was found that little more than half the sectional area of the top,
when converted into rectangular cells, was equivalent in its powers of resist
ance to double the area when formed of a solid top plate.       This discovery
was of great value in the construction of tubes and girders of wide span, as
the weight   of the structure itself (which increases   as the cubes, and the
 strength only as the squares) forms an important part of the load to which
it is subjected. On this question it is evident that the requirements of a
strain not exceeding 5 tons per square inch cannot be applied in both cases,
and the rule is therefore ambiguous as regards its application to di<U+FB01>'erent
forms of structure. In that rule, moreover, there is nothing said about the
dead weight of the bridge; and we are not informed whether the breaking
weight is to be so many times the applied weight plus the multiple of the
load, or, in other words, whether it includes or is exclusive of the weight
of the bridge itself.
   These data are wanting in the railway instructions; and until some <U+FB01>xed
principle of construction is determined upon, accompanied by a standard
measure  of strength, it is in vain to look for any satisfactory results in the
erection of road and railway bridges composed entirely of wrought iron.
   The author was led to inquire into this subject with more than ordinary
care, not only on account of the imperfect state of our knowledge, but from
the want of de<U+FB01>nite instructions.   In the following experimental researches
he has endeavoured to ascertain the extent to which a bridge or girder of
wrought iron may be strained without injury to its ultimate powers of resist
ance, or the exact amount of load to which a bridge maybe subjected with
out endangering its safety—in other words, to determine the fractional strain
of its estimated powers of resistance.
   To arrive at correct results and to imitate as nearly as possible the strain
to which bridges are subjected by the passage of heavy trains, the apparatus
specially prepared for the experiments was designed to lower the load quickly
upon the beam in the <U+FB01>rst instance, and next to produce a considerable
amount of vibration, as the large lever with its load and shackle was left
suspended upon      it,and the apparatus was su<U+FB01>iciently elastic for that
purpose.

    After the beam had thus sustained             one    million changes of load without
apparent alteration, the load was increased to 10,486 lbs., or g-ths of the
breaking-weight, and the machinery again put in motion.                         With this addi
tional weight         the de<U+FB02>ections were increased, with_a permanent                set   of '05
inch, from '23 to '35 inch, and after sustaining 5175 changes the beam broke
by tension at a short distance from the middle.                    It is satisfactory here to
observe that during the whole of the 1,005,175 changes none of the rivets
were loosened or broken.
    The beam broken in the preceding experiment was repaired by replacing
the broken angle-irons on each side, and putting a patch over the broken
plate equal in area to the plate itself.              A weight of 3 tons was placed on
the beam thus repaired, equivalent to one-fourth of the breaking-weight,
and the experiments were continued as before.

 the breaking-weight upon bridges of this description, as, according to the
last experiment, the beam broke with 313,000 changes ; or a period of eight
years, at the same rate as before, would be sufficient to break it. It is more
than probable that the beam had been injured by the previous 3,000,000
 changes to which it had been subjected; and assuming this to be true, it
 would follow that the beam was undergoing a gradual deterioration which
 must some time, however remote, have terminated in fracture.

       W. H. L. RUSSELL, A.B. Communicated by Professor CAYLEY.
       Received    July 31, 1863.
                                     (Abstract.)
    In the preceding memoirs on the Calculus of Symbols, systems have been
constructed for the multiplication and division of non-commutative symbols
subject to certain laws of combination; and these systems su<U+FB02>ice for linear
differential equations.     But when we enter upon the consideration of non
linear equations, we see at once that these methods do not apply.               It
becomes necessary to invent some fresh mode of calculation, and a new no
tation, in order to bring non-linear functions into a condition which admits
of treatment by symbolical algebra.         This is the object of the following
memoir.      Professor Boole has given, in his ‘ Treatise on Differential Equa
tions,’ a method due to M. Sarrus, by which we ascertain whether a given
non-linear function is a complete differential.      This method, as willbe seen
by anyone who will refer to Professor Boole’s treatise, is equivalent to <U+FB01>nd
ing the conditions that     a non-linear  function may be externally divisible by
the symbol    of differentiation.    In the following paper I have given a nota
tion by which    I  obtain the actual expressions for those conditions, and for
the symbolical remainders arising in the course of the division, and have
extended my investigations to ascertaining the results of the symbolical
division of non-linear functions by linear functions of the symbol of differ
entiation.

   The following pages contain a short account of some speculations on
 molecular mechanics.         They will show how far my plan of molecular

  l864.]          The Rev.   J. Bayma on Molecular Mechanics.                   127_
  mechanics has been as yet developed, and how much more is to be done
  before it reaches its proper perfection.                 I
                                               Of course can do no more than
 point out the principles on which, according to my views, this new science
  ought to be grounded.       The proofs would require a volume,—and the more
 so, as existing wide-spread philosophical prejudices will make it my duty to
 join together both demonstration and refutation.           But there will be time
 hereafter, if necessary, for a complete exposition and vindication of the
 principles on which      I rely; at present it will be enough for me to state
 them.
     The aim of “molecular mechanics” is the solution of a problem which
 includes all branches of physics, and which may be enunciated, in general
 terms, as follows     :—
     “ From    the knowledge we gain of certain properties of natural substances
 by observation and experiment, to determine the intrinsic constitution of
 these substances, and the laws according to which they ought to act and
 be acted upon      in any hypothesis whatever.”
     In  order to clear the way for the solution of this problem,     three things
 are to be done.
     First. From the known properties of bodies must be deduced the essen
 tial principles and intrinsic constitution of matter.
     Secondly. General formulas must be established for the motions of any
 kind of molecular system, which we conceive may exist in rerum natura.
  _  Tiiirdly. We must determine      as far as possible the  kinds of molecular
 systems which are suited to the different primitive bodies; and be pre
 pared to make other applications suitable for the explanation of pheno
 mena.
     Of these three things, the <U+FB01>rst, which is the very foundation of mole
 cular mechanics, can, I think, be done at once.        The second also, though
it requires a larger treatment, will not present any great di<U+FB02>iculty.          The
third, however, in this <U+FB01>rst attempt, can be but very imperfectly accom
                                                               I
plished; for sciences also have their infancy, nor am so bold as to ex
pect to be able to do what requires the labour of many:           I shall’ only say
so   much    as may su<U+FB01>ice to establish  for this science a de<U+FB01>nite existence and
a   proper form.
     In  order to give an idea  of my plan,  I will now say a few words on each
of these three points.
                  I. PRINCIPLES or     MOLECULAR      Mncnamcs.
    First, then, (to say nothing of the name of “ molecular mechanics,” which
will be justi<U+FB01>ed later,) in all bodies we <U+FB01>nd these three things, extension,
inertia, and active powers, to one or other of which every property of bodies
may be referred.        In order therefore to arrive at a clear idea of the con
stitution of natural substances, these three must be diligently investigated.
    E:vtension.—I have come to the following conclusions on this head, which,

128                 The Rev.       J.   Bayma on Molecular Mechanics.        [Feb. 11,
I think,       can be established by evident arguments        drawn from various con
siderations.
    1.   All    bodies consist     of simple and unextended elements, the sum of
which constitute          the     mass of the given body. The extension
                                 absolute
itself, or volume, of the body is nothing but the extension of the space in
cluded within the bounding surfaces of the body ; and the extension of space
is nothing but its capability of being passed through (percurribilitas) in any
direction by means of motion extending from any one point to any other.
   2. There is no such thing possible as matter materially and mathema
tically continuous—that is to say, such that its parts touch each other with
true and perfect contact.  There must be admitted indeed a continuity of
forces ready to act; but this continuity is only virtual, not actual nor
formal.
  3. Simple elements cannot be at once attractive at greater, and repulsive
at less distances. To this extent at least Boscovich’s theory must be
corrected.        If an                 at any distance, it will be so at all
                          element is attractive
distances;       and   if it     at any distance, it will be repulsive at all
                               be repulsive
distances.  This is proved from the very nature of matter, and perfectly
corresponds with the action of molecules and with universal attraction.
   4. Simple elements must not be confounded with the atoms of the chemist,
nor with the molecules of which bodies are composed.           Molecules are,
according  to their name,  small   extended masses,    e. they imply volume;
                                                              2'.
elements are indivisible points without extension. Again, molecules of what
ever kind, even those of primitive bodies, are so many systems resulting
from elements acting on each other; consequently elements differ from
molecules as parts differ from the whole; so that much may be said about
separate elements, which cannot be said of separate molecules or chemical
atoms, and vice versd.     Element, molecule, body have the same relation
to each other in the physical order, that individual, family, state bear to
each other in the social order; for        body results from molecules, and
                                                 a
molecules from elements holding togethe<U+FB02>mechanically, in        similar way to
                                                                         a
that in which     state results from families, and families from individuals
                    a
bound together by social ties.
  So much regarding extension;                 for
                                                I     do not now intend to proceed to
the demonstration          of these statements,      but simply to put down what     it   is
I   am prepared to prove.
  Inertia.—There would scarcely be any need of saying anything on this
head, were there not some, even learned men, who entertain false ideas
about     it,
          and from not rightly understanding what       said of inertia by
                                                                    is
physical philosophers, throw out ill-founded doubts, which do more harm
than good to science.     say, then,
                                I
    1.   Inertia implies two things: (a) that each element of matter    per     is
fectly indifferent to receiving motion in any direction and of any intensity
from some external agent; (6) that no element of matter can move itself
by any action of its own.

 1864.]           The Rev.       J. Bayma on Molecular Mechanics.                    129
    2.  It  follows as a sort of corollary from this, that to be inert does not
signify to be without active power; and that the very same element, which
 on account of its inertia cannot act upon itself, may, notwithstanding this
 inertia, have an active power, by which it may act upon any other element
 whatever.
    3. Inertia is an essential property of matter, and is not greater in one
 element than in another,           but is always the same in all elements, whether
 they are attractive or repulsive, whether their active power is great or
                               '
 small.
    4. That which is called by natural philosophers             the via inertia: is not a
 special mechanical force added on to the active forces of elements, but is the
 readiness of a body to react by means of its elementary forces, against any
  action tending to change the actual condition of that body.
    These four propositions will remove many false notions, which give rise to
 confusion of ideas and impede the solution of many important questions.
    Active power.—The questions relating to the active power of matter are
 of the greatest importance, since on them depends nearly the whole science
 of nature.      On this point I am convinced, and think I can prove, that
    1. No other forces exist in the elements of matter except locomotive
 or mechanical      forces;    for these alone are required, and these alone are
 suf<U+FB01>cient, to account for all natural phenomena.               So that we need have
 no anxiety      about   the vires occultze of the ancients, not need we make
 search after any other kind of primitive forces, besides such as are mecha
nical or locomotive.         Hence chemical, electric, magnetic, calori<U+FB01>c and other
 such   actions   will be  all  reduced to mechanical actions, complex indeed, but
all following certain de<U+FB01>nite laws, and capable of being expressed by mathe
matical formulae as in general mechanics.               Hence in treating of molecular
mechanics we do not make any gratuitous assumption or probable hypo
thesis, but are engaged on a branch of science founded on demonstrable
truths, free from all hypothesis or arbitrary assumption.
    2. There are not only attractive, but also repulsive elements;              and this
is the reason why molecules of bodies (as being made up of both sorts)
may at certain distances attract, and at others repel each other.
    3. Simple elements, in the whole sphere of their active power, and con
sequently also at molecular distances, act (whether by attracting or repel
ling) according to the inverse ratio of the squares of the distances. This
proposition may        seem to contradict      certain known laws, as far as regards
molecular distances ; but         the contradiction  is only apparent, and this appear
ance will vanish when we consider that the action of elements (of which
we are    now speaking) is not the same as the action of molecules. From
the fact that cohesion, e. 5]., does not follow the inverse ratio of the square
of the distance, it will certainly result that molecules do not act according
to this law, and this is what physical science teaches : but it does not fol
low that element; do not act according to the law.                 This truth is, as all
must see,     of the utmost importance, since it is the foundation of molecular

130              The Rev.   J. Bayma on Molecular Mechanics.               [Feb. 11,
mechanics,     of which it would be impossible to treat at all, unless the law
of elementary action at in<U+FB01>nitesimal distances were known. This truth
universalizes Newton’s law of celestial attraction by extending it to all
elementary action, whether attractive or repulsive, and makes it applicable
not only to telescopic, but also to microscopic distances.         It is clear there
fore that I am bound to prove this law most irrefragably, lest           I  construct
my molecular mechanics on an insecure foundation.
   4. The sphere of the activity of matter is inde<U+FB01>nite, in this sense, that
no <U+FB01>nite distance can be assigned at which the action of matter will be null
It by no means, however, follows from this that the force of matter has an
in<U+FB01>nite intensity.
    5. The natural activity of   each element     of matter is exerted immediately
on every other existing element        at  any distance, either by attracting or
repelling, according    to the  agent’s   nature.    Thus, c. g., the action which
the earth exerts on each falling drop of rain is exerted immediately by each
element    of the earth on each element of the water (notwithstanding the dis
tance between them); itis not exerted through the material medium of the
air, or of ether, or any other substance. The same must be said of the action
of the sun on the planets. This proposition, however, it is evident, holds
only for the simple action of the elements, i. e., attractive or repulsive.
For it is clear that complex actions causing vibratory motions, such as
light or sound, are only transmitted through some vibrating medium. This
conclusion is also of immense importance, because it solves aquestion much
discussed by the ancients about the nature of action exerted on a distant
body, and removes all scruples of philosophers on this head.
   6. Bodies do not and cannot act by mathematical               contact,    however
much our prejudices incline us to think the contrary; but every material
action is always exerted on something at a distance from the agent.
   7. There is another prejudice which          I  wish to remove, i. e. that one
motion    is the e<U+FB01>cient cause of another motion.          It is easily shown that
this mode of speaking, though sometimes employed by scienti<U+FB01>c men, is
incorrect, and ought to be abandoned, because it tends to the destruction
of all natural science.    Motion never causes motion, but is only a condition
affecting the agent in its manner of acting.           For all motion is caused by
some agent giving velocity     and  direction;    but the agent gives velocity and
direction by means of its own active power, which it exerts differently
according as it is found in di<U+FB02>'erent local conditions.           Now these local
conditions    of the agent may    be differently   modi<U+FB01>ed    by the movement      of
the agent itself.    The impact of bodies, the change of motion to heat, the
communication      of velocity from one body to another (always a di<U+FB02>icult
question), and other points of a like nature can only be satisfactorily
explained by this principle.
   These are the principal points that have to be discussed, de<U+FB01>ned, and
demonstrated in order that molecular mechanics may be established on
solid principles.

         II.  MATHEMATICAL         EVOLUTION      or THESE Pamcrrmus.
    After establishing principles, we must proceed to investigate the formulas
of motion and of equilibrium, <U+FB01>rst between the elements themselves, then
between the several systems of elements.           The di<U+FB01>iculties to be overcome
in establishing the principles were chie<U+FB02>y philosophical: the di<U+FB02>iculties
which occur in the present part are mathematical, and can only be over
come by labour and patience.                                         ~
    As long as we con<U+FB01>ne ourselves to two elements, the mathematical for
mula expressing their motion is easily found. Thus, if there are two attrac
tive elements of equal intensity, and if v be the action of one for a unit of
distance in a unit of time, 2a the distance between them at the beginning
of motion, .1: the space passed through by one in the time t, the equation
of motion will be
               t=                                    tang =
                   \/?('\/.z(a—a:)+a.arc
And since it is clear, from other considerations, that these two elements
must vibrate together inde<U+FB01>nitely in vibrations of equal times and constant
extent, the time of one oscillation will easily be found from the above
formula.
    If the two attractive  elements have unequal forces, or if one be attractive
and the other repulsive, or both repulsive, the equation of motion may easily
be obtained.
    But when we have to do with         a more complex system     of elements, after
obtaining the diiferential equations corresponding to the nature of the
system, it is scarcely possible to obtain their integration, as will appear
from the examples which        I  shall give below.    Consequently, if we wish to
deduce anything from such equations, we must proceed indirectly, and a
long labour must be undertaken, sometimes with but slender results.             This
material di<U+FB01>iculty will be diminished, or perhaps disappear, either by some
new method of integration (which           I can scarcely dare to hope for, though
it is a great desideratum)     or  by  certain tables exhibiting series of numerical
values belonging to different systems.
    But there occurs another di<U+FB02>iculty in these systems. For since the
agglomerations of simple elements can be arranged in an in<U+FB01>nite variety,
and   it would   be neither   reasonable nor possible to treat of all such agglo
 merations, we must limit the number of them according to the scope we
 have  in view, i.  e. according   to the use they may be of in explaining natural
 phenomena.       Even this is a very difficult matter.         I
                                                          How have endeavoured
 to overcome this difficulty     I will brie<U+FB02>y explain.
            I
    First. considered that the molecules of primitive bodies, such as oxygen,
 hydrogen, nitrogen, &c., cannot reasonably be supposed to be z'rregular--           .
 a conclusion    which, 'though     I  cannot rigorously demonstrate, yet     I  can
 render probable by good reasons.           Consequently, while treating of primi
 tive systems   I may con<U+FB01>ne myself to the examen of forms that are regular.

  132                 The Rev.      J.  Bayma on Molecular Mechanics.              [Feb. 11,
      Secondly.      I divided    these regular systems into different classes according
  to their geometrical <U+FB01>gure.                          I
                                           Of these have investigated the tetrahedric,
  octahedric,      hexahedric,     octohexahedric,     pentagonal-dodecahedric, and icosa
  lredric.
      I then     divided     these classes     into different species, viz. pure centratm,
  centro-nucleatze, cenlro-binucleatar,            centro-trinucleatw,  &c., also into acen
  tratw (without centre), truncatze, &c. To enumerate the whole would take
  too long ; indeed         I  only mention these to show how in such a multiplicity
  of systems      I endeavoured        to introduce the order necessary for me to be able
  to speak distinctly about them.
      Lastly, besides classes and species, it was requisite also to consider cer
  tain distinct varieties under the same species. And in this way seemed           I
  to myself to have embraced all the regular                  systems  of elements possibly
  conceivable.
      Thirdly. The several parts of which any system of elements can consist
  are reduced by me to a centre, nuclei to any number, and an external enve
 lope. And thus           I   obtained not only a method of nomenclature for the dif
 ferent systems (a most important point), but also a method of exhibiting
 each system under brief and intelligible symbols.                   Thus, e. g., the tetra
 hedric     system pure centratum                 e. without any nucleus), in which the
 centre is an attractive         element,    and  the four elements of the envelope repul
 sive, will be represented thus,
                                            m=A+4R,
 in which expression m signi<U+FB01>es the absolute mass of the system (in this case
 m=5), A represents the attractive centre, and 4R the four repulsive ele
 ments of the envelope.               The letters A and R are not quantities, but only
 indices denoting the nature of the action.
     In  a  similar way, the following expression
                                         m=R+6A+8R'
denotes a system whose                centre R is repulsive,      whose single nucleus 6A
is octahedric and attractive,                  and whose envelope 8R’ is hexahedric
and repulsive: m, which, as                before,   indicates the absolute mass of the
system,      here   =15.
     This will su<U+FB01>ice to show how the different species and varieties of the
afore-mentioned          systems may be named and expressed.
              I
     Then had to <U+FB01>nd mechanical formulas for the motion or equilibrium of
the several systems; for it is only from such formulas that we can deter
mine what systems are generally possible in the molecules of bodies. Speak
ing generally, no system pure centratum, of whatever <U+FB01>gure it be, can be
admitted       in the molecules of natural bodies, whether gaseous, liquid, or
solid.
    Let   22 represent    the action of the centre, and 11: that of one of the elements
of the envelope        for   a unit of distance; and let rbe the radius of the system,

  III.  APPLICATION on THE Pnmcrrnms                 or MOLECULAR Mncasmcs.
    [Under this head the author points outthe various properties of bodies
which would have to be explained, and of which he conceives an explana
tion might be aiforded could the mathematical calculations be effected
which are required for the elaboration of his theory, and enunciates the
following conclusions       as deduced      from his explanation      of the impact of
bodies.]
    1.  If a body    does not contain any repulsive elements,       it cannot cause any
retardation    in the movement of any impinging body.
    2. Again,    if the  medium through which a body moves contain no repul
 sive elements, no retardation       of its motion can take place.
    3.  If a medium     does contain repulsive elements, retardation        must neces
 sarily take place.
    4. Consequently, as the planets in their movements through the tether
 do not suifer any loss of velocity, it must be concluded that the nether does
 not contain    any repulsive elements at all, and that its elasticity must be
 explained without any recourse to repulsive forces.
    This last inference is somewhat wonderful, and decidedly curious: but
 after much consideration it appeared to me so natural, and so well harmo
                                                                  I
 nizing with other truths and scienti<U+FB01>c theories, that ceased to hesitate
 about its adoption and gave it a most decided assent;                whether wisely or
 not, I leave others to judge.

 the Somme at Abbeville flows through a nar

 Abbeville. Three miles up this valley is the
 village of Drucat; and on the hill above the

                 a       cutting exposes section             a
of calcareous tufa or travertin several feet thick,
and containing in places numerous land shells,

                                   is
to  be worked for building-purposes.    This bed
is overlain          by

  trict, in a Slightly inclined and continuous plane rising on either side under
  the adjacent hills with a slope varying from 10 to 40 feet in the mile, the
  latter being an extreme case.       If we take a mean of 20 feet, as the gravel
  pit  is not above   one-third of  a mile from the valley, the rise in the water
  underneath would not probably exceed 10 feet above the level of the stream.
  The chalk formation is so generally <U+FB01>ssured and permeable that know of  I
  no instance of a line of water-level or of springs occurring above the ge
  neral line dependent upon the level of the adjacent rivers.        It is also well
  known that strong springs are common at the foot of the hills along many
  of our chalk valleys, as, for instance, that at Amwell, those at Carshalton,
 and many along the valley of the Thames. These springs are more or less
 calcareous, often highly so.
     It is evident that the travertin at Drucat has been formed by a deposit
 from a spring of considerable volume ; and it further appears that it <U+FB02>owed
 while the loess was in the course of formation.          For the tufa could only
 have been formed at or near the level of the spring; so that its continued
 deposit down the slope of the hill shows the spring to have been gradually
 lowered as the valley became deeper, and while subject to the continued
 inundations which deposited the loess.         The line of present water-level in
 the chalk here is about 90 feet below the summit of the bill, as proved by
 a well in an adjacent farmhouse, and at the gravel-pit they have gone down
 60 feet without reaching water.         But the level of the upper part of the
 tufa shows the line of water-level or of springs to have been at one time
 70 feet above the valley, which could only have happened when the bottom
 of the valley was on a level 60 to 70 feet higher than it now is. The gradual
 deepening of the valley is indicated by the gradual lowering of the spring
 until it reached to within from 20 to 30 feet of the present valley-level, when
it became extinct. Further, we have in the adjacent bed of high-level gravel
 evidence of the origin of this important spring; for the sands and gravel
beds are not only very thick, but they are also perfectly free from calca
reous matter and very permeable, and they show in their numerous gravel
pipes how great must have been the volume and solvent power of the rain
water which at one time percolated through them.            The water, after pass
ing through      the gravel and  acting upon   the underlying chalk to form these
large vertical cavities, would, upon reaching the original line of water-level,
have <U+FB02>owed off horizontally and escaped in a strong spring at the base of
the adjacent slope.      It there parted with its excess of the carbonate of lime,
and so formed the calcareous tufa.         This case furnishes therefore new and
good evidence on two points :—<U+FB01>rst, on the connexion of the sand- and
gravel-pipes with the percolation of fresh water through calcareous rocks;
and secondly, on the condition of the former land surface and of the springs,
only possible on the hypothesis of former higher levels of the bottom of the
valley and    of its gradual excavation.

                                      (Abstract.)
     The animals of which the retina was examined were the frog, the black
  and yellow salamander, the edible turtle, the water- and the land-tortoise,
 the Spanish Gecko, the blindworm, and the common snake.                The method
  adopted was to examine the retina (where possible) immediately after
  decapitation of the animal, alone and with chemical agents; and to make
 sections   of the retina hardened in alcohol or in an aqueous solution of
 chromic acid, staining them with iodine or carmine, and adding glycerine,
 pure and diluted, to make them transparent.           The following is a summary
 of the results of the examination.
     1. The rods and cones consist of two segments, the union of which is
 marked by a bright transverse line.
    2. Each segment consists of a membranous sheath and contents.
 E      The outer segment, or shaft, is a long narrow rectapgle (by inference,
  a prism or cylinder).    It refracts more highly than the inner segment. Its
 contents are tructureless, and of an albuminous nature.             It is that part
 which is commonly known as “ the rod.”            It is smaller in the cones than
 in the rods, and in the cones narrows slightly outwards.
    4. The outer ends of the shafts rest upon the inner surface of the
‘choroid, and their ides are separated by pigmented processes, prolonged
from the inner surface of the choroid between them to the line that marks
 the union of the shaft with the inner segment.           The e<U+FB02>'ect of this is that
the shafts    are completely insulated,   and rays entering one shaft are pre
 vented passing out of it   into neighbouring shafts.
    5. The inner segment of the rods and cones, or body (the appendage of
 some microscopists), has a generally <U+FB02>ask-shaped form, longer and more
 tapering in the rods, shorter and stouter in the cones.           It is much paler
 and less conspicuous than the shaft.       It <U+FB01>ts in an aperture in the membrana
 limitans externa.
    Its inner end always encloses, or is connected by an intermediate band
 with an outer granule which lies in or below the level of the membrana
 limitans externa.     Its outer end, in cones only, contains a spherical bead
 nearly   colourless in  the frog and blindworm, brilliantly coloured in the
  turtle and water- and land-tortoises, and absent from the common snake and
  Spanish Gecko.     In addition to this head, where present, and the outer gra

nnle, the body contains an albuminous substance which in chromic acid pre
parations retires as an opaque granular mass towards the outer end of the
body.     The inner end of the body is prolonged inwards, in the form of a
pale,   delicate <U+FB01>bre, which was sometimes followed through the layer of
inner granules into the granular layer.       It does not appear to be struc
turally connected with the inner granules.        It is essentially distinct from
Miiller’s radial <U+FB01>bres, and bears a considerable resemblance to the axis
cylinder of nerve. That it ever proceeds from the outer granule associated
with the rod- or cone-body is doubtful, from the consideration (a) that where
the body is large, and the granule lies within at some distance from its
contour, the <U+FB01>bre is seen to leave the inner end of the body distinct from
the granule, and ([3) that the <U+FB01>bre appears to proceed from the .o11t61‘
granule only where the body is small, as in the frog, and where the
 granule does not lie within the body but is joined to this by a band.
 Ritter’s axial <U+FB01>bres are arti<U+FB01>cial products.
     6. The “ outer granules
                                ” are                                        Each

cell is so intimately associated with a rod- or cone-body that it forms an
integral part of it.
     7. The intergranular layer is a web of connective <U+FB01>bre.          It contains
nuclei.
    8. The inner granules are roundish, in chromic acid preparations poly
gonal cells. They differ from the outer granules by their higher refraction,
by the absence of a nucleus, and by receiving a deeper stain from carmine.
They lie in areolee of connective tissue derived from Miiller’s radial <U+FB01>bres,
and from the intergranular and granular layer.         They are more numerous
 than the outer granules, and consequently than the rods and cones.
     9. The granular layer is a very close <U+FB01>brous web derived in part from
Miiller’s radial <U+FB01>bres, and from other <U+FB01>bres proceeding from the connective
frame of the layer of inner granules.       It transmits (a) the radial <U+FB01>bres,
 (fl) <U+FB01>bres proceeding radially outwards from the ganglion-cells and bundles
of optic nerve-<U+FB01>bres, and (-y) <U+FB01>bres passing inwards from the rod- and cone
bodies.
     10. The ganglion-cells communicate by axis-cylinder-like <U+FB01>bres with the
bundles of optic nerve-<U+FB01>bres, and send similar <U+FB01>bres outwards, which have
been traced some distance in the granular layer.
     11. In the frog and Spanish Gecko the author         has a few times traced
<U+FB01>bres proceeding from the bundles of optic nerve-<U+FB01>bres for some distance
in a radial direction in the granular layer.
     12. Miiller’s radial <U+FB01>bres arise by expanded roots at the outer surface
of the membrane. limitans interna, pass radially through the layers,
contributing in their course to the granular layer, to the areolar frame of
the layer of inner granules, and end in the intergranular layer and at the
inner surface of the membrane. limitans externa. They are a connective
and not a nervous     tissue, and do not communicate       between the basilary
element and ganglion-cells.

     13. The orderly arrangement of the several layers and their elementary
parts is maintained by a frame of connective tissue which consists of
 I,  an unbroken homogeneous membrane bounding the inner surface of the
retina, the membrana limitans interua; 2, a fenestrated membrane which

    This substitution of ethyl for oxygen was effected by acting upon oxalic
ether with zincethyl.       On distilling the product with water, leucic ether
came over, which on treatment with an alkali yielded a salt of leucic acid.
    We have since found that this process may be much simpli<U+FB01>ed by gene
rating the zincethyl during the reaction, which is effected by heating a
mixture of amalgamated zinc, iodide of ethyl, and oxalic ether in equivalent
proportions to the necessary temperature.
    The operation may be considered complete when the mixture has soli
di<U+FB01>ed to a resinous-looking mass. This, treated with water as in the for
mer reaction and distilled, produces quantities of leucic ether considerably
greater than can be obtained from the same materials by the <U+FB01>rst mode of
operating.       Thus the necessity for the production of zincethyl is entirely
obviated, the whole operation proceeds at the ordinary atmospheric pressure,
and a larger productis obtained.
    We <U+FB01>nd that this process is also applicable to the homologous reactions
with the oxalates and iodides of methyl and amyl.                  By it we have obtained

numerous other acids belonging to the lactic series, which we have already
more or less perfectly studied, and the history of which we propose to lay
before the Royal Society as our researches proceed, reserving for a later
communication      our views regarding the constitution of this series of
acids, and the theoretical conclusions arrived at in the course of the inquiry.
In the present communication we will describe the application of this re
action to a mixture    of iodide of methyl and oxalate of methyl.
    Two equivalents of iodide of methyl were mixed with one of oxalate of
methyl, and placed in contact with an excess of amalgamated and granu
lated zinc in a <U+FB02>ask, to which an inverted Liebig’s condenser, provided
with a mercurial safety tube, was attached. The <U+FB02>ask was immersed during
about twenty-four hours in water maintained at a temperature gradually
rising from 70° C. to 100° C. as the reaction progressed towards com
pletion. At the end of that time the mixture had solidi<U+FB01>ed to a yellowish
gummy mass, which, on distillation with water, yielded methylic alcohol
possessing an etherial odour, but from which we could extract no cther.
The residual magma in the <U+FB02>ask, consisting of iodide of zinc, oxalate of
zinc, and the zinc-salt of a new acid, was separated from the metallic zinc
by washing with water.          It was then treated with an excess of hydrate of
baryta   and  boiled  for   a   considerable time; carbonic acid was afterwards
passed through the liquid until, on again boiling, the excess of baryta was
completely removed.        'l‘o the <U+FB01>ltered    solution recently precipitated oxide
of silver was added until all iodine was removed.           The solution separated
from the iodide of silver was again submitted to a current of carbonic acid,
boiled, and <U+FB01>ltered.      The resulting liquid, on being evaporated in the water
bath, yielded a salt crystallizing in brilliant needles possessing the peculiar
odour of fresh butter.        This salt is very soluble in water and in alcohol,
but nearly   insoluble    in   ether, and perfectly neutral to test-papers.      On
being submitted to analysis, it gave numbers closely corresponding with
the formula

the ether to evaporate spontaneously, prismatic crystals of considerable size

In  addition to the baryta-salt above mentioned, we have examined the silver
salt, which is best formed by adding oxide of silver to the free acid, heating
to boiling, and <U+FB01>ltering, when the salt is deposited in star-like masses of

   Attempts to produce an ether by digesting the free acid with absolute

only of the ether being apparently formed.
   Thus the <U+FB01>nal result of the action of zinc upon a mixture of iodide and
oxalate of methyl is perfectly homologous with that obtained by the action
of zincethyl upon oxalic ether. In the methylic reaction, however, no
compound corresponding to leucic ether was obtained.     This cannot create
surprise when  it is remembered  that dimethoxalic ether approaches closely
in composition to lactic ether, which is well known to be instantly decom
 posed by water. We have sought in vain to obviate this decomposition of
 dimethoxalic ether by adding absolute alcohol in place of water to the pro
iduct   of the reaction.                                                          »

  This paper is a continuation of a former paper “On the Joints of the
Old Red Sandstone of the Co. Waterford,” published in the ‘ Philosophical
                ’
Transactions for 1858, and contains the results of the author’s observations
for some years, in Donegal, the Mourne and Newry Mountains, Cornwall,
and Fennanagh, with deductions from; theory.
   The author establishes the existence in Waterford of a Primary Conjugate
System of Joints, and of two Secondary Conjugate Systems, lying at each
 side   of the Primary at angles of 27°      5_'   and 37° 11’,

      The carbon in No.        I.  is rather lower than that of the other three; this is
  owing to the specimen not being quite free from alumina; moreover it was

  All the specimens were prepared at diiferent times, except IV. and V.,
which are analyses of the same specimen.    The lead compound therefore
seems to approach nearly to the somewhat anomalous formula 5(C16 H5 0,)
+6PbO, being         a basic lead-salt; it is, however, perfectly analogous to the
lead compound          of purpurine, 5(C16 H5 06) +6PbO, described by Wolff
and Strecker *.
  From these analyses of the lead compound and also from the ultimate
analyses of munjistine itself, it is pretty evident that its true formula is
C16 HB   06.
   Neither sublimed munjistine nor that obtained by crystallization from
alcohol, when dried at the ordinary temperature in vacuo, loses weight at
110° C. It is not improbable, however, that the gelatinous uncrystallizable
precipitate, which separates on the cooling of boiling saturated aqueous
solutions      of munjistine, is    a hydrate.
  From        some experiments made on a considerable scale,                             I <U+FB01>nd
                                                                                            that ordinary
madder does not contain any munjistine,    In                              order to ascertain this fact, a
considerable quantity of garancine from Naples Roots, and likewise some
which had been subjected to the action of high-pressure steam according to
Pinco<U+FB01>' and Schunck’s process, were treated with boiling bisulphide of car
bon, and the product obtained on evaporating the bisulphide repeatedly
extracted with large quantities of boiling water ; the solution, when acidu
lated with sulphuric acid, gave an orange-red precipitate from which  was                              I
unable to obtain any munjistine.   Professor Stokes succeeded, however, in
detecting the presence         of alizarine, purpurine, and rubiacine in it                      1'.
   The production of phthalic acid from alizarine, purpurine, and munjistine,
together with   comparison of their subjoined formulae, indicates the very
                   a
close relationship between these three substances, the only true colouring
principles of the different species of madder with which we are acquainted.

  einnamic acid by the action of hypochlorite of lime.
                  Tinctorial power of Munjiatine and Munjeet.
     Prof. Runge stated, in 1835, that munjeet contains twice as much avail
  able colouring matter as the best Avignon madder. This result was so unex
  pected, that the Prussian Society for the Encouragement of Manufactures,
  to whom Professor     Runge’s memoir was originally addressed, referred the
  matter to three eminent German dyers, Messrs. Dannenberger, Biihm, and
  Nobiling. These gentlemen reported, as the result of numerous and carefully
  conducted experiments, that so far from munjeet being richer in colouring
  matter than ordinary madder, it contained considerably less.       This conclu
  sion has been con<U+FB01>rmed by the experience of my friend Mr. John Thom,
  of Birkacre, near Chorley, one of the most skilful of the Lancashire printers.
     From a numerous series of experiments I have just completed,          I <U+FB01>nd
  that the garancine from munjeet has about half the tinctorial power of the
 garancine made from the best madder, viz. Naples Roots. These, however,
 yield only about 30 to 33 per cent. of garancine, while munjeet, according
 to my friend Mr. Higgin, of Manchester, yields from 52 to 55 per cent.
 Taking the present prices therefore of madder at 36 shillings per cwt., and
 munjeet at 30 shillings, it will be found that there will be scarcely any
 pecuniary advantage in using munjeet for ordinary madder-dyeing.            The
 colours from munjeet are certainly brighter, but not so durable as those
 from madder, owing to the substitution of purpurine for alizarine.        There
 is, however, great reason to believe that some of the Turkey-red dyers are
 employing garancine from munjeet to a considerable extent. When this is
 the case they'_evidently sacri<U+FB01>ce fastness to brilliancy of colour. By treating
 such a garancine with boiling water, and precipitating by an acid in the
way already described, its sophistication with munjeet may very readily be
detected.    The actual amount of colouring matter in munjeet and the best
madder is very nearly the same;       but the inferiority of munjeet as a dye
stuff results from its containing only the comparatively feeble colouring
matters, purpurine and munjistine, only a small portion of the latter being
useful, whilst the presence of munjistine in large quantity appears to be
positively injurious.     So much is this the case, that when the greater part
of the munjistine is removed from munjeet-garancine by boiling water, it
yields much richer shades with alumina mordants than before.

dyeing vegetable fabrics mordanted with alumina.              If, however, strong
ammonia be employed      to  dissolve the  purpurine,   considerable   heat is pro
duced—-a rise of temperature of as much as 20° C. taking place if the
bulb  of a thermometer    be immersed    in <U+FB01>nely divided purpurine and strong
ammonia poured on it.
   The purpurine employed in these experiments was prepared by Kopp’s
process, and I am indebted for it to my friend Professor Grace Calvert.
   The solution of the new substance, purpureine, is <U+FB01>ltered to separate dust,
&c., as well as a black substance insoluble in dilute ammonia; it is then
added to a considerable quantity of dilute sulphuric acid, boiled fora short
time, and allowed to cool.      When cold, the impure purpureine is collected
on a <U+FB01>lter, well washed, and dissolved in a small quantity of hot alcohol.
The spirituous solution is again <U+FB01>ltered into a quantity of very dilute boil
ing sulphuric acid, about  1 part acid to from 50 to 100 of water; when cold,
the precipitate is collected and again well washed.§ A crystallization out of
boiling very dilute acid now renders it quite pure.          This somewhat long
and tedious process is necessary to free it from an uncrystallizable black
substance, a part of which is separated when the crude purpureine is dis
solved in alcohol, and a part is left behind at the last crystallization.
   This compound being in its mode of formation and physical properties
very analogous to orceine, I have called it purpureine.          When crystallized
by the spontaneous evaporation of its alcoholic solution, or from boiling
dilute sulphuric acid under peculiar conditions of aggregation, it presents a
<U+FB01>ne iridescent green colour by re<U+FB02>ected light; whilst under the microscope
it appears as <U+FB01>ne long needles of a very deep crimson colour. As obtained
by the process above described, it has, however, but little of the iridescent
appearance, being of a brownish-red colour with a faint tinge of green.            It
is almost insoluble in cold dilute acids, and is in great part precipitated from
its aqueous solution by common salt, thus greatly resembling orceine.              It
is almost insoluble in bisulphide of carbon, very slightly so both in ether and
in cold water, much more so in hot, and very soluble in spirit both hot and
cold and in water rendered slightly alkaline.    It isfreadily  soluble in cold con
centrated sulphuric acid, and is precipitated     unaltered by water; on heat
ing, however, it is destroyed.
   Its aqueous solution gives a deep-red precipitate with chloride of zinc;
with chloride of mercury a purple gelatinous precipitate; and with nitrate
of silver a precipitate of a very dark brown colour slightly soluble in am
monia. I have been favoured with the following optical examination by
Professor Stokes :
   “ Its solutions show bands of absorption just like purpurine in character,
but in some cases considerably diferent in position. The etherial and
acidulated (acetic acid) alcoholic solutions show this strongly. The tint is so
different in purpurine and its derivative, that the intimate connexion revealed
by the prism would be lost by the eye. A drawing of the spectrum for pur
purine would serve for its derivative (purpureine), if the bands were simply
pushed a good deal nearer the red end.”

 it is quite insoluble in water, ether, and bisulphide of carbon, and very
 slightly soluble in spirit, but soluble in hot moderately strong nitric acid,
 from which it separates on standing for a considerable time.                   If boiled with
 strong nitric acid, it is slowly decomposed.                 When heated, it de<U+FB02>agrates:
 from this      circumstance,    and considering its mode of formation, it is evidently
 a nitro-substitution compound ; I have therefore called it nitropurpureine.
     Owing to the small quantity which I have hitherto been able to procure,
 I have not yet determined the composition of this beautiful body, which is
 <U+FB01>ner in appearance than any of the derivatives from madder I have as yet
 met with.
                              Action   of Ammonia     on Alizarine.
    The alizarine which was employed for the subjoined experiments was
 obtained by extracting Professor E. K0pp’s so-called green alizarine* with
 bisulphide of carbon. It yields only about 15 per cent. of orange-red ali
 zarine. This was crystallized three times out of spirit, from which it usually
 separates as a deep-orange-coloured crystalline powder. Unfortunately this
 alizarineistill contains a quantity of purpurine, from which it is impossible
 to purify       it either by crystallization or sublimation.            Accordingly, when
 treated      with   ammonia      by   the  method     already   described    for purpurine,
 while it yields a substance analogous to purpureine, the product is impure,
 being contaminated with purpureine,               This mixture has been examined by
 my    friend    Professor   Stokes,   who  <U+FB01>nds   that   it contains purpureine, derived
 from the purpurine present as an impurity in the alizarine employed, and
 another substance very like alizarine in its optical properties, probably
 a new substance (alizareine), bearing              the same relation       to alizarine   that

 it would be almost certain priori that his ‘ green alizarine ’ would contain
                                   12
 purpurine, and the two would be dissolved by bisulphide of carbon, and
 might very well afterwards be associated by being deposited in intermingled
 crystals, if not actually crystallizing together.”
                            Action  of Ammonia      on  Munjistine.
     This reaction with munjistine was only tried on                 a very small scale,    but
 the results were by no means satisfactory.              The munjistine was completely
 destroyed,     the   greater part being changed into a brown humus-like sub
 stance, insoluble in am_monia,—the remainder forming a colouring-sub
 stance, analogous to purpureine, but not crystalline.                 It dyed unmordanted
                                                                                         '

     The combined action of ammonia and oxygen, therefore, on the three
 colouring-substances_ alizarine, purpurine, and                munjistine,     is to change
 them from adjective to substantive dye-stuifs.                 I  think it not improbable
 that if this archilizing process were applied to various other colouring mat
 ters, they would be found capable of undergoing similar transformations.
                               Action  of Bromine on Alizarine.
      A  boiling saturated solution of alizarine in alcohol is mixed with about
  six or eight parts of distilled water, and to this when cold about one or one
  and a half parts of bromine water are added, when a bright yellow amor»
  phous precipitate is produced.           After standing twelve or sixteen hours, the
  solution is <U+FB01>ltered ; and if the clear <U+FB01>ltrate be now carefully heated so as to
  expel the spirit, a substance of a deep orange-colour is deposited, consisting
  of very <U+FB01>ne needles, which are contaminated with a mall quantity of resin
  if a  great excess of bromine has been employed.                These needles are soluble
  in   spirit and    ether,  insoluble  in water,   and   soluble   in bisulphide of carbon,
  from which they crystallize           by spontaneous evaporation, in dark-brown
  nodules.     With soda they give the same purple colour as alizarine. They
  dye    cloth mordanted with alumina a dingy brownish red, very different
  from the colour produced by ordinary crystallized alizarine.                    The follow

                 ‘

  had been made by Schiitzenberger and A. Paraf. The product of one preparation which
   they obtained, and to which they have given the name of alizarinamizl, yielded a formula
   C40 H15 N01,, and another preparation gave the formula 08,, H” N, 024, both being, when
   dry, nearly black amorphous substances.      lt appears, therefore, from the results of MM.
   Schiitzenberger and Paraf's experiments, that these gentlemen were not more successful
   in obtaining a pure product from the action of ammonia on alizarine than I have been.

 I  was for some time inclined to think that it might be a mixture               of bromi
 nated alizarine with free alizarine; but as all the six samples analyzed were
 prepared at different times, it is highly improbable that such uniform analy
 tical results could be obtained         if they  were from a mere admixture       of sub
 stances.     The existence of         a   brominated     compound    is   also con<U+FB01>rmed

                           Action ofBr0mine on Purpurine.
    When pure purpurine is dissolved in spirit mixed with a considerable
 quantity of water, and an aqueous solution of bromine added, as in the
 case of alizarine, a yellow amorphous precipitate is produced.               The solution
 separated from this by <U+FB01>ltration, when heated to expel the spirit, gives no
precipitate whilst hot; but on cooling, a very small quantity of a brown
resinous powder is deposited.             From this it is evident that the presence of
a small quantity of purpurine in alizarine will not interfere with the pro
duction    of pure brominated alizarine, if the precaution be taken to collect it
from the solution whilst it is still hot.
    I think   it right to state that the experiments and analyses detailed in the
preceding paper have been performed by my assistant, Mr. Charles
Edward Groves.          I cannot conclude this paper without again acknowledg
ing   the  essential  services  I  have received from Professor Stokes, who kindly
submitted the different products obtained by me to optical examination.

   In  order to obtain the spectra of the elementary bodies, we may employ
either <U+FB02>ame or the electric current. The former is the more easily managed,
but its temperature is for the most part too low to volatilize the body to be

  154              Drs. Pliicker and Hittorf on the Spectra of              [Main 3,
  examined, or,   if it be volatilized or already in the state of gas, to exhibit its
  characteristic lines.     In most cases it is only the electric current that is
  <U+FB01>tted to produce these lines ; and the current furnished by a powerful in
  duction coil was what the authors generally employed.
      In the application of the current, di<U+FB01>'erent cases may arise. The body to
  be examined may be either in the state of gas, or capable of being vola
  tilized at a moderate temperature, such as glass will bear without softening,‘
  or its volatilization may require a temperature still higher.
      In the <U+FB01>rst two cases the body is enclosed in a blown-glass vessel con
  sisting of two bulbs, with platinum wires for electrodes, connected by a
  capillary tube. In the case of a gas, the vessel is exhausted by means of
  Geissler’s exhauster, and <U+FB01>lled with the gas at a suitable tension.          In the
  case of a solid easily volatilized,      a portion is introduced into the vessel,
  which is then exhausted as highly as possible, and the substance is heated
  by a lamp at the time of the observation.            In the third case the electric
  current is employed at the same time for volatilizing the body and render
  ing its vapour luminous.         If  the body be a conductor, the electrodes are
  formed of it ; but the spectrum observed exhibits not only the lines due to
  the body to be examined, but also those which depend on the interposed gas.
  This inconvenience is partly remedied by using hydrogen for the interposed
  gas, as its spectrum under these circumstances approaches to a continuous
   one.    If the body to be examined be a non-conductor, the metallic elec
   trodes are covered with it. In this case the spectrum observed contains the
  lines due to the metal of which the electrodes are formed, and to the inter
   posed gas, as well as those due to the substance to be examined.
       Among the substances examined, the authors commence with nitrogen,
   which <U+FB01>rst revealed to them the existence of two spectra belonging to the
   same substance.       The phenomena presented by nitrogen are described in
   detail, which permits a shorter description to su<U+FB02>ice for the other bodies
                                                                                      '
   examined.
       On sending through a capillary tube containing nitrogen, at a pressure of
   from 40 to 80 millimetres, the direct discharge of a powerful Ruhmkor<U+FB01>” s
   coil, a spectrum is obtained consisting, both in its more and in its less re
-
   frangible part, of a series of bright shaded bands : the middle part of the
   spectrum is usually less marked.          In each of the two parts referred to, the
   bands are formed on the same type; but the type in the less refrangible
   part of the spectrum is quite different from that in the more refrangible.       In
   the latter case the bands have a channeled appearance, an effect which is
   produced by a shading, the intensity of which decreases from the more to
   the less refracted part of each band.         In a su<U+FB02>iciently pure and magni<U+FB01>ed
   spectrum,   a small  bright line is  observed  between the neighbouring channels,
   and the shading is resolved into dark lines, which are nearly equidistant,
   while their darkness decreases towards the least refracted limitof each
   band.     With a similar power the bands in the less refrangible part of
   the spectrum are also seen to be traversed by <U+FB01>ne dark lines, the arrange

ment     of which, however, while similar for the diiierent hands, is quite
 different from that observed in the channeled spaces belonging to the more
                                         '
 refrangible region.
    If, instead of sending the direct discharge of the induction coil through
 the capillary tube containing nitrogen, a Leyden jar be interposed in the
 secondary circuit in the usual way, the spectrum obtained is totally differ
 ent.    Instead of shaded bands, we have now a spectrum consisting of bril
 liant lines having no apparent relation whatsoever to the bands before
 observed.     If the  nitrogen employed contains a slight admixture of oxygen,
 the bright lines due to oxygen are seen as well as those due to nitrogen,
 whereas in the former spectrum a slight admixture of oxygen produced no
 apparent e<U+FB01>'ect.
  '
    The different appearance of the bands in the more and in the less refracted
 portion of the spectrum <U+FB01>rst mentioned suggested to the authors that it
 was really composed of twospectra, which possibly might admit of being sepa
 rated.    This the authors succeeded in effecting by using a somewhat wider
 tube.     Sent through this tube, the direct discharge gave a golden-coloured
 light, which was resolved by the prism into the shaded bands belonging to
 the less refrangible part of the spectrum, whereas with           a small  jar inter
 posed the light was blue, and was resolved by the prism into the channeled
 spaces belonging to the more refrangible part.                                       .
     By increasing the density of the gas and at the same time the power 0
 the current, or else, in case the gas be less dense, by inter-posing in the
 secondary circuit at the same time a Leyden jar and a stratum of air, the
  authors   obtained    lines  of dazzling brilliaucy which were no longer well
  de<U+FB01>ned, but had become of appreciable breadth, while at the same time
  other lines, previously too faint to be seen, made their appearance.            The
 number of these lines, however, is not unlimited.              By the expansion of
  some   of the lines, especially the brighter       ones, the spectrum    tended to
                                                                                      "
 become continuous.
    Those spectra which         are  composed   of rather broad bands, which show
 di<U+FB02>'erent appearances according as they are di<U+FB01>'erently shaded by <U+FB01>ne dark
lines, the authors generally call spectra of the <U+FB01>rst order, while those
 spectra which show brilliant coloured lines on a more or less dark ground
they call spectra of the second order.
     Incandescent   nitrogen accordingly exhibits two spectra of the <U+FB01>rst, and
  one of the second order.        The temperature produced by the passage of an
‘electric current increases with the quantity of electricity which passes, and
for a given quantity with the suddenness of the passage. When the tem
 perature    produced by the discharge is comparatively low, incandescent
nitrogen emits a golden-coloured light, which is resolved by the prism into
shaded bands occupying chie<U+FB02>y the less refrangible part of the spectrum.
At a higher temperature the light is blue, and is resolved by the prism into
channeled bands <U+FB01>lling the more refrangible            part of the spectrum.     At   a
still higher temperature         the   spectrum   consists mainly of bright     11111’-.8,
                                                                      N 2

which at the highest attainable temperature begin to expand,          so  that the
spectrum tends to become continuous.
   The authors think it probable that the three different spectra of the
emitted light depend upon three allotropic states which nitrogen assumes
at different temperatures.
   By similar methods the authors        obtained   two different spectra of sul
phur, one of    the <U+FB01>rst and one  of the second order. The spectrum of the
<U+FB01>rst order exhibited channeled spaces, like one of the two spectra of that
order of nitrogen; but the direction in which the depth of shading in
creased was the reverse of what was observed with nitrogen, the darker
side of each channeled space being in the case of sulphur directed towards
the red end of the spectrum.
   Selenium, like sulphur, shows two spectra, one of the <U+FB01>rst and one        of the
second order.
   Incandescent     carbon,  even  in  a state   of the <U+FB01>nest division,    gives  a
continuous     spectrum.    Among the gases which by their decomposition,
whether in <U+FB02>ame or in the electric current, give the spectrum of carbon,
the authors describe particularly the spectra of cyanogen and ole<U+FB01>ant gas
when burnt with oxygen or with air, and of carbonic oxide, carbonic acid,
marsh-gas, ole<U+FB01>ant gas, and methyl rendered incandescent by the electric
discharge; they likewise describe the spectrum of the electric discharge
between electrodes of carbon in an atmosphere of hydrogen. The spectrum
of carbon examined under these various conditions showed great varieties,
but all the different types observed were represented, more or less com
pletely, in the spectrum of cyanogen fed with oxygen.          The authors think
it possible that certain bands, not due to nitrogen, seen in the <U+FB02>ame of
cyanogen, and not in any other compound of carbon, may have been due
to the undecomposed gas.             -    . -
   The spectrum of hydrogen, as obtained by a small Ruhmkor<U+FB02>"s coil,
exhibited chie<U+FB02>y three bright lines.        With the large coil employed by the
authors, the lines slightly and unequally expanded;           On interposing the
Leyden jar, and using gas of a somewhat higher pressure, the spectrum
was transformed      into a continuous one, with a red line at one extremity,
while at a still higher pressure this red line expanded into a band.
   The authors also observed a new hydrogen spectrum, corresponding to
a lower temperature, but having no resemblance at all to the spectra of the
<U+FB01>rst order of nitrogen, sulphur, &c.                                ,
   Oxygen gave only a spectrum of the second order, the different lines of
which, however, expanded under certain circumstances into narrow bands,
but very di<U+FB02>'erently in different parts of the spectrum.
   Phosphorus, when treated like sulphur, gave only           a spectrum    of the
second order.
   Chlorine, bromine, and iodine, when examined by the electric discharge,
gave only spectra of the second order, in which no two of the numerous
spectral   lines belonging   to the three                                      The
                                              substances were coincident.

authors were desirous of examining whether iodine would give a spectrum
of the <U+FB01>rst order the reverse of the absorption-spectrum at ordinary tem
peratures.    The vapour of iodine in an oxyhydrogen jet gave, indeed, a
spectrum of the <U+FB01>rst order, but it did not agree with what theory might
                                                                     ~

    In the electric discharge, arsenic and mercury gave only spectra of the
second order.      The metals of the alkalies sodium, potassium, lithium,
thallium show, even at the lower temperature of Bunsen’s lamp, spectra of
the second order.
    Barium, strontium, calcium in the <U+FB02>ame of Bunsen’s lamp show bands
like spectra of the <U+FB01>rst order, and in each case a well-de<U+FB01>ned line-like
spectra of the second order.      On introducing chloride of barium into an
oxyhydrogen jet,     the  shading of the bands was resolved into <U+FB01>ne dark
lines, proving that the band-spectrum of barium is in every respect a
spectrum    of the <U+FB01>rst order.
    Spectra of the <U+FB01>rst order were observed in the case  of only a few of the
heavy metals, among which may be particularly mentioned lead, which,
when its chloride, bromide, iodide, or oxide was introduced into an oxy
hydrogen jet, gave a spectrum with bands which had a channeled appear
ance in consequence of a shading by <U+FB01>ne dark lines.
    Chloride, bromide, and iodide of copper gave in a Bunsen’s lamp, or the
 oxyhydrogen jet, spectra with bands, and besides a few bright lines.    The
bands in the three cases were not quite the same, but differed from one
 another by additional bands.     Manganese showed a curious spectrum of
 the <U+FB01>rst order.    When an induction discharge passed between electrodes
 of copper or of manganese, pure spectra of these metals, of the second
 order, were obtained.

 the investigation of the in<U+FB02>uence of certain physical agencies, viz. simple

  The paper commences with a description of the apparatus employed,
and the method followed in conducting the inquiry; and the details of the
several experiments are then given.  The following is a brief statement of
                                                                              '

      The experiments on di<U+FB02>"usion showed that venous blood not only
     1.
yields a much greater amount of carbonic acid than arterial blood, but
also absorbs and combines with a larger proportion of oxygen.
   2. Motion of the blood was found to increase the chemical changes
arising from the mutual action of the blood and the respiratory gases.
   3. The results of the experiment on the in<U+FB02>uence of time led to the con
clusion that the blood and air reciprocally act on each other in the same
way out of the body as they do within                 it,
                                          and that their action     not in        is
stantaneous, but gradual.                                                    ,

change of the respiratory gases depends.    The higher the temperature up
to that of 38° C. (the animal heat), the more rapid and more effectual were
the respiratory changes; whereas     temperature of 0° C. was found totally
                                               a
to arrest them.
     5.The in<U+FB02>uence of age on the blood was found to be very marked, espe
cially on its relation to oxygen. The older and the more putrid the blood
becomes, the greater     the amount of oxygen that disappears from the air;
                                 is
and although at the same time the exhalation of carbonic acid progressively
increases with the age of the blood, yet its proportion   exceedingly small‘

when compared with the large amount of oxygen absorbed.
   6. The average amount of urea in fresh sheep’s blood was ascertained to
be  0559 per cent., and its disappearance from the blood during the putre
factive process was very gradual, there being as much as 0387 per cent. in
blood after    was 304 hours old.

mineral substances.
     1.The effect of snake-poison was found to be an acceleration of the
transformations and decompositions occurring in blood, upon which the
absorption of oxygen and the exhalation of carbonic acid depend.
    2. The presence of an abnormal amount of uric acid in blood was also
found to hasten the chemical changes upon which the absorption of oxygen
and exhalation of carbonic acid depend.

respiratory changes produced in atmospheric air by blood. _

  4. The in<U+FB02>uence of hydrocyanic acid was studied both upon ox-blood
and human blood, and found to be the same in each case, namely, to
arrest respiratory changes.
 -
   5. Nicotine was also found to diminish the power of the blood either to
take up oxygen or give off carbonic acid gas and thereby become <U+FB01>tted for
the purposes of nutrition.
   6. The effect of woorara poison, both on the blood in the body and out
of   it,
      was ascertained to be in some respects similar to that of snake-poison,
namely, to increase the chemical decompositions and transformations upon
which the exhalation of carbonic acid depends; but differed in retarding,
instead of hastening, the oxidation of the constituents of the blood.
 '
      -Antiar poison and aconite were found to act alike, inasmuch as both
     7.
of them hastened oxidation and retarded the changes upon which the
exhalation of carbonic acid depends; in both respects offering a striking
contrast to woorara poison, which, as has just been said, diminishes oxidw
tion and increases the exhalation of carbonic acid.
   8. The effect of strychnine on the blood, both in and out of the body,
was studied, and found to be in both cases identical, namely, like some of
the other substances previously mentioned, to arrest respiratory changes.
Moreover, in one experiment in which the 'air expired from the lungs of an
animal dying from the effects of the poison was examined,          was ascer                it
tained that the arrest in the interchange of the gases took place before the
animal was dead.
     9. Brucine acts in               a    similar manner   as strychnine,   but in         a    much less
marked degree.
     10.    Quinine also           possesses the power      of retarding oxidation of the blood,
as   well   as the elimination           of carbonic acid gas.
     11. Morphine has               a  more powerful effect in diminishing the exhalation
of carbonic acid gas,                 as well as the chemical changes upon which the
absorption of oxygen                  by
                           blood depends.
     Under this head the effects of anaesthetics                upon blood are next detailed;

described       :--If

chloroform be employed in this experiment, the paint-like mass will he
found to be composed in greater part of the crystals just spoken of; the
crystals in this case being both larger and <U+FB01>ner than when healthy blood                                is
employed.     Chloroform only partially destroys the blood-corpuscles.      Its
chemical action      to diminish the power of the constituents
                             is                                of the blood  to
unite with oxygen and give 01? carbonic acid.

     The action of sulphuric ether upon blood dilfers in many respects from
 that of chloroform.         In the <U+FB01>rst place, ether has a powerful effect inde
 stroying the blood-corpuscles, dissolving the cell-walls and setting the
 contents free.       In the second place, ether prevents the blood from assum
 ing   an arterial   tint when agitated with air.      The higher the percentage of
 the agent, the more marked the effect.            In the third place, ether neither
 diminishes the absorption of oxygen nor the exhalation of carbonic acid by
 blood; and lastly, it has a much more powerful e<U+FB01>'ect in causing the con
 stituents of the blood to crystallize.      For example, if an equal part of ether
 be added to the blood        of a dog poisoned     by the inhalation  of chloroform,
 as the ether evaporates groups        of large needle-shaped crystals are formed.
 Under the microscope the crystals           are found to be of a red colour and
 prismatic shape.
     Alcohol acts upon blood somewhat like chloroform; it arrests the che
 mical changes, but in a less marked degree.
     Amylene was found to act like ether upon blood, in so far as it did not
 diminish     the absorption of oxygen or retard the elimination of carbonic
 acid.    It   differed, however, from ether in not destroying the blood-cor
puscles.
     In the last place, the action of mineral substances is stated, viz.     :—
     1. Corrosive      sublimate was found to increase the chemical           changes
which develope carbonic acid, and to have scarcely any            e<U+FB02>iect on those de
pending upon oxidation         ; its in<U+FB02>uence,   if any, is rather to diminish them
than otherwise.
    2. Arsenic seems to retard both the oxidation of the constituents of the
blood and the exhalation of carbonic acid.
    3. Tartrate of antimony increases the exhalation of carbonic             acid gas,
while it at the same time diminishes the absorption of oxygen.
    4. Sulphate of zinc and sulphate of copper both act like tartrate of
antimony, but not nearly so powerfully.
    Lastly, phosphoric acid was found to have the effect of increasing the
chemical     transformations     and decompositions      upon which the exhalation
of carbonic acid depends.

    Considered broadly, two substances, or two forms of substance, occupy
 the universe—the ordinary and tangible matter of that universe, and the

intangible and mysterious ether in which that matter is immersed.            The
natural philosophy of the future must mainly consist in the examination of
the relations of these two substances.        The hope of being able to come
closer to the origin of the ethereal waves, to get some experimental hold of
the molecules whence issue the undulations     of light and heat, has stimulated
the author in the labours which have occupied him for the last <U+FB01>ve years,
and it is this hope, rather than the desire to multiply the facts already
known regarding the action of radiant heat, which prompted his present
investigation.
   He had already shown the enormous           differences which exist between
gaseous bodies, as regards both their power of absorbing and emitting
radiant heat. When a gas is condensed to a liquid, or a liquid congealed
to a solid, the molecules coalesce, and grapple with each other, by forces
which were insensible as long as the gaseous state was maintained.           But
though the molecules are thus drawn together, the ether still surrounds
them: hence, if the acts of radiation and absorption depend on the indi
vidual molecules, they will assert their power even after their state of
aggregation has been changed.       If, on the contrary, their mutual entangle
ment by the force of cohesion be of paramount in<U+FB02>uence in the interception
and emission of radiant heat, then we may expect that liquids will exhibit a
deportment towards radiant heat altogether different from that of the vapour
from which they are derived.
   The <U+FB01>rst part of the present inquiry is devoted to an exhaustive examina
tion of this question.     The author employed twelve different liquids, and
operated upon <U+FB01>ve different layers of each, which varied in thickness
from 0'02 of an inch to 0'27 of an inch.          The liquids were enclosed, not
in glass vessels, which would have materially modi<U+FB01>ed the heat, but between
plates of transparent rock-salt, which but slightly affected the radiation.
His source of heat throughout these comparative experiments consisted of
a spiral of platinum wire, raised to incandescence by an electric current of
unvarying strength.      The quantities of radiant heat absorbed and trans
mitted by   each  of the liquids at the respective thicknesses were <U+FB01>rst deter
mined; the vapours of these liquids were subsequently examined, the
quantities of vapour employed being proportional to the quantities of liquid
traversed by the radiant heat.     The result of the comparison was that, for
heat of the same quality, the order of absorption of liquids and that of
their vapours are identical. There was no exception to this law ; so that, to
determine    the position of a vapour as an absorber or radiator, it is only
necessary to determine the position of its liquid.
   This result proves that the state of aggregation, as far, at all events, as
the liquid stage is concerned, is of altogether subordinate moment—a con
clusion which will probably prove to be of cardinal moment in molecular
physics. On one important and contested point it has a special bearing.        If
the position of a liquid as an absorber and radiator determine that of its

 162      Prof. T'yndall—Contribu¢i0ns         10 Molecular  P~lt](8;'cs*,'l [Mar.  17!,
 vapour, the position     of water <U+FB01>xes that of aqueous vapour. Water- had
 been compared with other liquids in a multitude of experiments, and it was
 found that as a radiant and as an absorbent it transcends them all. Thus,
 for example, a layer of bisulphide of carbon, 0'02 of an inch in thickness,
 absorbs 6 per cent., and allows 94 per cent. of the radiation from the red
 hot platinum spiral to pass through it ; benzol absorbs 43, and transmits
 57 per cent. of the same radiation ; alcohol absorbs 67, and transmits 33
 per cent., and it stands at the head of all liquids except_one in point of
 power as an absorber.       The exception is water. A layer of this substance,
 of the thickness above given, absorbs 81 per cent., and permits only 19 per
 cent. of the radiation to pass through it.        Had no single experiment ever
 been made upon the vapour        of water, we might infer with certainty from the
 deportment     of the liquid,  that weight  for weight this vapour transcends all
                                                                                   '
 othersin its power of absorbing and emitting radiant heat.
    The relation of absorption and radiation to the chemical constitution of
 the radiant and absorbent substances was next brie<U+FB02>y considered.
    For the <U+FB01>rst six substances in the list of those examined, the radiant
 and absorbent powers augment as the number of atoms in the compound
 molecule augments.        Thus, bisulphide of carbon has 3 atoms, chloroform
 5, iodide of ethyl 8, benzol 12, and amylene 15 atoms in their respective
 molecules; and the order of their powers as radiants and absorbents is
 that here indicated-bisulphide of carbon being the feeblest, and amylene
 the strongest of the six.       Alcohol, however, excels benzol as an absorber,
 though   it  has  but  9 atoms    in its molecule; but, on the other hand, its
 molecule is rendered more complex than that of benzol by the introduc
 tion of a new element. Benzol contains carbon and hydrogen, while alco
 hol contains carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen.             Thus, not only does the
idea of multitude come into play in absorption and radiation, that of com
plexity must also be taken into account.          The author directed the parti
 cular attention of chemists to the molecule of water; the deportment of
this substance towards radiant heat being perfectly anomalous, if the che
mical formula at present ascribed to it be correct.
    Sir William Herschel made the important discovery that beyond the
limits of the red end of the solar spectrum, rays of high heating power
exist which are incompetent to excite vision.          The author has examined
the deportment of those rays towards certain bodies which are perfectly
opaque to light.        Dissolving iodine in the bisulphide of carbon, he ob
tained a solution    which   entirely intercepted the light of the most brilliant
<U+FB02>ames, while to the extra-red rays of the spectrum the same iodine was
found to be perfectly diathermic.           The transparent bisulphide, which is
highly pervious     to the  heat  here  employed, exercised the same absorption
as the opaque solution.        A hollow prism <U+FB01>lled with the opaque liquid was
placed in the path of the beam from an electric lamp ; the light-spectrum
was completely intercepted, but the heat-spectrum was received upon a

           ,   Prof. Tyndall—Contri_buiions        ‘to Molecular Pltysicr,  _   163;
t8_64;.]_    H
screen, and     could   be there examined.        Falling upon a thermo-electric‘
pile, its presence     was   shown   by  the  prompt    de<U+FB02>ection of even a coarse
galvanometer.
   What, then, is the physical meaning of opacity and transparency, as
regards light and radiant heat’!         The luminous rays of the spectrum differ
from the non-luminous ones simply in period.               The sensation of light is
excited by waves of ether        shorter   and  more   quickly recurrent than those
which fall beyond the extreme red.               But why should iodine stop the
former, and allow the latter to pass?            The answer to this question, no
doubt,   is, that  the  intercepted   waves  are those whose periods of recurrence
coincide with the periods of oscillation possible to the atoms of the dis
solved iodine.       The elastic forces which separate these atoms are such as
to compel them to vibrate        in de<U+FB01>nite periods, and when these periods syn
 chronize with    those of the ethereal waves the latter are absorbed.        Brie<U+FB02>y
 de<U+FB01>ned, their    transparency in liquids, as well as in gases, is synonymous
with discord,     while opacity is synonymous with accord between the periods
 of the waves      of ether and those of the molecules of the body on which
they impinge.         All ordinary    transparent and colourless substances owe
their transparency        to the discord which exists between the oscillating
periods of their molecules and those of the waves of the whole visible spec
trum. The general discord of the vibrating periods of the molecules of com
pound bodies with the light-giving waves of the spectrum may be inferred
from the prevalence of the property of transparency in compounds, solid,
liquid, and gaseous, while their greater harmony with the extra-red periods
 is to be inferred from their opacity to the extra-red rays.
    Water illustrates this transparency and opacity in the most striking
 manner.       It is highly transparent to the luminous rays, which demon
 strates the incompetency of its molecules to oscillate in the periods which
 excite vision.      It is as highly opaque to the extra-red undulations, which
 proves the synchronism of its periods with those of the longer waves.
    If, then, to the radiation from any source water shows itself to be emi
 nently or perfectly opaque, it is a proof that the molecules whence the
 radiation emanates must oscillate in what may be called extra-red periods.
 Let us apply this test to the radiation from a <U+FB02>ame of hydrogen. This
 <U+FB02>ame consists mainly of incandescent aqueous vapour, the temperature of
 which, as calculated by Bunsen, is 3259° C., so that if transmission aug
 ments with temperature, we may expect'_the radiation from this <U+FB02>ame to
 be copiously transmitted by the water.              While, however, a layer of the
 bisulphide of carbon 0'07 of an inch in thickness transmits 72 per cent.
 of the incident radiation, and every other liquid examined transmits
 more or less of the heat, a layer of water of the above thickness is entirely
 opaque to the radiation from the <U+FB02>ame. Thus we establish accord be
 tween the periods of the molecules of cold water and those of aqueous
 vapour at a temperature of 3259° C. But the periods :of water have
 already been proved to be extra-red; hence those of the hydrogen <U+FB02>ame

 164.~      Prof. Tyndall—Contributions to Molecular Physics.          [Maia  1'7,
 must be extra-red also.      The absorption by dry air of the heat emitted by
  a platinum spiral raised to incandescence by electricity was found to be
  insensible, while that by the ordinary undried air was 6 per cent.         Sub
  stituting for the platinum spiral a hydrogen <U+FB02>ame, the absorption by dry
  air still remained insensible, while that of the undried air rose to 20 per
  cent. of the entire radiation.       The temperature of the hydrogen <U+FB02>ame
 was as    stated, 3259° C., that  of  the  aqueous vapour of the air was 20° C.
  Suppose, then, the temperature of our aqueous vapour to rise from 20° C.
 to 3259° C., we must conclude that the augmentation of temperature is
  applied to an increase of amplitude, and not to the introduction of periods
  of quicker recurrence into the radiation.
     The part played by aqueous vapour in the economy of Nature is far
  more wonderful than hitherto supposed.           To nourish the vegetation of
  the earth, the actinic and luminous rays of the sun must penetrate our
  atmosphere, and to such rays aqueous vapour is eminently transparent.
 The violet and the extra-violet rays pass through it with freedom.            To
 protect vegetation from destructive chills, the terrestrial rays must be
 checked in their transit      towards   stellar space, and this is accomplished
 by the aqueous vapour diffused through the air. This substance is the
 great moderator of the earth’s temperature, bringing its extremes into
 proximity, and obviating contrasts between day and night which would
 render life insupportable.       But we can advance beyond this general
 statement now that we know the radiation from aqueous vapour is inter
 cepted, in a special degree, by water, and reciprocally, the radiation from
 water by aqueous vapour ; for it follows from this that the very act of noc
 turnal refrigeration which produces the condensation of aqueous vapour
 upon the surface of the earth—giving, as it were, a varnish of liquid water
 to that surface—imparts to terrestrial radiation that particular character
 which disquali<U+FB01>es it from passing through the earth’s atmosphere ‘and
 losing itself in space.
     And here we come to a question in molecular physics which at the
present moment occupies the attention of able and distinguished men. By
 allowing the violet and extra-violet rays of the spectrum to fall upon sul
 phate of quinine and other substances, Professor Stokes has changed the
periods of those rays.       Attempts have been made to produce a similar
result at the other end of the spectrum—-to convert the extra-red periods
into periods competent to excite vision—but hitherto without success.
Such a change of period the author believed occurs when a platinum wire
is heated to whiteness by a hydrogen <U+FB02>ame.            In this common experiment
there is an actual breaking-up        of  long periods into short ones—-a true
rendering of invisual periods visual.          The change of refrangibility here
e<U+FB01>ected differs from that of Professor Stokes, <U+FB01>rst, by its being in the
opposite direction, that is from lower to higher; and secondly, in the
circumstance that the platinum is heated by the collision of the molecules
of aqueous vapour, and before their heat has assumed the radiant form.

But it cannot     be   doubted   that the   same  effect would be produced by
radiant heat of the same periods, provided the motion of the ether could
be rendered su<U+FB02>iciently intense.         The effect, in principle, is the same
whether we consider the platinum wire to be struck by a particle of aqueous
vapour oscillating at a certain rate, or by a particle of ether oscillating at
the same rate.
   By plunging    a  platinum wire into   a hydrogen <U+FB02>ame    we cause  it to glow,
and thus introduce       shorter periods into the radiation.    These, as already
stated, are in discord with water; hence we should infer that the trans
mission through water will be more copious when the wire is in the <U+FB02>ame
than when it is absent.        Experiment proves this conclusion to be true.
Water, from being opaque, opens        a passage to 6 per cent.  of the radiations
from   the <U+FB02>ame and spiral.        A thin plate of colourless glass, moreover,
transmitted   58 per cent. of the radiation from the hydrogen <U+FB02>ame; but
when the <U+FB02>ame and spiral were employed 78 per cent. of the heat was
transmitted.    For an alcohol <U+FB02>ame Knoblauch and Melloni found glass to
be less transparent    than for the same <U+FB02>ame with platinum spiral immersed
in it;  but Melloni afterwards showed that this result was not general,
that black glass and black mica were decidedly more diathermic              to the
radiation from the pure <U+FB02>ame. The reason of this is now obvious.            Black
mica and black glass owe their blackness to the carbon diifused through
them.    The carbon, as proved by Melloni, is in some measure transparent
to the extra-red rays, and the author had in fact succeeded in transmitting
between 40 and 50 per cent. of the radiation from a hydrogen <U+FB02>ame
through a layer of carbon suf<U+FB01>cient to intercept the light of the most bril
liant <U+FB02>ames. The products of combustion of the alcohol <U+FB02>ame are carbonic
acid and aqueous vapour, the heat of which is almost wholly extra-red.
For this radiation the carbon is in a considerable degree transparent, while
for the radiation from the platinum spiral it is in a great measure opaque.
By the introduction of the platinum wire, therefore, the transparency of
the pure glass and the opacity of its carbon were simultaneously aug
mented; but the augmentation of opacity exceeded that of transparency,
and a difference in favour of opacity remained.
   No more striking or instructive illustration of the in<U+FB02>uence of coinci
dence could be adduced than that furnished by the radiation from a car
bonic oxide <U+FB02>ame. Here the product of combustion is carbonic acid; and
on the radiation from this <U+FB02>ame even the ordinary carbonic acid of the
atmosphere     exerts a powerful effect.       A quantity of the gas, only one
thirtieth of an atmosphere in density, contained in a polished brass tube
four feet long, intercepted 50 per cent. of the radiation from the carbonic
oxide <U+FB02>ame.      For the heat emitted by solid sources, ole<U+FB01>ant gas is an in
comparably more powerful absorber than carbonic acid; in fact, for such
heat the latter substance, with one exception, is the most feeble absorber to
be found among the compound gases.            For the radiation from the hydro
gen <U+FB02>ame, moreover, ole<U+FB01>ant gas possesses twice the absorbent power of

                                                                          '

carbonic acid; but for the radiation from the carbonic oxide <U+FB02>ame atia
common tension of one inch of mercury, while carbonic acid absorbs 50 per
cent., ole<U+FB01>ant gas absorbs only 24.          Thus we establish the coincidence of
period between carbonic acid at a temperature over 3000° C., the periods
of oscillation of both the incandescent and the cold gas belonging to the
 extra-red portion of the spectrum.                                     .            .

    It will be seen from the foregoing remarks and experiments how impossible
it is to examine the effect of temperature on the transmission of heat, if
different sources of heat be employed.            Throughout such an examination
the same     oscillating atoms ought to be retained.          The heating of a' pla
-tinum spiral by an electric current enables us to do this while varying the
temperature between the widest possible limits. Their comparative opacity
-to the extra-red rays shows the general accord         of the oscillating periods of
 our series of vapours with those of the extra-red undulations; hence, by
 gradually heating a platinum wire from darkness up to whiteness, we
 gradually augment the discord between it and our vapours, and must there
fore augment the transparency of the latter.          Experiment entirely con<U+FB01>rms
this conclusion.       Formic  ether,   for  example, absorbs 45 per cent. of the
radiation from a platinum spiral heated to barely visible redness; 32 per
cent. of the radiation from the same spiral at a red heat; 26 per cent. of
 the radiation from a white-hot spiral, and only 21 per cent. when the spiral
is brought near its point of fusion.           Remarkable cases of inversion as to
transparency occurred       in these   experiments.      For barely visible redness
 formic ether is more opaque than sulphuric ; for a bright red heat both are
‘equally transparent, while for a white heat, and still more for a nearly
 fusing temperature, sulphuric ether is more opaque than formic.                  This
 result gives us a clear view of the relationship of the two substances to the
 luminiferous ether. As we introduce waves of shorter period, the sulphuric
 augments most rapidly in opacity ; that is to say, its accord with the shorter
 waves is greater than that of the formic.           Hence we may infer that the
molecules    of  formic  ether  oscillate   as  a whole  more slowly than those of
‘sulphuric ether.
    When the source of heat was a Leslie’s cube <U+FB01>lled with boiling water and
 coated with lampblack, the opacity of formic ether in comparison with
 sulphuric was very decided; with this source also the position of chloro
 form, as regards iodide of methyl, was inverted.          For a white-hot spiral, the
 absorption of chloroform       vapour being 10 per cent., that of iodide of
~methyl is 16 ; with the blackened cube as source, the absorption by chloro
 form is 22 per cent., while that by the iodide of methyl is only 19. This
inversion is not the result of temperature merely ; for when a platinum wire
heated to the temperature of boiling water was employed as a source, the
iodide was the most powerful absorbent. Numberless experiments, indeed,
 prove that from heated lampblack an emission takes place which synchro
nizes in an especial manner with chloroform. This may be thus illustrated.
 For the Leslie’s cube coated with lampblack, the absorption by chloroform

is more than three times that by bisulphide of carbon ; for the radiation from
the most luminous portion of a gas <U+FB02>ame the absorption by chloroform is
also considerably in excess of that by bisulphide of carbon; while for the
<U+FB02>ame of a Bunsen’s burner, from which the incandescent carbon particles
are removed by the free admixture             of air, the absorption by bisulphide of
carbon is nearly twice that by chloroform ; the removal of the incandescent
carbon particles more than doubled in this instance the relative transparency
of the chloroform.          Testing, moreover, the radiation from various parts of
 the same <U+FB02>ame, it was found that for the blue base of the <U+FB02>ame the bisulphide
was the most opaque, while for all other portions of the <U+FB02>ame the chloroform
was most opaque.           For the radiation from a very small gas <U+FB02>ame, consisting
 of a blue base and a small white top, the bisulphide was also most opaque,
 and its opacity very decidedly exceeded that of the chloroform when the
 <U+FB02>ame     of bisulphide of carbon was employed as a source. Comparing the
 radiation from a Leslie’s cube coated with isinglass with that from a similar
 cube coated with lampblack, at a common temperature of 100° C., it was
found that out of eleven vapours all but one absorbed the radiation from the
 isinglass most powerfully; the single exception was chloroform.                  It may
 be remarked that whenever, through a change of source, the position of a_
 vapour as an absorber of radiantheat was altered, the position of the liquid'
 from which the vapour was derived was changed in the same manner.
     It  is still a point of difference between eminent investigators as to whether
 radiant heat up to a temperature of 100° C. is monochromatic or not.
 some a<U+FB01>irm‘ this, others deny it. A long series of experiments enables the
  author to state that probably no two substances at a temperature of 100° C.
  emit heat of the same quality.          The heat emitted by isinglass, for example,
  is different from that emitted by lampblack, and the heat emitted by cloth
  or paper di<U+FB02>"ers from both. It is also a subject of discussion whether rock
  salt is equally diathermic to all kinds of calori<U+FB01>c rays,—the di<U+FB02>erences
  affirmed to exist by one investigator being ascribed by others to differences
  of incidence from the various sources employed.                MM. De la Provostaye
   and Desains maintain the former view, Melloni and M. Knoblauch main
   tain the latter. The question was examined by the author without changing
 [anything but the temperature of the source.                Its size, distance, and sur
  roundings remained the same, and the experiments proved that rock-salt
   shared in some degree the defect of all other substances ; it is not perfectly
   diathermic,     and  it is more    opaque‘  to the radiation     from a barely visible
spiral than to that from          a white-hot one.             -
      The author devotes a section of his memoir to the relation of radiation to
   conduction. De<U+FB01>ning radiation, internal as well as external, as the com
   munication of motion from the vibrating molecules to the ether, he arrives
  by theoretic reasoning at the ‘conclusion thatthe best radiatorsfought to
  prove the worst conductors.           A broad consideration of the subject‘ shows
  at once the _ general harmony of, the, conclusion with observed facts.
   Organiosubstances are all excellent radiators          ; they are also extremely bad

conductors.          The moment           we pass from the metals to              their compounds, we
pass from a series of good conductors to bad ones, and from bad radiators
to good ones.          Water, among liquids, is probably the worst conductor; it
is the best radiator.             Silver, among solids, is the best conductor; it is the
worst radiator.           In   the excellent researches             of MM. Dela Provostaye and
Desains the author              <U+FB01>nds a striking illustration of what he regards as a
natural law-—tl1at those molecules which transfer the greatest amount of
motion to the ether, or, in other words, radiate most powerfully, are the
least competent to communicate motion to each other, or, in other words,
to conduct with facility.

    In the volume on Sun Spots which Carrington has recently published,
we are furnished with a curve denoting the relative frequency of these phe
nomena from 17 60 to the present time.                           This curve exhibits a maximum
                                                                     ‘                    ’
corresponding to 17 886. Again, in Dalton’s Meteorology we have a list
of aurorae observed at Kendal and Keswick from May 1786 to May 1793.
    The observations at Kendal were made by Dalton himself, and those at
Keswick by Crosthwaite.                   This list gives—
For the year 1787                . . 27 aurorae,            For the year 1790           . . . . 36 aurorae;

ringt0n’s dates        of maximum sun spots.
    The following observation is unconnected with the aurora borealis.                                    In
examining the sun pictures taken with the Kew Heliograph under the
superintendence of Mr.De la Rue, it appears to be a nearly universal law that
the faculee belonging to a spot appear to the left of that spot, the motion
due to the sun’s rotation being across the picture from left to right.
    These pictures comprise a few taken in 1858, more in 1859, afew in 1861,
and many more in 1862 and 1863, and they have been carefully examined

           HICKS, Esq. Communicated by . P. GASSIOT, F.R.S. Received
           March 16, 1864.
    Having shown this instrument to Mr. Gassiot, he wished me to write a
  short description of          it,
                       which he thought would be of interest to the Royal
  Society.
    Some time since          I     constructed an open-scale barometer, with     column      a
 of mercury placed in              a glass tube hermetically sealed at the top, and per
 fectly open at the bottom.               The lower half of the tube               is   of larger bore
 than that of the upper.
     Ifa column of mercury,    of exactly the length which the atmosphere                           is
 able at the time to support, were placed in        tube of glass hermetically
                                                             a
 sealed at the top, of equal bore from end to end, the mercury would be held
 in suspension; but immediately the pressure of the atmosphere increased,
 the mercury     would rise towards the top of the tube, and remain there
 till, on the pressure decreasing,      would fall towards the bottom, and
                                              it
 that portion which the atmosphere was unable to support would drop out.
 But   if the lower half of the tube be made         little larger in the bore
                                                                 a
 than the upper, when the column falls, the upper portion passes out of the
 smaller part of the tube into the larger, and owing to the greater capacity
 of the latter, the lower end of the column of mercury does not sink to the
 same extent as the upper end, and the column thus becomes shorter.       The
 fall will continue until the column      reduced to that length which the
                                                   is
 atmosphere         is   capable   of supporting, and the scale attached thus registers
 what   ordinarily termed the height of the barometer.
           is                                                            -
    From the above description      will be evident that, by merely varying
                                            it
 the proportion  in the size of the  two parts of the tube,    scale of any        a
length can be obtained.    For example,    the tubes are very nearly the
                                                        if
same size in bore, the column has to pass through    great distance before
                                                                     a
the necessary compensation takes place, and we obtain    very long scale,      a
say 10 inches, for every 1-inch rise and fall in the ordinary barometer.
But   if    the lower tube  made much larger than the upper, the mercury
                                   is
passing into     quickly compensates, and we obtain
                    it                                small scale, say from
                                                                     a
2 to  3inches, for every inch. To ascertain how many inches this would rise
and fall for an ordinary inch of the barometer, attach   in connexion with
                                                             I           it,
astandard barometer, to an air-pump receiver, and by reducing the pressure
in the air-pump cause the standard barometer to fall, say inch, when the
                     I                                                         1
other will fall, say inches; and so
                            5             ascertain the scale for every inch,
                                                 I
from 31 to 27 inches.
   It was on this principle that constructed the open-scale barometer,
                                           I
which has since been extensively used. But having been asked to apply                              a
Vernier to one of these barometers graduated in this way,      found this im-

170                 Mr. Perkin       on Mauve or     Aniline-Purple.               [1864.
    I have now remedied         this defect, and made what       I believe  is an absolute
standard barometer, by graduating the scale from the centre, and reading
it off with two verniers to the TU1;;'5th of an inch. The scale is divided
from the centre, up and down, into inches, and subdivided into 20ths.
    To ascertain the height of the barometer graduated in this way, take a
reading of the upper surface of the column of mercury with the vernier,
then of the lower surface in the same way, and the two readings added to
gether will give the exact length of the column of mercury supported in the
air, which is the height of the barometer at the time.
    There is another advantage in this manner of graduating over the
former, that if a little of the mercury drops out it will give no error, as the
column will immediately rise out of the larger tube into the smaller, and
become the same length as before; but by the former scale the barometer
would stand too high, until readjusted, which could only be effected by
 putting the same quantity of mercury in again.
    I  have introduced Gay-Lussac’s pipette into the centre of the tube, to
prevent the possibility of any air passing up into the top.
    The Society then adjourned over the Easter Recess to Thursday, April 7th.
“ On Mauve or Aniline-Purple.”                   By W. H. PERKIN, F.C.S. Com
      municated by Dr. STENHOUSE.                  Received August 19, 1863*.
    The discovery of this colouring matter in 1856, and its introduction              as a
commercial article, has originated that remarkable series of compounds
known as coal-tar colours, which have now become so numerous, and in
consequence of their adaptibility to the arts and manufactures are of such
great and increasing importance. _ The chemistry of mauve may appear to
have been rather neglected, its composition not having been established,
although it has formed the subject of several papers by continental chemists.
Its chemical nature also has not been generally known; and to this fact
many of the discrepancies in the results of the di<U+FB01>'erent experimentalists
who have worked on this subject are to be attributed.
    The <U+FB01>rst analysis        I  made of this colouring matter was in 1856, soon
after   I had become its fortunate discoverer.                            I

puri<U+FB01>ed    as  thoroughly      as  my knowledge     of its  properties then enabled me,
and the results'f" obtained agree very closely with those required for the
formula I now propose.            Since that time I have often commenced the study
of this body in a scienti<U+FB01>c point of view, but other duties have prevented me

from completing these investigations; but, although unacquainted with its
correct formula, its chemical characters have necessarily been well known
to me for a considerable time.         When <U+FB01>rst introduced, commercial mauve
appeared as an almost perfectly amorphous body ; but now, owing to the
great improvements which have been made in its puri<U+FB01>cation, it is sent into
the market perfectly pure and crystallized.
   On adding a solution of hydrate of potassium to a boiling solution of
commercial crystallized mauve, it immediately changes in colour from
purple    to a blue violet,     and after a few moments begins to deposit a
crystalline body.        After standing a few hours, this crystalline product is
collected on a <U+FB01>lter, washed with alcohol once or twice, and then thoroughly
with water.      When dry, it appears as a nearly black glistening substance,
not unlike pulverized specular iron ore.

   This substance, for which propose the name Mauveine, is a powerful
base.    It dissolves in alcohol, forming a blue violet solution, which imme
diately assumes a purple colour on the addition of acids. It is insoluble, or
nearly so, in ether and benzole.          It is a very stable body, and decomposes
ammoniacal compounds readily.              When heated strongly it decomposes,
yielding   a basic  oil, which   does not   appear to be aniline.

     Carbonate      of Mauveine.—The tendency of solutions of mauveine to

   tion be thrown up into a tube containing carbonic acid over mercury, the
   carbonic acid will quickly be absorbed, the solution in the mean time pass
   ing from its normal violet colour to purple.          To prepare this carbonate, it
   is necessary to pass carbonic acid gas through boiling alcohol containing a
   quantity of mauveine in suspension.           It is then <U+FB01>ltered quickly, and car
   bonic acid passed through the <U+FB01>ltrate until nearly cold.             On standing,
   this liquid will deposit the carbonate as prisms, having a green metallic
   re<U+FB02>exion.      A solution of this salt, on being boiled, loses part of its carbonic
   acid and assumes       the violet colour of the base.    When dry this carbonate
   rapidly changes, and if heated to 100° C. loses nearly all its carbonic acid
   and changes in colour to a dull olive; therefore, as it cannot be dried with
   out undergoing a certain amount of change, its composition is di<U+FB01>icult to
   determine.        However,   I endeavoured to estimate the carbonic acid in this
   salt by taking     a. quantity of it freshly prepared and in the moist state, and
  heating    it   in  an  oil-bath until carbonic acid ceased to be evolved.       The
  residual base was then weighed, and also the carbonic acid, which had
  been collected in a potash bulb, having been previously freed from water
  by means of sulphuric acid.          The following results were obtained :
      I. 1'88 residual base obtained; ‘I90 carbonic acid evolved.
      II. 1'375 residual base; ‘I385 carbonic acid evolved. ‘.190 of CO2 is
  equal to '268 of H,CO,; this, added to the residual base, will give the
  amount of substance experimented with, viz. 2'l48.             The amount of CO,
  obtained from this quantity, therefore, is 8'8 per cent.
      Calculating the second experiment in a similar manner, the amount of
 carbonate       operated upon would be 1'5'i02 grm.; the percentage of CO,
 obtained      is therefore equal to 8'8.        A carbonate having the formula
  (C,., H“ N,), H, CO, would contain 5'1 per cent. of CO,, and an acid
 carbonate having the formula O,., H,‘ N‘, H, CO, would contain 9'4            I    per
 cent. of    C0,.
     Considering that this salt when prepared begins to crystallize before it
 is cold, probably the <U+FB01>rst portions that deposit are a monocarbonate, while
the larger quantity which separates afterwards is an acid carbonate.             Hence
the de<U+FB01>ciency in the amount of CO2 obtained in the above experiments.
I   hope to give my attention to this remarkable salt at a future period.
     In the analysis of the salts of mauveine great care has to be taken in
drying them thoroughly, as most of them are highly hygroscopic.
     I  am now engaged in the study of the replaceable hydrogen in mauveine,
          I
which hope will throw some light upon its constitution.                From its for
mula     I  believe it to be a tetramine, although up to the present time             I
have not obtained any de<U+FB01>nite salts with more than 1 equiv. of acid.
     When mauveine is heated with aniline it produces a blue colouring
matter, which will doubtless prove to be a phenyle derivative of that base.
A salt of mauveine when heated alone also produces a violet or blue
compound.           These substances    I am now examining, and hope in a short
time to have the honour of communicating them to the Society.

   The paper is divided into two Parts; the <U+FB01>rst gives the results of expe
riments on animals; the second, of observations upon the human being.
                                     PART   I.
   Assuming that the great divisions of the brain preserve each the same
function through the vertebrate kingdom, it is maintained that experiments
which can be performed only on such of the lower animals as are very
tenacious of life, will afford deductions of universal application.
   The method of proceeding with regard to each species was to remove,
<U+FB01>rst, the whole encephalon, with the exception of the medulla oblongata;
then in a similar animal only the cerebrum was taken away.              The only
di<U+FB01>"erence between the two cases was in the fact that one animal had a
cerebellum, and the other had not. A comparison was believed to show, in
the powers which one had more than the other, the function of the organ
the possession of which constituted the only difference.
   Finally it was ascertained in each species what is the eifect of taking
away the cerebellum alone.
   The use of the organ was thus estimated in two ways—by the effect of
its addition to the medulla, and of its subtraction from the rest of the
nervous system.
   The   species so treated are arranged   in an ascending scale, according to
the comparative     weight of the cerebellum.        The <U+FB01>eld-snake, frog, sala
mander, toad, land-tortoise,    eel,  water-tortoise,  pike,  perch. tench, dace,
carp, gold-<U+FB01>sh, rudd, loach, and gudgeon were subjected to these opera
tions; besides which, many experiments of a less systematic character were
made upon birds and mammalia.
   The results are these :—
   In Reptiles, with the exception of the snake, the cord, together with the      _
medulla oblongata, is sufficient to give the power of voluntary or sponta
neous motion——limited, but usually enough to allow of feeble locomotion.
   With the addition of the cerebellum, all actions dependent on the will
appear to be naturally performed.
   VOL. xnr.                                                          P

178          Dr. Dickinson on the Functions of the Ccrebellum.         [April 7,
    The removal of thecerebellum shows that the cerebrum by itself is
unable to give more than a limited amount of voluntary motion, and that
of a kind de<U+FB01>cient in balance and adjustment.
    It is therefore inferred that the cord, together with the medulla oblon
gate, is a great source of spontaneous motor power, in which function both
the cerebrum and the cerebellum        take part, the cerebellum to the greater
extent; it also appears that a certain harmony in the use of the muscles
depends on the possession of the latter organ.
     Regarding Fishes, the cord and medulla oblongata seem unequal to the
performance of voluntary motion.
     When the cerebellum is added, the powers become so far extended that
movements are made in obedience to external stimuli.            Generally speak
ing, a determined position is maintained and locomotion            accomplished,
without the use, however, of the pectoral <U+FB01>ns.
     If  the  cerebellum   only be taken away, there is a loss of the proper
 adjustment between the right and left sides ; so that oscillation or rotation
 takes place.     All the limbs are used, but apparently with a de<U+FB01>ciency of
 sustained activity.
     It is therefore concluded    that with Fishes, as with Reptiles, the power
 of intentional movement is shared by both cerebrum and cerebellum; the
 former in this case has the larger in<U+FB02>uence.
     Such movements as depend on the cerebrum are destitute of lateral ba
 lance, are sudden in being affected by any external cause, and are emotional
 in their character.     Such as depend on the cerebellum are mutually ad
 justed, of a continuous kind, and less directly under the in<U+FB02>uence of con
  sciousness.
     The same facts were supported by experiments on the higher orders of
  animals: in these it seemed that the cord and medulla are insu<U+FB01>icient to
  excite voluntary movements.        The muscles, as with <U+FB01>shes and reptiles,
  acknowledge a double rule, from the cerebrum and from the cerebellum.
  The anterior limbs are most subservient to the cerebrum ; the posterior to
  the cerebellum.      The limbs on one side are in connexion chie<U+FB02>y with the
  lobe   of the opposite side.     The absence of the cerebellum destroys the
  power of lateral balance.
      From the negative results of the experiments, it is inferred that the cere
  bellum has nothing to do with common sensation, with the sexual pro
  pensity, with the action of the involuntary muscles, with the maintenance
   of animal heat, or with secretion.
      The only function which the experiments assigned to the cerebellum is
   such as concerns the voluntary muscles, which receive therefrom a regu
  lated supply of motor in<U+FB02>uence. Each lateral half of the cerebellum affects
   both sides, but the one opposite to itself most.
      The cerebellum has a property distinct from its true voluntary power,
   which harmonizes the action of the voluntary muscles, and has been de
   scribed as “ coordination.”

    The only faculty which constantly suffers in consequence of changes in
 the cerebellum,    the power of voluntary movement.

 limbs——which results are about equally frequent.
    From the manner in which the paralysis was distributed                                   in cases     of disease
 of part of the organ,-it inferred that each lobe in connexion as source

 of voluntary movement with all the four limbs, but in the greatest degree
 with the limbs of the opposite                       side, and          with the lower more than with the
 upper extremities.

180                          Prof. Sylvester on Newton's Rule for                       [April 7,
for assigning an inferior limit to their number.      He has given no clue
towards the ascertainment of the grounds upon which this rule is based, and
has stated it in such terms as to leave it quite an open question whether or
not he had obtained a demonstration of it.        Maclaurin, Campbell, and
others have made attempts at supplying     a demonstration, but their efforts,
so far as regards the more important part of the rule, that namely by
which the limit to the number of imaginary roots is <U+FB01>xed, have completely
failed in their object. Thus hitherto any opinion as to the truth of the rule
rests on the purely empirical ground of its being found to lead to correct                           _
results in particular arithmetical instances. Persuaded of the insuf<U+FB01>ciency
of such    a mode           of veri<U+FB01>cation, the author has applied himself to obtain
ing    a rigorous demonstration                of the rule for equations of speci<U+FB01>ed degrees.
 For the second             degree    no demonstration            is necessary.   For cubic equa
 tions a proof is found without dif<U+FB01>culty.             For biquadratic equations the
 author proceeds as follows.            He supposes the equation to be expressed
 homogeneously in .z', 3/, and then, instituting a series of in<U+FB01>nitesimal linear
 transformations obtained by writing .2--I-by for z, or 1/ + ha: for y, where it is
 an in<U+FB01>nitesimal quantity, shows that the truth of Newton’s rule for this
 case depends on its being capable of being shown that the discriminant of
the function (1, ie, e’, ie, 11.1’, 3/)‘ is necessarily positive for all values of
 e greater than unity, which is easily proved.           He then proceeds to consider
 the case of equations of the 5th degree, and, following a similar process,
arrives at the conclusion that the truth of the rule depends on its being
capable of being shown that the discriminant, say (D) of the function
 (I, e, e’, 11“, 11, 11.10, 3/)’, which for facility of reference may be termed
 “the (e,   11) function,”        necessarily positive when e“—e11’ and 11“-11¢” are
                                     is

there being in general a theory for equations with conjugate coefficients,
which for greater brevity may be termed conjugate equations, analogous to
that for real equations in respect of the distinction between real and imagi
nary roots in the latter.  A conjugate equation is one in which the coeffi
cients, reckoning from the two ends of the equation, go in pairs of the form
pi-iq, with the obvious condition that when there is a middle coei<U+FB01>cient
this must be real. Such an equation may be supposed to be so prepared
that, when thrown into the form P+iQ, P and Q shall have no common
algebraical factor; and when this is effected, it may easily be shown that
 the conjugate equation can neither have real roots nor roots paired together
 of the form ).+i,u, 7\—i;i respectively. How, then, it may be asked, is the
 analogy previously referred to possible?  On investigation it will be found
that the roots divide themselves into two categories, each of exactly the
same order of generality,—viz. solitary roots of the form cw, and associ
ated roots which go in pairs, the two roots of each pair being of the form
pew,    lei‘? respectively;    so that,   following the ordinary mode of geometrical
representation of imaginary quantities, the roots of a conjugate equation
may be denoted by points lying on the circumference of a circle to radius
unity (corresponding to solitary roots), and points (corresponding to the
associated roots) lying in couples on different radii of the circle at reci
procal distances from the centre, each couple in fact constituting, accord
ing to Prof. W. Thomson’s de<U+FB01>nition, electrical images of each other in
respect to the circle.        If
                            the circle be taken with radius in<U+FB01>nity instead of
unity (so as to become a straight line), then we have the geometrical
eidolon of the roots _of an ordinary equation, the solitary roots lying on a
straight line, and the associated or paired (imaginary) roots on each side of,
and at equal distances from the line.
   In  the inquiry before us, whether the variable point belong to the real
or conjugate part of the plane of the D curve, it is shown to remain true that

      This theorem was published by the author, but without proof, in the
‘
 Comptes Rendus’ for the month of March in this year.
   But the method of demonstration now supplied is deserving of particular
attention in itself; for it brings to light a new order of purely tactical con
siderations, and establishes  a previously unsuspected kind of, so to say,
algebraical polarity.  The   proof essentially depends upon the character of
every superlinear form being associated with, and capable of de<U+FB01>nition by
means of a pencil of rays, which may be called the type pencil, subject to
a species of circulation of a different nature according as the degree of the
form is even or odd, which he describes by the terms “per-rotatory” in the
one case, and “ trans-rotatory
                                ” in the other;
                                                 so that the types themselves
may be conveniently distinguished by the names “per-rotatory” and “trans
rotatory.”    By per-rotatory circulation is to be understood that species in
which, commencing with any element of the type, passage is made from it
 to the next, from that to the one following, from the last but one to the last,
 from the last to the <U+FB01>rst, and so on, until the <U+FB01>nal passage is to the element
 commenced with from the one immediately preceding.       By trans-rotatory
 circulation, on the other hand, is understood that species in which, com
 mencing with any element and proceeding in the same manner as before
 to the end element, passage is made from that, not to the end element
 itself, but to its polar opposite, from that to the polar opposite of the next,
 and so on, until the <U+FB01>nal passage is made to the polar opposite of the ele
 ment commenced with, from the polar opposite of its immediate ante
 cedent. The number of changes of sign in effecting such passages, whether
 in a per-rotatory or a trans-rotatory type, is independent of the place of
 the element with which the circulation is made to commence, and may be
 termed the variation-index of the type, which is always an even number for
 per-rotatory, and an odd number for trans-rotatory types.         A theorem is
 given whereby    a relation is  established between    the variation-index of a
 per-rotatory or trans-rotatory and that of a certain trans-rotatory or per-rota
 tory type capable of being derived from them respectively; and this purely
 tactical theorem, combined with the algebraical one, that the form _f(:v,           3/)

        arranged for Spectrum Analysis.”                  By   J. P. GASSIOT,  F.R.S.
        Received March 17, I864.
     The principles which should regulate the construction of a battery of
 prisms have been alluded to in the description of the large spectroscope
 now at Kew Observatory, which has a train of nine dense glass prisms with
 refracting angles of 45°*.
     While for purposes of exactitude, such as mapping out the solar spec
 trum, <U+FB02>int glass stands unrivalled; yet when the greatest amount of dis
 persion is the desideratum, prisms <U+FB01>lled with bisulphide of carbon present
 obvious advantages, on account of the enormous dispersive power of that
 liquid—the difference of its indices of refraction for extreme rays being,
 according to Sir David Brewster, as 0'077 against 0026 for <U+FB02>int glass.
     In the <U+FB02>uid prisms of the ordinary construction, the sides are cemented
 on with a mixture of glue and honey.             This cement, on hardening, warps
 the sides, and confusion of the spectral lines is the consequent result.          To
 obviate this source     of error, it has  been proposed to attach      an additional
 pair  of parallel sides  to such prisms,   a thin <U+FB01>lm of castor-oil being interposed
 between the surfaces.         The outer plates are then secured by means of
 sealing-wax,   or  some   cement,   at the corners. In the battery of prisms now
 about to be described, Mr. Browning has dispensed with this attachment at
 the corners, which is likely to prove prejudicial, and has secured the second
 sides in their proper position by extremely light metal frames which clasp
 the plates only on their edges.
    Thus arranged, the frames exert no pressure on the surfaces of the
plates, and are quite out of the <U+FB01>eld of view, and they can be handled with
 out any fear of derangement.
    On account of the lower refractive power of bisulphide of carbon, as com
pared with <U+FB02>int glass, a refractive angle of 50° was given to the <U+FB02>uid prisms.
Eight such prisms would         cause a ray   of light to travel more than a circle,
and would be the greatest number that could be employed had the ordi
nary arrangement been adopted. _
    In place, however, of giving to the <U+FB02>uid prisms two pairs of parallel
sides,  Mr. Browning, taking advantage of the diiference between the re
fractive and dispersive properties of crown glass and bisulphide of carbon,
has substituted a prism of crown glass having a refracting angle of 6° for
one of the outer plates of each prism—the base of this crown-glass prism
being brought to correspond with the apex of the <U+FB02>uid prism, thus :—

 decreased, that eleven of them thus constructed                     can be used in        a    circle
instead of eight. An increase of dispersive power, due to refracting angles
of 150° of the bisulphide of carbon,       thus gained, minus only the small
                                                     is
amount of dispersion counteracted owing to the dispersive power of the
crown-glass prisms being employed in the contrary direction.

this loss   inconsiderable, amounting to scarcely more than
           is                                                      <U+FB01>fteenth of   a

 12th inst.    The results then obtained may probably not be considered
devoid of interest.    They are as follows :—
   The prisms were arranged so as to enable that portion of the spectrum
to be observed in which the well-de<U+FB01>ned D line of Fraunhofer is situated.
This line, long since resolved   as double, presented an angular separation     of
3' 6", measured from the centre of one to that of the other principal line,
this measurement being made by Mr. Balfour Stewart by means of the
micrometer    attached to the telescope; the value of the divisions of the
micrometer    he had previously determined relatively to the divided circle of
the spectroscope.     A centre line (clearly de<U+FB01>ned and <U+FB01>gured in Kirchhoff
and Bunsen’s map) was distinctly visible, and nearly equidistant from the
centre towards the violet; <U+FB01>ve clearly de<U+FB01>ned lines were perceptible, as also
two faint lines on each side of the principal lines, between the centre line
of Kirchhoff towards the red.       Several faint lines were also perceptible.
   The lines as represented in the diagram were drawn by Mr. Whipple,
one of the assistants in the Observatory, as they were observed by him
about 3.45 P.M       Some of these may possibly be due to the earth’s atmo
sphere, but the <U+FB01>ve most’ refrangible lines were observed at an earlier
period of the day by Mr. Stewart, Mr. Browning, and myself.
   The great angular separation of the double D line to 3' 6" is a proof of
the power of this arrangement of the sulphide-of—carbon prisms, and offers
the means of mapping out the entire solar spectrum on a scale not hitherto
attained.

  The CROONIAN Lncruaa was delivered by Prof. HERMANN HELM
nourz, For. Memb.- R.S., “On the Normal Motions of the Human
Eye in relation to Binocular Vision.”
   The Motions of the Human Eye are of considerable interest, as well for
the physiology of voluntary muscular motion in general, as for the
physiology of vision.   Therefore    Imay be allowed to bring before this
Society the results of some investigations relating to them, which   have      I
made myself; and I may venture perhaps to hope that they are such as to
interest not only physiologists and medical men, but every scienti<U+FB01>c man
who desires to understand the mechanism of the perceptions of our senses.
  The eyeball may      be considered as a sphere,      which can          round
                                                                   be turned
its centre   as a <U+FB01>xed   point. Although this description is not absolutely
accurate, it is su<U+FB02>iciently so for our present purpose.    The eyeball, indeed,
is not <U+FB01>xed during   its motion  by  the solid walls of an articular excavation,
like the bone of the thigh; but, although it is surrounded at its posterior
surface only by soft cellular tissue and fat, it cannot be moved in a per
ceptible degree     forward and backward,    because        of the cellular
                                                        the volume
tissue, included   between the eyeball and the osseous walls of the orbit,
cannot be    diminished or augmented by forces so feeble as the muscles of
the eye are able to exert.
   In the interior of the orbit, around the eyeball six muscles are situated,
which can be employed to turn the eye round its centre.       Four of them,
the so-called recti muscles, are fastened at the hindmost point of the orbit,
and go forward to <U+FB01>x themselves to the front part of the eyeball, passing
over its widest circumference—or its equator, as we may call           it,
                                                                       we con
                                                                         if
sider the foremost and the hindmost points of the eyeball as its poles. These
four recti muscles are from their position severally named superior, inferior,
internal, and external.     Besides these, there are two oblique muscles, the
ends of which come from the anterior margin of the orbit on the side next
the nose, and, passing outwards, are attached at that side of the eyeball
which    towards the temple—one of them, the superior oblique muscle,
        is
being stretched  over the upper side of the eyeball, the other, or inferior,
going along its under side.
   These six muscles can be combined as three pairs of antagonists.         The
internal and external recti turn the eye round perpendicular axis, so that
                                                    a
its visual lineis  directed either to the right side or to the left.  The supe
rior and    inferior recti turn
                              it  round  a  horizontal axis, directed  from the
upper end of the nose to the temple      ;  so that the superior rectus elevates
the visual line, the inferior depresses it. ‘Lastly, the oblique muscles 'turn
the ‘eye round an axis which    is  directed from its centre to the occiput, so

that the superior oblique muscle lowers the visual line, and the inferior raises
it; but these last two muscles not only raise and lower the visual line;
they produce also a rotation of the eye round the visual line itself, of which
we shall have to speak more afterwards.
  A solid body, the centre of which is <U+FB01>xed, and which can be turned
round three ditferent axes of rotation, can be brought into every possible
position consistent with the immobility of its centre. Look, for instance, at
the motions of our arm, which are provided for at the shoulder-joint by the
gliding of the very accurately spherical upper extremity of the humerus in
the corresponding excavation of the scapula.    When we stretch out the arm
horizontally, we can   turn    <U+FB01>rst,  it,
                                     round    perpendicular axis, moving

           it                                                       by such             it

tions in which the arm can be turned.
  Now let us   see how far the motions of the eye can be compared to those
of our arm.    We can raise and lower the visual line, we can turn     to the                it
left and to the right, we can bring  into every possible direction, through
                                                  it
out   certain range —as far, at least, as the connexions of the eyeball permit.

So far the motions of the eye are as free as those of the arm.       But when
we have chosen any determinate direction of the eye, can we turn the eye
round the visual line           as an axis, as we       can turn the arm round            its longi
tudinal axis?
   This    is   a    question   the answer to which  connected with
                                                                  is     curious          a
peculiarity of our voluntary motions.       In    purely mechanical sense, we

must answer this question in the affirmative.         Yes, there exist muscles
by  the  action  of which those  rotations   round  the visual line can be per
formed.     But when we ask, “Can we do         by an act of our will?” we must
                                                         it
answer, “ No.” We can voluntarily turn the visual line into every possible
direction, but we cannot voluntarily use the muscles of our eye in such                              a
way as to turn       round the visual line.
                        it                      Whenever the direction of the
visual line     <U+FB01>xed, the position of our eye, as far as
                is                                            depends upon our

will, is completely <U+FB01>xed and cannot be altered.
   This law was <U+FB01>rst satisfactorily proved by Professor Donders, of Utrecht,
who, in    avery ingenious way, controlled the position of the eye by those
ocular spectra which remain in the <U+FB01>eld of vision after the eye had been

and they become less sensitive to that kind of light by which they

being in the middle of broader red one.
                               a            The cause of this appearance is,
that those parts of your retina which were excited formerly by green light
are less affected by the green rays contained in white or whitish light than
by rays of the complementary colour, and white light, therefore, appears
to them reddish; to those parts of the nervous membrane, on the other
hand, which had been fatigued by red light, white light afterwards appears
to be greenish.  The nervous membrane of the eye in these cases behaves
nearly like the sensitive stratum in photographic apparatus, which
                                                            a                                                          is
altered by light during the exposure in such     way that                    a                      it   is   impressed
differently afterwards by various agents; and the impression                                              of light on
the retina may be, perhaps, of the same essential nature as the impression
made upon  a   photographic plate.     But the impression made on the living
eye does not last so long as that on sensitive compounds of silver vanishes                              ;   it
very soon  if the light be not too strong.  Light of great intensity, like_
that of the sun when directly looked at, can develope very dark ocular
spectra, which last   quarter of an hour, or even longer, and disturb the

perception of external objects very much, as is well known.            One must be
very careful to avoid the use of too strong a light in these experiments,
because the nervous apparatus of the eye is easily injured by it; and the
brightness of these coloured strips when illuminated by common day
light is quite sufficient for our present purpose.
    Now you will perceive easily that these ocular spectra are extremely well
adapted to ascertain the position of the eye-ball, because they have a <U+FB01>xed
 connexion with certain parts of the retina itself.       If the eyeball could turn
 about its visual line as an axis, the ocular spectrum would apparently un
 dergo the same degree of rotation; and hence, when we move about the eye,
and at last return to the same direction of the visual line, we can recognize
easily and accurately whether the eye has returned into the same position
 as before, or whether the degree of its rotation round the visual line has
been altered.      Professor Donders has proved, by using this very delicate
 test, that the human eye, in its normal state, returns always into the same
position when the visual line is brought into the same direction. The
position and direction of the eye are to be determined in this case in refer
 ence to the head of the observer; and          I  beg you to understand always,
when     I say that the eye or its visual line is moved upwards or downwards,
that it is moved either in the direction of the forehead or in that of the
cheek; and when       I say it is moved to the left or to the right, you are to
 understand the left or right side of the head.          Therefore, when the head
itself is not in its common vertical position, the vertical line here under
stood is not accordant with the line of the plummet.
    Before the researches of Donders, some observers believed they had
found a dilference in the relative positions of the eye, when the head was
brought into different situations.      They had used either small brown spots
of the iris, or red vessels in the white of the eye, to ascertain the real
position of the eyeball; but their apparent results have been shown to be
 erroneous by the much more trustworthy method of Donders.
    In  the <U+FB01>rst place, therefore, we may state that the position of the eye
ball depends exclusively upon the direction of the visual line in reference
to the position of the head of the observer.          But now we must ask, what
is the law regulating the position of the eye for every direction of its visual
line’! In order to de<U+FB01>ne this law, we must <U+FB01>rst notice that there exists a
certain direction of the visual line, which, in relation to the motions of the
eye, is distinguished from all other directions of the eye ; and we may call
it the central or primary direction of the visual line.            This direction is
parallel to the median vertical plane of the head; and it is horizontal when
the head of the observer, who is standing, is kept in a convenient erect

tion of the visual line may be determined practically with greater accuracy
we shall see afterwards.        All other directions of the visual line we may
call secondary directions.

dian plane of the eye. Such a plane cuts through the retina in a certain
line; and when the eye has been moved, we consider as the same meridian
plane that plane which passes through the new direction of the visual
line and the same points of the retina as before.
    After having given these de<U+FB01>nitions, we may express the law of the
motions of the eye in the following way :—
    VVhenever the eye is brought into a secondary position, that meridian
plane of the eye which goes through the primary direction of the visual
line has the same position as it has in the primary direction of the eye.
   It follows from this law that the secondary position of the eye may be
found also by turning the eye from its primary position round a <U+FB01>xed axis
which is normal as well to the primary as to the secondary of the visual
line.
   [The geometrical relations of these different positions were explained by
the lecturer by means of a moveable globe placed on an axis like the common
terrestrial   globes.]
    It   would   take   too long to explain the different      ways in which dif
ferent observers have tried to determine the law of            the motions of the
eyeball.     They have employed complicated apparatus           for determining the
angles by which the direction and the rotation of             the eye were to be
measured.        But usually two difficulties arise from the use of such instru
ments containing graduated circles, in the centre of which the eye must be
kept steady. In the <U+FB01>rst place, it is very di<U+FB02>icult to <U+FB01>x the head of the
observer so <U+FB01>rmly that he cannot alter its position during a continuous
series of observations, and that he reassumes exactly the same position of
the head when he returns to his measurements after a pause,—conditions
which must necessarily be ful<U+FB01>lled if the observations are to agree with
each other.       Secondly,    I have found that the eye must not be kept too
long    a time  in a  direction  which is near to the limits of the <U+FB01>eld of vision ;
else its muscles are fatigued, and the positions of the eyeball corresponding
to different directions of the visual line are somewhat altered.          But if we
have to measure angles on graduated circles, it is difficult to avoid keeping
the eye too long in directions deviating far from the primary direction.
    I  think that it depended upon these causes, that the observations carried
out by Meissner, Fick, and Wundt agreed very ill with each other and
with the law which I have explained above, and which was <U+FB01>rst stated by
 Professor Listing of Giittingen, but without any experimental proof.
                                 I
Happily it is possible, as found out, to prove the validity of this law by
a very simple method, which is not subject to those'_'sources of error I have
named, and which         I may be allowed to explain brie<U+FB02>y.
    In order to steady the attitude of the head in reference to the direction
of the visual line,      I have taken a little wooden board, one end of which is
hollowed into a curve <U+FB01>tting the arch of the human teeth; the margin of
this hollow is covered with sealing-wax, into which, after it had been
 softened by heat and had been cooled again su<U+FB01>iciently, I inserted both

      of my teeth, so that kept it <U+FB01>rmly between my jaws. The impres
sions of the teeth remain indented in the sealing-wax; and when   put          I
my teeth afterwards into these impressions,     I
                                               am sure that the little board
is brought exactly into the same  position, relatively to my head and my
eyes, as it was before.  On the other end of that little board, which is
kept horizontally between the teeth, a vertical piece of wood is fastened,
on which     I
             <U+FB01>x horizontally a little strip of card pointed at each end, so
that these two points are situated about <U+FB01>ve inches before my eyes, one
before the right eye, the other before the left.  The length of the strip of
card must be equal to the distance between the centres of the eyes, which
is 68 millimetres for my own eyes.      Looking now with the right eye in
the direction of the right point of that strip, and with the left eye in the
direction of the left point, I
                             am sure to bring the eyes always into the same
position relatively to my head, so long as the position      of the strip of card
on the wooden piece remains unaltered.
   As        of vision
         a <U+FB01>eld          I
                         use either a wall covered with a grey paper, in the
pattern of which horizontal and vertical lines can be easily perceived, or a
drawing-board   covered with grey drawing-paper, on which a system of
horizontal and vertical lines is drawn, as in <U+FB01>g. 1, and coloured stripes are
fastened along the line ab.
   Now the observer at <U+FB01>rst must endeavour to <U+FB01>nd out that position of
his eyes which we call the primary position. In order to do this, the ob
server takes the wooden piece between his teeth, and brings his head into
such a position that his right eye looks to the centre of the coloured stripes,
 in a direction perpendicular to the plane of the drawing.     Then he brings
 his head   into such an attitude that the right end  of the card-strip appears
 in the same direction as the centre of the coloured stripe.      After having
 steadily looked for some time to the middle of the coloured stripe, he turns
 away his gaze to the end of either the vertical or horizontal lines, ab, ed,
 which are drawn through the centre of the coloured stripe. There he will
 see an ocular spectrum of the coloured stripe, and will observe if it coin
  cides with the horizontal lines of the drawing.    If not, he must alter the
 position of the strip of card on the wooden bar to which it is fastened, till
  he <U+FB01>nds that the ocular spectrum of the coloured stripe remains horizontal
  when any point either of the line ab or cd is looked at.       When he has
  thus found the primary direction of his visual line for the right eye, he
  does the same for the left.
     The ocular spectra soon vanish, but they are easily renewed by looking
  again to the centre of the stripes.    Care must be taken that the observer
  looks always in a direction perpendicular to the plane of the drawing
  whenever he looks to the centre of the coloured stripe, and that he does
  not move his head. If he should have moved         it,
                                                       he would <U+FB01>nd      out im
                                                                          it
 mediately when he looks back to the strip, because the point of the card
 strip would no longer cover the centre of the coloured stripe.
    So you see that the primary direction of the visual line         is
                                                                completely

 <U+FB01>xed, and that the eye, which wants only to glance for an instant at a
 peripheral point of the drawing, and then goes back again to the centre,
 is not fatigued.
     This method of <U+FB01>nding the primary position of the eye proves at the
  same   time that vertical and horizontal lines keep their vertical or hori
 zontal position in the <U+FB01>eld of vision when the eye is moved from its pri
  mary direction vertically or horizontally; and you see, therefore, that
 these movements agree with the law which             I  have enunciated.    That is
 to say, during vertical movements of          the eye the vertical meridian plane
  keeps its vertical position, and during horizontal movements the horizontal
 meridian.
     Now you need only bring either your own head into an inclined position,
 or the diagram with the lines, and repeat the experiment, putting your
 head at <U+FB01>rst into such a position that the centre of the diagram corre
 sponds with the primary direction of the visual line, and moving after
 wards the eye along the lines a 6 or c d, in either a parallel or perpendicular
 direction to the coloured line of the diagram, and you will <U+FB01>nd the ocular
 spectrum of the coloured line coinciding with those black lines which
 are parallel with ab.         In this way, therefore, you can easily prove the
 law of Listing for every possible direction of the visual line.
     I found the results of these experiments in complete agreement with
 the law of Listing for my own eyes, and for those of several other persons
                                                                                      '
 with normal power of vision.          The eyes of very short-sighted persons, on
 the contrary,    often show    irregularities, which may be caused by the elon
 gation of the posterior part of those eyes.
    These motions of our eyes are a peculiar           instance  of motions which,
being quite voluntary, and produced by the action of our will, are never
theless limited as regards their extent and their combinations.             We <U+FB01>nd
similar limitations of motion of the eyes in other cases also. We cannot
turn one eye up, the other down; we cannot move both eyes at the same
time to the outer angle; we are obliged to combine always a certain de
gree of accommodation of the eyes to distance, with a certain angle of
convergence of their axes. . In these latter cases it can be proved that
the faculty of producing these motions is given to our will, although our
will is commonly not capable of using this faculty. We have come by
experience to move our eyes with great dexterity and readiness, so that
we see any visible object at the same time single and as accurately as
possible; this is the only end which we have learnt to reach by muscular
exertion   ; but we have not learnt to bring our eyes into any given position.
In    order to move them to the right, we must look to an object situated
on our right side, or imagine such an object and search for it with our
eyes.     We can move them both inwards, but only when we strive to look
at the back     of our   nose,    or at an imaginary object situated near that
place.     But commonly there is no object which could be seen single by
turning one eye upwards, the other downwards, or both of them out

 1864.]                   Human Eye in relation to Binocular             Vision.          193
 wards, and we are therefore unable to bring our eyes into such positions.
 But it is a well known fact, that when we look at stereoscopic pictures, and
 increase the distance of the pictures by degrees, our eyes follow the motion
 of the pictures, and that we are able to combine them into an apparently
 single object, although our eyes are obliged to turn into diverging direc
 tions.             Professor   Donders,_aswell as myself, has found that when we
 look to        a distant    object, and put before one of our eyes a prism of glass
 the refracting            angle of which is between 3 and 6 degrees, and turn the
 prism at <U+FB01>rst into such a position before the eye that its angle looks to the
 nose and the visual lines converge, we are able to turn the prism slowly,
 so  that its angle looks upwards or downwards, keeping all this time the
object apparently single at which we look.      But when we take away the
prism, so that the eyes must return to their normal position before they
can see the object single, we see the object double for a short time-one
image higher than the other.     The images approach after some seconds of
time and unite at last into one.
   By these experiments it is proved that we can move both eyes outward,
or one up and the other down, when we use them under such conditions
that such a position is required in order that we may see the objects single
at which we are looking.
      I
      have sometimes remarked that                   I
                                        saw double images of single objects,
when I was sleepy and tried to keep myself awake.        Of these images one
was sometimes higher than the other, and sometimes they were crossed,
one of them being rotated round the visual line.        In this state of the
brain, therefore, where our will begins to lose its power, and our muscles
are left to more involuntary and mechanical impulses, an abnormal rota
tion of the eye round the visual line is possible.    I infer also from this
observation, that the rotation of the eye round the visual axis cannot be
effected by our will, because we have not learnt by which exertion of our
will we are to effect             it,
                           and that the inability does not depend on any
anatomical structure either of our nerves or of our muscles which limits
the combination             of motion.       We should         expect, on the contrary, that,
                                                                                           if
such an anatomical mechanism existed,                    it   should come out more distinctly
when the will has lost its power.
  We may ask, therefore,       this  peculiar manner of moving the eyes,
                                        if
which     determined by the law of Listing,
               is                               produced by practical exer

cise on account of its affording any advantages to visual perceptions. And
I believe that certain advantages are indeed connected with it.
    We cannot rotate our eyes in the head, but we can rotate the head with
 the eyes. When we perform such          motion, looking steadily to the same
                                                 a
 point, we  remark that the visible objects turn apparently       little round a
 the <U+FB01>xed point, and we lose by such     motion of our eye the perception of
                                                 a
 the steadiness of the objects at which we look. Every position of the visual
line    connected with
          is              determined and constant degree of rotation, accord

ing to the law of Donders; and in altering this rotation we should judge
the position of external objects wrongly.
     The same will take place when we change the direction of the visual line.
 Suppose the amplitude of such motions to be in<U+FB01>nitely small; then we may
consider this part of the <U+FB01>eld of vision, and the corresponding part of the
retina on which       it is projected, as plane surfaces.   If during  any motion of
the eye the optic image is displaced so that in its new position it remains
parallel to its former position on the retina, we shall have no apparent mo
 tions of the objects.        When, on the contrary, the optic image of the visible
 objects is dislocated so that it is not parallel to its former position on the
 retina, we must expect to perceive an apparent rotation of the objects.
     As long as the motions of the eye describe in<U+FB01>nitely small angles, the eye
 can be moved in such a way that the optic image remains always parallel
 to its <U+FB01>rst position.        For this end the eye must be turned round axes of
 rotation which are perpendicular to the visual line ; and we see indeed that
 this is done, according to the law of Listing, when the eye is moving near
 its primary position.         But it is not possible to ful<U+FB01>l this condition com
 pletely when the eye is moved through a wider area which comprises a
 larger part of the spherical <U+FB01>eld of view.          For if we were to turn the eye
  always   round    an   axis  perpendicular  to the visual line, it would come into
 very diiferent positions after having been turned through different ways to
  the same <U+FB01>nal direction.
     The fault, therefore, which we should strive to avoid in the motions of
  our   eye, cannot be completely avoided, but it can be made as small as pos
  sible for the whole <U+FB01>eld of vision.
      The problem, to <U+FB01>nd such a law for the motions of the eye that the
  sum    of all the rotations round the visual line for all possible in<U+FB01>nitely
  small motions of the eye throughout the whole <U+FB01>eld of vision becomes a
  minimum, is a problem to be solved by the calculus of variations.            I have
  found that the solution for a circular <U+FB01>eld of vision, which corresponds
  nearly to the forms of the actual <U+FB01>eld of vision, gives indeed the law of
  Listing.
      I conclude    from these researches, that the actual mode of moving the
  eye is  that  mode by which the perception of the steadiness of the objects
  through the whole <U+FB01>eld of vision can be kept up the best; and I suppose,
  therefore, that this mode of motion is produced by experience and exercise,
  because    it is the best suited for accurate perception of the position of ex
   ternal objects.
      But in this mode      of moving, rotations round the visual line are not com
  pletely avoided when the eye is moved in a circular direction round the
  primary position of the visual line ; and it is easy to recognize that in such
   a case we are subject to optical illusions.
      Turn your eyes to a horizontal line situated in the highest part of the
    <U+FB01>eld of vision, and let them follow this line from one end to the other.

The line will appear like               a curved line, the convexity          of which looks down
ward.    When you look to its right extremity, it seems to rise from the left
to the right; when you look to the left extremity of the line, theleft end
seems to rise.   In the same way, all straight lines which go through the
 peripheral parts of the <U+FB01>eld of vision appear to be curved, and to change
their position       a    little,   if you   look to their upper or their lower ends.
   This explanation relates only to Monocular vision;                           we have to    inquire
also how it in<U+FB02>uences Binocular vision.
   Each eye has its <U+FB01>eld of vision, on which the visible objects appear dis
tributed like the objects of a picture, and the two <U+FB01>elds with their images
seem to be superimposed.     Those points of both <U+FB01>elds of view which ap
pear to be superimposed are called corresponding (or identical) points.
If we look at real objects, the accurate perception of the superimposition
of two di<U+FB01>'erent optical images is hindered by the perception of stereoscopic
form and depth; and we unite indeed, as Mr. Wheatstone has shown, two
retinal images completely into the perception of one single body, without
being able to perceive the duplicity of the images, even if there are very sen
sible di<U+FB01>"erences of their form and dimensions.    To avoid this, and to <U+FB01>nd
those points of both <U+FB01>elds of view which correspond with each other, it is
necessary to use <U+FB01>gures which cannot easily be united into one stereoscopic
projection.
   In <U+FB01>g. 2 you see such <U+FB01>gures, the right of which is drawn with white
lines on a black ground, the left with black lines on awhite ground. The
horizontal lines of both <U+FB01>gures are parts of the same straight lines ; the
vertical lines are not perfectly vertical.  The upper end of those of the
right <U+FB01>gure is inclined to the right, that of the left <U+FB01>gure to the left, by
about      1-}   degree.
     Now I beg you to look alternately with the right and with the left eye
at these <U+FB01>gures.   You will <U+FB01>nd that the angles of the right <U+FB01>gure appear
to the right eye equal to right angles, and those of the left <U+FB01>gure so appear
to the left eye but the angles of the left <U+FB01>gure appear to the right eye to

   1864.]          Human Eye in relation to Binocular        Vision.          197
   time  looking down at a near object, as in reading or writing, I found some
   times that the horizontal lines of <U+FB01>g. 2 crossed each other; but they be
   came parallel again when      I had looked for some time at distant objects.
      In order to de<U+FB01>ne the position of the corresponding points in both <U+FB01>elds
   of vision, let us suppose the observer looking to the centres of the two sides
   of <U+FB01>g. 2, and uniting both pictures stereoscopically.     Then planes may be
  laid through the horizontal and vertical lines of each picture and the
  centre of the corresponding         eye.    The planes laid through the dif
  ferent horizontal lines will include angles between them, which we may call
  angles of altitude; and we may consider as their zero the plane going
  through the <U+FB01>xed point and the horizontal meridian.           The planes going
  through the vertical lines include other angles, which may be called angles
  of longitude, their zero coinciding also with the <U+FB01>xed point and with the
  apparently vertical meridian.       Then the stereoscopic combination of those
  diagrams shows that those points correspond which have the same angles
  of altitude and the same angles of longitude; and we can use this result
  of the experiment     as a de<U+FB01>nition  of corresponding points.
      We are accustomed to call Horopter the aggregate of all those points of
  the space which are projected on corresponding points of the retinae.
 After having settled how to de<U+FB01>ne the position of corresponding points, the
  question, what is the form and situation of the Horopter, is only a geome
 trical question.                                       I
                       With reference to the results had obtained in regard
 to the positions of the eye belonging to different directions of the visual
 lines,   I have  calculated   the form   of the Horopter, and found that   gene
 rally the Horopter is      a line of double curvature produced by the inter
 section    of two hyperboloids, and that in some exceptional cases this line of
 double curvature can be changed into a combination of two plane curves.
     That is to say, when the point of convergence is situated in the middle
 plane     of the head, the Horopter is composed of a straight line drawn
 through the point of convergence, and of a conic section going through
 the centre of both eyes and intersecting the straight line.
     When the point of convergence is situated in the plane which contains
 the primary directions of both the visual lines, the Horopter is a circle
 going through that point and through the centres of both eyes and a
 straight line intersecting the circle.
     When the point of convergence is situated as well in the middle plane of
the head as in the plane of the primary directions of the visual lines, the
Horopter is composed of the circle         I  have just described, and a straight
line going through that point.
     There is only one case in which the Horopter is really a plane, as it was
supposed to be in every instance byAguilonius, the inventor of that name,
namely, when the point of convergence is situated in the middle plane of
the head and at an in<U+FB01>nite distance. Then the Horopter is a plane
parallel to the visual lines, and situated beneath them, at a certain distance
which depends upon the angle between the really and apparently vertical

meridians, and which is nearly as great as the distance of the feet of
the observer from his eyes when he is standing.     Therefore, when we look
straight forward to a point of the horizon, the Horopter is a horizontal plane
going through our         is the ground upon which we are standing.

   Formerly physiologists believed that the Horopter was an in<U+FB01>nitely
distant plane when we looked to an in<U+FB01>nitely distant point. The di<U+FB01>‘er
ence of our present conclusion is consequent upon the difference between
the position of the really and apparently vertical meridians, which they did
                                                                  "
not know.
   When we look, not to an in<U+FB01>nitely distant horizon, but to any point of
the ground upon which we stand which is equally distant from both our
eyes, the Horopter is not a plane; but the straight line which is one of its
parts coincides completely with the horizontal plane upon which we are
Standing.
   The form and situation of the Horopter is                     of great practical importance
for the accuracy of our visual perceptions, as                   I have   found.
     Take  straight wire—a knitting-needle for instance—and bend it a little
            a

Hold this wire with outstretched arm in a nearly perpendicular position
before you, so that both its halves are situated in the middle plane of your
head, and the wire appears to both your eyes nearly as a straight line.
In this position of the wire you can distinguish whether the angle of the
wire is turned towards your face or away from                     it,

binocular vision with the greatest degree of certainty and accuracy (and
indeed with an astonishing degree of accuracy) when the line of the three
pin coincides with the direction of the circle which                 part of the

Horopter.
  From these observations                it   follows   that the forms and the distances        of
those objects which are situated in, or very nearly in, the Horopter, are
perceived with     greater degree of accuracy than the same forms and
                      a

result to those cases in which the ground whereon we stand is the plane of
the Horopter, it follows that, looking straight forward to the horizon we
can  distinguish the inequalities and the distances of different parts of the
ground better than other objects of the same kind and distance.
   This is actually true. We can observe it very conspicuously when we
look to a plain and open country with very distant bills, at <U+FB01>rst in the
natural position, and afterwards with the head inclined or inverted, looking
under the arm or between our legs, as painters sometimes do in order
to                 the colours of the landscape better.  Comparing the aspect
of the distant parts of the ground, you will <U+FB01>nd that we perceive very
well that they are level and stretched out into a great distance in the
natural position of your head, but that they seem to ascend to the horizon
and to be much shorter and narrower when we look at them with the head
inverted: we get the same appearance also when our head remains in its
natural position, and we look to the distant objects through two rectangular
prisms, the hypothenuses of which are fastened on a horizontal piece of
wood, and which show inverted images of the objects.        But when we invert
our head, and invert at the same time also the landscape by the prisms, we
have again the natural view and the accurate perception of distances as in
the natural position of our head, because then the apparent situation of
the ground is again the plane of the Horopter of our eyes.
   The alteration of colour in the distant parts of a landscape when viewed
with inverted head, or in an inverted optical image, can be explained,       I
think, by the defective perception of distance.         The alterations of the
colour of really distant objects produced by the opacity of the air, are well
known to us, and appear as a natural sign of distance; but if the same
alterations are found on objects apparently less distant, the alteration of
colour appears unusual, and is more easily perceived.
   It is evident that this very accurate perception of the form and the
distances of the ground, even when viewed indirectly, is a great advantage,
because by means of this arrangement of our eyes we are able to look at
distant objects, without turning our eyes to the ground, when we walk.

but   n>3, there will exist in general concomitants of the intermediate
       if
species.
     There       is      an obvious difference between covariants and contravariants on
the one hand,                and the intermediate                     concomitants          on the other.              The

its primitive; in an intermediate concomitant, the number of indeterminates
is always greater than in its primitive. Again, to every metamorphic of                                                         a
covariant or contravariant,      there corresponds  metamorphic of its primi      a
tive   ;   whereas, in the case of   concomitant of the intermediate order
                                                  a                                                                       i,    a
metamorphic of the primitive will correspond, not to every metamorphic
of the concomitant, but only to such metamorphics as result from trans
formations the matrices of which are the ith derived matrices of matrices
of order n.
     It    is   also obvious that, besides the 12-1 species of concomitance here
de<U+FB01>ned, there are, when n            >3, an in<U+FB01>nite number of other species of
                                            is
concomitance of the same general nature.    For from any derived matrix
we may form another derived matrix, and so on continually; and to
every such process of derivation   distinct species of concomitance will

many researches; in what follows,       employed to obtain   de<U+FB01>nition of

For the index of inertia we may take the number of the positive squares ;
it is equal to the number of continuations of sign in a series of ascending
principal minors of the matrix of the quadratic form, the series com
mencing with unity, i. e. with a minor of order 0, and each minor being
so taken as to contain that which precedes it in the series (see Professor
Sylvester
            “ On Formulae connected with Sturm’s Theorem,” Phil. Trans.
vol. cxliii. p. 481). The distribution of these forms into Orders depends
on the following principle                           :—
    “Two forms belong to the same order when the primary and secondary
 divisors of their corresponding concomitants are identica .”
   Since, as has been just pointed out, there are, beside the fundamental
 concomitants, an in<U+FB01>nite number of other concomitants, it is important to
 know whether, in order to obtain the distribution into orders, it    or                                                              is,           is
not, necessary to consider those other concomitants.  With regard to the
primary  divisors,   can be shown that
                               it             unnecessary to consider any          it    is
concomitants other than the fundamental ones;      e.  can be shown that                            i.      it
the equality iof the primary divisors of the corresponding fundamental
concomitants of two quadratic forms, implies the equality of the primary
divisors of all their corresponding concomitants. And      probable (but                                         it    is
it   seems       di<U+FB02>icult to prove) that the                               same         thing       is   true for the secondary
divisors also.
   Con<U+FB01>ning our attention (in the next place) to the forms contained in
any given order, we proceed to indicate the principle from which the sub
division of that order into genera  deducible.                        is

respect of the particular characters deducible from their fundamental con-~

  II.  “On   some Phenomena exhibited by Gun-cotton              and Gunpowder
        under special conditions of Exposure to Heat.”            By F. A. ABEL,
        F.R.S. Received March 29, 1864.
                                      I
     The experiments upon which have been engaged for some time past, in
  connexion with the manufacture and properties of gun-cotton, have brought
 under my notice some interesting points in the behaviour of both gun
 cotton and gunpowder, when exposed to high temperatures, under parti
 cular conditions.    I believe that these phenomena have not been previously
 observed, at any rate to their full extent, and       I therefore venture to lay
 before the Royal Society a brief account of them.
     Being anxious to possess some rapid method of testing the uniformity
  of products obtained by carrying out General von Lenk’s system of manu
 facture of gun-cotton, I instituted experiments for the purpose of ascer
 taining whether, by igniting equal weights of gim-cotton of the same com
 position, by voltaic agency, within a partially exhausted vessel connected
 with a barometric tube,      I  could rely upon obtaining a uniform depression
 of the mercurial    column,    in di<U+FB02>'erent experiments made in atmospheres of
 uniform rarefaction, and whether slight differences in the composition of
 the gun-cotton would be indicated, with su<U+FB02>icient accuracy, by a corre
 Bponding difference in the volume of gas disengaged, or in the depression
 of the mercury.      I found that, provided the mechanical condition of the
 gun-cotton,   and its  position with reference to the source of heat, were in
 all instances the same, the indications     furnished by these experiments were
 su<U+FB02>iciently accurate for practical purposes.        Each experiment was made
 with <U+FB01>fteen grains of gun-cotton, which were wrapped compactly round the
 platinum wire; the apparatus was exhausted until the column of mercury
 was raised to a height varying from 29 inches to 29'5 inches.          The <U+FB02>ash
 which accompanied the de<U+FB02>agration of the gun-cotton was apparently
 similar to that observed upon its ignition in open air ; but it was noticed
 that an interval of time always occurred between the <U+FB01>rst application of
 heat (or incandescence of the wire) and the <U+FB02>ashing of the gun-cotton, and
that during this interval there was a very perceptible fall of the column of
mercury.      On several occasions, when the gun-cotton, in the form of
 " roving,” or loosely twisted strand, was only laid over the wire, so that it
hung down on either side, the red-hot wire simply cut it into two pieces,
which fell to the bottom of the exhausted vessel, without continuing to
burn. As these results appeared to indicate that the eifects of heat upon
gun-cotton, in a highly rare<U+FB01>ed atmosphere, differed importantly from
those observed under ordinary circumstances, or in a ‘very imperfect va
cuum, a series    of experiments, under variously modi<U+FB01>ed conditions, was
instituted,  of which the following are the most important.
    It was found in numerous experiments, made with proportions of gun
 cotton varying from one to two grains, in the form ofa loose twist laid
 double, that in highly rare<U+FB01>ed atmospheres
                                                     (the pressure being varied

from   I to 8 in inches of mercury) the gun-cotton, when ignited by        means‘
of the platinum wire, burned very slowly, presenting by daylight an appear
ance as if it smouldered, with little or no <U+FB02>ame attending the combustion.
I  was at  <U+FB01>rst led by these results to conjecture    that this peculiar kind   of
combustion     of the gun-cotton    was determined solely by its ignition Qin
atmospheres rare<U+FB01>ed beyond       a  certain              I
                                             limit; and was induced, in con
sequence, to institute a number of experiments with the view of ascertain
ing what was the most highly rare<U+FB01>ed atmosphere in which gun-cotton
would burn as in the open air——with a <U+FB02>ash, accompanied by a body of
bright <U+FB02>ame.      In order to ensure uniformity in the degree of heat applied
to the   cotton in these experiments, the platinum wire employed was suffi
ciently  thin  to be instantaneously melted on the passage of the voltaic
current.    About <U+FB01>fty different experiments were made with equal quanti
ties of gun-cotton (0'2 grain), placed always in the same position, so that
the platinum wire rested upon the material.         A tolerably de<U+FB01>nite limit of
the degree of rarefaction was arrived at, within which the gun-cotton was
exploded instantaneously, as in the open air. When the pressure of air
in the apparatus was reduced to 8'2 in inches of mercury, the gun-cotton
still exploded with a <U+FB02>ash, but not quite instantaneously;       on reducing the
pressure to 8   inches, the cotton  underwent   the slow   kind of combustion in
the majority of cases; on a few occasions it exploded with a <U+FB02>ash of <U+FB02>ame.
The same occurred in a succession of experiments, until the pressure was
reduced gradually to 77 inches, when instances of the rapid explosion           of
gun-cotton were no longer obtained.                                         -
   Although these results were moderately de<U+FB01>nite when the conditions of
the experiments    were as nearly as possible uniform, it was found that they
could be altered by slight modi<U+FB01>cations of any one particular condition
(such as the quantity of gun-cotton, its- mechanical condition, its position
with reference to the source of heat, the quantity of heat applied, and the
duration of its application).     In illustration of this, the following results
may be quoted.
    If the gun-cotton was wrapped       round, instead of being simply placed
across the wire, its instantaneous combustion was effected in atmospheres
                                                                            "'
considerably more rare<U+FB01>ed than with the above experiments.                       a
    In employing a small piece of gun-cotton (03 of an inch long and
weighing 0'3 to 0'4 of a grain) loosely twisted, laid across the wire, or
upon a support immediately beneath the latter so that the wire rested
upon it, the slow combustion established in it by the heated wire, under
greatly diminished atmospheric pressure (amounting to 0'6 inch in this and
the following experiments), proceeded uniformly towards each end of the
piece of twist, until the whole was transformed into gas.          But if a piece
of the same twist, of considerably greater length (say 4 inches long and
weighing about 2 grains), was exposed to heat in an atmosphere of the
same rarefaction, the gun-cotton being laid over the wire and hanging
down on either side, it was cut through by the passage of the current, and

 206                    Mr. Abel    on the Combustion   of            [April 22,
 the two pieces, falling to the bottom of the vessel, ceased to burn almost
 immediately.      Of a piece of gun-cotton weighing 2'17 grains, there re
 mained unohanged 1'80 gr.; the quantity burned amounted therefore to
 0'37 g1'., and corresponded closely to the quantity which was completely
 burned in the preceding experiments.          (The depression of the mercurial
 column    in this experiment, by the gases generated from the gun-cotton,
 amounted to 0'2 inch.)
    A piece of the twist, IQ inch long, was placed across the wire, and
 supported by a plate of plaster of Paris, <U+FB01>xed immediately beneath it. The
 current was established to an extent just su<U+FB01>icient to heat the wire to the
 point of ignition of the gun-cotton, and then interrupted.           The twist
 burned slowly in both directions until about a quarter of an inch was con
  sumed on either side of the wire, when the combustion ceased.             The
 same result was obtained in repetitions of the experiment,    the wire being at
 once raised to a red heat, and thus maintained until the gun-cotton ceased
 to burn.    But upon increasing the battery-power, doubling the thickness
 of the wire, and maintaining the heat, while a similar piece of twist was
 burning in both directions, the slow combustion continued until the entire
 quantity was transformed into gas.        The same result was obtained by re
peating this experiment with similar and larger quantities of gun-cotton,
 placed in the same position as before with reference to the wire.
     In the next experiment, the mass of cotton exposed at one time to heat
 was increased by doubling a piece of the twist (4 inches long) and laying
 it thus doubled across the wire, as before. The current was allowed to
 pass until the wire was heated just suf<U+FB01>eiently to ignite the gun-cotton,
 and then interrupted.     In this case the slow combustion proceeded through
 out the entire mass   of the cotton.   The permanent depression of merciny in
 this experiment was 0'6 inch. It was particularly noticed on this occasion,
 that, as the decomposition of the gun-cotton crept slowly along the mass,
 the burning portions or extremities of twist were surrounded by a beautiful
 green light, more like a phosphorescence than a <U+FB02>ame, and in form some
 thing similar to the brush of an,electric discharge.
    Eight inches of the twist were laid fourfold over the wire, which was
 heated just su<U+FB02>iciently to ignite the cotton.    The decomposition proceeded,
 as before, gradually throughout the mass        of the gun-cotton, but became
 somewhat more rapid towards the end, when the green glow, observed at
 <U+FB01>rst, was superseded by a pale yellowish lambent <U+FB02>ame, very di<U+FB01>'erent in
 appearance from the <U+FB02>ame which accompanies the combustion of gun-cot
 ton under ordinary conditions.       The permanent depression of the column
 of mercury in this experiment was 1-2 inch.
    The various modi<U+FB01>cations     in the nature and extent of combustion which
 gun-cotton may be made to undergo, as demonstrated by the above experi
 ments, when exposed to heat in highly rare<U+FB01>ed atmospheres under variously
  modi<U+FB01>ed conditions, are evidently due to the same causes which affect the
  rate of combustion of fuses under different atmospheric pressures, and which

have already been pointed out by Frankland in his interesting paper on the
in<U+FB02>uence of atmospheric pressure upon some of the phenomena of combus
tion.     The heat furnished by an incandescent or melting platinum wire is
greatly in excess of that required to induce perfect combustion in gun
cotton which isfactually in contact with, or in close proximity to it; and the
heat resulting from this combustion, which is contained in the products of
the change,      will su<U+FB02>ice to cause the transformation   of the explosion topro
 ceed from particle to particle.       But if  the pressure of the atmosphere in
which the gun-cotton is submitted to the action of heat be reduced, the
 gases   resulting from the combustion of the particles nearest to the source of
heat _will have a tendency, proportionate to the degree of rarefaction of the
 air, to pass away into space, and thus to convey away from proximity to the
 cotton, more or less rapidly and completely, the heat necessary to carry on
 the combustion established in the <U+FB01>rst particles.         Thus, when the heated
 wire is enveloped in a considerable body of gun-cotton, the ignition of the
 entire mass is apparently not instantaneous, if attempted in a highly rare<U+FB01>ed
 atmosphere, because the products of the combustion <U+FB01>rst established in the
 centre of the mass of gun-cotton escape rapidly into space, conveying away
 from the point of combustion the heat essential for its full maintenance ;
 the gun-cotton therefore undergoes at <U+FB01>rst an imperfect form of combus
 tion, or a kind of metamorphosis different from the normal result of the
 action of heat upon this material.       But the e<U+FB01>'ects of the gradual generation
  of heated gases from the interior of the mass of cotton are, to impart some
  of their heat to the material through which they have to escape, as well as
  gradually to increase the pressure of the atmosphere in the vessel, and thus
  to diminish the rapidity of their escape; hence a condition of things is in
  time arrived at when the remainder of the gim-cotton undergoes the ordi
  nary metamorphosis, a result which is accelerated by maintaining the
  original source of heat.       If, however,   the gun-cotton be employed in a
  compact form (in the form of twist or thread), and placed only in contact
  with the source of heat at one point, the heat will be so effectually conveyed
  away by the escaping gases, that the material will undergo even what may
  be termed the secondary combustion or metamorphosis for a limited pe
  riod only ; so that, if a su<U+FB02>icient length of gun-cotton be employed, it will
  after a short time cease to burn, even imperfectly, because the heat essen
  tial for the maintenance of any chemical activity is soon completely abs
   tracted by the escaping gases.       These results may obviously be modi<U+FB01>ed in
  various ways, as shown in the experiments described : thus, by increasing
   and maintaining the source of heat independent of the burning cotton, the
   slow combustion     may be maintained through a much greater length of the‘
  material until the pressure of the atmosphere is increased, by the products
   disengaged, to an extent su<U+FB02>icient to admit of a more rapid and perfect
   metamorphosis      being established in the remainder of the material ; or the
   same result may be attained, independently of the continued application of
   external  heat,   by employing     a thicker mass of cotton. or by using the

  208                    Mr. Abel     on the Combustion        of               [April 21,
  material in a less compact form.          In these cases the maintenance of the
   chemical change is favoured either by radiation of heat to the cotton, and
  provision of additional heat, from an external source, to the gases as they
   escape and expand, or by establishing        the change in a greater mass of the
  material, and thus reducing the rapidity with which the heat will be con
  veyed away by the escaping gases, or, <U+FB01>nally, by allowing the gases, as they
  escape, to pass to some extent between the <U+FB01>bres of the cotton, and thus
  favouring the transmission of heat to individual particles of the material.
      In the description of the two experiments last referred to above, I have
  stated that some peculiar phenomena were observed to attend the imperfect
  kind of combustion induced in the gun-cotton in rare<U+FB01>ed atmospheres.
      In  order to examine these phenomena more closely, I instituted a series of
  experiments, in a darkened room, with equal quantities of gun-cotton ($
  inch of twist=0'3 gr.) placed always in the same position, across the
  platinum wire, the only varying element in the experiment being the
  pressure of the atmosphere in the vessel, which was gradually increased.
 The following were the results observed :—
     Experiment I.-—Pressure=0'62 inch.              The wire was heated just suffi
 ciently to ignite the     material;     the   current was then interrupted.           The
 gun-cotton     burned  very  slowly  in  both   directions,  emitting only      the small
 green phosphorescent      <U+FB02>ame, or brush, already described.
     Exp. II.—Pressure=l        inch. In addition to the green glow which sur
 rounded the burning ends, a very faint yellowish <U+FB02>ame was observed hover
 ing over the gun-cotton.
     Exp. I1I.—Pressure=l'5 inch.             The cotton burned      a  little faster, and
 the faint yellowish <U+FB02>ame was of a more decided character             ; indeed two sepa
 rate <U+FB02>ames were observed, each following up the green light as the cotton
 burned in the two directions.
     Earp.  IV.—Pressure=2 inches.           The results were the same as in the
 preceding experiment,      excepting   that    the yellowish <U+FB02>ames became more
 marked.
     Earp.  V.—Pressure=2'5 inches.            The   same    phenomena,       the   cotton
 burning considerably     faster.
    Exp. VI.—Pressure=3 inches.             The  same phenomena, the        yellow <U+FB02>ames
increasing in size.
     Exp. VII.—Pressure=4 inches.             The rapidity of combustion            of the
cotton increased again considerably       ; the other phenomena observed were as
before.
    Exp. VIII.--Pressure=6 inches.             The pale yellow <U+FB02>ame had increased
in   size considerably, no longer forming a tongue, as in the preceding experi
ments, but completely        enveloping the burning ends of the gun-cotton.
The green glow, though much reduced, was still observed immediately
round the burning surfaces.
     Exp. IX.—Pressure=8 inches.             The green glow was only just percep
 tible in this instance, and the cotton burned very rapidly, almost with the

ordinary <U+FB02>ash      ;  but the <U+FB02>ame was still of a pale yellow. In the preceding
experiments      clouds  of white vapour were observed after the decomposition
of the gun-cotton; in this and the following experiments this white vapour
was produced in much smaller proportion.
   Ezpta. X. to XV. inclu.n've.—Pressure=l0, 12, I4, 18, 20, 24 inches.
The phenomena observed in these experiments did not differ in any im
portant degree from those of Experiment IX.
    Esp. XVI.—The         same pressure (24   inches) was employed as in the last
experiment, but the piece of gun-cotton-twist was laid double across the
wire.     In this instance the gun-cotton burned with a bright yellow <U+FB02>ash,
as in open air.
   Earp. XVII.—Pressure= 26 inches.             The gun-cotton was laid singly
over the wire, as in all experiments but the last. It burned with a <U+FB02>ash 0
bright light, as in open air.
    It appears from these experiments that gun-cotton, when ignited in small
quantities in rare<U+FB01>ed atmospheres, may exhibit, during its combustion, three
distinct luminous phenomena. In the most highly rare<U+FB01>ed atmospheres, the
only indication of combustion is a beautiful green glow or phosphorescence
which surrounds the extremity of the gun-cotton as it is slowly transformed
into gases or vapours. » When the pressure of the atmosphere is increased to
one inch (with the proportion of gun-cotton indicated), a faint yellow <U+FB02>ame
appears at a short distance from the point of decomposition; and as the
pressure is increased this pale yellow <U+FB02>ame increases in size, and eventually
appears quite to obliterate the green light.          Lastly, when the pressure of
the atmosphere and consequently proportion of the oxygen in the con
<U+FB01>ned space is considerable, the cotton burns with the ordinary bright yellow
<U+FB02>ame.      There can    be no doubt  that this <U+FB01>nal result is due to the almost in
stantaneous secondary combustion, in the air supplied, of the in<U+FB02>ammable
gases evolved by the explosion of the gun-cotton.           It was thought that the
pale yellow <U+FB02>ame described might also be due to a combustion (in the air
still contained in the vessel) of portions of the gases resulting from the de
composition of the gun-cotton ; but a series of experiments, in which
nitrogen, instead of air, constituted the rare<U+FB01>ed atmosphere, showed that
this could not be the case.       The results obtained in these experiments cor
responded closely to those above described, as far as relates to the produc
tion of the green glow and of the pale yellow <U+FB02>ame.             With rare<U+FB01>ed atmo
 spheres   of  nitrogen ranging   down   to one  inch  of pressure, the green <U+FB02>ame
was alone obtained;        and the pale yellow <U+FB02>ame, accompanying the green,
 became very marked at a pressure of 3 inches, as in the experiments with
 air.
    Itwould     seem probable from     these results, that the mixture   of gaseous
 products obtained by the peculiar change which heat effects in gun-cotton
 in highly rare<U+FB01>ed atmospheres, contains not only combustible bodies, such
 as carbonic     oxide, but also a small proportion of oxidizing gas (possibly
 protoxide    of  nitrogen, or even oxygen), and that when the pressure of the

properties, retains su<U+FB02>icient heat as it escapes, to burn, more or less com
pletely, according to the degree of rarefaction      of the atmosphere.
   A series of experiments instituted with gim-cotton in highly rare<U+FB01>ed
atmospheres of oxygen, showed that the additional proportion of this gas
thus introduced into the apparatus, beyond that which would have been
contained in it with the employment of air of the same rarefaction, affected
in a very important manner the behaviour of the explosion under the in
<U+FB02>uence of heat.        If
                     eight or ten grains of gun-cotton are placed round the
platinum wire, and the pressure of the atmosphere of oxygen in the vessel
be reduced to four or three (in inches of mercury), the cotton explodes in
stantaneously, with an intensely bright <U+FB02>ash, when the wire is heated.    In
a series   of experiments made under gradually diminished pressures, oxygen
being used instead of air, it was found that the gum-cotton exploded instan
taneously, with a bright <U+FB02>ash, until the pressure was reduced to 1'2 inch           ;
from this pressure to that of 0'8 inch it still burned with a <U+FB02>ash, but not
instantaneously;  and at pressures below 0'8 inch it no longer burned with
a bright <U+FB02>ash, but exhibited the comparatively slow combustion, accom
panied by the pale yellow <U+FB02>ame, which has been spoken of as observed
when gun-cotton was ignited       in air rare<U+FB01>ed to pressures ranging from   1   inch
to 24 inches.
  The interesting phenomena exhibited by gun-cotton in highly rare<U+FB01>ed
atmospheres, induced me to make some experiments of a corresponding
nature with gunpowder.    The same apparatus was used as in the preceding
experiments, but  a small  glass cup was <U+FB01>xed immediately beneath the
platinum wire, so that, by bending the latter in the centre, it was made to
dip into the cup, and could be covered by grains of gunpowder.
   Two grains’ weight of small grain gunpowder were heaped over the wire,
and the pressure of air in the apparatus was reduced to 0'65 inch.     The
wire being heated to redness, three or four grains, in immediate proximity
to it,fused in short time and appeared to boil, evolving yellowish vapours,
                a
no doubt of sulphur.    After the heat had been continued for eight or ten
seconds, those particular grains de<U+FB02>agrated, and the remainder of the
powder was scattered by the slight explosion, without being ignited.    No
appreciable depression of the mercurial column occurred during the evolu
tion of the yellowish vapours   the permanent depression, after the de<U+FB02>a
                                  ;
gration, was only 0'15 inch.
  The experiment was repeated with small-grain gunpowder, amounting to
four grains, and the same phenomena were observed, with this difference,
that second slight de<U+FB02>agration followed shortly after the <U+FB01>rst, probably in
    a
consequence   of  grain or two of the powder falling back into the cup.
                   a
   A single piece of gunpowder, weighing 14 grains, so shaped as to remain
in good contact with the wire, was placed over the latter, being supported
by the cup. The pressure of air in the apparatus was, as before, equal to
 0'65 inch of mercury.    There was no perceptible effect for     short time
                                                                   a

after the wire was <U+FB01>rst heated to redness;       vapours of sulphur were then
given off, and slight scintillations   were occasionally observed ; after a time
the wire became deeply buried in the superincumbent mass of gunpowder,
which fused, and appeared to boil, where it was in actual contact with the
source   of heat. A<U+FB01>er the lapse of three minutes from the commencement
of the experiment, the powder de<U+FB02>agrated.    The permanent depression of
the   mercury column amounted to 1'35 inch.
     The experiment was repeated with a similar piece of powder, weighing
16 grains ; the same phenomena were observed; and <U+FB01>ve minutes elapsed
between the <U+FB01>rst heating of the wire and the de<U+FB02>agration of the powder.
   The experiments were continued with <U+FB01>ne-grained gunpowder, and under
pressures gradually increased, in successive experiments, from '07 to 3 in
inches of mercury.   The same weight of gimpowder (4 grains) was used in
all the experiments.  In those made under a pressure of 1 inch, the results
observed were similar to those obtained in the <U+FB01>rst experiments;     single
grains of gunpowder were successively de<U+FB02>agrated, burning very slowly,
and scattering but never igniting contiguous grains of powder. Eventually,
after the lapse of from ten to twenty seconds, 3 or 4 grains were de<U+FB01>a
grated at once, the remainder of the powder being thereby projected from
the cup. At a pressure of 1'5 inch, the same phenomena were observed,
but the successive de<U+FB02>agrations of fused grains of powder followed more
quickly upon each other, and the <U+FB01>nal ignition of several together occurred
in about ten seconds after the wire was <U+FB01>rst heated. At a pressure of 2
inches, at <U+FB01>rst only one or two of the fused grains were ignited, singly;
and several were de<U+FB01>agrated together after the lapse of <U+FB01>ve seconds. A
larger quantity of the powder was burned, but a portion was projected
from the cup as in preceding experiments.   At a pressure of 3 inches, no
grains were ignited singly; the combustion of the powder was effected
after an interval of about four seconds, and the greater portion was burned ;
the combustion,  though it had gradually become more similar to that of
gunpowder in open air, was still very slow.
   Experiments made with gunpowder in highly rare<U+FB01>ed atmospheres of
nitrogen furnished results quite similar to those described; nor was any
important difference in the character of the phenomena observed when
oxygen was substituted for air, except that the scintillations and de<U+FB02>agra
tions of the powder-grains were in some instances somewhat more bril
liant.
   The above experiments show that, when gunpowder is in contact with an
incandescent wire in a highly rare<U+FB01>ed atmosphere, the heat        is,
                                                                 in the <U+FB01>rst
instance, abstracted to so great an extent by the volatilization of the sul
phur, that the particles of powder cannot be raised to the temperature
necessary for their ignition, until at any rate the greater part of that ele
ment has been expelled from the mixture, in consequence of which the por
tions <U+FB01>rst acted upon by heat will have become less explosive in their cha
racter, and require, therefore,   a   higher temperature for their ignition than
                                                                   R.   2

in their original condition.     The effect of the continued application of heat
to the powder thus changed is, to fuse the saltpetre and to establish che
mical action between it and the charcoal, which, however, only gradually
and occasionally becomes so energetic as to be accompanied by de<U+FB02>agration,
because the gas disengaged by the oxidation of the charcoal continues to
convey away much of the heat applied, in escaping into the rare<U+FB01>ed space.
For the     same reason, the grains of unaltered powder which are in actual
contact with the de<U+FB02>agrating particles are not ignited by the heat resulting
from the combustion, but are simply scattered by the rush of escaping
 gases, at any rate   until the pressure in the vessel has been so far increased
 by their generation as to diminish the rapidity and extent of their expan
 sion at the moment of their escape.       The disengagement, <U+FB01>rst of sulphur
 vapour    and  then  of gaseous products of chemical change, unattended by
 phenomena of combustion, when gunpowder is maintained in contact with
 ared-hot wire in very highly rare<U+FB01>ed atmospheres, are results quite in har
 mony with the observations made by Mitchell, Frankland, and Dufour, with
 regard to the retarding in<U+FB02>uence of diminished atmospheric pressure upon
 the combustion of fuses.       The phenomena described are most strikingly
 exhibited by operating upon single masses of gunpowder, of some size, in the
 manner directed above, when the application of the red-hot wire may be con
 tinued from three to <U+FB01>ve minutes (the gases disengaged during that period
 depressing the column of mercury from 05 to 0'7 inch) before the mass is
 ignited.     There is no doubt that the products of decomposition of the gun
 powder, obtained under these circumstances, differ greatly from those which
 result from its explosion in con<U+FB01>ned spaces or in the open air under ordi
 nary atmospheric conditions.        In all the experiments conducted in the
 most highly rare<U+FB01>ed atmospheres (at pressures of 0'5 to 1'5 in inches of
 mercury), the contents of the vessel, after the <U+FB01>nal de<U+FB02>agration of the
 powder, always possessed a very peculiar odour, similar to that of horse
 radish, due to the production of some sulphur-compound; nitrous acid
 was also very generally observed among the products.          It is readily con
 ceivable that the chemical action established between the constituents of
 gunpowder, under the circumstances described, must be of a very imperfect
 or partial character, the conditions under which it is established being un
  favourable to its energetic development.
     In describing the phenomena which accompany the ignition of gun
  cotton in atmospheres of different rarefaction,    I have pointed out that, at
  pressures varying from one to twenty-four in inches of mercury, a pale
 yellow <U+FB02>ame         observed, which increased in size with the pressure of the
                 was
  atmosphere; and that a <U+FB02>ame of precisely the same character was pro
  duced in rare<U+FB01>ed atmospheres of nitrogen. The experiments instituted in
  nitrogen ‘show that the explosion of loose tufts of gun-cotton in atmo
  spheres of that gas, even at normal pressures, was always attended with a
                <U+FB02>ash of <U+FB02>ame, quite different from the bright <U+FB02>ash produced by
  -pale yellow
   igniting gun-cotton in air. The same result was observed in atmospheres

1864.]                     Gun-cotton and Gunpowder.                                213
of carbonic     acid, carbonic oxide, hydrogen, and coal-gas.        In   operating with
pieces of gun-cotton-twist or thread of some length instead of employing
the material in loose tufts, the results obtained in the two last-named gases
were very different from those observed in atmospheres of nitrogen, carbonic
acid, and carbonic oxide.     When ignited by means of a platinum wire
(across which it is placed) in vessels <U+FB01>lled with either of those two gases,
and completely closed or open at one end, the piece of twist burned slowly
and regularly, the combustion proceeding much more deliberately than if
the same piece of gun-cotton had been ignited in the usual manner in air,
and being accompanied by only a very small jet or tongue of pale yellow
<U+FB02>ame, which was thrown out in a line with the burning surface when the
gun-cotton was ignited. The same result was obtained in currents of those
gases when passed through a long, wide glass tube, along which the gun
cotton twist was laid, one end being allowed to project some distance into
the air.   The projecting extremity being ignited, as soon as the piece of
twist had burnt up to the opening of the tube through which the gas
was passing, the character of the combustion of the gun-cotton was changed
from the ordinary to the slow form above described.       On repeating this
 form of experiment in currents of hydrogen and of coal-gas, the ignited
 gum-cotton burned in the slow manner only a very short distance inside the
 tube, the combustion ceasing altogether when not more than from half an
 inch to one inch of the twist had burnt in the tube. The same result
 was observed when the current of gas was interrupted at the moment that
 the gun-cotton was in<U+FB02>amed.      It was at <U+FB01>rst thought that this extinction
 of the combustion of gun-cotton by hydrogen and coal-gas might be caused
by the very rapid abstraction of heat from the burning surface of gun
cottou in consequence of the diffusive powers of those gases; but when
the experiments were made in perfectly closed vessels, the piece of gun
 cotton-twist  being ignited by means of a platinum wire, the combustion
 also ceased almost instantaneously.    These effects, therefore, can only be
 ascribed to the high cooling-powers, by convection, of the gases in question.
 It was found, by a succession of experiments, that when nitrogen was mixed
 with only one-<U+FB01>fth of its volume of hydrogen the combustion of g\m-cotton
 twist in the mixture was very slow and uncertain (being arrested after a
 short time in some instances), and that a mixture of one volume of hydrogen
 with threeof nitrogen prevented its combustion, like coal-gas.
   The slow kind of combustion of gun-cotton, in the form of twist, which
 is determined  by its ignition in currents or atmospheres of nitrogen, car
 bonic acid, &c. may also be obtained in a powerful current of atmospheric
 air, the thread of cotton being placed in a somewhat narrow glass tube.
 If,   however, the airat rest, or only passing slowly, the result
                          is                                          uncer    is
 tain.  In employing very narrow tubes into which       the  gun-cotton <U+FB01>ts
 pretty closely, the combustion passes over into the slow form when                   it
 reaches the opening of the tube, and occasionally       will then continue
                                                                it

burns slowly along the tube, with a very small sharp tongue of pale <U+FB02>ame,
a. jet of <U+FB02>ame is obtained   at the mouth of the tube, by the burning of
the gas evolved by the decomposition of the gun-cotton.     Sometimes, and
especially when wider tubes are employed, the slow combustion will pro
ceed only for a short distance, and then, in consequence of the ignition of
a mixture of the combustible gases and air within the tube, the gun-cotton
will explode with great violence, the tube being completely pulverized,
and portions of uliburnt cotton scattered by the explosion.   If still wider
tubes are employed, the cotton will <U+FB02>ash into <U+FB02>ame almost instantaneously
throughout the tube directly the <U+FB02>ame reaches the opening : in these cases
the explosion is not violent; sometimes the tube escapes fracture, and at
others is broken in a few places, or torn open longitudinally, a slit being
produced in the tube directly over the gun-cotton.  By using narrow tubes
and gradually shortening the tube through which the gun-cotton was
passed, pieces of the twist being allowed to project at both ends, it was
found, upon in<U+FB02>aming the material which projected on one side, that the
slow form of combustion, induced in it as soon as it burned into the tube,
was maintained by that portion which burned in the open air on the other
side, when the combustion  had proceeded through the tube.      Eventually,
by the employment of a screen of wood or card-board containing a perfo
ration of the same diameter as that of the gun-cotton-twist, through which
the latter     was partially drawn, the alteration of the combustion of the
material     from the ordinary to the slow kind was found to be invariably
effected.      On the  side of the screen, the gun-cotton burned with the
                          one
ordinary <U+FB02>ame and rapidity, until the combustion extended to the perfo
ration, when the <U+FB02>ame was cut off and the material on the opposite side of
the screen burned        only slowly, emitting     the small-pointed        tongue    of pale
yellow <U+FB02>ame.
  These results              that
                       indicate        if,
                                     even for the briefest space of time, the
gases resulting from the <U+FB01>rst action of heat on gun-cotton upon its ignition
in open air are impeded from completely enveloping the burning extremity
of the gun-cotton-twist, their ignition     prevented; and as
                                              is                     the comit   is
paratively high temperature produced by their combustion which effects
the rapid and more complete combustion of the gun-cotton, the momentary
extinction of the gases, and the continuous abstraction of heat by them as
they escape from the point of combustion, render           impossible for the
                                                                  it

at, or escape from, the extremity of the twisted cotton, but pass readily be
tween the separated <U+FB01>bres of the material, rendering it di<U+FB02>icult or impos
sible to divert them all into one direction; and hence they at the same
time transmit the combustion from particle to particle, and maintain the
heat necessary for their own combustion.
    2.  If a piece of the compactly twisted .gun-cotton, laid upon, the table,
be in<U+FB02>amed in the ordinary manner, and a jet of air be thrown against the
<U+FB02>ame, in a line with the piece of cotton, but in a direction opposite to that
in which the <U+FB02>ame is travelling, the combustion may readily be changed to
the slow form, because the <U+FB02>ame is prevented from enveloping the burning
cotton, and thus becomes extinguished, as in the above experiment.
    3. Conversely, if a gentle current of air be so directed against the gun
cotton, when undergoing the slow combustion, that it throws back upon
the burning cotton the gases which are escaping, it will very speedily burst
into the ordinary kind of combustion.       Or, if a piece of the gun-cotton
twist, placed along a board, be made to burn in the imperfect manner, and
the end of the board be then gradually raised, as soon a the material is
brought into a nearly vertical position, the burning extremity being the
lowest, it will burst into <U+FB02>ame.
    By applying to the extremity of a piece of the compact twist a heated
body (the temperature of which may range from 135° C. even up to a red
heat), provided the source of heat be not very large in proportion to the
surface presented by the extremity of the gun-cotton, the latter may be
ignited with certainty in such a manner that the slow form of combustion
at once ensues, the heat applied being insu<U+FB02>icient to in<U+FB02>ame the gases
produced by the decomposition of the gun-cotton.        By allowing the gun
cotton thus ignited to burn in a moderately wide tube, closed at one end,
the in<U+FB02>ammable     gases produced  may be burned at the mouth of the tube,
 while the gun-cotton is burning in the interior; or they may be ignited
 and the gun-cotton consequently in<U+FB02>amed, by approaching a <U+FB02>ame, or a
body heated to full redness, to the latter, in the direction in which they
are escaping.
    It need  hardly be stated that these results are regulated by the degree
of compactness of the gun-cotton, the size of the twist, and the dimensions
of the heated body.       Thus a small platinum wire heated to full redness,
or the extremity of a piece of smouldering string, will induce the slow
 combustion    in a thin and moderately compact twist; but a larger body,
such as a thick rod of iron, heated only to dull redness, will effect the
 ignition both of the gun-cotton and of the gases evolved by the combustion
 of the <U+FB01>rst particles, so that the material will be in<U+FB02>amed in the ordinary
manner.      Similarly the red-hot platinum wire, or a stout rod heated to
 redness barely visible in the dark, if they are maintained in close proxi
mity to the slowly burning surface of gun-cotton, will eventually cause the
gases evolved to burst into <U+FB02>ame.        The more compact the twist of the
‘g\m-cotton, the more super<U+FB01>cial is the slow form of combustion induced in

   The remarkable              facility with which the nature of combustion of              gum

vations indicative of    this  variation were made  in the course of the experi

gun-cotton, the products included           considerable proportion of

formed on the combustion        of  gun-cotton in air or other gases; but the
quantity produced appears      always   to be much greater in instances of the
imperfect or slow combustion of the material.       The odour of the gases pro

very great difference existing between the results of the combustion of gun

oxide when gun-cotton      exploded in open air or partially con<U+FB01>ned spaces,

  Decomposition           of Silicic Acid.-—Heated for                 some time in     a    porcelain

simply because these metals are highly volatile and <U+FB02>y off before the
crucible has attained the proper temperature.      Magnesium being much less
volatile than the alkaline metals, takes oxygen from silica before volatilizing.

    Precipitation of Metallic S0luti0ns.——Magnesium precipitates nearly
all the metals from their neutral solutions.   When these are taken in the
‘form of protosalts, even manganese, iron, and zinc are precipitated as black
powders.    Aluminium and uranium (and perhaps chrome) are only pre

cipitated as oxides.
    Alloys of Ma_qnesium.—-I have examined only a few alloys of magnesium.
 Unlike zinc, magnesium will not unite with mercury at the ordinary tem
perature of the air. With tin 85 parts, and magnesium 15 parts, I formed
 a very curious alloy of a beautiful lavender-colour, very hard and brittle,
 easily pulverized, and decomposing water with considerable rapidity at
 ordinary temperatures.      If
                              the air has access during the formation of this
 alloy, the miriture takes <U+FB01>re; and if the crucible be then suddenly with
‘drawn from the lamp, the <U+FB02>ame disappears,'but a vivid phosphorescence
 ensues, and the unfused mass remains highly luminous for a considerable                 i
time.    A white powdery mass, containing stannic acid and magnesia, is the
result.
   [With platinum, according to Mr. Sonstadt, magnesium forms a fusible
alloy; so that platinum crucibles can be easily perforated by heating mag
nesium in them.]
  Sodium and potassium      unite with magnesium, and form very malleable
alloys, which  decompose  water   at the ordinary temperature.
   It is probable that an alloy of copper and magnesium, which have notI
yet obtained, would differ from brass, not only_in lightness, but by de
composing water at the ordinary temperature with more or less rapidity.
    Uses.—Magnesium will be found a useful metal whenever tenacity and
lightness are required and tarnish is of no consequence.       The light fur
nished by combustion of the wire has already been utilized in photography
at night.  In the laboratory it will be found useful to effect decomposi
tions which sodium and potassium cannot effect on account of their greater
volatility.

     The system of the above calculated values, which best agrees with the
observed ones, results from the expression
     (B)         i=70° l7"42—4'-1854t+0'-018931t’;
it leaves in each single equation a probable error of 1- l"42; and accordingly
in the expression itself the probable errors appear to be

This expression can be brought under the form
     (B*)         -i=66° 26"09+(t’—110-543)’.0'~01893l,
which would prove that at the place in question the inclination will come,
in 1910-5433, to a minimum of 66° 26"09. The aforesaid errors of terms
give i2'27 years for the uncertainty of the epoch of this minimum, and
 -_l-_3' '9 for the uncertainty of its value; but as the expression (B) results
from observations        between 1806 and 1863, its consequences ought not to
be extended as far as 1910.
                                       3. Declination.
      Four results of observations of this element, made by the late astrono
mers       Kirch in 1731, Bode in 1784 and 1805, and Tralles in 1819, have
been       added to my own, which extend from 1825 to 1864. These latter
were obtained with the declination- andytransit-instrument              employed in my
voyage,      which   intermediately     was frequently compared      and  found in per
fect agreement with a large Gaussian magnetometer, whenever the indi
cations of the latter were duly freed from the torsion of the suspending wires
and      from the want of parallelism between the normal of the employed spe
culum and the magnetic axis of the bar.               My observations were all made in
the open air, with the exception of the two in 1849 and 1850, which, having
been executed in a room, were corrected for the in<U+FB02>uence of local attractions.
As the determination of this latter            seemed     exposed to a somewhat larger

with those obtained in the open air,     have given to the two <U+FB01>rst only      I
a fourth of the weight of the others.  A similar allowance for larger pro
bable errors should perhaps have been made in employing the four state
ments of former observers; but, for want of particulars about the operations
they are founded upon, it was more safe to neglect the difference between
their weight-and that of the others, than to <U+FB01>x it by an arbitrary as
sumption.
      If, for the moment of observation, there were marked by 1800-l-t,                                                                          as

which furnishes the above calculated numbers; and by their comparison
with the observed ones, the probable errors are—
                       in the absolute term ofd -_l__-1"94 ;

If, now, instead of employing the variations 4» (m, .1-), or <p according to
observations in the years 1837 and 1838, we assume (1) that the periodi
cal dependence between this function and the date t consists in always

changing each parameter proportionally to its mean
and then (2) that, as General Sabine has proved, the whole function has
nearly reached a maximum in all moments marked by

 By executing this operation,               I        found that the reduced observations are

 and that, though scarcely differing from (IV.), this expression    preferable,             is
 because the probable error of each of its terms    by nearly gl; of its former
                                                                            is
 value smaller than the corresponding                         one in   (IV.)
      As the expression (C*)               is   identical with
                      (C)           d=18° 8"68-0"070652{t-—                      l‘899}’,

II. “     On the Action of Chlorine upon Methyl.”                By C. Senor.
       LEMMEB, Assistant in the Laboratory of Owens College, Man
       chester.      Communicated by Professor Rosco]-1,      F.R.S.     Received
       April   5, 1864.
   In   a paper published in the Journal of the Chemical Society, New Ser.
vol. i. p. 425,    I  pointed out the great interest which attached to the study
of the lower terms of hydrocarbons, known by the name of the “ alcohol
radicals,” inasmuch as the question of the chemical constitution of these
bodies requires to be more de<U+FB01>nitely settled.
   Having been aided in these researches by a grant from the Council,            I
beg to lay before the Royal Society the results of an investigation on the
action of chlorine upon methyl, which are as unexpected as they are de
cisive.
   Equal volumes of chlorine and of methyl were exposed in strong well
corked bottles, holding from two to three litres, to diffused daylight in the
open air at a temperature of about 5° C.              The methyl was prepared
according     to  Kolbe’s    method, by electrolysis of a concentrated solution of
acetate of potassium, and carefully puri<U+FB01>ed by washing with a solution of
caustic potash and concentrated sulphuric acid.           The colour of the chlo
rine disappeared rather quickly; colourless oily drops condensed on the
the sides of the bottles, and collected after some time on the bottom as a
mobile liquid, the greater part of which volatilized again when the bottles
were brought into a warm room.             Hence it appears that by the action of
r 1e volume of chlorine upon one of methyl, substitution-products are
formed, consisting chie<U+FB02>y of a volatile liquid, the boiling-point of which
 ies between 5° and 15° C.         In order to collect these products, the bottles
were heated till all the liquid had volatilized, and then opened, with the
mouth downwards, under a hot concentrated solution of common salt, to
which some caustic soda was added in order to quicken the absorption of

the hydrochloric acid, of which half the volume of gas contained in the
bottles consisted.       The bottles were then taken out of the liquid, placed in
an upright position, and the mouth provided with a doubly perforated
cork, into one opening of which a siphon <U+FB01>tted.                              Through this siphon a
hot concentrated solution of common salt slowly ran in, whilst the gas
thus displaced escaped by a bent tube and was condensed in a small tube
receiver, surrounded by a mixture of ice and salt.                             The liquid thus ob
tained was left for some hours in contact with a piece of solid caustic
potash, in order to remove moisture and the last traces of hydrochloric
acid.     Subjected to distillation, the liquid began to boil at 11° C., and the
boiling-point rose slowly to 30° C., at which temperature two-thirds of
the liquid had come over.             On continuing the fractional distillation for
some time longer, the distillate yielded a few grammes of a colourless
mobile liquid, boiling between 11° and 13°C., which, as the following
analysis and vapour-density determinations prove, is chloride of ethyl,
C2 H,Cl.        The boiling-point of the liquid agrees with that of this com
pound,      and   it possesses   the     strong        peculiar smell and the property of
burning with       a white, luminous,       green-bordered <U+FB02>ame, characteristic of the
chloride    of ethyl.

    which numbers give                 the vapour-density   2'235, whilst      the   theoretical
    vapour-density of chloride of ethyl is 2'233.
      The boiling-point of the residue left after the <U+FB01>rst distillation rose
    quickly up to 60° C., whilst nearly the whole distilled over between this
    temperature and 70° C.  By a few more fractional distillations of this latter
    portion, monochlorinated chloride                of ethyl, C, H, Cl, boiling between
    62° and 65° C., was isolated.
      0'l270 grm. of this compound gave 0'3530 grm. of chloride of silver
    and 00095 grm. of metallic silver, which corresponds to 7l'43 per cent.
    of  chlorine, whilst the formula requires 7171 per cent.
        Eight litres of methyl yielded about 8 grammes of the mixed chlorides,
    or only about one-third of the theoretical quantity of chloride of ethyl
    which should have been obtained.          This is easily explained by the vola
    tilization of the liquid, and its solution in large quantities of water, as well
    as by the formation of higher       substitution-products, in consequence of
    which a considerable quantity of methyl is left uncombined.
      From these results it appears that the lowest term of the series                           of
‘
'
    alcohol radicals behaves with chlorine exactly in the same manner                       as   I
    have shown in the paper above referred to is the case with its homologues
    ethyl-amyl, C7 H“, (which gives chloride of heptyl, C7 H15 Cl), and amyl,

                     as
    chlorine substitution-products of these chlorides are formed in smaller
    quantities.
          As there  no reason why those terms of the series which are placed
                          is
    between C, H6,       H“, C“, H22 should show

230           Dr. Kopp on the Speci<U+FB01>c Heat of Solid Bodies.           [May 12,
number of the author’s experiments are on substances whose speci<U+FB01>c heat
had not been previously determined ; they extend to all the more_ important
classes of inorganic compounds, and to a great number of organic com
pounds.
   In the fourth part the author gives a synopsis of the materials at pre
sent available and trustworthy for considering the relations between speci<U+FB01>c
heat and atomic weight or composition.       That is, he gives for solid bodies
of known composition the atomic formula, the atomic weight, the more
trustworthy determinations of speci<U+FB01>c heat, and (corresponding         to these)
the atomic heats, or products of the speci<U+FB01>c heats and the atomic weights.
   The relations between the atomic heat and the atomic weight or the
bomposition are discussed in the <U+FB01>fth part.
    A  discussion whether the speci<U+FB01>c heat of a body varies materially with
its diiferent physical conditions forms an introduction to this part. The
in<U+FB02>uence which change of temperature of solid bodies exerts on the speci<U+FB01>c
heat is considered.    This difference is inconsiderable,  as is also the differ
ence of speci<U+FB01>c heats found for the same substance, according as it is ham
mered or annealed, hard or soft.      With dimorphous varieties of the same
substance, even where the speci<U+FB01>c gravity is di<U+FB01>"erent, the same speci<U+FB01>c
heat is found in most cases.      Great difference had been supposed to exist
in the speci<U+FB01>c heat of a substance, according as it was crystalline or amor
phous.     The author shows that, for a great number of substances, there is
no such difference, and that in other cases the apparent differences depend
on inaccurate determinations of the speci<U+FB01>c heat.         He shows that three
 sources of error more especially may give too great a speci<U+FB01>c heat for a
 substance, or for one of its various modi<U+FB01>cations :—
    1. When the substance is heated to a temperature at which it begins to
 soften, and thus to absorb part of its latent heat of fusion.
    2. If the substance is heated to a temperature at which it begins to pass
into another modi<U+FB01>cation, and this change, with its accompanying deve
lopment of heat, is continued in the calorimeter.
    3. If the substance investigated is porous, and (as was the case in the
earlier methods) is directly immersed in the liquid of the calorimeter, in
which case the development of heat which accompanies the moistening of
porous substances comes into play.
    The author arrives at the following result :—From what is at present
 known with certainty, one and the same body may exhibit small differ
ences with certain physical conditions (temperature, or different degrees of
density or porosity) ; but these differences are never so great as to furnish
an explanation of cases in which a body markedly deviates from a regu
larity which might perhaps have been expected for it—always assuming
that the determination of the speci<U+FB01>c heat, according to which the body in
 question forms an exception to the regularity, is trustworthy and free from
 foreign elements.
    The author then discusses the applicability    of’ Dalong and Petit’s law.

The atomic heats                  of many elements* are, in accordance with this law,
approximately  equal; they vary between 6 and 6'8, the average being
about 6-4.   The explanations attempted why this law only approximately
holds good, he considers inadequate.    In any case there are individual
elements which do not obey this law.     The atomic heat of phosphorus, for
instance, as deduced from direct determinations of its speci<U+FB01>c heat in the
solid state, is considerably smaller (about 5'4) ; and still more so are those
of silicium_ (about 4),                of boron (about 2'7), and of carbon (1-8 for dia
mond).

been found to be 12-8 on the average, and of the chlorides R Cl,=18'5.

cases     it is less.     It   is near 6'4 in the case     of those compounds which only
contain        elements whose atomic              heats, in accordance with Dulong and
Petit’s law, are themselves approximately = 6'4. It is less in those com
pounds containing elements which, as exceptions to Dulong and Petit’s law,
have a considerably smaller atomic heat than 6'4, and which are found to
be exceptions, either directly, by determinations of their speci<U+FB01>c heat in the
solid state, or indirectly, by the method to be subsequently described.
   After Dulong and Petit had propounded their law, Neumann showed
that      a   similar regularity existed in the        case   of compounds, that   is,   that the
atomic heats     of analogous compounds are approximately equal. Regnault,
as   is   known, has con<U+FB01>rmed Dulong and Petit’s, as well as Neumann’s law,
to  considerably greater extent, and for
     a                                   larger number of compounds,
                                                           a
than had been previously done. And Regnault’s researches have more
especially shown that the elementary atoms,now regarded as monequivalent,
_are, as regards the atomic heat of their compounds, comparable with the
elementary atoms which are to be considered as polyequivalent. Thus, as re
gards atomic heat, arsenious acid, As2 9,, and sesquioxide of iron, Fe, 9,, or
chloride of silver and subchloride of copper, Gu Cl, may be classed together.
Of the applicability of Neumann’s law, as hitherto investigated and found
in          of chemically analogous compounds, the author’s experimental
     the case
determinations have furnished        number of new examples.

These results seem to give to, Neumann’s law a validity far beyond the
limits to which it had hitherto been considered to apply. But, on the
other hand, the author’s comparisons go to show that neither Neumann’s
                                                                                  '
nor Dulong and Petit’s law is universally valid.
  Neumann’s law is only approximate, as is well known. For such analo
gous compounds as, from what we know at present, are quite comparable
and, in accordance with this law, ought to have equal atomic heats, Regnault
found the atomic heats dilfering from each other by                   T15

such cases there are even greater differences            in the atomic beats, for which
an adequate explanation is still wanting.
    But there are other ditferences in the atomic heats of some compounds
which might have been expected to have equality of atomic heat in accord
ance with Neumanu’s law——di<U+FB01>'erences which occur with regularity, and
for which an explanation is possible.  Certain elements impress upon                            all
their compounds the common character that their atomic heats are smaller
than those of analogous compounds of other elements. This         case, for      is

R, 9,.    It  is seen that the compounds of those elements which, in the free
state, have themselves a smaller atomic heat than most other elements, are
characterized by a smaller atomic heat.
   This leads the author to discuss whether                         it is to be assumed that the
elements enter into compounds with the atomic heats which they have in
the free state.       This assumption is only admissible provided it can be
proved   that   the atomic   heat of a compound depends simply on its empirical
formula, and not on the chemical character or rational constitution.                             Much
of what has previously       been   said    favours          this    view   of the case.     It is also
supported    by   the fact, which    the    author         proves,      that  similar  chemical    cha
racter in analogous compounds, and even isomorphism, do not presuppose
equality in the atomic heats, if in one compound an atomic group (a com
pound radical) stands in the place of an elementary atom of another: for
instance, the atomic heat of cyanogen compounds is considerably greater
than those of the corresponding chlorine compounds, and those of ammo
nium materially greater than.those of the .c.orresponding potassium com
pounds.     A further support for that assumption is found in the fact that,
regardless of the chemical character, the atomic heat of complex com
pounds is found to be the sum of the atomic heats of simpler atomic groups,
the addition of which gives the formulae of those more complex compounds.
A few cases selected from the comparisons of the author may explain this.

 1864.]          Dr. Kopp      on the Speci<U+FB01>c    Heat of Solid Bodies.                   235
 The opinion that the elements enter into compounds with the atomic beats
 they have in the free state has been already expressed ; but the view has
 also been defended that the atomic heat  of an element may differ in a com
 pound from what it is in the free state,  and may be different in di<U+FB01>'erent
 compounds.   The author discusses the latter view, and criticises the reasons
 which may be adduced for it; he comes to the result that it is not proved
 and   is inadmissible.
      As the result of all these comparisons and observations, the author arrives
 at the conclusion, Each element, in the solid state and at an adequate dis.
 tance from its melting-point, has one speci<U+FB01>c or atomic heat, which may
 indeed somewhat vary with physical ‘conditions (di<U+FB02>'erent temperature, or
 different density for example), but not so much as to necessitate such
 variations being taken into account in considering the relation in which the
 speci<U+FB01>c or the atomic heat stands to the atomic weight or composition.
 For each element it is to be assumed that it has essentially the same
 speci<U+FB01>c heat or atomic heat in the free state and in compounds.     He then
 passes on to determine what  atomic  heats  are to be assigned to the indivi
 dual elements.  As data for determining this he takes (1) the atomic heats
 which follow from determinations of the speci<U+FB01>c heat of the elements in
 the free, solid state; (2) the atomic heats obtained for an element
                                                                                it if,
                                                                       from
 the atomic heat of one of its compounds, which contains beside         only
 elements of known atomic heat, the atomic heats corresponding       to the
 latter elements are subtracted (3) the ditference found between the atomic
                                   ;
 heats of analogous compounds of an element of unknown and of an ele
 ment of known atomic heat, in which case the difference     taken as being
                                                                     is
 the difference between the atomic heats of these two elements.     The au
 thor dwells upon the fact that in the indirect deduction of an element by
 (2) and (3) the result may be uncertain,—-<U+FB01>rst, because the atomic heats
 of compounds are frequently not known with certainty, as     seen     theis        by
 circumstance that analogous compounds, for which there             is
                                                           every reason to
 expect equal atomic heat, are found experimentally to exhibit considerable
 differences; but secondly, because in such deductions the entire relative
 uncertainty, in the atomic heats for   compound and for that to be sub
                                             a

                                       is                  a   small number, viz. the
 residue remaining in the deduction.
    The details of the considerations by which the author deduces the
atomic heat of the individual elements cannot be gone into; the results
simply, which are not all attained with equal certainty, may be adduced.
The author adopts the atomic heat 1'8 for 9, 2'3 for H, 2'7 for        3'7 for B,

                          it  left undecided   in  the case of the latter ele

same atomic heats, or whether the differences in the atomic heats cannot
at present be shown with certainty.

agreement between the calculated and the observed speci<U+FB01>c heats.    The

                                      a
cannot be hoped for than that between the observed atomic heats of those
compounds for which, from all we know at present, the sametatomic heat ‘is
-to be   expected in conformity with Neumann’s law, to which in such cases,
of    course, calculation corresponds. In only few cases are differences be a
tween calculation                     and observation            met with which exceed these               limits or

-the accuracy of the latter, since the bases of calculation are too far from
being trustworthy. But he hopes that his Table of atomic heats will soon
-acquire such corrections, and therewith greater trustworthiness, as was
 the case with the <U+FB01>rst Table of atomic weights.        Here, the data for
 the Table were at <U+FB01>rst but little certain, and the di<U+FB02>’erences between the
calculated            and observed composition of chemical compounds very con
siderable;            but the Table was the means of corrections being introduced
 by which these di<U+FB01>erences were diminished.
      If
      calculation of the speci<U+FB01>c heat does not supersede the necessity of
experimental determination in the solid state, and does not give     trust                                  a

It might here appear doubtful whether calculation was not refuted by
experiment.    The discrepancy was removed by the observation that the
substance is distinctly more viscous at 50° than it is at lower temperatures,
and by the suspicion that it might at 50° (that       100° below its melting    is,
point) already absorb some of its latent heat of vitreous fusion.    This was
found to be the case; two concordant series of experiments gave as the

      He calls to mind the discrepancy which has prevailed, and still prevails,
in reference to certain bodies, between their actual indecomposability, and
the considerations, based on analogy, according to which they were held to
be compound.        Even after Davy had long proclaimed the elementary
nature of chlorine,     was maintained that
                              it               contained oxygen.  it  In regard

direct determination of speci<U+FB01>c heat, and chlorine, by indirect deduction,
are found to have an atomic heat in accordance with Dulong and Petit’s
law, puts out of doubt that iodine and chlorine,          compound at all, are          if

    According to Dulong and Petit’s law, compounds of analogous atomic
 composition have approximately equal atomic heats.           In general, com
 pounds   whose  atom consists of    larger number
                                               a    of  undecomposable atoms,

 valid,    might be concluded with great certainty that the so~called ele

 bodies as,      at all compound, have the same degree of composition.

     arranged the more simple and then the more complicated compounds; the
     general;valid.ity of Dulong and Petit’s law would include the proof that

and the various metals as elements, chemistry has penetrated to the same
depth in that range of inquiry, and has found at the same depth the limit
to its advance.
    But with the proof that this law is not universally true, the conclusion
to which this result leads loses its authority.       If we start from the ele
ments at present assumed in chemistry, we must admit rather that the
magnitude     of the atomic heat of  a body does not depend on the    number of
elementary atoms contained in a molecule, or on the complication of its
composition, but on the atomic heat of the elementary atoms which enter
into its composition.     It is possible that a decomposable body may have
the    same  atomic heat as an element.       Chlorine might certainly    be the
peroxide of an unknown element which had the atomic heat of hydrogen ;
the atomic heat of peroxide of hydrogen, H9, in the solid state or in
solid compounds,       must 'be =2'3+4=6'3, agreeing very nearly with the
atomic heats of iodine, chlorine, and the elements which follow Dulong and
Petit’s law.
    In a very great number of compounds the atomic heat gives more or
less accurately a measure for the complication of the composition.          And
this is also the    case with  those  compounds   which,   from  their  chemical
deportment,    are  comparable   to the  undecomposed bodies.     If ammonium
or cyanogen     had not been decomposed, or could not be by the chemical
means    at present available, the greater atomic heats of the compounds of
these bodies, as compared with analogous potassium or chlorine com
pounds, and the greater atomic heats of ammonium and cyanogen ob
tained by indirect determination, as compared with those of potassium and
chlorine, would indicate the compound nature of those so-called compound
radicals.    The conclusion appears legitimate, that, for the so-called ele
ments, the directly or indirectly determined atomic beats are a measure for
the complication of their composition.        Carbon and hydrogen, for exam
ple,  if not themselves actually simple bodies, are yet simpler compounds
of  unknown elements than silicium or oxygen; and still more complex are
the elements which may be considered as following Dulong and Petit’s law.
    It may appear surprising, and even improbable, that so-called elements,
which can replace each other in compounds, as for instance hydrogen and
the metals, or which enter into isomorphous compounds as corresponding
elements, like silicium and tin, should possess unequal atomic heats and
unequal complication of composition.         But this really is not more sur
prising than that undecomposable bodies and obviously compound bodies,
hydrogen and hyponitric acid, or potassium and ammonium, should, with
out altering the chemical character of the compound, replace one another,
or even be present in isomorphous compounds as corresponding                con
stituents.
    The author concludes his memoir with the following words :——“ have    I
here expressed opinions, in reference to the nature of the so-called ele
ments, which appear to depend upon allowable conclusions from well

opinions  the certain basis of the actual, and of what can be empirically
proved, is left.   It must also not be forgotten that these conclusions only
give some sort of clue as to which of the present undecomposable bodies
are of more complicated, and which of simpler composition, and nothing
as  to what the simpler substances are which are contained in the more
complicated.     Consideration of the atomic heats may declare something
as to the structure of a compound atom, but can give no information as to
the qualitative nature of the simpler substances used in the construction of
the compound atoms.         But even if these conclusions are not free from
uncertainty and imperfection, they appear to me worthy of attention in a
subject which is still so shroudedin darkness as the nature of the unde
composed bodies.”

Baffin Bay (soundings taken in one of Sir E. Parry’s expeditions), from
the Hunde Islands in Davis Strait (dredgings by Dr. P. C. Sutherland),
from the coast of Norway (dredgiugs by Messrs. M‘Andrew and Barrett),
and from the whole width of the North Atlantic (soundings by Commander
Dayman), the authors have been enabled to form a tolerably correct esti
mate of the range and respective abundance of several species of Foramini
fera in the Northern seas; and the more perfectly by taking Professor
Williamson’s and Mr. H. B. Brady’s researches in British Foraminifera as
supplying the means of estimating the Foraminiferal fauna of the shallower
                                                “ Celtic Province,” and the less

opposite, or “Virginian” end,—thus presenting for the <U+FB01>rst time the
whole of a Foraminiferal fauna as a natural-history group, with its internal
and external relationships.
   The relative abundance or scarcity and the locations of the several species
and chief varieties are shown by Tables; and their distribution in other
seas (South Atlantic, Paci<U+FB01>c, and Indian Oceans, and the Mediterranean
and Bed Seas) is also tabulated; and in the descriptive part of the memoir
notes on their distribution, both in the recent and the fossil state, are care
fully given.

    That any mineral substance, whether crystallized or not, should diminish
 in density by the action of heat might be looked upon as a natural con
 sequence of dilatation being produced in every case and becoming per
manent.       Such diminution of density occurs with idocrase, Labradorite,
felspar, quartz,   amphibole, pyroxene, peridote, Samarskite, porcelain, and
glass.      But Gadolinite, zircons, and yellow obsidians augment in density
from the same cause. This again may be explained by assuming that
under the in<U+FB02>uence of     a powerful   heat these substances undergo some per
manent molecular change.                          I
                                But in this Note have to show that this mole
cular change is not permanent         but intermittent, at least as regards the
          I
species have examined, and probably with all the others. Such researches,
while tending to elucidate certain points of chemical geology, may likewise
add something to our present knowledge of the modes of action of heat.
    My   experiments were undertaken     to prove an interesting fact announced
formerly by Magnus, namely, that specimens of idocrase after fusion had
diminished considerably in density without undergoing any change of com
position: before fusion their speci<U+FB01>c gravity ranged from 3'349 to 3'45,
and after fusion only 2'93 to 2945.         Having lately received specimens of
this and other minerals brought from Vesuvius in January last by my friend
Henry Rutter, Esq.,       I determined upon repeating this experiment of

Magnus.       I  found, <U+FB01>rst, that what he stated for idocrase-and for a speci
men of reddish-brown garnet was also the case with the whole family of
garnets as well as the minerals of the idocrase group; secondly, that it is
not necessary to melt the minerals: it is sn<U+FB02>icient that they should be
heated to redness without fusion, in order to occasion this change of density ;
thirdly, that the diminished density thus produced by the action of a red
heat is not a permanent state, but that the specimens, in the course of a
month or less, resume their original speci<U+FB01>c gravities.
    These curious results were <U+FB01>rst obtained by me with a species of lime
garnet, in small yellowish crystals, exceedingly brilliant and resinous,
almost granular, fusing with dzficulty to a black enamel, accompanied with
very little leucite and traces of grossular, and crystallized in the second
system.
    Specimens weighing some grammes had their speci<U+FB01>c gravity taken with
                                                                              ‘
great care, and by the method described by me in the Chemical News’ for
 1862.     They were then perfectly dried and exposed for about a quarter of
an hour to a bright red heat.                  When the whole substance of the specimen
was observed to have attained this temperature, without trace of fusion, it
was allowed to cool, and when it had arrived at the temperature of the
atmosphere, its speci<U+FB01>c gravity was again taken by the same method as be
fore.     The diminution of density being noted, the specimens were carefully
dried, enveloped in several folds of <U+FB01>ltering paper, and put aside in a box
along with other minerals.                  In the course of a month it occurred to me
that it would be interesting to take the speci<U+FB01>c gravity again, in order to
ascertain whether it had not returned to its original <U+FB01>gure, when, to my
 surprise,  I  found that each specimen had effectively increased in density
 and had attained its former speci<U+FB01>c gravity.                    Thus :

 I ask,  what becomes of the heat that seems to be thus shut up in a mineral
 substance for the space of a month?                    The substance of the mineral is di
lated, the distance between its molecules is enlarged, but these molecules
slowly approach each other again, and in the course of some weeks resume
their original positions. What induces the change’! or how does it happen

      Such are the points which          I propose to examine in the next place ; in
  the mean time the observations            I have just alluded to are a proof that
  bodies can absorb      a‘  certain   amount  of heat not indicated by the thermo
  meter (which becomes latent), and that this is effected without the body
  undergoing a change of state; secondly, that they slowly part with this
  heat again until they have acquired their original densities; thirdly, so
  many different substances being affected by a change of density when
  melted or simply heated to redness and allowed to cool, it is probable this
  property will   be   found to belong, more or        less, to  all substances without

     After a few introductory remarks, the authors describe the apparatus
 which they employ, and their general method of observing the spectra of
 the <U+FB01>xed stars and planets.           The spectroscope contrived for these inqui
 ries was attached to the eye end of a refracting telescope of 10 feet focal
 length, with an 8-inch achromatic object-glass, the whole mounted equa
 torially and carried by _a clock-movement.              In the construction of the
 spectroscope, a plano-convex cylindrical lens, of 14 inches focal length, was
 employed to convert the image of the star into a narrow line of light,
 which was made to fall upon a very <U+FB01>ne slit, behind which was placed an
 achromatic collimating lens.           The dispersing portion of the arrangement
 consisted   of two dense <U+FB02>int-glass prisms; and the spectrum was viewed
 through    a small achromatic       telescope with a magnifying power of between
 5 and 6 diameters.         Angular measures of the diiferent parts of the spec
 trum were obtained by means of a micrometric screw, by which the posi
 tion of the small telescope was regulated.           A re<U+FB02>ecting prism was placed
 over one half of the slit of the spectroscope, and by means of a mirror,
 suitably adjusted, the spectra of comparison were viewed simultaneously
 with the stellar spectra.         This light was usually obtained from the in
 duction spark taken between electrodes of different metals. The dispersive
power of the apparatus was su<U+FB02>icient to enable the observer to see the line
Ni of Kirchhoff between the two solar lines D ; and the three constituents
of the magnesium group at 6 are divided still more evidently *. Minute
considerable time. The increase of density of Gadolinite and the decrease of density of
Samarskite by the action of heat are accompanied by a vivid emission of light, as mentioned
in my work on ‘ Phosphorescence’ 810., pp. 31 and 32, where H. Rose’s ingenious expe
riment is described.
   * Each unit of the  scale adopted was about equal to Tigvsth   of the distance between
A and H in the solar   spectrum. The-measures on different occasions of the same line
rarely differed by one of these units, and were often identical.

   details  of  the methods      adopted for testing the exact coincidence of the
   corresponding      metallic  lines with those of the solar and lunar spectrum,
   are given, and the authors then proceed to give the results of their obser
   vations.
      Careful examination of the spectrum of the light obtained from various
   points of the moon's surface failed to show any lines resembling those due
   to the earth’s atmosphere.        The planets Venus, Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn
   were also examined for atmospheric lines, but none such could be disco
  vered, though the characteristic aspect of the solar spectrum was recognized
   in each case; and several of the principal lines were measured, and found
   to be exactly coincident with the solar lines.
      Between forty and <U+FB01>fty of the <U+FB01>xed stars have been more or less com
  pletely examined; and tables of the measures of about 90 lines in Alde
  baran, nearly 80 in a Orionis, and 15 in [3 Pegasi are given, with dia
  grams of the lines in the two stars <U+FB01>rst named.            These diagrams include
  the results     of   the  comparison    of the  spectra of various terrestrial ele
  ments with those of the star. In the spectrum of Aldebaran coincidence
  with nine of the elementary bodies were observed, viz. sodium, magnesium,
  hydrogen, calcium, iron, bismuth, tellurium, antimony, and mercury;'in
   seven other cases no coincidence was found to occur.
      In the spectrum of :zOrionis <U+FB01>ve cases of coincidence were found, viz.
   sodium, magnesium, calcium, iron, and bismuth, whilst in the case of ten
  other metals [no coincidence with the lines of this stellar spectrum was
  found.
      ,GPegasi furnished a spectrum closely resembling that of at Orionis in
  appearance, but much weaker: only a few of the lines admitted of accu
  rate measurement, for want of light; but the coincidence of sodium and
  magnesium       was ascertained;     that  of barium,   iron, and manganese was
  doubtful.      Four other elements were found not to be coincident.         In par
  ticular, it was noticed that the lines C and F, corresponding to hydrogen,
  which are present in nearly all the stars, are wanting in {Z Orionis and
  <U+FB01> Pegasi.
      The investigation of the stars which follow is less complete, and no
  details of measurement are given, though several points of much interest
 have been ascertained.
      Sirius  gave  a.  spectrum containing <U+FB01>ve strong lines, and numerous <U+FB01>ner

 iron, was shown by coincidence of certain lines in the spectra of these
 metals with those in the star.          In a I4/rte the occurrence of sodium, mag
 nesium, and hydrogen was also shown by the same means. In Capella
 sodium was shown, and about twenty of the lines in the star were mea
 sured. In Arcturus the authors have measured about thirty lines, and have
 observed the coincidence of the sodium line with a double line in the star
 spectrum.        In Pollux    they obtained   evidence  of the presence of sodium,

magnesium, and probably of iron.        The presence of sodium was also indi
cated in Procyon and at Cygni.
    In no single instance have the authors ever observed a star-spectrum in
which lines were not discernible, if the light were su<U+FB01>iciently intense, and
the atmosphere favourable.       Rigel, for instance, which some authors state
to be free from lines, is <U+FB01>lled with a multitude of <U+FB01>ne lines.
    Photographs of the spectra of Sirius and Capella were taken upon collo
dion; but though tolerably sharp, the apparatus employed was not sul<U+FB01>
ciently perfect to afford any indication of lines in the photograph.
    In the concluding portion of their paper, the authors apply the facts
observed to an explanation of the colours of the stars. They consider that
the difference of colour is to be sought in the difference of the constitution
of the investing stellar atmospheres, which act by absorbing particular
portions of the light emitted by the incandescent solid or liquid photo
sphere, the light of which in each case they suppose to be the same in
quality originally, as it seems to be independent of the chemical nature of
its constituents, so far as observation of the various solid and liquid ele
mentary bodies, when rendered incandescent by terrestrial means, appears
to indicate.

 .  The principal object of the present memoir is to establish the different
kinds of skew surfaces of the fourth order, or Quartic Scrolls ; but, as preli
minary thereto, there are some general researches connected with those in
my former. memoir “On Skew Surfaces, otherwise Scrolls" (Phil. Trans.
vol. 153. 1863, pp. 453, 483), and I also reproduce the theory (which may
be considered as a known one) of cubic scrolls; there are also some con
cluding remarks which relate to the general theory.             As regards quartic
scrolls,  I remark that M. Chasles, in afootnote to his paper, “Description
des Courbes de tous les ordres situées sur les surfaces réglées du troisiemo
et du    quatrieme ordres,” Comptes Rendus, t.         liii. (1861),    see p. 888,
 states, “les surfaces réglées du quatrieme ordre     . . . .   admettent quatorze
especes.”     This does not agree with my results, since I <U+FB01>nd only eight spe
cies  of quartic scrolls; the developable surface or “torse” is perhaps in
cluded as a “ surface réglée ;
                                ” but
                                       as there is  only    one  species  of quartic
torse, the de<U+FB01>ciency is not to be thus accounted for.         My enumeration ap
pears to me complete, but it is possible that there are subforms which M.
Chasles has reckoned as distinct species.

   induction into     a general   theorem, was subsequently established rigorously
   by Mr. Cayley by means of Lagrange’s theorem.
      For the case of n=2, the differential equation was found by Mr. Harley

      Solving these di<U+FB02>"erential equations for the particular cases of n=2 and
   1|=3, Mr. Harley arrived at the actual expressions of the roots of the
   given algebraic equation for these cases.            That all algebraic equations up
   to the <U+FB01>fth degree can be reduced to the above trinomial form, is well
   known.
      A solution of (1) by means of de<U+FB01>nite triple integrals inthe case of n==4

   general solution of the equation by means of a de<U+FB01>nite single integral has
  been obtained by the same analyst.
      While the subject seems to be more important with relation to diffe
  rential than with reference to algebraic equations, the connexion into which
  the two subjects are brought must itself be considered as a very interesting
  fact.     As respects the former of these subjects, it may be observed that it
  is a matter of quite fundamental           importance to ascertain for what forms         of

    The following paper is a contribution to the general theory under the
aspect last mentioned.           In endeavouring to solve Mr. Harley’s equation by
de<U+FB01>nite integrals, I was led to perceive its relation to a more general equa
tion, and to make this the subject of investigation.                   The results will be
presented in the following order :—

     Secondly,     I  shall show that for particular values of m, the above equa
 tion admits of an immediate first integral, constituting a di<U+FB01>erential equation
 of the n— lth order, and that the results obtained by Mr. Harley are par
 ticular cases of this depressed equation, their difference of form arising from
 difference of determination of the arbitrary constant.
     Thirdly,_I shall solve the general differential               equation by de<U+FB01>nite in
 tegrals.
     Fourthly,     I shall  determine the arbitrary constants of the solution so as
 to express the mth power of that real root of the proposed algebraic equa
 tion which reduces to 1 when :v=0.
     The di<U+FB01>'erential equation which forms the chief subject of these investi
 gations certainly occupies an important place, if not one of exclusive im

   The author commences this paper by taking            a retrospective view of the
principal   facts which  have  been   established regarding the magnetic disturb
ances, considered as a distinct branch of the magnetic phenomena of the
globe, from the time when        they were <U+FB01>rst made the objects of systematic
investigation by    associations   formed for that express purpose, at Berlin in
1828 and at Giittingen in 1834, and dwelling more particularly on the
results subsequently obtained by the more complete and extended researches
instituted in 1840 by the British Government on the joint recommendation
of the Royal Society and of the British Association for the Advancement
of Science.
   The Berlin Association, formed under the auspices of Baron Alexander
von Humboldt, consisted of observers in very distant parts of the European
continent, by whom the precise direction of the declination-magnet was
recorded simultaneously at hourly intervals of absolute time, at forty-four
successive hours at eight concerted periods of the year, which thence ob
tained the name     of “ Magnetic Terms.”       By the comparison of these hourly
observations    it became known that the declination was subject to very con
siderable <U+FB02>uctuations,    happening on days which seemed to be casual and
irregular, but were the same at all the stations, consequently over the con
tinent of Europe generally.         This conclusion was con<U+FB01>rmed by the Got
tingen Association, established at the instance and under the superintendence
                                                                    ”
of MM. Gauss and Weber, by whom the “Term-observations were extended
to  six periods in the year, each of twenty-four hours’ duration, the records
being made at intervals of <U+FB01>ve minutes.            The number of the stations at
which these observations were made was about twenty, distributed generally
over the continent of Europe, but not extending beyond it.               They were
continued from 1834 to 1841.           The observations themselves, as well as the
conclusions drawn from them by MM. Gauss and Weber, were published in
                                           ‘
the well-known periodical entitled           Resultate aus der Beobachtungen des
magnetischen Vereins.’        The synchronous character of the disturbances,
over the whole area comprehended by the Association, was thoroughly con
<U+FB01>rmed: the disturbing action was found to be so considerable as to occa
sion frequently a partial, and sometimes even a total obliteration of the
regular diurnal movements, and to be of such general prevalence over the
greater part of Europe, not only in the larger, but in most of the smaller
oscillations, as to make it in avery high degree improbable that they could

 248                vGeneral Sabine—-Comparison        of Magnetic       [May 26,
 have either a local or an atmospherical origin. No connexion or correspon
  dence was traceable between the indications of the magnetical and meteoro
  logical instruments; nor had the state of the weather any perceptible in
 <U+FB02>uence.      It  happened very frequently     that either an extremely quiescent
  state of the needle or     a very regular  and uniform progress was preserved
  during the prevalence of     the most violent storm ; and as with wind~storms,
  so with thunder-storms, as even when close at hand they appeared to exer
  cise no perceptible in<U+FB02>uence on the magnet.           At some of the most active
  of the Giittingen stations the <U+FB02>uctuations of the horizontal force were ob
  served contemporaneously with those of the declination-magnet, by means
  of the bi<U+FB01>lar magnetometer devised by M. Gauss: both elements were
  generally    disturbed   on the   same   days  and at the same      hours.    The
  magnitude of the disturbances appeared to diminish as their action was
  traced from north to south, giving rise to the conclusion that the focus
  whence the most powerful disturbances in the northern hemisphere ema
  nated might perhaps be successfully sought in parts of the globe to the
  north or north-west of the area comprehended by the stations. The inter
  comparison of the records obtained at the different stations showed more
  over that the same element was very differently affected at the same hours
  at different   stations; and that occasionally the      same disturbance   showed
 itself" in different   elements at different stations.     The general conclusion
 was therefore thus drawn by M. Gauss, that “we are compelled to admit
 that on the same day and at the same hour various forces are contempo
 raneously in action, which are probably quite independent of one another
 and have very different sources, and that the effects of these various forces
 are intermixed in very dissimilar proportions at various places of observa
 tion relatively to the position and distance of these latter ; or these effects
 may pass one into the other, one beginning to act before the other has
 ceased.    The disentanglement of the complications which thus occur in
 the phenomena at every individual station will undoubtedly prove very
 di<U+FB01>icult. Nevertheless we may con<U+FB01>dently hope that these difficulties will
not always remain insuperable, when the simultaneous observations shall
be much more widely extended.            It will be a triumph of science should
we at some future time succeed in arranging the manifold intricacies of the
phenomena, in separating the individual forces of which they are the
 compound result, and in assigning the source and measure of each.”
     In the British investigations, which commenced in 1840, the <U+FB01>eld of re
search was extended so as to include the most widely separated localities
in both hemispheres, selected chie<U+FB02>y with reference to diversity of geo
graphical circumstances, or to magnetic relations of prominent interest.
Suitable instruments were provided for the observation of each of the three
magnetic elements; the scheme of research comprehended not alone the
casual and irregular <U+FB02>uctuations which had occupied the chief attention of
the German associations, but also “ the actual distribution of the magnetic
 in<U+FB02>uence over the globe at the present epoch in its mean or average state,

 appear in the fonn of momentary, daily, monthly, semiannual, or annual
 change, or in progressive changes receiving compensation possibly, either
 in whole or in part, in cycles of unknown relation and unknown period.”
 The magnetic disturbances to which the notices in the present paper are
 limited, form a small but important branch of this extensive inquiry, and are
 referred to in the instructions prepared by the Royal Society in terms which
 are recalled by the author on the present occasion, because they are ex
 planatory of the principles on which the coordination of the results ob
 tained in such distant parts of the world has been conducted, and the
 conclusions derived from them established.           In pages 2 and 3 of the
 Report embodying the instructions drawn up by the Royal Society, it is
 stated that “ the investigation of the laws, extent, and mutual relations of
 the casual and transitory variations is become essential to the success
 ful prosecution of magnetic discovery . . . . because the theory of those
 transitory changes is in itself one of the most interesting and important
points to which the attention of magnetic observers can be turned, as they
 are no doubt intimately connected with the general causes of terrestrial
 magnetism, and will probably lead us to a much more perfect knowledge
 of those causes than we now possess."       In the opinion thus expressed, the
 author, who was himself one of the committee by whom the Report was
 drawn up, fully concurred; and having been appointed by Her Majesty’s
 Government to superintend      the observations made at the British Colonial
 observatories,  and to coordinate and publish their results, he has endea
voured to show in this paper that the methods pursued have been in strict
conformity with these instructions, and also that the conclusions derived are
in accordance with the anticipations expressed therein.
    Inferences regarding the “general causes of terrestrial magnetism”
must be based upon the knowledge we possess of the actual distribution of
the magnetic in<U+FB02>uence on the surface of the globe, since that is the only
part which is accessible to us.     In regard to this distribution, the Report
itself refers continually to two works, then recently published, as contain
ing the embodiment       of the totality of the known phenomena, viz. a
“Memoir on the Variations of the Magnetic Force in different parts of the
Earth’s Surface,” published in 1838 in the Reports of the British Associa
tion, and M. Gauss’s ‘Allgemeine Theorie des Erdmagnetismus,’ published
in 1839.     In both these works the facts, as far as they had been ascertained,
were conformable in their main features to the theory, <U+FB01>rst announced by
Dr. Halley in his Papers in the Philosophical Transactions for 1683 and
1693, of a double system of magnetic action, the direction and intensity
of the magnetic force being, at all points of the earth’s surface, the
resultants of the two systems.       In both these works the Poles, or Points
of greatest force (in the northern hemisphere) were traced nearly to the
same localities—viz. one in the northern parts of the American continent,
and the other in the northern parts of the Europaeo-Asiatic continent,——their

  250             General Sabine-—-Comparison      of Magnetic       [May 26,
  geographical  positions,  as taken  from  M. Gauss’s ‘Allgemeine Theorie,’
  being, in America, lat. 55°, long. 263° E., and in Siberia lat. 71°, long.
  116° E.    Combining then the expectation expressed in the Report of “ a
  probable connexion existing between the casual and transitory magnetic
 variations and the general phenomena of terrestrial magnetism,”          with
  M. Gauss’s conclusion from the Gottingen researches, that “the sources
 of the magnetic disturbances in Europe might possibly be successfully
 sought in parts of the globe to the north or to the north-west of the
 European continent,” it seemed reasonable to anticipate that a connexion
                                           “ points of
 might be found to exist between the                   origin” of the disturb
 ances, if these could be more precisely ascertained, and the critical locali
 ties of the earth’s magnetism above referred to. To put this question
 to the test, the <U+FB01>rst step was to ascertain in a more satisfactory way
 than had been previously attempted, the laws of the disturbances
 themselves.    The process by which a portion of the observations ex
 hibiting the etfects of the disturbing action in a very marked degree
may be separated from the others, and subjected to a suitable analysis
 forthe determination of their general laws, has been fully described else
 where.    The immediate effect of its application was to show that, casual
 and irregular as the disturbances might appear to be in the times of their
 occurrence, they were, in their mean qfects, strictly periodical phenomena,
 characterized by laws distinct from those of any other periodical phenomena.
with which we were then acquainted, __and traceable directly to the Sun as
their primary source, inasmuch as they were found to be governed every
where by laws depending upon the solar hours. To those who are familiar
with the theory by which the passage of light from the sun to the earth is
explained, an analogous transmission of magnetic in<U+FB02>uences from the sun
to the earth may appear to present no particular difficulty.       It is when
the in<U+FB02>uences reach the earth that the modes of their reception, distribu
tion, and transmission are less clearly seen and understood ; but these are
within our own proper terrestrial domain and sphere of research; and ac
cordingly it was to thesethat the author’s attention was directed.    Where
ever the disturbances had been observed and were analyzed, it was found
that those of the declination were occasionally de<U+FB02>ections to the east and
occasionally de<U+FB02>ections to the west of the mean position of the magnet,
and those of the horizontal and vertical forces occasionally increased and
occasionally diminished the respective forces.      The disturbances of each
element were therefore separated into two categories, according as they be
longed to one or to the other class.     Each category was found to present
diurnal progressions, of systematic regularity, but quite distinct from one

 the same distinctive features ; the local hours or maximum and minimum
 varied at different stations, but the same two dissimilar forms were every
 where presented by the curves representing the two diurnal progressions.
     Having thus traced apparently two sources in which the disturbances
 might be supposed to originate, the possible connexion of these with the
 points of maximum attraction in the two systems of the magnetic terrestrial
 distribution presented itself as the next object of <U+FB01>tting research.       It was
 inferred that if two stations were selected in nearly the same latitude, but
situated one decidedly on the eastern side and the other decidedly on the
 western side    of one of the points referred to, the curve of the easterly    de
 <U+FB02>ection at the one station would perhaps          be found to correspond with the
 curve   of westerly de<U+FB02>ection at the other station at the     same hours of abso
lute time, and vice versd.       The Kew photograms in the <U+FB01>ve years 1858 to
 1862 supplied the necessary data for one of the two stations, viz. the one
to the west of the point of maximum attraction of one of the two mag
netic    systems, whilst Pekin, where hourly observations from 1851 to 1855
inclusive are recorded in the ‘Annales de l’Observatoire Central Physique
 de  Russie,’ might supply a station ‘on its eastern side. As this comparison
 might be regarded somewhat in the light of a crucial experiment, the reliance
 to which the Pekin observations were entitled was examined by the very deli
 cate   test afforded by rewriting the observations recorded at solar hours in
  hours of lunar time, and_ examining the lunar-diurnal variation thence
  derived.      When this is found to come out systematically and well, and
  similarly in different years, the observations which have furnished it may
  be safely regarded as trustworthy.       The Pekin observations corresponded
  satisfactorily to this test, and in the Philosophical Transactions for 1863,
  Art. XII., the comparison was made of the Kew and Pekin disturbance
  de<U+FB02>ections, the result showing that “ the conical form and single maximum
  which characterize the curve of the easterly de<U+FB02>ections at Kew, characterize
  the curve    of the westerly de<U+FB02>ections at Pekin at approximately the same
 hours    of  absolute  time.”    For a further trial of this important result, a
  second comparison of the same kind was made, being that of the curves of
 the disturbance- de<U+FB02>ections      at Nertschinsk from 1851 to 1857,       also re
                    ‘ Annales
 corded    in the              de l’Observatoire,’   &c., with those from 1858 to
  1862 at Kew.        Nertschinsk is about 12° north of Pekin, and is nearly in
 the same longitude as that station, whilst its latitude is almost identical
  with that of Kew.       The Nertschinsk observations were subjected to the
  same test in respect to accuracy as those of Pekin, and with a similarly
  satisfactory result.    The comparison of the disturbance-de<U+FB02>ections showed
 a  still more perfect accord between the curves representing the easterly
  de<U+FB02>ections at Kew and the westerly at Nertschinsk at approximately the
  same hours of absolute time.
     The present paper contains a further comparison of the nearly synchro
  nous disturbances at Kew and at Nertschinsk on the days of most notable
  disturbance at both stations in 1858 and 1859, the comparison being

    352             General Sabine on Magnetic Disturbances.              [May 26,
   limited to those two years inasmuch as the Kew record did not commence
    until January 1858, whilst the hourly observations at Nertschinsk for
    1860 and subsequent years have not yet reached England. The de<U+FB02>ections
   at Nertschinsk from the normals of the same month and hour, on forty-four
    days in 1858 and 1859, are given in a Table similar in all respects to the
   Table, in the Philosophical Transactions for 1863, showing the de<U+FB02>ections on
   the most notable days of disturbance at Kew in the same years. The com
   parison of the two Tables is discussed in some detail ; but it is sufficient to
   state here that the general conclusions are quite in accordance with those
   arrived at in the previous comparisons.
      The steps by which the author was led to a discovery of the decennial
   variation in the magnetic disturbances, and to its identi<U+FB01>cation in period and
   epochs with the variation in the magnitude and frequency of the sun-spots
   resulting from the observations of M. Schwabe since their commencement in
    1826, are too well known to need .repetition on this occasion.         But they
   furnish the ground on which, in this paper, he has for the <U+FB01>rst time sug
   gested the possibility that a cosmical connexion of a somewhat similar
   nature    may be hereafter recognized as the origin and source of one of
                                         '
   the two magnetic systems which cooperate in producing the general
   phenomena of the variations of the magnetic direction and force in dif
   ferent parts of the globe.     The author’s suggestion is, that the one of
   the two systems which is distinguished by its possessing a systematic
   and continuous movement of geographical          translation,    thereby giving
  rise   to  the  phenomena of the secular change, may be referrible to
   direct solar in<U+FB02>uence operating in a cycle of yet unknown duration. The
  phenomena of the secular change in the earth's magnetism have hitherto
  received no satisfactory explanation whatsoever; and they have all the cha
  racters be<U+FB01>tting what we might suppose to be the effects of a cosmical
  cause.     Some of the objections which might have impeded the reception
  of such an hypothesis before we had learnt to recognize in the sun itself a
  source    of magnetic energy, and to identify magnetic variations observed on
'
  the earth with physical changes which manifest themselves to our sight in
  the photosphere of the sun, are no longer tenable.         It is true that we do
  not yet possess similar ocular evidence of a solar cycle of the much longer
  duration which would correspond to the secular change in the distribution
  of terrestrial magnetism.     But careful observations of the variable aspects
  of the solar disk can only be said to be in their commencement, and it
  would be premature to assume that no visible phenomena will be discovered
  in the sun which will render the evidence of connexion as complete in the
  one case as in the other.    Such evidence, however, is not a necessary con
  dition of an existing connexion; the decennial period would have been
  equally true (though not so readily perceived by us)      if  the sun-spots had
  been less conspicuous.

    1.   In former communications
                              to the Royal Society             I
                                                     have shown that Local
Attraction, owing to the amount it in some places attains, is a more trouble
some element to deal with in geodetical operations than had generally been
supposed.    The Mountains and the Ocean were shown to combine to make
the deviation of the plumb-line as much as 22"'7l, l7"'23, 2l"'05, 34"'l6
(or quantities not di<U+FB02>'ering materially from them) in the four principal sta
tions of the Great Arc of India between Cape Comorin and the Himma-'
layas--viz. at Punnoe. (8° 9' 31"), Damargida (18° 3' 15'), Kalianpur
(24° 7' ll"), Kalians (29° 30' 48"); and how much these might be in
creased or lessened by the effect of variations of density in the crust below
 t was di<U+FB02>icult to say.    Deviations amounting to at least such quantities as
 7"'61 and 7"'87 were shown to exist in the stations of the Indian Arc,
 arising from this last cause (see Phil. Trans. l86l, p. 593 (4) and (5)).
    M. Otto Struve has lately called attention to similarly important de
<U+FB02>ections caused by local attraction in Russia.--and especially to a remark
 able di<U+FB02>'erenee of de<U+FB02>ection at two stations near Moscow, only about eighteen
miles apart, amounting to as much as l8", which is attributed to an invi
sible unknown cause in the strata below (see Monthly Notices of the Royal
Astronomical Society, April 1862).
   2. It is therefore an important inquiry, What degree of uncertainty does
Local Attraction, if not allowed for, introduce into the two problems of
geodesy, viz. (1) obtaining correct Maps of a country, and (2) determining
the Mean Figure of the Earth.           I
                                      have pointed out the effect on mapping
in India, as far as determining the latitudes is concerned, in a former paper.
I  propose now to consider the subject generally with reference to. any
country, and taking into account the longitudes as well as the latitudes.
The effect upon the determination of the mean <U+FB01>gure of the earth I discuss
at greater length.                      I
                      By a change, venture to call it a correction, of Bessel’s
method of applying the principle of least squares to the problem, I obtain
formulae for the semiaxes and ellipticity of the Mean Figure involving ex
pressions for the unknown local de<U+FB02>ections of the plumb-line at the standard
or reference-stations of the several arcs made use of in the calculation.

the Mean Figure of the Earth, and in this way surmount what was the
apparentlyjnsuperable difficulty which our ignorance of the amount of local
attraction threw in the way of the solution of the problem. The paper
concludes with some speculations on the constitution of the earth’s crust

  3.    In
         determining differences of latitude and longitude between places
by means of the measured lengths which geodesy furnishes, the method of
geodesists is to substitute these lengths and the observed middle latitudes
in the known trigonometrical formulae, using the axes of the MEAN FIGURE
of the earth. It might at <U+FB01>rst sight appear likely that this would lead to
incorrect results, as the actual length measured may lie along a curve dif
ferent to that of the mean form.     I propose now to show that no sensible
error  is introduced by following this course, either in latitude or longitude,
if the arc does not exceed twelve degrees and a half of latitude, or fifteen
degrees of longitude in extent.
    4. First. An are of Latitude.-—Suppose an ellipse drawn in the plane

be relatively correct in themselves; but the precise position of the map on
the terrestrial spheroid will be unknown by the amount of the unknown
de<U+FB02>ection of the plumb-line in latitude and longitude at the place which
<U+FB01>xes the map.     In India the effect of the Himmalaya Mountains and the
Ocean, taken alone, would throw out the map by nearly half a mile.       The
calculations, however, which                      I
                                 give in the next two sections of this paper,
show that the effect of variations in the density of the crust below almost
entirely counteracts that of the mountains and ocean at Damargida in lati- .
tude 18° 3’ 15”, and the displacement of the map is almost iusensible if
<U+FB01>xed by that station.                   If
                       <U+FB01>xed by the observed latitude of any other station,
the map will be out of its place by the local de<U+FB02>ection of the plumb-line at
that station. This, in the Indian Great Arc, does not exceed one-thirteenth
of   a mile at any         of the stations where the latitude has been observed.              It
appears also from those calculations, that, except in places evidently situated
in most disadvantageous positions, the local attraction is rarely of any con
siderable amount.

 dentivariables,           but are functions of u and v, and of the de<U+FB02>ections produced
by local attraction.  In the preceding diagram the plane of the paper is
the plane of the meridian in -which the arc, of which AB is one section,
has been geodetically measured.     A is the reference-station of the several
portions of the whole are.    A Z is the vertical at A in which the plumb
line hangs.    The two curves, of which A’B' and ab are portions, are a
variable ellipse and the mean ellipse having the same centre O and their
 axes    in the       same the mean ellipse being what the variable ellipse
                                 lines,
 becomes when the values are substituted for u and 0 which make the sum
 of the squares ‘of the errors a minimum : Z'A A'N' and z A aN are nor
mals through               A to    these two ellipses;               AD,   A’m', am are perpendicular
                  '
to O D.
   Now,          if the
                earth had its mean form, a plumb-line at A would hang in
the normal :.'A to the mean ellipse ; but it hangs actually in ZA. Hence
ZAz is the de<U+FB02>ection (northward in the diagram) which the plumb-line
suffers from the local attraction arising from the derangement of the <U+FB01>gure
and mass of the earth from the mean.         This angle is some constant but
unknown quantity t, t being reckoned positive when the de<U+FB02>ection is north
Ward.   This quantity 1! is part of the correction ZAZ', or 41:, added to the
observed latitude of Abefore applying the principle of least squares.    The
other part is zAZ', which I will now calculate: it is the angle between
the two normals drawn through A to the variable and the mean ellipses.

   These formulae for the semiaxes and ellipticity of the mean <U+FB01>gure of the
earth show us that the effect of local attraction‘ upon the <U+FB01>nal numerical
results may be very considerable: for example, 'a de<U+FB02>ection of the plumb
line of only 5" at the standard station (St. Agnes) of the Anglo-Gallic arc
would introduce a correction of about one mile to the length of the semi
major axis, and more than three miles to the semi-minor axis. If the de-
                                                                                  '
<U+FB02>ection at the standard station (Damargida) of the Indian Great Arc be
what the mountains and ocean make it (without allowing any compensating
e<U+FB02>'ect from variations in density in the crust below, which no doubt exist,
but which are altogether unknown), viz. about l7"'24, the semiaxes will be
subject to a correction, arising from this cause alone, of half a mile and
two miles. This is sufficient to show how great a degree of uncertainty local
attraction, if not allowed for, introduces into the determination of the mean
<U+FB01>gure.     As long as we have no means of ascertaining the amount of local
attraction at the several standard-stations     of the arcs employed in the cal
culation,   this uncertainty    regarding   the mean <U+FB01>gure, as determined by
geodesy, must remain.
  § 3. Comparison     of the Anglo-Gallic, Russian, and Indian      Area, with a
                view to deduce the Mean Figure       of the Earth.
   9. The <U+FB01>rst three of the eight arcs which have been used in the calcula
tion, viz. the Anglo-Gallic, Russian, and Indian, are of considerable length;
and as the a   priori probability appears to be that the earth nowhere departs
much from its mean form,       it seems not unlikely that by the following de
vice we may overcome the difficulty pointed out in the last paragraph.          I
will deduce expressions for the semiaxes of the mean <U+FB01>gure of each of
these three arcs by the method there given.           If reasonable values can be
assigned   to the  expressions   for the de<U+FB02>ection of the plumb-line from the
normals to these three ellipses such as will make the axes the same, we
shall have a very strong argument in favour of those being the actual de
<U+FB02>ections in nature, and of the <U+FB01>gure thus deduced, as common to the three
arcs, being in fact the mean <U+FB01>gure of the earth.
   10. In the previous calculation t has represented the angle which the
plumb-line makes, in the plane of the meridian, with the normal to the
mean ellipse of the earth.       I shall now use T as the angle which the plumb
line makes, in the plane of the meridian, with the normal to the mean

Anglo-Gallic arc. Proceeding precisely as in paragraph 8, we have

  These three results are remarkably near each other; they differ from
their average, 20926189 and 20855316, in no case by so much as 300 feet,
and in most cases by much less.           I
                                         think, then, that we may safely infer
that this average ellipse is in fact the mean <U+FB01>gure of the earth.  This being
the case, T1, T2, T3 are the same as     t3; and therefore the de<U+FB02>ections

If these      are substituted in the formulae (1)           of paragraph (6), we have

    15.      If the
               reasoning in the last section, which has led to so satisfactory
a result, be correct,   think we may draw some useful inferences regarding

   I have inserted     the formula of Cowhythe from p. 771 of the Ordnance
Survey Volume.         I have also added two columns, in one of which are given
the de<U+FB02>ections of the plumb-line arising from attraction at those of the
stations for which it has been calculated.              For those of the Anglo-Gallic
Arc,   I  refer to the Ordnance Survey Volume, sect. xi. p. 625; and for
those of the Indian Are to my paper in the Philosophical Transactions for
1861, p. 593.        I would observe that not only in the two stations of the
Indian Arc, but in those I have selected from the Anglo-Gallic Arc (all of
which are near the sea-shore), allowance is made for de<U+FB01>ciency of density and
attraction of sea-water.        In the stations (3), (4), (5), (6) the etfect of the
sea for about 9 miles south of the coast is taken and estimated at +0"'27
(see Ordnance Survey Volume, p. 631) ; in station (8) for 36 miles north,
and estimated at -0"'39 (p. 642) ; in station (9) for 50 miles north, and
estimated at -0"'70 (p. 664) ; in station (10) for 50 miles north, and esti
mated at -0" '64 (p. 662).            It is of importance to bear this in mind. For

    Ocean and the Mountains has been shown to be very large.         This shows
    that -the effect of variations of density in the crust must be very great, in
'
    order to bring about this near compensation.       In fact the density of the
    crust beneath the mountains must be less than that below the plains, and
.   still less than that below the ocean-bed.    If
                                                 solidi<U+FB01>cation from the <U+FB02>uid
    state commenced   at the surface, the amount of contraction            in the solid
    parts beneath the mountain~region has been less than in the parts beneath
    the sea.  In fact, it is this unequal contraction which appears to have
    caused the hollows in the external surface which have become the basins
    into which the waters have <U+FB02>owed to form the ocean. As the waters
    <U+FB02>owed into the hollows thus created, the pressure on the ocean-bed would
    be increased, and the crust, so long as it was sui<U+FB01>ciently thin to be in<U+FB02>u
    enced by hydrostatic principles of <U+FB02>oatation, would so adjust itself that the
    pressure on any couche de niveau of the <U+FB02>uid should remain the same.
    At the time that the crust <U+FB01>rst became su<U+FB02>iciently thick to resist fracture
    under the strain produced by a change in its density—that        is,
                                                                    when     <U+FB01>rst

    ceased to depend for the elevation or depression of its several parts upon
    the principles of <U+FB02>oatation, the total amount of matter in any vertical
    prism, drawn down into the <U+FB02>uid below to          given distance from the
                                                      a
    earth’s centre, had been the same through all the previous changes. After
    this, any further contraction or any expansion in the solid crust would not
    alter the amount of matter in the vertical   prism, except where there was
    an ocean; in the ease of greater contraction under an ocean than elsewhere,
    the ocean would become deeper and the amount of matter greater, and in
    ‘case of less contraction or of an expansion of the crust under an ocean,
               a
    the ocean would become shallower, or the amount of matter in the vertical
    prism less than before.  It not likely that expansion and contraction in
                                is
    the solid crust would affect the arrangement of matter in any other way
    That changes of level do take place, by the rising and sinking of the sur
    face, is   well-established fact, which rather favours these theoretical con
               a
    siderations.    But they receive, think, great supportlfrom the other fact,
                                  I
    that the large effect of the ocean at Punnoe and of the mountains at Ka
    liana almost entirely disappear from the resultant de<U+FB02>ections brought out
    by the calculations.    The formulae of paragraph 15 show that when we
    get close to the mountain-mass, as at Dehra, which        at the foot of the

 whereas     at Kaliana, and stations still further off, the attraction of the
 mountain-mass above the sea-level, and the de<U+FB01>ciency of attraction from
 the crust below that level, would nearly counterbalance each other.           Thus,
 if the thickness of the crust below     the plains is 100  miles,  and the  amount
 of matter in the     crust  under the plains equals that of the crust and moun
 tains together in the mountain-region,         then the de<U+FB02>ections at Kaliana,
 Kalianpur, and Damargida, instead of being 27"'98, l2"'05, 6"'79, arising
 from the mountains alone, are reduced to 1"'54, —0"'06, -—0”'06 (see
 Philosophical Transactions for 1858, p. 759), which are all insigni
 <U+FB01>cant compared with the large de<U+FB02>ections caused by the mountains
  alone.
      This theory, that the wide ocean has been collected on parts of the
  earth’s   surface   where hollows have     been made by the contraction and
  therefore increased density of the crust below, is well illustrated by the
  existence of a whole hemisphere of water, of which New Zealand is the
  pole, in stable equilibrium.       Were the crust beneath only of the same
  density as that beneath the surrounding continents, the water would be
  drawn off by attraction and not allowed to stand in the undisturbed posi
  tion it now occupies.
       17. I  have, in what goes before, supposed that, in solidifying, the crust
  contracts and grows denser, as this appears to be most natural, though,
  after the solid mass is formed, it may either expand or contract, according
   as an" accession or diminution of heat may take place.        If, however, in the
  process    of solidifying, the mass becomes lighter, the    same    conclusion  will
   follow—the mountains being formed by a           greater degree of expansion of
  the crust beneath them, and not by a less contraction, than in the other
   parts of the crust.     It may seem at <U+FB01>rst di<U+FB01>icult to conceive how a crust
   could he formed at all, if in the act of solidi<U+FB01>cation it becomes heavier
   than the <U+FB02>uid on which it rests; for the equilibrium of the heavy crust
   <U+FB02>oating on a lighter <U+FB02>uid would be unstable, and the crust would sooner or
   later be broken through, and would sink down into the <U+FB02>uid, which would
   over<U+FB02>ow it. If, however, this process went on perpetually, the descending
    crust, which was ‘originally formed by a loss of heat radiated from the
   surface into space, would reduce the heat of the <U+FB02>uid into which it sank,
   and after a time a thicker crust would be formed than before, and the
    di<U+FB01>iculty of its being broken through would become greater every time a
    new one was formed.         Perhaps the tremendous dislocation of strati<U+FB01>ed
    rocks in huge masses with which a traveller in the mountains, especially
    in the interior of the Himmalaya region, is familiar, may have been brought
    about in this way.      The catastrophes, too, which geology seems to teach
    have at certain epochs destroyed whole species of living creatures, may
    have been thus caused, at the same time breaking up the strata in which
    those species had for ages before been deposited as the strata were formed.
    These phenomena must now long have ceased to occur, at any rate on                 I

 15, all of which are near the coast.   The evidence they furnish, however,
is not to be compared in weight with that of the Indian Arc, already con

  The theory have proposed, that contraction of the crust has formed the
                 I
basins in which the sea has settled, can hardly be expected to apply so
completely to such con<U+FB01>ned sheets                         of water    as the Mediterranean                                   south
of Spain, and the Gulf of Bothnia.                         Here there may be an actual de<U+FB01>ci
ency of attracting matter in the water, not altogether compensated for by
increased density of the crust below.  These hollows may have been formed
during the breaking up of the crust   and subsequent removal of portions by
currents, and not chie<U+FB02>y by the contraction of the crust. Thus the de<U+FB02>ec

other parts of the crust.    The four stations (3), (4), (5), (6) on the south

in the direction of the ocean, and seem certainly to indicate that there             is   a

theory: though the three de<U+FB02>ections are all small, they are towards the
sea, the largest of them being at Fuglenazs, which is very near to the
North Cape, and has a large expanse of ocean above it.
   19. The least that can be gathered from the de<U+FB02>ections of these coast
stations   is,
            that they present no obstacle to the theory so remarkably sug
gested by the facts brought to light in India, viz. that mountain-regions
and oceans on    large scale have been produced by the contraction
                    a                                                    of the
materials, as the surface of the earth has passed from <U+FB02>uid state to
                                                          a             a   con
dition of s'olidity—theamount of contraction beneath the mountain-region
having been less than that beneath the ordinary surface, and still less than
that beneath the ocean-bed, by which process the hollows have been pro
duced into which the ocean has <U+FB02>owed. In fact the testimony of these coast
stations   in some degree directly in favour of the theory, as they seem to
           is
indicate, by excess of attraction towards the sea, that the contraction of the
crust beneath the ocean has gone on increasing in some instances still fur
ther since the crust became too thick to be in<U+FB02>uenced by the principles of
<U+FB02>oatation, and that an additional <U+FB02>ow of water into the increasing hollow
has increased the amount of attraction upon stations on its shores.

 “Description of the Cavern of Bruniquel, and its Organic Contents.
        —Part I. Human Remains.”             By Professor RICHARD OWEN,
        F.R.S., &c.   Received May 12, 1864.
                                   (Abstract.)
    In this   communication   the author gives an account of the Cavern of
 Bruniquel, Department    of the Tarn and Garonne, France, in the state which
 it presented when visited by him in January 1864, and a description of the
 human remains discovered therein by the proprietor, the Vicomte de Lastic
 St. Jal, in 1863, and subsequently by the author in January 1864.
    The circumstances under which these discoveries were made are minutely
 detailed, and the contemporaneity of the human remains with those of the
 extinct and other animals with which they are associated, together with the
 <U+FB02>int and bone implements, is shown by the evidences of the plastic condition
 of the calci<U+FB01>ed mud of the breceia at the time of interment, by the chemical
 constitution of the human bones, corresponding with that of the other
 animal remains, and by the similarity of their position and relations in the
surrounding breccia.
    Among the principal remains of the men of the <U+FB02>int-period described are
the following :—1st, the hinder portion of the cranium, with several other
parts of the same skeleton, which were so situated in their matrix as to
indicate that the body had been interred in a crouching posture, and that,
after   decomposition  and dissolution   of the soft parts, the skeleton had
yielded to the superincumhent       weight; 2nd, an almost entire calvarium,
which is described and compared with different types of the human skull,
shown to be superior in form and capacity to the Australian type, and more
closely to correspond with the Celtic type, though proportionally shorter
than the modern Celtic, and the form exhibited by the Celtic cranium from
Engis, Switzerland; 3rd, jaws and teeth of individuals of different ages.
    After noticing other smaller portions of human cranium, the author
proceeds to describe minutely the lower jaw and teeth of an adult, and
upper and lower jaws of immature individuals, showing the characters of
certain deciduous teeth. The proportions of the molars are not those of
the Australian, but of other races, and especially those of ancient and
modern Europeans. As in most primitive or early races in which masti
cation was little helped by arts of cookery or by various and re<U+FB01>ned kinds
of food, the crowns of the molars, especially of m 1, are worn down beyond

     It will be          found that Gauss’s proof of these theorems can                                                         be transferred to

                                            are both semieven, or derived
from semieven primitives, the proof of the sixth conclusion is incomplete,

and, while showing that F cannot be derived from an uneven primitive,
fails to show whether it is derived from a semieven or from an even primi
tive.   But, in the same way in which Gauss has shown that M1 is divisible
by    m1       x m',, it
              can also be shown that M2 is divisible by 1112 x m'2* ;   e.,                                                                       1'.
in the case which we   are considering, M2     divisible by Ml, because                            is
m,=m1, m’-2=m',,  and m,m',=M,.      Therefore M,=M,,    and       derived                                                           F    is

sixth conclusion.
   (2) In the real theory, when two or more forms are compounded, each
form may be taken either directly or inversely; but, however the forms
are taken, the determinant of the resulting form         the same.  In the                                         is
complex theory,  not  only may  each  of the forms  to  be  compounded be
taken in either of two different ways, but also the determinant of the re
sulting form may receive either of two values, di<U+FB01>'ering, however, only in
sign; and     important to attend to the ambiguities which thus arise.

every uneven ambiguous class contains eight ambiguous forms.
  Combining this result with the preceding we obtain the Theorem,
  “The number of uneven ambiguous classes is one half of the whole
number of assignable generic characters.”
  The number of semieven and even ambiguous                                            classes     is determined      by
the two following Theorems                       :—
       “When            DE 1- 1,         mod 4, there_'are as many evenas semieveu ambiguous
classes.”
       “When            DE 1,
                   mod 2, there are as many semieveu as uneven ambiguous
classes, or only half as many, according as there are altogether as many
semieveu as uneven classes, or only half as many.”
       To prove the <U+FB01>rst of these theorems, let Dzzgk, mod 4, and let

we suppose             that 12 is uneven.           The equation (0,) X (o) = (f) is satis<U+FB01>ed by
one           uneven  class (rpo),            or by two (rpo) and (¢,), according as the forms

the others are so too ; the same thing is therefore true for the classes                                                        (f),
(¢o), (¢,).  Thus the number of semieven ambiguous classes is equal to or
and divide the resulting forms by 1+2‘; of the quotients, one, or three, will be semieven,

even forms satis<U+FB01>es the equation 2 ><¢ =(l-|-2') Xf; and, conversely, every semieven
form ¢ satisfying that equation is equivalent to one of these forms; for, from any trans

remains to show that when there are three of these forms, they constitute either one or
three classes, but never two. For this purpose it is su<U+FB02>icient to consider the three semi

that every form of determinant 1 is equivalent to one or other of the forms

    The paper contains an abstract of the scienti<U+FB01>c results of an inquiry
which the author had undertaken for the Government into the exact dietary
of large  classes of the community, viz. agricultural labourers, cotton opera
tives, silk-weavers, needlewomen, shoemakers, stocking-weavers, and kid
glovers.     The inquiry in reference to the <U+FB01>rst class was extended to every
county in England, to North and South Wales and Anglesea, to the West
and North of Ireland, and to the West, North, and part of the South of
 Scotland, whilst in reference to the other classes it was prosecuted in the
towns where they were congregated.
    The object of the investigation was to ascertain          in the most careful
manner the kind and quantity of food which constitutes the ordinary dietary
of those populations; and the inquiry was in all cases made at the homes of
the operatives.
    The number of families included in the inquiry was 691, containing 3016
persons then living and taking food at home.             The calculations of the
nutritive elements are made upon the basis of an adult, two persons under
 the age of 10 and one over that age being regarded as an adult, and of
 the elements, the carbon and nitrogen are calculated in each article of food,
whilst the free hydrogen       is separately estimated as carbon upon the total
quantities.
    The author then cites the estimations which in his papers in the Philo
 sophical Transactions for 1859 and 1861 he had made of the quantity of
 carbon and nitrogen emitted by the body under various conditions, and com
 putes on those bases the amounts of those substances which are required as
 food by various classes of the community.          He then proceeds to state the
 quantities which  have   been   actually found in the dietaries of the persons in
 cluded in this investigation, and the great variations which the inquiry had
brought to light. He also compares the nntriment with the cost of it in
 the food, and states the proportion which the nitrogen bears to the carbon
in each of the classes and in the di<U+FB01>‘erent localities.
    Each article of food is then considered separately, and the frequency
 with which, as well as the average quantity in which, it was obtained by
 these populations   is stated.

   The paper gives the results of the author’s observations on human muscular
variations observed during the last <U+FB01>fteen years, and extending over upwards
of six hundred subjects.        Many of the more striking varieties were drawn
by the author from the subject, and form a series of thirty-seven illus
trations accompanying the paper.            Some of them he has not found placed
on record by any authority       he  has    consulted.   The author classi<U+FB01>es these
muscular variations     as follows,  viz. :
                           Variations with redundancy.
    lst. Those which have       an‘ origin in a development totally independent
of  any other muscles or     tendons.
    2nd. Those which consist of extensions or offsets from normal muscles
or tendons, and of muscular <U+FB01>bres replacing tendons, and tendinous <U+FB01>bres
intersecting muscles.
    3rd. Those which are formed by simple areolar separation or segrega
tion of muscles.
    These are given in the order of their rarity, and of their comparative
value in reference to the muscular anatomy of the lower animals.
                             Variations with de<U+FB01>ciency.
    lst. Those produced by total suppression of the germs of muscles.
    2nd. Those resulting from amalgamation with neighbouring muscles,
    3rd.‘ Those from atrophy or degeneration subsequent to their formation.
    All the illustrations belong to the former class, which supply the most
<U+FB01>tting subjects for them.
    The frequency of varieties of all kinds in the human subject is very great.
Few subjects are to be found entirely free from them.           Muscular variations
are rather more common in the male sex.               In them, also, variations with
redundancy calculated to increase muscular power, such as are classed in
the 2nd division of that section, are more common, but may be also associ
ated in the same individual with anomalies from defect or diminution. The
 same individual is frequently found subject to more than one irregularity,
 a muscular irregularity of a marked kind being generally associated with
 several others.    Probably the‘ source is hereditary, as is undoubtedly the
 case  with those which result in deformity.           Muscular variations are more
common in the arm, back, leg, and head, and least common, as a rule, in
the abdomen, the groin excepted.             They are generally more or less sym
metrical, though often much more evident on one side than the other.                 _
Distinct developments are usually found on both sides. Variations by

from de<U+FB01>ciency on the left.
                      Variationa   by simple reduplication.
   The following muscles have been observed double, or in two distinct
layers :—Pectoralis, major and minor; gluteus maximus ; soleus ; pyra
midalis abdominis; pyriformis; subclavius.
                             Variations by deficiency.
   The following have been seen totally de<U+FB01>cient :—Psoas parvus ; palmaris
longus; superior and inferior gemellus; extensor minimi digiti; pyra
midalis abdominis; pyriformis; peroneeus tertius; extensor primi inter
nodii pollicis ; trapezius ; plantaris and palmaris brevis (rarely).
   The following have been seen partly de<U+FB01>cient :—Trapezius ; omo-hyoid ;
stemo-hyoid ; serratus magnus; internal oblique and transversalis abdo
minis; soleus.
             Other varieties observed (all illustrated by drawings).
   1.   An offset from the platyama      myoides below the ear, reaching from
the trapezius    and occipito-frontalis   to the parotid fascia and risorius San
torini (homologue of the panniculus       carnosus).
   2. Extensive    origin of omo-hyoid from the clavicle, in addition to its
scapular attachment.
   3. Double omo-hyoid, the upper one digastric, the lower uninterrupted by
tendon, and attached to base of coracoid process.         Not before recorded.
   4. Levator clavicul¢e.—Clavio-       or acromio-trachelian, observed in two
subjects, on both ides, arising with the levator anyuli scapular from the
third and fourth cervical transverse processes, and inserted into the outer
third of the clavicle under the trapezius.        Found in all the Ape-tribe.
   5. Costa-faccialie.-—A broad muscular band arising from the <U+FB01>rst rib
and cartilage, outside the sterno-thyroid, and lost in the fascia of the upper
half of the neck.     Not before described.
   6.   A  double anterior belly to the diyastric muscle, with complete decus
sation across the median line. The latter peculiarity not before recorded.
   7. Sternalis brutorum.—Rectus eternalia vel thoracicus connected above
with   a prolongation  downwards of the sternal tendon of the sterno-mastoid,
muscular <U+FB01>bres spreading out below over the sternal and epigastric apo
neurosis, and_attached to the xiphoid and <U+FB01>fth, sixth, and seventh costal
cartilages.
   8. Double s-ubclavius.——The      lower <U+FB01>bres. distinct from upper, with ce
phalic   vein passing between   them,   and attached to the coracoid process.
   9. Broad slips from pectoralic major and latissimus dor-ti, passing
across axillary vessels and nerves, and attached, low down the arm, to the
aponeurosis inserted into the inner condyle of humerus and olecranon pro
cess.    These slips are highly developed in some of the anthropoid Apes ;

the former especially in the Gibbon. The same subject, a muscular male,
showed also a high and large origin of the pronator radii temp in common
with the brachialis anticus.
      10. Chandra-coracoid    muscle, passing from the latissimus dorsi at tenth
rib to the tip of the coracoid process.           Not before recorded.    The same
 subject showed also a low origin of the pectoralis minor.
      1 1. Biceps with four heads.-—-Of the two additional heads, the inner arises
 with the brachialis anticus, and the outer with the supinator longus. In
 the same arm is a slip from the coraco-brachialie           to the internal inter
 muscular septum, passing         down   to   the  condyle, and perforated by the
 brachial artery.
      12. Coraco-capsularis.—A muscular slip from the tip of the coracoid
 process to the capsular ligament          of the shoulder-joint, inserted between
 subscapular and triceps muscles.
       13. Brachio-fascialis,   passing from the brachialis anticus     to the fascia
 over the <U+FB02>exor muscles       of the forearm, coexistent with the semilunar fascia
 from the biceps.
       14. Palmaris lonyua, with inverted belly and double origin, the addi
  tional one (tendinous) from the oblique line of the radius above the <U+FB02>exor
  sublimis. Given 011' from it also is the <U+FB02>exor brevis minimi digiti. A
  precisely similar arrangement of this very uncertain muscle not before re
  corded.      A somewhat similar arrangement found in the Cebus and Magot.
       15. Three distinct muscles and tendons connecting,-1, the <U+FB02>exor
 pollicis longua with the indicial tendon of the <U+FB02>exor prqfundus diyitorum ;
   2, the <U+FB02>exor sublimis (coronoid origin) with the <U+FB02>exor pollicis lonyue;
  and 3, the <U+FB02>exor sublimis with the <U+FB02>exor profundus (middle part).
   Segregation also of the indicial portion of the <U+FB02>exor profundus.
        16. Flewor brevis rninimi rliyiti.    Additional long, broad, <U+FB02>eshy origin
   from the fascia of the forearm, and another from the tendon of<U+FB02>exor carpi
   ulnaris. Aponeurotic slip given off to transverse metacarpal ligament.
        17. Striking abnormality seen in two male subjects on both sides.           A
   long tendon with bulky, muscular belly above, arising from the outer con
   dyloid ridge of humerus with the ertensor carpi radialis lonyior, and
   inserted in one case into the base of the <U+FB01>rst metacarpal bone and origin
    of the abductor pollicis, and in the other passing entirely into the latter
   muscle.      Not before recorded.                             _
        18.  Ewtensor primi internodii pollicis et indicz'a.—Arising by     a distinct
    belly above the indicator, going along with that muscle, and giving off two
    tendons, one to be implanted outside the indicator tendon, and the other
    to supply the place of the ertensor primi internodii pollicis.         Not before
    recorded in the human subject.         Found in the Dog.
        19. Ewtensor proprius diyiti medii.—A distinct extensor of the <U+FB01>rst
    phalanx of the middle <U+FB01>nger, arising from the ulna below the indicator.
        20. Ertensor minimi digiti with double tendon, one going to the fourth
     <U+FB01>nger.    Associated with this are three curious slips or displacements of

 302      Mr.  J. Wood    on some Varieties in Human Myology.            [June 16,
  the dorsal interossei,   arising from the base of the metacarpal, os magnum
  and unciforme, and attached to the common expansion of the erfenaor
 tendons behind the slips from the interossei.         These slips are considered
 by the author to indicate a tendency to the formation of an extensor brevia
 digitorum manua, by posterior displacement of the <U+FB01>bres of the dorsal
 interossei.
 : 21.    A. Muaculus     interoaeeua volaris primus.-—A      palmar   interosseous
 going to the dorsal aponeurosis of the thumb.             Not usually described,
 though often present.       Mentioned    by  Henle.
          B. In ahand from the subject before given in 9 and 17, all the dorsal
 interossei   were arranged in two portions easily separable.          In the <U+FB01>rst
 intcrosseous space    the  abductor   inolicia was very distinctly divided   into a
 posterior part, arising in the usual manner, and inserted into the base of
 the <U+FB01>rst phalanx; and an anterior, arising from the <U+FB01>rst metacarpal, and
 inserted partly (by a small slip) into the second metacarpal, but chie<U+FB02>y
  (by a very  distinct tendon) into the dorsal expansion of the common exten
 sor tendon of the index.        Not before recorded in the human subject.         A
 similar arrangement found in the Gorilla and other Simiae.
     22. Strong muscular slips seen in the male perineum, arising from the
 usual attachment of the transversi perinei to the ischial tuberosity, and
 inserted with the front <U+FB01>bres of the accelerator urine into the dorsal fascia
-of the penis and corpora cavernosa, in front of the erector penis.              Not
 before recorded.
     23. Separation of the anterior <U+FB01>bres of the gluteua minimua into a dis
 tinct muscle homologous with the scansorius of Traill, or invertorfemoris
 of Owen, found in the Orang and others of the Ape-tribe.
     24. Temorfaaciw plantari.s.—-Arising from the oblique line of the tibia
 under the soleus, and inserted into the internal annular ligament, near the
 tuberosity of the os calcis.
    25. Flezor accesaorius longus digitorum.—Fleshy from the aponeurosis
halfway up the back of the leg, with atendon joining the <U+FB02>ezor accessorius
 and tendon of the <U+FB02>ewor longus digitorum.
    The super<U+FB01>cial <U+FB02>exor tendon of the little toe was also, in the same foot,
 supplied from the outer <U+FB01>bres of the <U+FB01>ezor accessorius. Not before recorded.
    26. Peroneus quinti digiti.-—-In most instances a tendinous, but in one
 a <U+FB02>eshy offset from the peroneus brevis, below the outer ankle-bone, to
the expansion of the common extensor tendon of the little toe.            Very fre
 quent   in the human    subject,  usual in  the Apes.
    27. Tensor f(l8Ci(B dorsalis pedals, from the lower third of <U+FB01>bula to the
anterior annular ligament and dorsal fascia.         Not before recorded.
    28. Tibialis anticue tendon divided into three parts, going respectively
to the inner cuneiform, base      of metatarsal, and <U+FB01>rst phalangeal bone of the
great toe.    The last-mentioned offset not before recorded. Similar arrange
ment in the Quadrumana.

                                          is
widely in their physical and chemical characters that no difficulty exists in
distinguishing them.      Thus the members of the aniline and pyridine
series have, save their formulae, few points of resemblance; cespitine and

amylamine could scarcely be confounded with each other.      On the other
hand, the two modi<U+FB01>cations of tartaric acid resemble each other so closely
in their chemical    characters, that it is chie<U+FB02>y by the observation of
physical differences that they have been shown to be distinct.
  The most di<U+FB02>icult cases to solve are where the substances to be studied
are so inert as to allow of fewreactions by which they may be tested and
compared.     Thus, up to the present time, no crucial test has been devised
by which the alcohol radicals can be distinguished from the isomeric hydro
carbons of Boghead naphtha and American petroleum; and, indeed, a
change in opinion appears to be gaining ground, and the possibility of
their being identical seems again to be entertained by at least one chemist
who has carefully studied the subject‘.
    Another and scarcely less dit<U+FB01>cult case presents itself where a substance
is supposed to be isomeric with another which at the time has no exist
 ence.   Thus the constituent of oil of rue, long regarded as capric alde
hyde, C‘° H20 01', and which was subsequently shown to have the formula
C“ H’2 01}, is by some chemists §, who do not dispute the accuracy of the
latter formula, regarded as a ketone isomeric with the aldehyde of euodic
alcohol.   But if the substance from rue oil be not the aldehyde, then the
real one is unknown, and consequently no means exist for a comparative
study.    The question is, in this instance, complicated by recent researches
indicating ketones to be the aldehydes of alcohols formed by the hydration
of ole<U+FB01>ants     ll.
   It    evident that the chances of isomeric bodies being formed in re
        is
actions, increase with the complexity of the type from which they are de
rived; or, in other words, the more replaceable hydrogen exists in the
type, the greater the chances of isomerism in the derivatives.        The
ammonium         and ammonia       types always,     therefore,    present   the greatest
number       of instances of   isomerism.
  In   the course of the study of the organic bases produced     destructive by
distillation, the author very carefully compared the reaction of alkaloids
from different sources, and he states that he was almost convinced of there
being   true chemical diiference between the chinoline and leukoline series
         a
before he succeeded in obtaining the decisive reaction resulting in the
formation of the blue iodides from the amyl compounds of chinoline and
lepidine.  That observation led to the following comparative examination
of the pyridine series as obtained from cinchonine with the corresponding
series from Dippel’s-oil and coal naphtha.
  In order to submit the alkaloids to              a   searching    examination,     it   was
necessary that they should         bein an equally high state of purity, and              un
dergo the same        amount of fractionation. The methods of preparation                 and

fractionation       having, however, been described in his previous papers, the
author does not further enter into them.
     In   a previous     investigation   it was found that in fractionating the bases
from      cinchonine,   there was a    tendency in the fractions boiling below chino
line to accumulate in larger quantities between 160° and 166° C.; and it
was foimd on analysis that the distillate at that point had exactly the per
 centage composition of lutidine. The results of the analysis of the base
 and the platinum-salt pointed unmistakeably to the formula
                                            C’ H’ N.
     The boiling-point of        lutidine,  according to Dr. Anderson, is 154°; and
 it would therefore appear as if the base from cinchonine had a slightly
 higher boiling-point, but the author states that he does not draw any
 inference from that or any other isolated fact.
     Physical Properties of the Baaes.—Both bases, when pure, are colour
 less refractive oils, lutidine having a density of 0'9-167 at 0°, and the cin
 chonine base (which the author distinguishes by the name of ,6-lutidine)
 of 0'9555 at the same temperature. Lutidine boils at 154°, /3-lutidine be
 tween 163° and 168°.
     I/utidine dissolves readily on shaking in three or four times its bulk of
 water ; and, on warming, the liquid immediately becomes milky, and the
 base separates.        B-lutidine, on the contrary, requires not less than twenty
  <U+FB01>ve parts of water for solution, and does not present any signs of the very
  characteristic reaction of lutidine on warming the solution; on the con
  trary, a mixture of water and B-lutidine, cloudy from            excess of base, clears
 on warming.
     I/ulidine has a most characteristic           smell, resembling that of its lower
  homologues, but less pungent, and more approaching to aromatic.                    This
  smell is never altered in the least by any methods of puri<U+FB01>cation. After
  boiling with nitric, chromic, or any other acid, the organic smell is given
  off on neutralization with an alkali. All its salts, however puri<U+FB01>ed, have
  the same smell on the addition of an alkali.
      [3-lutidine has also a most characteristic smell, having not the faintest
   resemblance to that of lutidine.           It cannot well be described, but, if any
   thing, reminds one of nicotine; but it is without the peculiar pungency of that
  base.      It is also far more pleasant.        No treatment with acids or oxidizing
  reagents,    and  no amount     of puri<U+FB01>cation of its salt, causes the least alteration
   in the smell, or makes it approach, however distantly, to that of lutidine.
      The vapour-density of lutidine, boiling at 154°, was determined by Dr.
   Anderson at 201°, and found to be 3839.
      The vapour-density of [3-lutidine, boiling between 163° and 168°, was
  determined, for the purpose of this investigation, at 213°, and found to be
  3787.        Theory requires 3'699.
      From these numbers some important inferences may be drawn.                   It will
  be seen that the vapour-density, by experiment, is lower in the case of
  B-lutidine than in that of lutidine, although the former has a higher boil»

ing-point.   It may be inferred from this that the boiling-point of /3-luti
 dine has not been estimated above the truth, because if the fraction had
been taken too   high, the vapour-density  would have erred considerably in
excess.    This will be the more evident    if
                                            we consider that a determination
of a vapour-density by the method of Dumas          is,

tional distillation; and  ifany base of higher formula had been mixed with
it,
it    would have remained in the balloon, and increased the density to an
extent proportional to the amount of impurity. The experiment, therefore,
tends to show that the true boiling-point of lutidine      is, if
                                                            anything,   little

below 154°, and that of B-lutidine    isabout 165°, inasmuch as the error       is
not greater than that usually observed with the purest substances obtained
by fractional distillation.
   The author, after stating that_the specimen of lutidine employed in the
investigation was prepared by Anderson himself, shows that lutidine retains
its colourless state after recti<U+FB01>cation longer than ,8-lutidine.
    Comparative Study    of the Platinum-Salts of Lutidine and <U+FB02>-Lutidine.
   The author states that before entering on the comparative examination
of the bases, he determined their composition by converting them into
platinum-salts.     They both gave numbers so closely agreeing with those
demanded by     calculation from their formulas, that was evident that the
                                                          it
specimens used were pure.
  He then proceeded to ascertain whether         any differences existed in their
capability of yielding crystalline platinum-salts.
    I.B-Lutidine.—A solution of hydrochlorate of the base was mixed with
a solution of dichloride of platinum, the exact strength of the solutions
being known.      The mixture solidi<U+FB01>ed instantly to    mass of crystalline

be 1-780 gramme.
    II.
      Lutidine.—A precisely similar experiment was made with lutidine.
No signs of crystallization appeared for 15 minutes. A few crystalline
points then began to form.  After 48 hours the weight of the crystals
which had then formed was found to be 0'8l6 gramme.
  The experiment was then repeated, known weight of water being added
                                        a
to each solution.
    III./3-Lutidine.—A large quantity of crystalline plates was deposited
instantly. In <U+FB01>ve minutes the whole _had solidi<U+FB01>ed.    After 48 hours’ re
pose, the weight    of the crystals was found to
                                              be 1'66 gramme.
   IV. Dutidine.—No crystals appeared    for 35  minutes.  After 48 hours
the weight of crystals formed was found to be 0'83 gramme.
   The experiments     III.and IV., like    and II., show that [3-lutidine,
                                            I.                                      ~
under exactly the same conditions, gives twice as much salt as the Dippel
base.
  As, according to Dr. Anderson, the presence of hydrochloric acid             in
excess greatly retards the formation of the lutidine salt, the author made

 an experiment    to ascertain  if the retardation   was equal in the case    of
,8-lutidine.
    V. /3-Lutidine.-—-A mixture, the exact strength of which is given in the
 paper, containing a large excess of acid, was made.        The whole instantly
 became nearly solid, and in <U+FB01>ve minutes the beaker could be inverted with
 out any of the solid contents escaping.      After twelve hours the weight of
 crystals formed was 1'70 gramme.
    VI. Lutidine.——A precisely similar experiment was made with this base.
 No crystals appeared for thirty minutes.         In twelve hours only 0'68
 gramme had formed.
    From the above experiments, it is evident that there is a vast difference
 in the tendency of the two bases to form crystalline platinum-salts.
     Comparative Experiments upon the Decomposition by boiling of the
                 Platinum-Salts of B-Lutidine and Lutidine.
    The author describes in his paper the nature of the apparatus, and the
precautions taken to ensure precision in the experiments.
    I. B-I/utidine.—The salt begins to decompose the instant the solution
enters into ebullition, an insoluble powder beginning to deposit.         After
forty minutes the operation had to be stopped, owing to the large quantity
of insoluble sulphur-yellow precipitate which had fallen and rendered the
boiling concussive.
    The salt formed in this manner was boiled with      a fresh quantity of dis
tilled water, and then analyzed.     The numbers agreed with the formula

    II. Lutidine.—-The solution of the salt required two hours and a half of
active boiling before even a trace of the insoluble precipitate began to form,
After several hours more boiling, the deposit was excessively small.       The
author states that the difference in the behaviour of the two salts was so
great, that it would be easy at any time to distinguish the two platinum
salts by this test alone.

  He   states, however,   that a formula in which protochloride of platinum is
  made to replace one atom of hydrogen, would probably more nearly repre
  sent the constitution    of the substance.
     While studying these compounds, the author endeavoured to ascertain              if
  compounds having the same composition as the so-called bihydrochlorates
  could not be formed by direct combination of the base with dichloride of
 platinum, instead of removing an equivalent of hydrochloric acid from the
 platinum-salt.
     Dry dichloride of platinum, on being treated with excess of <U+FB01>-lutidine,
  evolved heat, and yielded an oily <U+FB02>uid, which solidi<U+FB01>ed on cooling.             After

    From its totally different appearance, the author concludes that it is
 isomeric and not identical with the sulphur-yellow body produced by boil

suppose that the product of the action of boiling water upon a platinum
salt yields such a substance, we must make the following admissions             :

atoms of platinicum (pti), may replace two atoms of hydrogen.

81.2     Prof. Hennessy on the Distribution of Temperature.                 [June 16,
   In this   paper he shows that the distillate from cinchonine contains not
only a base isomeric with cryptidine, and which he calls dispoline, but also
several other homologues of still higher atomic weight.
   The separation of these bases is very di<U+FB02>icult. They boil at too high a
temperature to allow of separation by means of fractional distillation, and,
in fact, most of them distil above the range of the mercurial thermometer.
   The author gives the details of the methods employed by him to purify
the mixtures of bases from resinous and tarry matters ; they will not, how
ever, be quoted in this abstract.
    After trial of various methods of separation, the author <U+FB01>nally adopts
fractional precipitation of the platinum-salts.         By following out this method,
 he obtained the platinum-salts of the following bases :—
                   -                C11 H11   N Dispoline.

    He has not given names to the homologues above dispoline.

    »S’ummar_2/.-—The author concludes from the results of the <U+FB01>rst portion of
 the investigation of which the above is an abstract, that the base, of the
 formula C’ H9 N, existing in the distillate from cinchonine, is distinct from
 that obtained from Dippel’s oil.
    He submits also that the second portion of the investigation shows the
 chinoline series to consist of no less than eight members, three of them
 being isomeric with certain bases from coal-oil.
    In conclusion he calls attention to the fact that the eighth homologue
of chinoline di<U+FB01>'ers only by C‘ H‘ NO’ from cinchonine itself, and he is of
opinion that    bases free  from oxygen exist in the distillate from cinchonine,
containing almost, if not quite, as many equivalents            of carbon  as the cin
 chona alkaloids themselves.

    The experiments    are twenty in number, and were perfonned during the
summer      of 1863.    The substances used were in ten experiments milk,
and in ten, fragments of meat and water. These were in all cases placed in
a bulb of glass about 21} inches in diameter, and having two narrow and
long necks. The experiments are divided into <U+FB01>ve series of four experi
ments esch.      In one series the bulbs were <U+FB01>lled with air previously passed
through    a porcelain tube containing    fragments of pumice-stone and heated
to vivid redness in    a furnace.     In the others they were <U+FB01>lled respectively
with carbonic acid, hydrogen, oxygen, and nitrogen gases. In each series
two experiments were made with milk, and two with meat; and each sub
stance was boiled in one case, and not boiled in the other.           The joints of
the apparatus were formed either by means of non-vulcanized caoutchouc
 tubing, or india-rubber corks previously boiled in a solution of potash;
and in every case, at the end of the experiment, the necks of the bulb were
 sealed by the lamp.       The time of boiling such of the substances as were
 boiled varied from <U+FB01>ve to twenty minutes, and the boiling took place in
 the bulbs, and with the stream of gas or air still passing through.           The
 substances were always      allowed   to cool in the  same   stream of gas before
 the bulbs were sealed.       The microscopic examination of the contents of
 the bulbs took place at various times, from three to four months after their
 enclosure.
    In  every case but one in which the substance had not been boiled low
 organisms were found, apparently irrespective of the kind of gas in which
 they had to exist.    The case in which they were not seen was that of the
 meat enclosed in a bulb <U+FB01>lled with nitrogen.         This bulb burst apparently
 spontaneously,   and  its doing  so   may  be looked   upon as a proof that in it
 also some change had taken place most likely connected with the develop
 ment of organic life. Where the substances had been boiled, the results
 were as follows  :
     1. In the carbonic acid experiments, no sign of life.
    2.  In the hydrogen experiments, no sign of life.
    3.  In the  heated air experiments, organisms found in both cases.
    4.  In the oxygen experiments, organisms found in the experiments with
  milk. The bulb containing the oxygen and I meat burst spontaneously,
 therefore probably contained organisms.
    5.  In  the nitrogen experiments, organisms were found where meat was
 used.    None where milk was used.
    No de<U+FB01>nite conclusion can be drawn from          so limited  a range of experi
 ments; but it is worthy of remark that organisms were found here under
 the precise circumstances in which M. Pasteur states that they cannot and

VII. “On        a Colloid Acid,      a Normal Constituent of Human Urine.”
    By WILLIAM Mancnr, M.D., F.R.S. Received May 28, 1864.
                                        (Abstract.)
    The object of the present communication is to describe the mode of ex
traction and the properties of an acid of a colloid nature which is always
present in healthy human urine, and appears destined to become
                                                                                    of great
importance in Physiological Chemistry.
    With the view of separating this acid from the urinary secretion, the
fluid is mixed with animal charcoal, concentrated, and <U+FB01>ltered, and the <U+FB01>l
trate, after precipitation with baryta-water, is dialyzed for about twenty-four
hours.     The dialyzed liquid, after subsequent <U+FB01>ltration and concentration, is
mixed with basic acetate of lead, which precipitates the colloid acid as an
insoluble lead-salt, along with a little hydrochloric acid and other impuri
ties.    The precipitate should be thoroughly washed, decomposed with sul
phuretted hydrogen, and again treated with animal charcoal.                       When the
acid is required in a pure state, the hydrochloric acid present is removed
with carbonate of silver, the excess of the silver precipitated with sulphu
retted hydrogen, and, after boiling to evolve this last substance, basic acetate
of lead is again added.        The lead-salt perfectly washed may be considered
pure, and the pure acid can be obtained from it by decomposition with
sulphuretted hydrogen.
    The acid is very slow to decompose when exposed to the air.                      It may
be considered to undergo no loss or decomposition by being boiled, as
shown by direct experiment.          After concentration by heat, its colour darkens
and it becomes syrupy, possessing a sharp acid taste, with a slight acrid
and astringent after-taste; the taste is perceptible in the solution when
very dilute: no crystals of the acid could be obtained in the syrup.                   Dried
at a temperature under 212° F., the acid has the appearance of a transpa
 rent varnish; it is very hygroscopic, and dissolves readily in water, though
 not apparently in alcohol (sp. gr. '820) or in ether. When burnt, the col
 loid acid chars, emitting a pungent and irritating smell, and after complete
 combustion, nothing but the minutest trace of inorganic residue remains.
Although strictly a colloid, this acid in the free state passes through a
 dialyzer, but not so readily as a crystalloid. When under the form of a
 compound, its property of dialyzing appears much diminished.                        I could
 not <U+FB01>nd that it exerted any action on polarized light*.
    " This acid does not precipitate egg-albumen.       It precipitates casein, but an excess
  does not appear to redissolve the precipitate as in the case of acetic acid.

    It   is therefore very obvious that the acid forms two salts, an acid and                          a
 neutral salt; we shall adopt the number 28'35                              org;          for the atomic
weight of the new acid.              The fact of there existing two different com
pounds of the acid, explains many chemical phenomena exhibited by this
 substance and its salts.
                      Compounds       of the Colloid Acid of Urine.
    The neutral salts are all soluble.
    Lead-Salta.—The colloid acid forms two lead-salt—sone which is insolu
 ble in water, and contains two equivalents of acid, and one which is so
 luble in water, and evidently contains                one equivalent            of acid.
     The insoluble compound is obtained by adding basic acetate of lead to
 an aqueous solution of the acid or of its neutral salts. An excess of the
basic acetate redissolves the precipitate, which reappears on the addition
of dilute nitric acid, to be <U+FB01>nally redissolved in an excess of the mineral
acid.       The whole of the colloid acid is not, however, precipitated by basic
acetate of lead, principally on account of the formation of a certain quantity
of neutral acetate of lead, which             I  found to have the property of dissolving
the insoluble colloid lead-salt.             On boiling a mixture of the insoluble lead

     This shows that it is not possible to estimate with accuracy the amount
 of the acid in urine by means of basic acetate of lead.
     When the acid is boiled‘ with an excess of hydrated oxide of lead,
 an insoluble compound is formed; if the acid be in excess, a compound
  soluble in hot water, but precipitating on cooling, is obtained:          I   have not
  yet determined the composition        of these two lead-salts.
      Bar_1/ta- and Lime-Salta.—These salts are easily prepared from the car
  bonates.      They contain one equivalent of the acid, are soluble in water,
  and yield precipitates with basic acetate of lead, nitrate of silver, and pro
 tonitrate of mercury and tannic acid; the more concentrated the solution,
 the more abundant         the precipitates.    A very slight precipitate occurs by
 adding    neutral   acetate  of lead to  salts of  the acid; other reagents fail to
                                                                              '

     The acid dissolves silver from the carbonate, but could not neutralize
 it perfectly by such means. The lime-salt of the acid cannot be entirely
  decomposed by boiling it with carbonate of silver.
     When the acid is boiled with black oxide of copper, copper is readily
  dissolved.
               Physiological relations     of the Colloid Acid of Urine.
     I  endeavoured to determine approximately the quantity of the colloid in
 a given     bulk of the urinary secretion, and extracted from 8 litres 4'46
 grammes of this substance, which, however, must fall short considerably
 of the real amount of the acid present.
     It  may be considered as existing in all probability in the blood, where
 there is little doubt that it acts an important part in the phenomena of the
 secretion    of gastric juice, by displacing the hydrochloric acid from chloride
 of sodium, combining with the sodium ; the soda-salt would remain in the
‘blood, being a colloid compound, while the free hydrochloric acid would
 <U+FB01>nd its way into the stomach.           An experiment    I  performed in connexion
 with this subject bears out the present view.
     The formation of the colloid acid appears to result from some trans
 formation of the colloid non-nitrogenous constituent of the liver known as
 the glucogenic substance.          When better acquainted with the chemical
 composition and physiological relations         of the colloid acid of urine,    I shall
 be able to give it an appropriate name.

   several of them of amyloid substance in abimdance ; but neither of these
   observers   has attempted to show, by chemical investigation,                at what
   period of development each of the tissues containing it is found to have it
   entering most largely into its composition.         It must be remembered that
   the acidulated tincture of iodine is a test of such delicacy for this substance,
   that it produces its characteristic reaction even when the quantity of amy
   loid substance present is very minute *; hence, judging from the use of this
   test under the microscope, one is apt to suppose that the amount present is
  greater than it really is, or rather that it is equally abundant in tissues
  which in reality contain it in widely different quantities.
      It was possibly owing to this mode of examination that Professor Bernard
   was led to suppose that this substance continues to exist in muscular tissue
   during the entire period of intra-uterine life, and that it does not disappear
  until after birth, when it does so under the in<U+FB02>uence of the respiratory
  and muscular movements.           I hope  to be able to show, however, that the
  establishment    of respiration    has little do with the disappearance of the
  amyloid substance       from  the  tissues of the foetus, and to prove that, in
  truth, certain azotized tissues are evolved from a nidus of amylaceous pro
  toplasm, which, after a particular stage of growth, becomes less and less
  as each of those tissues approaches maturity, and that when maturity is
  attained the amyloid substance, which once formed so large an ingredient
  of the growing tissue, has gradually become changed           so as to be no longer
  discoverable, even before respiration has commenced.
      M. Rouget has quite correctly pointed out the very early period at which
 the amyloid substance is found in the cartilaginous tissue: it <U+FB01>rst shows
 itselfin the cellules of this tissue; in the embryo chick and lamb, at a
 very early stage of development, it may be demonstrated; it very soon,
  however, disappears from the cells of cartilage and is too small in amount
 to be estimated at different stages of growth.
     The epithelial cells of the skin are rich in amyloid substance at an early
 period.     The points where cells aggregate themselves together for the com
 mencing development of a feather or a hair, show a great abundance of the
amylaceous material.          The horny appendages of the skin, the bill of the
 embryo    chick,  the   claws, hoofs, &c. of other embryos, contain it in large
 quantities up to a particular period of development.            The feet of a foetal
calf of about four months were dried at a heat not exceeding 212°; 7 grains
of the horny structure were rasped off, and on examination yielded 1'3 gr.
of amyloid substance. An exactly equal quantity from the feet of a nearly
full-grown foetal calf, similarly treated, gave an amount of amyloid sub
stance too minute       to be estimated.     It almost wholly disappears from the
feathers when they become prominent             on the surface, and for hairs the
same may be said.          If one of the large hairs from the eyebrow of a foetal
lamb, shortly before the time of birth, be examined, nothing more than a
    * A tenth of a grain of amyloid substance
                                                may be readily detected in an ounce of
water by the action of acidulated tincture of iodine.                         .        .

mere trace         of amyloid  substance can be detected, and that only in the cells
of the bulb.          If   a number of embryo lambs, of various sizes, are placed
side   by    side, and a drop        of a weak solution of iodine acidulated be allowed
to   fall on      a corresponding      part of each, the peculiar brown stain produced
will be      seen to increase       in intensity   up to a certain point.             After the ap
pearance of the hair, the stain gradually diminishes in intensity, showing the
lessening quantity of amyloid substance in the tissue.        If the tails cut off
from a series of foetal lambs are placed in a vessel containing a very weak
solution of iodine acidulated, it illustrates (by the colouring) very strikingly
the increasing abundance of the amyloid substance in' the epidemic tissue
up to a particular period (that              is,
                                  when the hair    fully formed), and then
                                                                   is
its gradual disappearance.   The feet and hoofs similarly treated illustrate
the same for the horny tissue of this part. From the time that the f(Bl.ll5
of the sheep     nine inches in length (at which period the amyloid sub
                      is
stance seems to be at its maximum), the amyloid substance contained in
the     horny structure of the hoof gradually diminishes until shortly before
birth, when, even after prolonged boiling, scarcely        trace can be ex  a
tracted from it.
   In the tissue of the lung of mammalian embryos, the amyloid substance
is at one period present in immense quantity. After the watery part
                                                                                                     is is
driven off by evaporation, more than 50 per cent. of the dry residue
found to be nothing else than animal dextrine.     As the organ approaches
maturity,  and  the animal    about being
                                      is  born, but before     has yet drawn     it
a single breath, the amyloid substance      found to be reduced to very

  It appears therefore that, although it exists in a less proportion than at
an earlier period, there is in muscular tissue at the period of birth a consi
derable quantity of amyloid substance; and this does not disappear alto
gether for some time in lambs,-occasionally not for some weeks after birth.
The tissue of voluntary muscle cannot be considered to have attained matu
rity at the time of birth                         it has
                                         hardly been called upon to exercise

earlier than other muscular tissue. The relation which the amyloid sub
stance bears to it is therefore of much interest.     In all embryos, without
exception,  which   I have  had an opportunity of examining at a time when
they were closely approaching the period of birth, there has been no more
than a trace of amyloid substance remaining in the muscular structure of
the heart. The preceding Table, drawn up from examination of the heart
of the embryo of the sheep, closely represents the corresponding state in
other embryos.
   The liver, which is the organ destined to form the amyloid matter during
adult life, naturally has an increase of this material going on in its tissue
up to and after birth: it does not make its appearance in the liver until
the embryo is already well advanced in development; it then is found
gradually and very slowly to increase in amount, but even at the time of
birth is present in comparatively small quantity (2 per cent. in the liver of
                                                            '
a lamb 20 inches long).
   The rapidly growing horn of a young stag was not found to contain any
amyloid substance in the tissues, -neither does it exist in the texture of the
growing horn of the calf; it is not found in the hair-bulbs of the adult,
neither is it to be discovered as a formative material of the newly formed
muscular <U+FB01>bres of the uterus when this organ is undergoing its remarkable
reconstruction    after delivery.
  What is the function of this material during               foetal life’!    It   can at least
be said it does not change into sugar, neither does it give rise to fat.    It
seems to be a formative   material,  which,  gradually becoming united   with
nitrogen, gives origin to the azotized structures.
IX.    "Description of a New Mercurial Gasometer and Air-pump."
       By T. R. ROBINSON, D.D., LL.D., F.R.S., &c. Received June 2,
       1864.
  In  some experiments on the electric spectra of metal and gases,   felt                I
the want of a mercurial gasometer for working with such of the latter as
are absorbable by water. That of Pepys is on too large a scale for my re
quirements, and it seemed better to contrive one more easily manageable,
        I
which saw could also be made to act as a mercurial air-pump. In this
Ihave succeeded to my satisfaction; and            I
                                           hope that a description of it
may be useful to those who are engaged in similar researches.
  There have been several attempts made to exhaust by means of mer
cury, the chief of them with which       I
                                     am acquainted being those of Close
(Nicholson’s Journal, 4to, iii. p. 264), Edelcrantz (Nicholson, 8vo, vii.
p. 188), Traill and Children (Nicholson, xxi. pp. 63 & 161), and that
of Geisler, which he uses in preparing the beautiful vacuum~tubes which
hear his name.   In all the principle    the same.

  vacuum; this vessel may be made to communicate with a receiver, and
   abstract from it a portion of the gas which <U+FB01>lls it; and by repeating the
   process the receiver can be exhausted as by successive strokes of an air
  pump.                                                  I
              In the two <U+FB01>rst instruments to which have referred, the descent
  of the mercury is produced by lifting a plunger which <U+FB01>lls one leg of an
  inverted siphon, the vacuum vessel being at the top of the other leg.           On
  depressing     the  plunger,  the mercury   is again  forced up  to <U+FB01>ll that vessel;
  and of course both legs must be longer than the barometric column.               In
  the two next, the receiver itself is <U+FB01>lled with mercury, which, by opening a
  cock, falls through a tube of su<U+FB01>icient length into a cistern below.           Here
  the stroke (so to call it) cannot be repeated.         In Geisler’s the bend of the
  siphon   is  of vulcanized   caoutchouc, so  that one  leg can be inclined down to
  a horizontal position, and thus allow the metal to fall from the other, or
  when raised to the vertical position <U+FB01>ll it again.               I
                                                             This believe acts well,
  but it must be rather unwieldy; and my practical acquaintance with the
  working of tubes of that material has made me suspicious of their tightness
  and permanence under such circumstances.
     As in all these     cases the  mercury is supported in the vacuum-vessel by
  atmospheric pressure, it is obvious that its descent will be produced by re
 moving in any way that pressure ; and an effective means of doing this is
  supplied by the common air- pump ; more tedious certainly than the mecha
 nical means above mentioned, but far more manageable; and as any mer
  curial pump must be slow in its working, while it is only required for spe
  cial purposes, this defect is not of much importance, and moreover is com
  pensated by some special advantages.
     But besides bringing down the mercury, means must be provided for
 raising it again.       My <U+FB01>rst plan was to do this by condensed air, the same
  syringe which made the exhaustion having its action reversed by a well-
 known arrangement.           It worked extremely well, was lighter, and required
 less mercury than the contrivance which I <U+FB01>nally adopted; but it is less
 convenient for gasometric work, as the syringe must be worked while gas
 is delivered.     The machine in its present form is shown in <U+FB01>g. 1. Its base
 is a stout piece of mahogany, 21 inches by l0'5, with a rim round it 0'5
 deep to prevent the loss of any spilled mercury, and handles at the ends by
which it can be transported.          To this is <U+FB01>rmly <U+FB01>xed the iron stand B, 3'5
high, 4 in diameter above ; its upper surface is carefully trued to a <U+FB01>anch, in
which is cemented the vacuum-bell A, so that when the touching surfaces
are lightly smeared with a mixture of lard and wax and screwed together
by the six screws (some of which appear in the <U+FB01>gure), the joint is air-tight.
The bell A is 2 inches in diameter and 6'5 high ; it has a tubulure at'_the top,
in which is ground a glass cock C, whose construction is shown in <U+FB01>g. 2.
The key of it is pierced from its bottom to a level with the bore, with
which this perforation communicates occasionally by a lateral opening.            In
the position of the <U+FB01>gure, it will be seen that the bell communicates with
the branch a; if the key be turned half round, it is connected with the

324                Dr. Robinson on a New Mercurial Gasometer                               [June    1.6,
One end of the bell’s cock communicates with the atmosphere, the other
with the receiver-plate R. This is of glass 2 inches in diameter, 0'75 thick,
and is cemented on the top of the iron pillar P.      Through it are drilled
the passages shown in <U+FB01>g. 3 ; in t is ground the glass tube, shown in <U+FB01>gj. l
by T, the end of which is in contact with the cock, and their junction
made air-tight by a tube of Para caoutchouc; in g and k are similarly
ground the siphon-gauge G and the glass cock K. These all communicate
with the receiver by the passage 1:, and by removing the tubes can be
easily dried or cleaned.  The cock K is connected by elastic tube with the
catch-jar N, which is supported in a small mercurial trough M.
   The operation of this machine as an air-pump is as follows :—The re
ceiver being placed on R, open the screw S, press down the plunger nearly
to the bottom of the cylinder, remove the key of the bell-cock, and pour
through the opening which it leaves as much mercury as will <U+FB01>ll the bell
to the bore of the cock.    In this one l0lbs. are required.       Raise the
plunger to the top, and the metal will subside from the bell till only 0'3 of
an inch remains on the top of B, <U+FB01>lling the space left vacant in D by the
rising of the plunger. The length of the plunger and the height of B
must be adjusted to this condition.   Replace the key; turn it to commu
nicate with the atmosphere (which position                             I
                                                 call (a)), and depress the
plunger. The mercury will rise again in the bell, <U+FB01>lling       and expelling     it,
the air from    till at last
                        it,  little mercury will appear in the bore of the
                                             a
cock.  To prevent this from being splashed about, bit of bent tube           a                     v    is
ground on the end of the cock, which receives     and when     has too     it,             it
much    isremoved and emptied into       through S. Secondly, turn the key
                                                          D
to shut off the bell (position (0)); draw up the plunger, close     open E,                S,
and couple     to an air-pump, with which exhaust D. This pump may be
                   it
of the commonest description, for an exhaustion of one or two inches                                    is
quite su<U+FB01>icient.   The mercury will sink in the bell, leaving above                                it   a
Torricellian vacuum.     Close E, and turn the key to communicate with the
receiver (position (r))   its air or gas will expand into the bell.
                                    ;
   These three operations form the cycle of operation, and must be re
peated till the required exhaustion be obtained, with one modi<U+FB01>cation of
the <U+FB01>rst one. In              it,
                     at the second and all subsequent strokes, the key to                          is

                        8

and the key set at (a); the other two steps are as at <U+FB01>rst.

absorbent <U+FB02>uid by an elastic tube, slipped on the a end of the cock ; which
will also convey the gas to any vessel.
   If  it be required to <U+FB01>ll a receiver for experiments in an atmosphere of
gas   either at common pressure or a less one, it may either be exhausted
by an air-pump connected with K, and <U+FB01>lled from A, or exhausted by A
and <U+FB01>lled from N.        The former can only be done with gases which have
no action on brass.
   These operations seem complicated when described with so much detail,
but in practice they are very easy, and their result is good.              Some pre
cautions, however, are required to ensure it. The bottom of the bell-cock
and of its key must be ground, so as to leave no shoulder or hollow in
which air may be entangled when the bell is <U+FB01>lled. Every part of the
metal work must be air-tight; this can only be secured by covering, not
only its joints, but its whole surface with several coats of varnish-paint
best of white lead.     When the <U+FB01>rst coat is applied, on exhausting the ap
paratus, every hole or pore is revealed by an opening in the paint (often
almost microscopic), which must be <U+FB01>lled up as it forms till all is tight,
It is almost needless to mention that the whole must be perfectly dry.               If
the hell he <U+FB01>lled a few times with undried air, enough of moisture will
adhere to its walls to prevent an exhaustion of more than 0'1 inch.                 In
such a case it must be dried by drawing air into it through sulphuric acid,
and this repeatedly.      Moisture also occasionally <U+FB01>nds its way into a part
still more troublesome, into the passage which connects the bell and cy
linder; it is probably condensed there when the mercury is colder than the
atmosphere.     I remove this by connecting the tube of K with a desiccator;
setting C to (1'), opening K and E, and by working the air-pump drawing
a stream of dry air into D, which bubbles up through the mercury in the
passage, and at last sweeps away all trace of water and its vapour.            In this
operation it is necessary to remove a portion of the mercury, as otherwise
it would be sucked into the pump; indeed this mischief might occur in
ordinary work by some mistake in the manipulation—for instance, by leaving
E open with (a). To prevent the possibility of this, D is connected with
the pump by a mercury trap, easily imagined, which intercepts any of that
metal that might come over.        And lastly, the interior of the bell must be
perfectly clean  if the highest degree of exhaustion is required.          This state
is obtained by washing it with strong nitric acid, then with distilled water,
 and when quite dry wiping it with linen, from which all traces of soap or
starch have been removed by boiling it in rain-water.            Thus we reduce to
a minimum the <U+FB01>lm of air which adheres to the hell even when <U+FB01>lled with
mercury, and lessens its vacuum.        When all these precautions were taken,
I found that with a receiver containing 3'7 inches, the <U+FB01>fth operation
brought the gauge (which had been similarly cleaned and carefully boiled)
down to 0'01.     The sixth brought it still lower, but my present means of
measurement"' are not sufficient to determine the precise amount.             In this

X.    “ On   the Distal Communication of the Blood-vessels with the Lym
        phatics ; and on a Diaplasmatic System of Vessels.” By THOMAS
        ALBERT Csarna, M .D., M.R.C.P., Physician to the Leamington
        Hospital and Warwick Dispensary.               Communicated by W. S.
                                      J
        Savonx, Esq. Received am: 2, 1864.
                                    (Abstract._)
   In   this paper the author has recorded the results at which he has arrived
concerning the distal intercommunication of the haamal with the lymphatic
system by means of injections thrown into blood-vessels; he also describes
certain minute vessels and networks       of vessels which can   be shown by the
same    means to exist in certain mucous membranes and elsewhere.            These
he has named diaplasmatics.
   The author's attention was <U+FB01>rst particularly called to the relation which
the lymphatics bear to the blood-vessels, by observing that when the latter
are  fully distended with   a very penetrating     injection, such injection often
<U+FB01>nds its way into the lymphatics without the occurrence of ordinary extra
vasation.
   He has thus injected the livers of three human beings and of three pigs
from the portal and hepatic vessels, the former (vessels) being <U+FB01>lled with
Turnbull’s blue precipitated in gelatine, and the latter with carmine simi
larly treated; and in each instance he has found that the injection had
gained entrance to the super<U+FB01>cial lymphatics.
   In sections taken from the surface of the pig's liver, these vessels (which
may readily be distinguished from the blood-vessels by their knotted irre
gular appearance and rapid increase and diminution in size) are observed
in many instances to surround a lobule, throwing out loops and prolongations
towards its centre.    A certain number of these prolongations, both in the
human liver and in the pig’s, when traced are seen to diminish in size so
much as to be considerably less in diameter than the capillaries of the
organ, in which they appear to lose themselves or rather originate.          Their
commencements in this part, it is acknowledged, are extremely di<U+FB02>icult to
determine by simple inspection, on account of the underlying capillaries
being <U+FB01>lled with injection of the same colour; but in some instances (as,
e. _q., where the pigment in the capillaries has faded) the author believes
that he has seen the actual anastomoses of the two sets of vessels.           The
circumstance, however, which renders exact microscopic observation so
very di<U+FB02>icult, is the one which a<U+FB01>brds the best evidence of the communi
cation of the two systems, viz. that the minutest lymphatics are almost

in close relation to them.     Thus  if the capillaries be red or blue, or any of
the intermediate shades of purple, the smallest lymphatics in the immediate

distinctly to show whence the lymphatics derive their supply of <U+FB02>uid.

gelatiiie from the blood-vessels, also exhibited a phenomenon similar to that
observed in the organs just mentioned.
    Sections taken from this gland and examined with the -,1»-inch objective,       .
showed that from the capillaries are given off <U+FB01>ne processes which break
up into a network among the cell-elements of the vesicles, and, furthermore,
that this network is in communication with the lymphatics which lie in the
intervesicular parts of the gland.        In addition to this, however, there are
communications between        the capillaries and lymphatics in the stroma itself.
    The processes which emerge from the capillaries in the stroma of the
thyroid as well as in the <U+FB01>brous tissues of other parts, such as the membrane
nictitans of the cat, bear a very strong resemblance to connective-tissue
corpuscles; and such the author considers them to be in these parts.          But
 as these   tubular processes can be shown by injection to form a plexus in
 the retina (cat), to be connected with the nuclei of the capillaries, the cor
 puscles of bone (perch and mouse), and the fusiform bodies found among
the <U+FB01>brillae of muscle (frog), as well as with the cells of connective tissue
and its modi<U+FB01>cations, it has appeared that the whole of these structures
 belong to one system of vessels.       This system the author has named, pro
 visionally at least,
                        “ Diaplasmatic,” because, on account of the extreme
 minuteness of its channels, it can only allow of the passage of the liquor
 sanguinis.
     To designate the whole of these minute         vessels lymphatics would, he
 considers, at   the  present  time  be   somewhat premature, because those of
 muscular <U+FB01>bre and of bones, and others which will be mentioned immediately,
‘have not been observed to join recognizable lymphatic trunks ; and moreover
 it would   seem by no means improbable        that some   of them may both com
 mence and terminate      in the blood-vessels, thus constituting what might be
 styled an intercapillary plexus ; or they may even have a triple connexion,
 viz. with the arterial capillaries, the lymphatics, and with the venous capil
 laries or the veins.
     The position in which the diaplasmatic network may be most readily
 demonstrated, both with and without injection, is in the mucous membrane
 of the palate of the frog or toad. In this part, when the viscid mucus and
 the ciliated  epithelium    have been removed, there may be seen with the
                     a very minute granular nucleated network, in each mesh of
 -}-inch objective,
 which is placed a globular nucleated cell. The membrane consists, there
 fore, of three layers—of a super<U+FB01>cial ciliated layer, next of a granular nu
  cleated plasmatic network, and lower still of a basement layer of globular
 nucleated cells. The processes of the middle granular plexus extend not only
 in the horizontal direction, but also upwards between the ciliated cells, and
 downwards between those of the basement layer, where they become con
 tinuous with the blood-vessels lying in the <U+FB01>brous tissue beneath.          This
 connexion with the blood-vessels, the author says, he has been able to make
  out by means of injection in the palate and oesophagus of the frog and
  toad, as well as in the mucous membrane of the eyelid of the latter animal.

  He has also demonstrated by injection that              a network similar to the one
 just described      is  present   in the   web-membrane of the pectoral <U+FB01>n of the
  perch. The lung of the toad also exhibits a modi<U+FB01>cation of the plasmntic
  network in the form of extremely <U+FB01>ne hollow processes, which either stretch
  completely across the mesh from capillary to capillary, or terminate in
  <U+FB01>nely pointed or blunt extremities among the epithelia or nuclei which
  stud the membrane of the air-vesicle.
     In the proper epithelial portion of the skin of batrachians or of mammals,
  the author has not yet been able to prove distinctly that the plexuses are
  to be found, but he has been so far successful in this direction as to have
  displayed them satisfactorily in the follicles and bulbs of the whisker hairs
 of the mole, mouse, and kitten. From certain observations, however, which
 cannot   here be detailed, he thinks it more than probable, not only that
 plasma-networks are present in the epithelial layer of the batrachian skin,
 but also in   a corresponding       part of the human cutis.
     With regard to the o<U+FB02>ices performed               by these networks, the author
 thinks it probable that all those found in the epidermal or mucous tissues
 are intimately connected with the function of secretion, and in a minor
 degree also perhaps with that of absorption; while those situated in the
 deeper parts of the organism, such as muscle and <U+FB01>brous tissue, are employed
 in conveying blood-plasma to, and etfete matters from, the tissues through
 which they pass or with which they may be in contact.

     The remarkable coincidence which              I  have pointed out* between the
 theoretical   effects   of rotation  and   the  results  of barometrical observations,
has led me to extend my researches with a view of de<U+FB01>ning more precisely
some of the most important effects of lunar action on the atmosphere.                   The
popular    belief  in  the  in<U+FB02>uence    of the  moon   on  the  weather,   which  antedates
all historical records, has received at various times a certain degree of phi
losophical sanction.         Herschel and others have attempted partially to for-_
mulate that in<U+FB02>uence by empirical laws, but the actual character of the
lunar wave that is daily rolled over our heads, appears never to have been
investigated.
    Major-General Sabine has shown that the moon produces a diurnal varia
tion of the barometer, amounting to about ‘O06 of an inch at St. Helena,
which is nearly equivalent to TH; of the average daily variation (Phil. Trans.
1847, Art. V.).         This would indicate a tidal wave of rather more than
1 ft. for each  mile    that we ascend above the earth’s surface, or from 3 to 6 ft.
near the summits of the principal mountain-chains.                    It is easy to believe
that the rolling of such a wave over the             broken    surface of the earth may

 exert a very important in<U+FB02>uence on the atmospheric and magnetic currents,                       .,
 the deposition of moisture, and other meteorological phenomena.                      As the     ,1
 height of the wave varies with the changing phases of the moon*, its                   effects
 must likewise vary in accordance with mathematical laws, the proper study
 of which must evidently form an important branch of meteorological science.
     Besides this daily wave, there appears to be a much larger, but hitherto
 undetected, weekly wave.           M. Flangerguesf, an astronomer at Viviers in
 France, extended his researches through a whole lunar cycle, from Oct.                     1!),
 1808 to Oct. 18, 1827, and he inferred from his observations
     1.   That in   a synodical revolution    of the moon, the barometer rises regu
 larly from the second octant, when it is the lowest, to the second quadra
 ture, when it is the highest, and then descends to the second octant.
     2. That the varying declination of the moon modi<U+FB01>es her in<U+FB02>uence, the
 barometer being higher in the northern lunistice than in the southern.
    The more recent and more complete observations at St. Helena give
 somewhat different results, which serve to con<U+FB01>rm the natural-z‘1prioricon
 viction that there are two maxima and two minima in each month.                           The
 means     of three years‘ hourly observations, indicate the existence of waves
 which produce in the <U+FB01>rst quarter a barometric effect of + ‘O04 in., in the
 second quarter of —'0l6 in., in the third quarter of +'0l8 in., and in the
 fourth quarter of —'006 in.—results which appear to be precisely ac
 cordant, in their general features, with those which would be naturally anti
 cipated from the combination of the cumulative action of the moon's at
 traction, with the daily wave of rotation, and the resistance of the aether.
    One peculiarity of the lunar-aerial wave deserves attention, for the indi
 rect con<U+FB01>rmation that it lends to the rotation theory of the aérobaric tides,
 and the evidence it furnishes of opposite tidal effects, which require con
sideration in all investigations of this character.              When the daily lunar
tides are highest, their pressure is greatest, the lunar in<U+FB02>uence accumulating
the air directly under the meridian, so as to more than compensate for the
                                                           ‘
 diminished weight consequent upon its “lift.”               B_u't‘_in

<U+FB02>uctuations, as we have seen heretofore, andalso in the weekly tides which
we are now considering,         a high wave is shown by a low barometer, and vice
versli.      The daily blending of heavy and light waves produces oscillations
which are indicated by the alternate rise and fall of the barometer and ther
mometer at intervals        of two or three days.
    M. Flangergues’s observations at perigee and apogee seem to show that
a portion of the movement of the air by the moon is a true lift, which, like
the lift of rotation, must probably exert an in<U+FB02>uence on the barometer.
On comparing the daily averages at each of the quadratures and syzygies,
I  found the difference of temperature too slight to warrant any satisfactory
inference, but a similar comparison of the hourly averages, at hours when
       * The height at St. Helena  appears to <U+FB02>uctuate between     about '9 and 1-6 ft.

        In obtaining       the above averages,               I   was obliged to interpolate for such
   changes as took place on Sundays or holidays, when no observations were
   taken. The interpolation, however, does not change the general result, and
   on some accounts the Table is more satisfactory than if the observations had
   been made with special reference to the determination of the lunar in<U+FB02>u
    ences, accompanied, as such a reference would very likely have been, by a
    bias to some particular theory.
        The thermometric and barometric averages show a general correspondence
    in the times of the monthly maxima and minima,-—the correspondence
    being most marked and uniform at midnight, when the air is most removed
    from the direct heat of the sun, and we might therefore reasonably expect
    to <U+FB01>nd the strongest evidences of the relations of temperature to lunar at
    traction.
        By taking the difference between the successive weekly tides, we readily
    obtain the amount of barometric effect in each quarter.                                The average effect
    is more than          three      times      as   great   in    the   third    and  fourth    quarters as in
    the remaining half-month,-a fact which suggests interesting inquiries as
     to the amount of in<U+FB02>uence                   attributable       to varying centrifugal force, solar
     conjunction or opposition, temperature, &c.
         Although, as in the ocean tides, there are two simultaneous corresponding
     waves on opposite sides of the earth, those waves are not of equal magnitude,
     the barometer being uniformly higher when the moon is on the inferior
     meridian, and its attraction is therefore exerted in the same directionas the
     earth’   s,  than when it is on the superior meridian, and the two attractions are
     mutually opposed.                Some of the views of those who are not fully satis<U+FB01>ed
     with the prevailing theory of the ocean-tides, derive                            a partial con<U+FB01>rmation
     from this fact.
         I <U+FB01>nd,     therefore, marked evidences of the same lunar action on the at
      mosphere as on the ocean, the combination of its attraction with that of
      the sun producing both in the air and water, spring tides at the syzygies,

  normal atmospheric changes may               be   explained by the following theory :—
      The attraction- and rotation-waves, as will be readily seen, have generally
  opposite values, the luni-solar wave being
               Descending, from 0° to 90°* and from 180° to:270°,
              Ascending, from 90° to 180° and from 270° to 0°;
  while the rotation-wave         is
              Ascending, from 330° to 60° and from 150° to 240°,
               Descending, from 60° to 150° and from 240° to 330°.
      From 60° to 90° and from 240° to 270°, both waves are descending,
  while from 150° to 180° and from 330° to 360° both are ascending.                      In
  consequence of this change of values, besides the principal maxima and
  minima at the syzygies and quadratures, there should be secondary maxima
  and minimaf at about 60° in advance of those points.
      The con<U+FB01>rmation of these theoretical inferences by the St. Helena obser
  vations appears to me to be quite as remarkable as that of my primary hy
  pothesis.     If   we arrange those observations in accordance with the moon's
  position,   and   take   the average daily height of the barometer, we obtain the

              By H. C. SOBBY, F.R.S., &c.                 Received June 7, 1864-.
       For some time past         I  have endeavoured to apply to the study of meteo
  rites the principles I have made use of in the investigation of terrestrial
  rocks, as described in my various papers, and especially in that on the
  microscopical       structure     of crystals (Quart. Journ. Geol. Soc. 1858, vol. xiv.
  p. 453).       I  therein    showed    that the presence in crystals of “ <U+FB02>uid-, glass-,
  stone-, or gas-cavities” enables us to determine in a very satisfactory manner
  under what conditions the crystals were formed.                      There are also other
  methods of inquiry still requiring much investigation, and a number of
  experiments must be made which will occupy much time ; yet, not wishing
  to postpone the publication of certain facts,              I purpose now to give a short
  account     of  them,    to  be  extended    and  completed on a subsequent occasion‘.
       In  the <U+FB01>rst place it is important to remark that the olivine of meteorites
   contains most excellent “glass-cavities,” similar to those in the olivine of
   lavas, thus proving that the material was at one time in a state of igneous
                                                 “
   fusion. The olivine also contains               gas-cavities,” like those so common in
   volcanic    minerals,      thus    indicating   the presence of some gas or vapour
   (Aussun, Parnallee). To see these cavities distinctly, a carefully prepared
   thin section and a magnifying power of several hundreds are required.
   The vitreous substance found in the cavities is also met with outside and
   amongst the crystals, in such a manner as to show that it is the uncrystal
   line residue of the material in which they were formed (Mezii-Madaras,
    Pamallee).       It  is of a claret or brownish colour, and possesses the charac
   teristic structure and optical properties of arti<U+FB01>cial glasses.             Some isolated
    portions of meteorites have also a structure very similar to that of stony
    lavas, where the shape and mutual              relations   of the crystals to   each other
   prove    that they   were    formed    in situ, on  solidi<U+FB01>cation.    Possibly some    entire
    meteorites should be considered to possess this peculiarity (Stannern, New
    Concord), but the evidence is by no means conclusive, and what crystalli
    zation has taken place in situ may have been a secondary result; whilst in
    others the constituent particles have all the characters            of broken fragments

       * The names given thus (Stannern) indicate what meteorites       I more particularly afar

 334 Mr. Sorby       on the  Microscopical Structure       of Meteorites. [June 16,
 (L’Aigle).     This sometimes gives rise to      a structure remarkably    like that of
 consolidated volcanic ashes, so much, indeed, that          I have specimens which,
 at <U+FB01>rst sight, might readily    be  mistaken   for sections  of meteorites. It would
 therefore appear that, after the material of the meteorites was melted, a
 considerable portion was broken up into small fragments, subsequently col
 lected together, and more or less consolidated by mechanical and chemical
 actions, amongst which must be classed a segregation of iron, either in the
 metallic   state or in combination with other substances.             Apparently this
 breaking up occurred in some cases when the melted matter had become
 crystalline, but in others the forms of the particles lead me to conclude
 that   it was broken up into detached globules whilst still melted (Mez6
 Madaras, Parnallce).       This seems to have been the origin of some of the
 round grains met with in meteorites ; for they occasionally still contain a
 considerable amount of glass, and the crystals which have been formed in
it are arranged in groups, radiating from one or more points on the external
 surface, in such a manner as to indicate that they were developed after the
fragments had acquired their present spheroidal shape (Aussun, &c.).                 In
this they differ most characteristically from the general type of concretionary
globules found in terrestrial rocks, in which they radiate from the centre ;
the only case that I know at all analogous being that of certain oolitic
grains in the Kelloways rock at Scarborough, which have undergone a
secondary crystallization.       These facts are all quite independent of the
fused black crust.
    Some of the minerals in meteorites, usually considered to be the same as
those in volcanic rocks, have yet very characteristic differences in structure
(Stannern), which      I  shall describe at greater length on a future occasion.
I  will then also give a full account of the microscopical structure of meteoric
iron as compared with that produced by various arti<U+FB01>cial processes, showing
that under certain conditions the latter may be obtained so as to resemble
very closely some varieties of meteoric origin (Newstead, &c.).
   There are thus certain peculiarities in physical structure which connect
meteorites with volcanic rocks, and at the same time others in which they
differ most characteristically,—facts which I think must be borne in mind,
not only in forming a conclusion as to the origin of meteorites, but also in
attempting to explain volcanic action in general.             The discussion of such
questions,    however,   should,   I  think,  be   deferred   until a more complete
account can be given of all the data on which these conclusions are founded.

                                 (Preliminary Notice.)
    The prevalent notions respecting solubility have      been derived chie<U+FB02>y from
observations on crystalline salts, and are very imperfectly applicable to the
class of colloidal substances.        Hydrated silicic acid, for instance, when in
the soluble condition, is properly speaking a liquid body, like alcohol,
miscible with water in all proportions. We have no degrees of solubility
to speak of with respect to silicic acid, like the degrees of solubility of a
salt, unless it be with reference to silicic acid in the gelatinous condi
tion, which is usually looked upon as destitute of solubility.           The jelly of
silicic acid may be more or less rich in combined water, as it is <U+FB01>rst pre
pared, and it appears to be soluble in proportion to the extent of its hydra
tion.       A jelly containing 1 per cent. of silicic acid, gives with cold water
a solution containing about 1 of silicic acid in 5000 water; a jelly con
taining 5 per cent. of silicic acid, gives a solution containing about 1 part
of acid in 10,000 water. A less hydrated jelly than the last mentioned
is still less soluble; and <U+FB01>nally, when the jelly is rendered anhydrous, it
 gives gummy-looking white masses, which appear to be absolutely inso
 luble, like the light dusty silicic acid obtained by drying a jelly charged
 with salts, in the ordinary analysis of a silicate.
     The liquidity of silicic acid is only affected by a change, which is perma
 ment (namely, coagulation or pectization), by which the acid is converted
 into the gelatinous or pectous form, and loses its miscibility with water.
 The liquidity is permanent in proportion to the degree of dilution of silicic
 acid, and appears to be favoured by a low temperature.            It is opposed, on
 the contrary, by concentration, and by elevation of temperature.            Aliquid
 silicic acid of 10 or 12 per cent. pectizes spontaneously in a few hours at
 the ordinary temperature, and immediately when heated.               A liquid of 5
  per cent. may be preserved for <U+FB01>ve or six days; a liquid of 2 per cent. for
  two or three months; and a liquid of 1 per cent. has not pectized after two
  years.     Dilute solutions of 0'1 per cent. or less are no doubt practically
  unalterable    by time, and hence the possibility of soluble silicic acid ex
  isting in nature.       I may add, however, that no solution, weak or strong,
  of silicic acid in water has shown any disposition to deposit crystals, but
  always appears on drying as a colloidal glassy hyalite.         The formation of
  quartz crystals    at a  low temperature,  of so  frequent  occurrence   in nature,
  remains still a mystery.       I can only imagine that such crystals are formed
  at an inconeeivably slow rate, and from solutions of silicic acid which are
  extremely dilute.       Dilution no doubt weakens the colloidal character of
  substances, and may therefore allow their crystallizing tendency to gain
  ground and develope itself, particularly where the crystal once formed            is
  completely insoluble, as with quartz.

  886            Mr. Graham    on the Properties   of Silicic Acid       [June 16,
      The pectization of liquid silicic acid is expedited by contact with solid
  matter in the form of powder.        By contact with pounded graphite, which
  is chemically inactive, the pectization of a 5 per cent. silicic acid is brought
  about in an hour or two, and that of a 2 per cent. silicic acid in two days.
 A rise of temperature of 1°'l C. was observed during the formation of the
  5  per cent. jelly.
     The ultimate pectization of silicic acid is preceded by a gradual thicken
 ing in the liquid itself. The <U+FB02>ow of liquid colloids through a capillary tube
 is always slow compared with the <U+FB02>ow of crystalloid solutions, so that a
 liquid~transpiration-tube may be employed as a colloidoscope.         With a col
 loidal liquid alterable in viscosity, such as silicic acid, the increased resist
 ance to passage through the colloidoscope is obvious from day to day.
 Just before gelatinizing, silicic acid <U+FB02>ows like an oil.
     A dominating quality of colloids is the tendency of their particles to ad
 here, aggregate, and contract.     This idio-attraction is obvious in the gradual
 thickening of the liquid, and when it advances leads to pectization.           In
 the jelly itself, the peci<U+FB01>c contraction in question, or syneresia, still pro
ceeds, causing separation of water, with the division into a clot and
serum; and ending in the production of a hard stony mass, of vitreous
   tructure, which may be anhydrous, or nearly so, when the water is allowed
to escape by evaporation.        The intense syneeresis of isinglass dried in a
glass dish over sulphuric acid in vacua, enables the contracting gelatin to
tear up the surface of the glass. Glass itself is a colloid, and the adhesion of
 colloid to colloid appears to be more powerful than that of colloid to crystal
 loid. The gelatin, when dried in the manner described upon plates of calc
 spar and mica, did not adhere to the crystalline surface, but detached itself
on drying.       Polished plates of glass must not he left in contact, as is well
known, owing to the risk of permanent adhesion between their surfaces.
The adhesion of broken masses of glacial phosphoric acid to each other is
an old illustration of colloidal synaeresis.
     Bearing in mind that the colloidal phasis of matter is the result of a
peculiar    attraction and aggregation   of molecules, properties never entirely
absent from matter but greatly more developed in some substances than in
others, it is not surprising that colloidal characters spread on both sides
into the liquid and solid conditions.         These characters appear in the
viscidity of liquids, and in the softness and adhesiveness of certain crystal
line substances.       Metaphosphate of soda, after fusion by heat, is a true
glass    or colloid;  but when this glass is maintained for a few minutes at a
temperature some degrees under its point of fusion, the glass assumes a
crystalline structure without losing its transparency.           Notwithstanding
this change, the low diffusibility of the salt is preserved, with other cha
racters of a colloid.      Water in the form of ice has already been repre
sented as a similar intermediate form, both colloid and crystalline, and
in the <U+FB01>rst character adhesive and capable of reunion or “ regelation."
     It is unnecessary to return here to the fact of the ready pectization of

 liquid silicic acid by alkaline salts, including some of very sparing solubility,
 such as carbonate of lime, beyond stating that the presence of carbonate of
 lime in water was observed to be incompatible with the coexistence of so
 luble silicic acid, till the proportion of the latter was reduced to nearly 1
 in 10,000 water.
     Certain liquid substances differ from the salts in exercising little or no
 pectizing in<U+FB02>uence upon liquid silicic acid.      But, on the other hand, none
 of the liquids now referred to appear to conduce to the preservation of the
 <U+FB02>uidity of the colloid, at least not more than the addition of water would
  do.    Among these inactive diluents of silicic acid are found hydrochloric,
  nitric, acetic, and tartaric acids, syrup of sugar, glycerine, and alcohol.
  But all the liquid substances named, and many others, appear to possess an
  important relation to silicic acid, of a very diiferent nature from the
  peetizing action of salts.    They are capable of displacing the combined
  water of the silicic acid hydrate, whether that hydrate is in the liquid or
  gelatinous condition, and give new substitution-products.
     A liquid compound of alcohol and silicic acid is obtained by adding
  alcohol to aqueous silicic acid, and then employing proper means to with
  draw the water from the mixture.   For that purpose the mixture contained
  in cup may
     a         be  placed over dry carbonate of potash or quicklime, within
  the receiver     of an air-pump.Or a dialyzing bag of parchment-paper con
  taining the mixed alcohol   and  silicic acid may be suspended in a jar of
  alcohol : the water diffuses away, leaving in the bag a liquid composed
  of alcohol and silicic acid only.    A point to be attended to           is,
                                                                       that the
  silicic acid should never  be allowed to form   more than   per cent.1  of the
  alcoholic solution, otherwise     may gelatinize during the experiment.

colourless. When a sulphagel is heated strongly in an open vessel, the last
portions of the monohydrated sulphuric acid in combination are found to
require a higher temperature for their expulsion than the boiling-point of
the acid.      The whole silicic acid remains behind, forming a white, opaque,
porous mass, like pumice. A sulphagel placed in water is soon decomposed,
and the original hydrogel reproduced.            No permanent compound of sul
phuric and silicic acids, of the nature of a salt, appears to be formed in
any circumstances.        A sulphagel placed in alcohol gives ultimately a pure
alcogel.     Similar jellies of silicic acid may readily be formed with the mono
hydrates of nitric, acetic, and formic acids, and are all perfectly transparent.
     The production of the compounds of silicic acid now described indicates
the possession of a wider range of a<U+FB02>inity by a colloid than could well be
anticipated.      The organic colloids are no doubt invested with similar wide
powers of combination, which may become of interest to the physiologist.
The capacity of a mass of gelatinous silicic acid to assume alcohol, or even
oleine, in the place of water of combination, without disintegration or altera
tion of form, may perhaps afford a clue to the penetration of the albuminous
 matter of membrane by fatty and other insoluble bodies, which seems to
 occur in the digestion of food.         Still more -remarkable and suggestive are
 the <U+FB02>uid compounds of silicic acid.           The <U+FB02>uid alcohol-compound favours
 the possibility of the existence of a compound of the colloid albumen with
 oleine, soluble also and capable of circulating with the blood.
     The feehleness of the force which holds together two substances belonging
 to different physical classes, one being a colloid and the other a crystalloid,
 is a subject deserving notice. When such a compound is placed in a <U+FB02>uid,
 the superior diffusive energy of the crystalloid may cause its separation from
 the colloid.     Thus, of hydrated silicic acid, the combined water (a crystal
 loid) leaves the acid (a colloid) to diffuse into alcohol ; and if the alcohol
 be repeatedly changed, the entire water is thus removed, alcohol (another
 crystalloid) at the same time taking the place of water in combination with
 the silicic acid.    The liquid in excess (here the alcohol) gains entire pos
 session of the silicic acid.     The process is reversed if an alcogel be placed
 in   a considerable volume of water.       Then alcohol separates from combina
 tion, in consequence of the opportunity it possesses to diffuse into water ;
 and water, which is now the liquid present in excess, recovers possession of
 the silicic acid.     Such changes illustrate the predominating      in<U+FB02>uence of
  mass.
     Even the compounds of silicic acid with alkalies yield to the decomposing
  force of diffusion.    The compound of silicic acid with 1 or 2 per cent. of
  soda is a colloidal solution, and, when placed in a dialyzer over water in
  vacuo to exclude carbonic acid, suffers gradual decomposition.         The soda
  diffuses off slowly in the caustic state, and gives the usual brown oxide of
  silver when tested with the nitrate of that base.
     The pectization of liquid silicic acid and many other liquid colloids is
  effected by contact with minute quantities of salts in a way which is not
      voL. sun.                                                     2 c

alkali. The latter change is gradual, 1 part of caustic soda, dissolved in
10,000 water, liquefying 200 parts of silicic acid (estimated dry) in 60
minutes at 100° C.        Gelatinous stannic acid also is easily lique<U+FB01>ed by a
small proportion of alkali, even at the ordinary temperature.            The alkali,
too, after liquefying the gelatinous colloid, may be separated again from it by
diffusion into water upon a dialyzer.          The solution of these colloids, in
such circumstances, may be looked upon as analogous to the solution of in
soluble organic colloids witnessed in animal digestion, with the di<U+FB01>erence
that the solvent <U+FB02>uid here is not acid but alkaline. Liquid silicic acid may
be represented as the “ peptone
                                     ” of
                                           gelatinous silicic acid; and the lique
faction of the latter by a trace of alkali may be spoken of as the peptization
of the jelly. The pure jellies of alumina, peroxide of iron, and titanic acid,
prepared by dialysis, are assimilated more closely to albumen, being peptized
by minute quantities of hydrochloric acid.
    Liquid Stanuic and Metastarmic Acids.—-Liquid stannic acid is prepared
by dialyzing the bichloride of tin with an addition of alkali, or by dialyzing
the stannate   of soda with an addition of hydrochloric acid.         In both  cases
a jelly is <U+FB01>rst formed on the dialyzer; but, as the salts di<U+FB01>'use away, the jelly
is again peptized by the small proportion of free alkali remaining: the
alkali itself may be removed by continued diiiusion, a drop or two of the
 tincture of iodine facilitating the separation.        The liquid stannic acid is
 converted on heating it into liquid metastannic acid.           Both liquid acids
 are remarkable for the facility with which they are pectized by a minute
 addition of hydrochloric acid, as well as by salts.
    Liquid Titanic Acid is prepared by dissolving gelatinous titanic acid in a
 small quantity of hydrochloric acid, without heat, and placing the liquid
 upon a dialyzer for several days.       The liquid must not contain more than
 1 per cent. of titanic acid, otherwise      it spontaneously gelatinizes, but it
 appears more stable when dilute.        Both titanic and the two stannic acids
 afford  the same    classes  of compounds      with alcohol &c.   as are obtained
 with silicic acid.
    Liquid Tungetic Ac-id.—-The obscurity which has so long hung over
 tungstic acid is removed by a dialytic examination.            It is in fact a re
 markable colloid, of which the pectous form alone has hitherto been known.
 Liquid tungstic acid is prepared by adding dilute hydrochloric acid care
 fully to  a 5 per cent. solution   of tungstate of soda, in su<U+FB01>icient proportion
 to neutralize the   alkali, and then placing the resulting liquid on a dialyser.
 In about three days the acid is found pure, with the loss of about 20 per
 cent.,  the salts having diffused entirely away.           It is remarkable that
 the puri<U+FB01>ed acid is not pectized by acids or salts even at the boiling
  temperature.     Evaporated to dryness, it forms vitreous scales, like gum
  or gelatin,  which sometimes adhere         so strongly   to the   surface of the
  evaporating dish as to detach portions of it.       It may be heated to 200° C.

 without losing its solubility or passing into the pectous state, but at a tem
 perature near redness it undergoes a molecular change, losing at the same
 time 2'42 per cent. of water. When water is added to unchanged tungstic
 acid, it becomes pasty and adhesive like gum; and it forms a liquid with
 about one-fourth its weight of water, which is so dense as to <U+FB02>oat glass.
 The solution effervesces with carbonate of soda, and tungstic acid is evi
 dently associated with silicic and molybdic acids. The taste of tungstic acid
 dissolved in water is not metallic or acid, but rather bitter and astringent.
                                                                                                        '
 Solutions of tungstic acid containing 5, 20, 50, 66'5, and 79'8 per cent. of
 dry acid, possess the following densities at 19°, l'0475, l'2l68, l'800l,
 2'396, and 3'24-'3. Evaporated in vacuo liquid tungstic acid is colourless,
 but becomes green in air from the deoxidating action of organic matter.
 Liquid silicic acid is protected from pectizing when mixed with tungstic
 acid, a circumstance probably connected with the formation of the double
 compounds  of these acids which M. Marignac has lately described.
    Molybdic Acid has hitherto been known (like tungstic acid) only in the
  insoluble form.     Crystallized molybdate of soda dissolved in water is de
  composed by the gradual addition of hydrochloric acid in excess without
  any immediate precipitation.     The acid liquid thrown upon a dialyzer may
  gelatinize after a few hours, but again lique<U+FB01>es spontaneously, when the
  salts di<U+FB02>'use away.    After a diffusion of three days, about 60 per cent. of
  the molybdic acid remains behind in a pure condition.        The solution of
  pure molybdic acid is yellow, astringent to the taste, acid to test-paper,
  and possesses much stability.   The acid may be dried at 100°, and then
  heatedto 200° without losing its solubility. Soluble molybdic acid has the
  same  gummy aspect as soluble tungstic acid, and deliquesces slightly when
  exposed to damp air.    Both acids lose their colloidality when digested with
  soda for a short time, and give a variety of crystallizable salts.

342                      Dr. Hofmann’s        Researches on the               [J one 16,
upon this subject, attributes to this compound a formula dilfering from the
expression at which I had arrived.             According to M. Schi<U+FB02>', aniline-blue
is not a triamine, as      I  had found, but a tetramine, which may be looked
upon as a combination        of rosauiline with triphenylamine,

    This formula is less simple than the one had given; it attributes to
aniline-blue a constitution not supported by analogy, and involves the
necessity of assuming, for the formation of this substance, a reaction which
ceases to be a simple process of substitution.
    M. Schi<U+FB02>"s formula is given as the result of an un<U+FB01>nished inquiry, and
the author himself appears to have but limited con<U+FB01>dence in its correct
ness.    Nevertheless, the publication of his Note imposed upon me the
duty of con<U+FB01>rming by new experiments the result of my former researches
upon this subject.
    The material used in these new experiments was likewise furnished to
me by Mr. Nicholson; it had been taken from the product of an operation
perfectly diiferent from the one which had supplied the <U+FB01>rst specimen.
In the following synopsis the experimental numbers of the former analyses
are marked (a), in contradistinction to those (b) recently performed.

     The preceding analyses appear to establish beyond a doubt the com
position of aniline-blue; and I do not hesitate to maintain the formula
originally established    _by me as the true expression       of the constitution of
                          '
this compound.
     The resumption of this inquiry has led me to some observations which
afford an additional support of the composition of aniline-blue.
   '
     Rosaniline, when submitted to dry distillation, undergoes an irregular
 decomposition.      Ammonia is evolved, a large amount of liquid bases (from
 40 to 50 per cent.) passes over, and a porous mass of charcoal remains in
 the retort.     The principal constituent of the liquid product is aniline.
     Ethyl-roeianiline, the commercial aniline-violet, already manufactured
 on a large scale by Messrs. Simpson, Maule, and Nicholson, when distilled,
 exhibits similar phenomena.        There is no di<U+FB01>iculty in separating from the
liquid product an appreciable amount of ethylaniline, the presence of which
 has been established by the examination of the platinum-salt.
     The relation existing between aniline-violet, obtained by the action          of
 iodide   of ethyl, and aniline-red, cannot possibly     be doubtful.    Now, since
 analysis points out similar relations between aniline-blue and aniline-red, it
 became perfectly legitimate to anticipate, among the products of distilla
 tion of aniline-blue, z'.e. of pkenylated rosaniline, the presence of pheny
 lated aniline, or diphenylamine, a substance which chemists had often, but
 vainly, endeavoured to prepare.         Eirperiment    has veri<U+FB01>ed   this anticipa
 tion.
     Some weeks ago my friend, M. Charles Girard, Director of the Works
  of the Fuchsine Company at Lyons, had the kindness to transmit to me
  for examination some basic oils of high boiling-point which he had obtained
  by the destructive    distillation of a considerable quantity of aniline-blue.
 The product of distillation which he forwarded to me was brown and viscid.
 When recti<U+FB01>ed, it furnished a slightly coloured liquid; at 300° the thermo
  meter indicated the distillation of a de<U+FB01>nite compound.
     The distillate which had -passed between 280° and 300° solidi<U+FB01>ed on
  addition   of hydrochloric acid,  a chloride  dif<U+FB01>cultly soluble (more especially
  in concentrated hydrochloric acid) being formed. By washing with alcohol,
  and ultimately by crystallization from this liquid, the chloride was obtained
  in a state of purity. When treated with ammonia, it furnished colourless
  oily drops, which, after a few moments, solidi<U+FB01>ed to a white crystalline
  mass.
      The crystals thus obtained possess a peculiar <U+FB02>ower-like odour; their
  taste is aromatic, and afterwards burning.        At 45° they fuse to a yellowish
 oil, distilling constantly, and without alteration, at 312° (corr.).       They are
 almost insoluble    in water, easily soluble in alcohol and ether.        Neither in
  aqueous nor in alcoholic solution has the substance any alkaline reaction.
  When brought into contact with concentrated acids, the crystals are converted
  into the corresponding salts, which are remarkable for their instability.       On
   the addition of water, the base separates in oily drops, rapidly solidifying to

crystals.     The chloride, when washed with water, loses every trace of
hydrochloric acid.
    The analysis of the base has led to the formula
                                        C12  Hll N.
    The composition      of the chloride,       which crystallizes from alcohol in
concentrically grouped needles, assuming a bluish tint by contact with the
air, is

   It deserves,   however, to be stated that the strict experimental demon
stration of   this mode of viewing the compound is still wanting, the ethyla
tion of the substance presenting di<U+FB02>iculties that I have not yet been able to
overcome.       I regret this gap, since the experience acquired in the study of
xenylamine, isomeric with diphenylamine,

and which for several weeks           I  regarded as the secondary phenyl-base,
points out    the  necessity  of consistently carrying out the process of ethyla
tion in the examination of bases of this kind.
   Diphenylamine      exhibits a peculiar reaction, which, while it appears to
reveal its relation to the colour-generating aniline, enables us to recognize
the presence of the new base.           In contact with concentrated nitric acid,
diphenylamine, as       well as  its  salts,  assumes at once a magni<U+FB01>cent blue
coloration.     The reaction succeeds best by pouring concentrated hydro
chloric acid upon a crystal of the base, and then adding the nitric acid drop
by drop.     Immediately the whole liquid becomes intensely indigo-blue.
Minute quantities of diphenylamine may in this manner be readily traced.
I  have thus been enabled to ascertain the presence            of this body, or, at all
events,  of a substance exhibiting this particular reaction, in the products
of distillation of rosaniline, leucaniline, and even of melaniline.            The last
experiment     deserves  particularly    to be  noticed,  since  it affords the general
method for the production of the secondary aromatic monamines, which
was hitherto wanting.
   The substance possessing the blue colour is formed also by the action of
other oxidizing agents.       On adding chloride of platinum to a solution of

XVII. “ On        Organic     Substances arti<U+FB01>cially formed from Albumen.”
       By ALFRED          H.    Saran,     F.C.S. Communicated by Auano
       SMEE, Esq., F.R.S.           Received May 27, 1864.
   In   a former     paper which I had the honour to submit to the Royal
Society,   I showed that <U+FB01>brin was formed by the passage of oxygen through
albumen, provided        a temperature    of 98° F. was maintained.          It was then
observed that a slightly acid state of         the   albumen, or the absence of the
alkaline salts was     found   to be most   favourable    to its formation.     I noticed
also that ammonia had little effect in preventing the formation of <U+FB01>brin,
but after the lapse of a short time caused it to swell to such a degree that
its microscopic characters could no longer be detennined.               It was observed
that albumen acted on by gastric juice; and passed through a membrane,
still had the capacity to form <U+FB01>brin in small amount.
   Since the publication of that paper,        I have conducted the following expe
riments in addition to those before mentioned.               I submitted some of the
fluid drawn off from a spina bi<U+FB01>da to the action of oxygen and heat in the
ordinary manner; after the lapse of a few hours it yielded a substance
which, under the microscope, presented all the characters of <U+FB01>brin.
   I  tried to obtain <U+FB01>brin from the urine in two cases in which it was
highly albuminous.         The urine was so loaded with albumen that it became
almost solid by heat.         I never have been able to transform this variety of
albumen into      <U+FB01>brin,  although the experiment was tried in many ways.                I
expect that     on  further  investigation  it will be found   that the  albumen   found
in urine (in most      cases at least) is a substance not capable       of further  deve
lopment.
   The next experiment which          I  have to describe is to my mind one of the
most beautiful exempli<U+FB01>cations of the arti<U+FB01>cial formation of organic bodies
under physical laws, producing results similar to those which we observe
under certain circumstances in disease, the changes being produced by the
action of a gas on a second body separated by a membrane, and having to
traverse it before the chemical changes can be effected.
   I  passed a current of oxygen gas through a small portion of perfectly
clean    intestine,   with the peritoneal coat attached.            The intestine was
placed in an albuminous <U+FB02>uid at a temperature of 98° F.; at the end of
twenty-four hours I found the intestine completely invested with minute
<U+FB01>brinous outgrowths, similar to those seen on the intestines of persons who
have died at the earliest stage of peritonitis.
   It is worth noticing that although these <U+FB01>brinous outgrowths take place
when the peritoneum of the intestine remains, yet if this coat be stripped
off they take place to avery limited extent.            In many cases no outgrowths
appear, even where the conditions          of the experiments are equal.
   It appears to me       that the tendency of <U+FB01>brin to be deposited on serous
 membranes, -under favourable circumstances, may throw some light on the

                           arti<U+FB01>cially formed from Albumen.                            351
frequency with which we <U+FB01>nd the surfaces of serous membranes (for
instance, the pericardium) so often coated with <U+FB01>brinous outgrowths.
  If  hydrogen is passed through albumen to which a small quantity of
potash has been added su<U+FB01>icient to ensure a slight excess of alkali,
after the lapse of some time a dense hard horny mass will be observed,
         at the point where the hydrogen comes into contact with the
especially
albumen; in fact the growth of the substance often clogs the tube to
such a degree that the hydrogenis prevented from further passing through
it.  It also has a tendency to grow upon platinized platinum when placed
in the albuminous <U+FB02>uid whilst the current of hydrogen is passing. The time
required    as is,
                rule, about four days
                     a                   temperature of 98° F. rather favours

 making   a larger   or smaller surface of the platinum come in contact with
 the zinc.     The amount of oxygen which is carried over is very limited,
provided a tube is used of % inch diameter; but when a tube of 11 inch is
used, a quantity might pass sufficient to interfere with the experiment.
   The amount of oxygen at times thus carried over when the large tube
is used is so great, that achange in the products may take place and <U+FB01>brin
may be formed in the place of the chondrin, provided the albumen is not
over alkaline.
   As <U+FB01>brin was formed by oxygen, and this new substance analogous to
chondrin by hydrogen, it occurred to me that these two substances might
be formed      simultaneously by a simple-cell voltaic arrangement.          For this
purpose    I took  a tube with one end closed by parchment paper, or some
times by animal membrane, <U+FB01>lled it with albumen which had been made
slightly acid by acetic acid, and inserted it into a small vessel containing
albumen to which a small quantity of potash or soda had been added.                 I
then connected the two <U+FB02>uids by means of a platinum wire, so that one side
might become a positive and the other anegative pole. Considerable action
took place after the lapse of some time, when upon examination           I found the
albumen in the tube was changed, not into the <U+FB01>brillated <U+FB01>brin, but into a
granular material.       The other pole, or rather the the alkaline albumen, was
changed into a substance which behaved with various reagents in di<U+FB02>'erent
ways.   In   some cases   it was a tough, ropy and viscid substance, which was
coagulated    in water by  a solution of acetate of lead, was insoluble in acids and
in alcohol, and very slightly soluble in alkali. At other times I have noticed
a substance formed having very much the appearance of the expeetoration
of bronchitis; and at other times the dense hard substance analogous to
chondrin in its behaviour with reagents was formed.
   The various states of the material into which albumen is converted
appear to be in<U+FB02>uenced by the nature of the alkali employed and by the
relative size of the negative pole.       The temperature should be as nearly as
possible   constant   during  the  time the  experiment is being conducted. The
amount of the surface of membrane interposed appears to have very little
in<U+FB02>uence over the products.           When soda was the alkali employed, the
viscid and frothy mucus-like product was more frequently obtained.
   The amount of water present appears to have a very decided in<U+FB02>uence
on the product formed. When the viscid and frothy material is produced, it
appears to form quicker than the hard and dense chondrin.                The tempe
rature of 98° F. appears to favour the production of the chondrinous
material; but I must admit         I have sometimes made all the varieties, the
viscid, the frothy, and also the chondrin, at much lower temperatures.
   In one case    I  succeeded after many experiments in obtaining from the
acid pole, by keeping it at a temperature of 98° F., <U+FB01>brin of the <U+FB01>brillated
form, but the greater portion of the albumen at this pole was converted
into the granular form. The alkaline pole formed pretty constantly the
 dense hard arti<U+FB01>cial chondrin.

two a tough elastic product was obtained.
     In experiments tried by passing hydrogen through albumen greatly
diluted with water, I found, after the lapse of a few days, a <U+FB02>occulent de
posit very similar in appearance to the deposit of mucus which often
takes place when urine is allowed to stand a short time.               This point, how
ever, requires further investigation.               I tried also the effect of passing
hydrogen through a portion of intestine inserted into an albuminous <U+FB02>uid.
I   have not as yet been able to form either the dense hard or viscid frothy
substance by this method.               I repeated the experiment for the formation of
<U+FB01>brin from       albumen,     by decomposing the water of its composition by elec
tricity. I must admit this is the most di<U+FB01>icult, troublesome, and unsa
tisfactory of all the methods I have employed.                 I <U+FB01>nd that the great ten
dency      of the  poles to  form   different   substances on them,  and the great rapi
dity with which they grow together, lead, without the greatest care, to
the belief that two different substances, differing only in density, are formed
at one and the same pole, so intimately blended are they together.                Thus I
was led to believe at <U+FB01>rst sight that a dense hard substance was fonned at
 the oxygen end, and not until I had repeated the experiment many times
 did I discover that the substance belonged to the hydrogen and not to
 the oxygen pole, and had grown across from one pole to the other.
      I   have obtained on several occasions <U+FB01>brin and chondrin at the same
 time by conducting hydrogen and oxygen derived by the decomposition of
 water by voltaic electricity through separate tubes. The oxygen passed
 into slightly acid albumen formed <U+FB01>brin ; the hydrogen passed into alkaline
 albumen formed either the chondrin or else the frothy and viscid material.
 The temperature was kept up at 98° F. in these experiments. On one
 occasion,      however,    I   happened accidentally to reverse the current (that
 is to say, the hydrogen was passed into the acid, and the oxygen into the
  alkaline albumen), when no chondrin or <U+FB01>brin was formed.
      The following conclusions           I  have arrived at after the study   of the in
  <U+FB01>uence which oxygen and hydrogen gases exert upon albumen when sub
  mitted to their action separately. at a temperature of 98° F., the normal
  temperature of the living body.                Albumen under the action of oxygen
  forms, after the lapse of a longer or shorter period, <U+FB01>brin. The <U+FB01>brin thus
  arti<U+FB01>cially produced is of three distinct varieties, viz., lst, the granular
  form; 2nd, a form allied to lymph incapable of being unravelled into
   <U+FB01>brils; lastly, the true <U+FB01>brillated <U+FB01>brin. The law which appears to regu
   late the state into which the albumen is converted, as far as my observa
   tion has gone, is one of molecular aggregation, similar to the electric
   deposit of metals, as the slower the <U+FB01>brin is formed the more organized
   is  it in substance.
        I have observed that when <U+FB01>brin is rapidly formed it is almost always
    produced in the granular state; this is particularly the case with <U+FB01>brin

  by voltaic means.
      Lymph     I  consider to be imperfectly formed <U+FB01>brin more highly deve
  loped than the preceding or granular form.           It is possible for this arti
  <U+FB01>cially formed lymph, under favourable circumstances, to assume a more
  organized appearance.
      I  have no doubt that the <U+FB01>brinous outgrowths on the intestine would have
  become larger and more developed if the experiment had been carried on
  for   a su<U+FB01>icient  length of time.   In fact almost all the <U+FB01>brin formed round
  a platinum wire inserted into albumen is at <U+FB01>rst covered by outgrowths of
  a soft structure.     These outgrowths, at the earliest period of their forma
  tion, do not under the microscope present any appearance of <U+FB01>brils. After
  the lapse of some time they appear to undergo condensation, and then to
  organize to such an extent that it would be di<U+FB01>icult at <U+FB01>rst sight to deter
  mine whether the substance might not be a portion of <U+FB01>brous tissue.
      The alkalies, with the exception of ammonia, prevent entirely the forma
  tion   of <U+FB01>brin.    Ammonia,   although it does not retard its formation, dis
  solves it after the lapse of ashort time.     The acids and absence of alkaline
  salts favour its formation.       The opposite, however, is the case with the
  hydrogen products, as an alkaline state favours their production.
      The action of hydrogen on albumen, as far as my investigations have as
   yet proceeded, forms substances analogous to chondrin and mucin.                 I
   believe that the organic substances, chondrin and mucin, products formed
   in aliving organism, are very closely allied to one another, if not varieties of
   the same substance, differing only in their mode of aggregation and stages
  _of development, and the amount of water in their composition.
       Of the  exact mode in which hydrogen acts on albumen we are at present
   ignorant.     I have noticed that in some experiments sometimes one, some
   times the other product was obtained, even when the same in<U+FB02>uences were
   apparently acting on experiments conducted at the same time.
       Considering the important physiological part that <U+FB01>brin, chondrin,       and
  _mucin play in the living body, the production arti<U+FB01>cially of substances
  analogous in their behaviour with reagents to those products formed in a
  living organism will, I trust, be taken as a sui<U+FB01>cient excuse for submitting
   to the Royal Society a paper so obviously de<U+FB01>cient in many parts, but
   which, nevertheless, it would require   a vast amount   of both time and labour

        the Blood.”       By G. G. STOKES, l\I.A., Sec. R.S., Lucasian Pro
        fessor of Mathematics in the University of Cambridge. Received
        June    16, 1864-.
     1.  Some time     ago my attention was called to a paper by Professor
 Hoppe *, in which he has pointed out the remarkable spectrum produced
 by the absorption of light by a very dilute solution of blood, and applied
 the observation to elucidate the chemical nature of the colouring matter.
 I  had no sooner looked at the spectrum, than the extreme sharpness and
 beauty of the absorptiombands of blood excited a lively interest in my
 mind, and I proceeded to try the effect of various reagents. The observa
 tion is perfectly simple, since nothing more is required than to place the
 solution to be tried, which may be contained in             a test-tube, behind a  slit,
 and view it through a prism applied to the eye.               In this way it is easy to
 verify Hoppe's statement, that the colouring matter (as may be presumed
 at least from the retention of its peculiar spectrum) is unatfected by alkaline
 carbonates and caustic ammonia, but is almost immediately decomposed
  by acids, and also, but more slowly, by caustic <U+FB01>xed alkalies, the coloured
 product of decomposition         being the haarnatin       of Lecanu, which is easily
 identi<U+FB01>ed     by its peculiar spectra.     But it seemed to me to be a point of
 special interest to inquire whether we could imitate the change of colour
 of arterial into that of venous blood, on the supposition that it arises from
 reduction.
     2.  In my experiments I generally employed the blood of sheep or oxen
 obtained from a. butcher ; but Hoppe has shown that the blood of animals
 in general exhibits just the      same bands.       To obtain the colouring matter
 in true solution, and at the      same  time to get rid of a part of the associated
 matters,    I  generally allowed the blood to coagulate, cut the clot small,             ~
 rinsed it well, and extracted it with water.           This, however, is not essential,
 and blood merely diluted with a large quantity of water may be used; but
 in what follows it is to be understood that the watery extract is used unless
 the contrary be stated.
     3. Since the colouring matter is changed by acids, we must employ re
 ducing agents which are compatible with an alkaline solution.                   If to a
 solution of protosulphate of iron enough tartaric acid be added to prevent
 precipitation by alkalies, and      a small quantity of the solution, previously
  rendered    alkaline  by  either  ammonia     or carbonate of soda, be added to a
 solution of     blood, the colour is almost instantly changed to a much more
 purple red as seen in small thicknesses, and a much darker red than before
 as seen in greater thickness.        The change of colour, which recalls the dif
 ference between arterial        and venous blood, is striking enough, but the
 change    in  the  absorption spectrum is far more decisive.           The two highly

        the purple solution be exposed to the air in a shallow vessel, it
quickly returns to its original condition, showing the two characteristic
bands the same as before; and this change takes place immediately, pro
vided a small quantity only of the reducing agent were employed, when the
solution is shaken up with air.                   If
                                    an additional quantity of the reagent be
now added, the same effect is produced as at <U+FB01>rst, and the solution may
thus be made to go through its changes any number of times.
    5. The change produced by the action of the air (that     of course, by        is,
the absorption of oxygen) may be seen in an instructive form on partly

     6.   Of
         course it is necessary to assure oneself that the single band in the
green is not due to absorption produced merely by the reagent, as is readily
done by direct observation of its spectrum, not to mention that in the
region    of the previous dark bands, or at least the outer portions of          it,   the
solution    actually more transparent than before, which could not be occa
               is
sioned by an additional absorption.        Indeed the absorption due to the
reagent itself in its different stages of oxidation, unless  be employed in
                                                            it
most unnecessary excess, may almost be regarded as evanescent in com
parison with the absorption due to the colouring matter; though          the     if
solution be repeatedly put through its changes, the accumulation of the
persalt of iron will presently tell on the colour, making sensibly yellower

than at <U+FB01>rst for small thicknesses of the solution.
   7. That the change which the iron salt produces in the spectrum      due      is
to   simple reduction of the colouring matter, and not to the formation of
     a
some compound of the colouring matter with the reagent,      shown by the
                                                                 is
fact that  variety of reducing agents of very different nature produce just
               a
the same effect. If protochloride of tin be substituted for protosulphate
of iron in the experiment above described, the same changes take place
as with the iron salt.  The tin solution has the advantage of being colour
less, and leaving the visible spectrum quite unaffected, both before and
after oxidation, and accordingly of not interfering in the slightest degree
with the optical examination of the solutions, but permitting them to be
seen with exactly their true tints.   The action of this reagent, however,
takes some little time at ordinary temperatures, though       very rapid
                                                             it   is                    if
previously the solution be gently wamied.      Hydrosulphate of ammonia
again produces the same change, though        small fraction of the colouring
                                                   a
matter    liable to undergo some different modi<U+FB01>cation, as
          is                                                    shown by the
                                                                 is
occurrence   of  slender
                    a    band in the red, variable in its amount  of develop
ment, which did not previously exist.    In this case, as with the tin salt, the
action   somewhat slow, requiring
          is                           few minutes unless
                                              a                  he assisted by

gentle heat. Other  reagents might    be  mentioned,   but these  will suffice.
   8. We may infer from the facts above mentioned that the colouring
matter of blood, like indigo,    capable of existing in two states of oxida
                                    is

in the action  on the spectrum.          It
                                     may be made to pass from the more to
the less oxidized state by the action of suitable reducing agents, and re
covers it; oxygen by absorption from the air.
   As the term haematin has been appropriated to product of decomposi

it has not been named          by
                           Hoppe,I propose to call     cruorine, as suggested

bottle, or even in a tall narrow vessel open at the top, it presently changes
in colour from a bright to a dark red, decidedly purple in small thicknesses.
This change is perceived even before the solution has begun to stink in the
least perceptible degree. The tint agrees with that of the purple cruorine
obtained immediately by reducing agents; and if a little of the solution be
sucked up from the bottom into a quill-tube drawn to a capillary point, and
the tube be then placed behind a slit, so as to admit of analyzing the
transmitted light without exposing the fluid to the air, the spectrum will
be found to agree with that of purple cruorine.         On shaking the solution
with air it immediately becomes bright red, and now presents the optical
 characters of scarlet cruorine.      It thus appears that scarlet cruorine is
 capable of being reduced by certain substances, derived from the blood,
 present in the solution, which must themselves be oxidized at its expense.
     10. When the alkaline tartaric solution of protoxide of tin is added in
moderate quantity to a solution of scarlet cruorine, the latter is presently
 reduced.    If the solution is now shaken with air, the cruorine is almost
instantly oxidized, as is shown by the colour of the solution and its spec
trum by transmitted light. On standing for a little time, a couple of minutes
or so, the cruorine is again reduced, and the solution may be made to go
through these changes a great number of times, though not of course in
 de<U+FB01>nitely, as the tin must at last become completely oxidized.           It thus
appears that purple cruorine absorbs free oxygen with much greater avidity
 than the tin solution, notwithstanding      that the oxidized cruorine is itself
reduced by the tin salt.     I shall return to this experiment presently.
     11. When a little acid, suppose acetic or tartaric acid, which does not
 produce a precipitate, is added to a solution of blood, the colour is quickly
changed from red to brownish red, and in place of the original bands (<U+FB01>g. l)
we have a different system, nearly that of <U+FB01>g. 3.         This system is highly
characteristic; but in order to bring it out a larger quantity of substance
is requisite than in the case of scarlet cruorine.   The <U+FB01>gure does not exactly
correspond to any one thickness, for the bands in the blue are best seen
while the band in the red is still rather narrow and ill-de<U+FB01>ned at its edges,
while the narrow inconspicuous band in the yellow hardly comes out till
the whole of the blue and violet, and a good part of the green, are absorbed.
The difference in the spectra <U+FB01>gs. 1 and 3 does not alone prove that the
 colouring matter is decomposed by the acid (though the fact that the
 change is not instantaneous favours that supposition), for the one solution
is alkaline, though it may be only slightly so, while the other is acid, and
the difference of spectra might be due merely to this circumstance.            As
the direct addition of either ammonia or carbonate of soda to the acid
liquid causes a precipitate, it is requisite in the <U+FB01>rst instance to separate the
 colouring matter from the substance so precipitated.
    This may be easily effected on a small scale by adding to the watery
 extract from blood-clots about an equal volume of ether, and then some
  glacial acetic acid, and gently mixing, but not violently shaking for fear

of forming an emulsion.          When enough acetic acid has been added, the
acid     ether rises charged    with nearly the whole of the colouring matter,
while the substance which caused the precipitate remains in the acid watery
layer below ". The acid ether solution shows in perfection the characteristic
 spectrum fig. 3.       When most of the acid is washed out the substance falls,
 remaining in the ether near the common surface.                  If after removing the
wash-water a solution, even a weak one,            of ammonia or carbonate of soda
be added, the      colouring matter readily dissolves in the alkali. The spec
trum of the transmitted light is quite different from that of scarlet cruorine,
and    by no means     so remarkable.      It  presents a single band of absorption,
very obscurely divided into two, the centre of which nearly coincides with
the <U+FB01>xed line D, so that the band is decidedly less refrangible than the
pair of bands of scarlet cruorine.         The relative proportion of the two parts
of the band is liable to vary.          The presence of alcohol, perhaps even of
dissolved     ether, seems    to favour   the <U+FB01>rst part, and an excess          of caustic
alkali the second, the <U+FB02>uid at the same time becoming more decidedly
dichroitic. The blue end of the spectrum is at the same time absorbed.
The band of absorption is by no means so de<U+FB01>nite at its edges as those of
scarlet cruorine, and a far larger quantity of the substance is required to
develope it.
    This difference of spectra shows that the colouring mutter (heematin)
obtained by acids is a product of the decomposition, or metamorphosis of
some kind, of the original colouring matter.
    When hsematin is dissolved in alcohol containing acid, the spectrum
nearly agrees with that represented in fig. 3.
     12. Haematin is capable of reduction and oxidation like cruorine.                   If
it be dissolved in a solution of ammonia or of carbonate of soda, and a little
of the iron salt already mentioned, or else of hydrosulphate of ammonia, be
added, a pair of very intense bands of absorption is immediately developed
(<U+FB01>g. 4).       These bands are situated at about the same distance apart as
those     of scarlet cruorine, and are no less sharp and distinctive.            They are
a  little more refrangible, a clear though narrow interval intervening between
the <U+FB01>rst of them and the line D.              They differ much from the bands of
cruorine in the relative strength of the <U+FB01>rst and second hand. With cruo
rine the second hand appears almost as soon as the <U+FB01>rst, on increasing the
strength or thickness of the solution fromzero onwards, and when both
bands      are well developed, the second hand is decidedly broader than the
<U+FB01>rst.      With reduced haematin, on the other hand, the <U+FB01>rst band is already
black and intense by the time the second begins to appear; then both
bands increase, the <U+FB01>rst retaining its superiority until the two are on the
   *   If I may judge from the results obtained with the precipitate given by acetic acid
and a neutral salt, a promising mode of separation of the proximate constituents of blood
crystals would be to dissolve the crystals in glacial acetic acid and add ether, which pre
cipitates a white albuminous substance, leaving the haamatin in solution.

         bands of scarlet cruorine                  in forensic inquiries.  Since, however, cruorine
         is very easily decomposed,                  as     by

              15.   1                                          speculations until
                        have purposely abstained from physiological                                                   I
         should have <U+FB01>nished   the chemico-optical part of the subject; but as the
         facts which have been adduced seem calculated to throw considerable light
         on the function of cruorine                 in the animal economy,                I     may perhaps          be
         permitted to make               a   few remarks on this subject.
           It has been disputed    a  point whether the oxygen introduced into the
         blood in its passage -through the lungs   simply dissolved orischemically                    is

 combined with some constituent of the blood.   The latter and more natural
 view seems for a time to have given place to the former in consequence of
 the experiments of Magnus. But Liebig and others have since adduced
 arguments          to show that the oxygen absorbed                     is,
                                                          mainly at least, chemically
 combined,          be   only in such

 in bicarbonate              of   soda, that        it   is   capable of being expelled by indifferent
 gases.        It   is   known, too, that            it   is   the red corpuscles in which the faculty
 of absorbing oxygen mainly resides.
    Now    has been shown in this paper that we have
            it                                        cruorine  substance        in               a
 capable of undergoing reduction and oxidation, more especially oxidation,
 so that   we may assume the presence of purple cruorine in venous blood,
            if
 we have all that                 is   necessary to account for the absorption and chemical
 combination of the inspired oxygen.
    16. It    stated by Hoppe that venous as well as arterial blood shows
                 is
 the two bands which are characteristic of what has been called in this
 paper scarlet cruorine.  As the precautions taken to prevent the absorption
 of oxygen are not mentioned,          desirable to repeat the experiment,
                                                    it    seemed
 which Dr. Harley and Dr. Sharpey have kindly done.        pipette adapted             A
 to syringe was <U+FB01>lled with water which had been boiled and cooled without
    a
 exposure to the air, and the point having been introduced into the jugular
 vein of  live dog,
            a          little blood was drawn into the bulb. Without the
                                  a
 water the blood                  would         for spectral analysis.
                                            have been too dark         The
 colour did not much differ from that of scarlet cruorine; certainly   was                                 it
 much nearer the scarlet than the purple substance.   The spectrum showed
 the bands          of scarlet cruorine.
    This, however, does not by any means prove the absence of purple cruo
 rine, but only shows that the colouring matter present was chie<U+FB02>y scarlet
 cruorine.   Indeed the relative proportions of the two present in    mixture                          a
 of them with one another and with colourless substances, can be better
 judged of by the tint than by the use of the prism.      With the prism the
 extreme sharpness of the bands of scarlet cruorine       apt to mislead, and    is
 to induce the observer greatly to exaggerate the relative proportion of that
 substance.
    Seeing then that the change of colour from arterial to venous blood as
 far as goes in the direction of the change from scarlet to purple cruo
          it             is
 rine, that scarlet cruorine                   is   capable     of reduction   even    in the cold         by   sub
 stances present in the blood      9), and that the action of reducing agents

On the other hand, Magnus removed as much as I0 or 12 per cent. by
volume of oxygen from arterialized blood by shaking the blood with car
bonic acid.       If,
                 as we have reason to believe, this oxygen was for the most
part chemically combined,        follows that carbonic acid acts as
                                  it                                      were          it             a

effect of the presence of carbonic acid, but        consequence of the removal

pure solution of scarlet cruorine, while the latter act just as before.
   If even in the case of blood exposed to an atmosphere of carbonic acid
we are not to attribute the change of colour to the direct presence of the
gas, much less should we attempt to account for the darker colour of
venous than arterial blood          by
                                 the small additional percentage of carbonic
acid which the former contains.       The ascertained properties of cruorine
furnish us with    ready explanation, namely that

The author uses throughout the language of the ozone theory.               If                          by
ozone be meant the substance, be        allotropic oxygen or teroxide of hy

nothing to prove its existence in blood; for all attempts to obtain an oxi
dizing gas from blood failed.    But        ozone be merely meant oxygen in
                                            if   by
any such state, of combination or otherwise, as to be capable of producing
certain oxidizing effects, such as turning guaiacum blue, the experiments                             of
Schmidt have completely established its existence, and have connected                                 it,
too, with the colouring matter.           Now in cruorine           we have    a   substance ad
mitting of      easy oxidation and reduction     ;   and connecting this with Schmidt’s
results, we may infer that scarlet cruorine     not merely

         the papers of Volta in 1779, are quoted as showing that bodies do not take
         up electricity in proportion to their surfaces.   According to Volta, any
         plane surface extended in length sustains    greater charge,—a result which

         the exposed surfaces; so that we cannot accumulate twice the quantity of
         electricity upon the plate under the same electrometer indication.
            5. On   a further investigation of the laws of electrical charge, the quan

is found to depend not only on the surface, but also on its linear boundary
extension.       Thus the linear boundary of 100 square inches of surface under
a rectangle 37'5 inches long by 2'66 inches wide, is about 80 inches;
whilst the linear boundary of the same 100 square inches of surface under
a plate 10 inches square is only 40 inches.           Hence the charge of the rec
tangle is much greater than that of the square, although the surfaces are
equal, or nearly so.
      6. The author <U+FB01>nds, by a rigid experimental examination of this question,
that electrical charge depends upon surface and linear extension conjointly.
 He endeavours to show that there exists in every plane surface what may
 be termed an electrical boundary, having an important relation to the group
 ing or disposition of the electrical particles in regard to each other and to
 surrounding matter.        This boundary, in circles or globes, is represented by
 their circumferences.       In plane rectangular surfaces, it is their linear ex
 tension or perimeter.       If this boundary be constant, their electrical charge
  (1)   varies with  the  square root of the surface.    If the surface be constant,
  the charge varies with the square root of the boundary.             If the surface and
  boundary both vary, the charge varies with the square             root  of the surface
  multiplied into the square root of the boundary.       Thus, calling C the charge
  S the surface,    B the boundary, and p some arbitrary constant depending
  on the electrical unit of charge, we have C= p 4 $3, which will be found,
  with some exceptions, a general law of electrical charge.             It follows from
  this formula, that if when we double the surface we also double the boun
  dary, the charge will be also double.       In this case the charge may be said
  to vary with the surface, since it varies with the square root of the surface,
  multiplied into the square root of the boundary.           If therefore the surface
  and boundary both increase together, the charge will vary with the square
  of either quantity. The quantity of electricity therefore which surfaces can
   sustain under these conditions will be as the surface.         If  l and b represent
                                                                           surface, then
   respectively the length and breadth of a plane rectangular

   to agree perfectly with experiment.       We have, however, in all these cases

   in an inverse ratio of the boundary multiplied into the surface.
                                                                              If the sur

 the quantity.
     8. These laws relating to charge, surface, intensity, &c., apply more
 especially to continuous surfaces taken as a whole, and not to surfaces
 divided into separated parts.     The author illustrates this by examining the
 result of an electrical accumulation upon a plane rectangular surface taken
 as a whole, and the results    of the same   accumulation    upon the same sur
 face divided   into two equal and similar portion      distant from each other,
 and endeavours to show, that if as we increase the quantity we also increase
 the surface and boundary, the intensity does not change.        If three or more
 separated equal spheres, for example, be charged with three or more equal
 quantities, and be each placed in separate connexion with the electrometer,
 the intensity of the whole is not greater than the intensity of one of the parts.
 A similar   result ensues  in charging any united number of equal and similar
electrical jars. A battery of <U+FB01>ve equal and similar jars, for example, charged
 with a given quantity =1, has the same intensity as a battery of ten equal
 and similar jars charged with quantity =2; so that the intensity of the
ten jars taken together is no greater than the intensity of one of the jars
 taken singly. In accumulating a double quantity upon a given surface
 divided into two equal and separate parts, the boundaries of each being
the same, the intensity varies inversely as the square of the surface. Hence
two separate equal parts can receive, taken together under the same electro
 meter indication, twice the quantity which either can receive alone, in
which case the charge varies with the surface.      Thus if a given quantity be
disposed upon two equal and similar jars instead of upon one of the jars
only, the intensity upon the two jars will be only one-fourth the intensity
of  one  of them, since the intensity in this case varies  with the square of the
surface inversely, whilst the quantity upon the two jars under the same
elcctrometer indication will be double the quantity upon one of them only ;
in which case the charge varies with the surface, the intensity being con
stant.    If therefore as we increase the number of equal and similar jars
we    also increase the quantity, the intensity remains the same, and the
charge will increase with the number of jars.           Taking a given surface
therefore in equal and divided parts, as for example four equal and similar
electrical jars, the intensity is found to vary with the square of the quantity
directly (the number of jars remaining the same), and with the square of
the surface inversely (the number of jars being increased or diminished);
hence the charge will vary as the square of the quantity divided by the
square of the surface; and we have, calling C the charge, Q the quantity,
                           2
and S the surface,             which formula fully represents the phenomenon
                        =%;
of  a constant intensity,  attendant upon the charging of equal separated sur
faces with quantities increasing as the surfaces ; as in the case ot' charging
an increasing number of equal electrical jars. Cases, however, may possibly
 arise in which the intensity varies inversely with the surface, and not in

versely with the square of the surface. In such cases, of which the author
gives some examples, the above formula does not apply.
   9. From these inquiries it is evident, as observed by the early electricians,
that conducting bodies do not take up electricity in proportion to their sur
faces, except under certain relations of surface and boundary.               If
                                                                   the breadth
of a given surface                          and the length inde<U+FB01>nitely in
                                be inde<U+FB01>nitely    diminished,
creased, the surface remaining constant, tben, as observed by Volta, the
least quantity which can be accumulated under a given electrometer indi
cation is when the given surface is a circular plate, that is to say, when
the boundary is a minimum, and the greatest when extended into a right
line of small width, that is, when the boundary is a maximum.        In the
union of two similar surfaces by a boundary contact, as for example two
circular plates, two spheres, two rectangular plates, &c., we fail to obtain
twice the charge of one of them taken separately.     In either case we fail
to decrease the intensity (the quantity being constant) or to increase the
charge (the intensity being constant), it being evident that whatever de
creases the electrometer indication or intensity must increase the charge,
that is to say, the quantity which can be accumulated under the given in
tensity.  Conversely, whatever increases the electrometer indication de
creases the charge, that is to say, the quantity which can be accumulated
under the given intensity.
      10.    If the
              grouping or disposition of the electrical particles, in regard to
surrounding  matter, be such as not to materially in<U+FB02>uence external induc
tion, then the boundary extension of the surface may be neglected.        In all
similar <U+FB01>gures, for example, such as squares, circles, spheres, &c., the elec
trical boundary           is,
                    in relation to surrounding matter, pretty much the same
in each, whatever be the extent of their respective surfaces.   In calculating
the charge, therefore,                of such surfaces, the boundary extensions may        be
neglected, in which case their relative charges are found to be as the square
roots of the surfaces only  thus the charges of circular plates and globes
                                       ;
are as their diameters, the charges of square plates are as their sides.   In
rectangular surfaces also, having the same boundary extensions, the same
result ensues, the charges are as the square roots of the surfaces.  In cases
of hollow cylinders and globes, in which one of the surfaces        shut out      is
from external in<U+FB02>uences, only one-half the surface may be considered as
exposed to external inductive action, and the charge will he as the square
root of half the surface, that    to say, as the square root of the exposed
                                             is
surface.          If,
              for example, we suppose     square plate of any given dimen
                                                         a
sions to be rolled up into an open hollow cylinder, the charge of the cylinder
will be to the charge of the plate into which we may suppose         to be ex     it
panded as 1:/t/5.     In like manner,  we take    hollow globe and circular
                                                    if          a                   a
plate of twice its diameter, the charge of the globe will be to the charge of
the plate also as        which the general relation of the charge of closed to
                         l :    :1Z        is
open  surfaces  of the same extension. The charge of square plate to the

 globes, a series    of circular and globular measures of de<U+FB01>nite values, taking
 the circular inch or globular inch as unity, and calling, after Cavendish, a
 circular plate of an inch in diameter, charged to saturation, a circular inch
 of electricity; or otherwise charged to any degree short of saturation, a
 circular inch of electricity under a given intensity. In like manner he de
 signates a globe of an inch in diameter a globular inch of electricity.
    In the following Table are given the quantities of electricity contained in
 circular plates and globes, together with their respective intensities for dia
 meters varying from '25 to 2 inches ; a circular plate of an inch diameter
 and §th of an inch thick being taken as unity, and supposed to contain

    13. The experimental investigations upon which these elementary data
 depend, constitute a second part of this paper.              The author here enters
 upon a brief review of his hydrostatic electrometer, as recently perfected
 and improved, it being essential to a clear comprehension of the laws and
 other physical results arrived at.
    In this   instrument      the attractive force between a charged        and neutral
 disk,  in connexion with the earth, is hydrostatically counterpoised by a
 small cylinder of wood accurately weighted, and partially immersed in a
 vessel of water.       The neutral disk and its hydrostatic counterpoise are
 freely suspended over the circumference of a light wheel of 2'4 inches in
 diameter,    delicately mounted on friction-wheels, so as to have perfectly
 free  motion,   and be susceptible of the slightest force added to either side
 of the balance.       Due contrivances are provided for measuring the distance
 between the attracting disks.            The balance-wheel carries a light index of
 straw reed, moveable over a graduated quadrantal arc, divided into 90° on
 each side of its centre.       The neutral attracting plate of the electrometer is
 about   1% inch in diameter, and is suspended from the balance-wheel by
 a gold thread, over a similar disk, <U+FB01>xed on an insulating rod of glass, placed
in connexion with any charged surface the subject of experiment.                   The
least force between the two disks is immediately shown by the movement

of the index over the graduated arc in either direction, and is eventually
counterpoised by the elevation or depression in the water of the hydrostatic
cylinder suspended from the opposite side of the wheel. The divisions on
the graduated quadrant correspond to the addition of small weights to
either side of the balance, which stand for or represent the amount of
force between the attracting plates at given measured distances, with given
measured quantities of electricity. This arrangement is susceptible of very
great accuracy      of measurement.
  The experiment     requires an extremely short time for its development,
and no calculation  is necessary for dissipation. The author carefully de
scribes the manipulation requisite in the use of this instrument, together
with its auxiliary appendages.    He considers this electrometer, as an in
strument of electrical research, quite invaluable,             and peculiarly             adapted to
the measurement of electrical force.
    14.  Having fully described this electrometer, and the nature of its indi
cations, certain auxiliary instruments of quantitative measure, to be em
ployed in connexion with        it,
                               are next adverted to.
   First, the construction and use of circular and globular transfer measures
given in the preceding Table, by which given measured quantities of elec
 tricity may be transferred from an electrical jar (charged through    unit                   a
jar from the conductor of an electrical machine) to any given surface in
 connexion with the electrometer.   The electrical jar he terms   quantity              a
jar, the construction and employment of which minutely explained; as
                                                               is
 also the construction and employment of the particular kind of unit-jar he
employs.

    15.   Two experiments       (1    and   2)   are   now given in illustration              of this
method     of investigation.
  Earperimenfl developes the law of attractive force as regards quantity                              ;

the <U+FB01>xed plate of the electrometer, the distance between the attracting sur
faces being constant.
   Errperiment     demonstrates the law of force as regards distance between

the attracting surfaces, the quantity of electricity being constant; and                              by
which     it  seen that the force
               is                    in an inverse ratio of the square of the
                                            is
distance between the attracting plates, the plates being susceptible of per
fect inductive action.  From these two experiments, taken in connexion
                                                                              2

  17. Having duly considered these preliminary investigations, the author
now proceeds to examine experimentally the laws of surface and boundary
as regards plane rectangular              surfaces, and to verify the formula: C                  =\/ S-fli,

     For this purpose
                    a series of smoothly-polished plates of copper were em
ployed, varying from  10 inches square to 40 inches long by 2'5 to 6 inches
wide, and about gth of an inch thick, exposing from 100 to 200 square
inches of surface.
   The charges (1) of these plates were carefully determined under                                  a given
electrometer indication,              plates being at a constant distance.

  Experiment 7.           In this
                          experiment, a copper plate 10 inches square is
compared with a rectangular plate 40 inches long by 2'5 inches wide.
   In these plates the surfaces are each 100 square inches, whilst the boun
daries are 40 and 85 inches.    The boundaries may be taken, without sen
sible error, as     1 :   2,   whilst the surfaces are the same.

     Charge of the rectangular plate surface =l05 square inches, 7 circular
inches under an intensity of 10°.         Charge of rectangular plate surface 200
square inches, 12 circular inches, under the same intensity of 10°. The
charges therefore are as 7: 12 nearly, or as 1: 1'7, being as the square
roots of the surfaces multiplied into the square roots of the boundaries
very nearly.
     Experiment 10. A square plate 10 inches square, surface 100 square
inches, boundary 40 inches, compared with a rectangular plate 40 inches
long by 5 inches wide, surface 200 square inches, boundary 90 inches.
     Here the surfaces are double of each other, and the boundaries also
double     each other,   or so nearly     as   to admit   of their being considered
 double    of each other. Charge of square plate 6 circular inches, under an
intensity of 10°. Charge of rectangular plate 12 circular inches, under
 the same intensity of 10°. -The charges, therefore, are as the square root!
of the surfaces and boundaries conjointly, according to the formula
 C= N/         as also veri<U+FB01>ed in the preceding experiment 9.
     A double surface, therefore, having a double boundary,           takes a double
 charge, but not otherwise.       Neglecting all considerations of the boundary,
 therefore, the surface and boundary varying together, the charge in this
 case  will be as the surface directly.
     18. The author having veri<U+FB01>ed experimentally the laws of surface and
 boundary, as regards plane rectangular surfaces, proceeds to consider the
 charges of square plates, circular plates, spheres, and closed and open sur
 faces generally.
     Experiment 1]. Plate       10  inches    square,   surface  100 square inches,
 boundary 40 inches, compared with a similar plate 14 inches square, sur
 face l96 square inches, boundary 56 inches.            Here the surfaces are as 1 :2
 nearly, whilst the boundaries are as l : N/5 nearly.
     In this case charge of square plate, surface 100 square inches, was found
 to be 8 circular inches under an intensity of 10°.             Charge of the plate,
 surface 196 square inches,      11  circular   inches,  under the same intensity of
 10°.     Here the charges are as 8 : 11, whilst the surfaces may be taken as
 1  :2, that is to say (neglecting the boundary), the charges are as the square
 roots   of the surfaces, according to the formula C= V §.
     On examining      the intensities   of these plates, they were found to be
 inversely as the surfaces ; thus 8 circular inches upon the plate, surface 100,
 evinced an intensity of 10°; 8 circular inches upon the plate, surface 196,
 evinced an intensity of 5° only, or % the former, according to the formula

periments, are as the square roots of the surfaces.
     On examining the intensities of                these  plates, they were found to be in
versely as the surfaces; thus 6                    circular inches upon the 9-inch plate
evinced an intensity of 10°, as just stated; 6 circular inches upon the
18-inch plate had only one-fourth the intensity, or 2°'5; being inversely

charges here are as 5:7, whilst the surfaces are as l :2; that is to say
(neglecting     the     boundaries),          the charges are as the square roots                   of the
surfaces.
     On examining the intensities of these plates, they were found to be,                                 as
in the preceding experiments, inversely                      as the surfaces.

We have to observe, however, that                      one    surface   of the sphere     is      closed or

circular plate of 14 inches, or double that diameter.  In this case the
inner and outer surface of the sphere, taken together, are actually the
same as the two surfaces of the plate. The inner surface of the sphere
being closed, however, as in the last experiment, the surfaces of the sphere
and plate, electrically considered, are therefore not equal, and the surface
of the plate is twice the surface of the sphere. The surfaces, therefore,
open to external induction are as 2 : 1.
  On examining the charges of the plate and sphere, they were found to
be as 10: 14, or as l:1'4; charge of sphere being 10 circular inches,
under an intensity of 20°, and charge of plate being 14 circular inches,
under the same intensity  of 20°. The charge of the sphere, therefore, as
compared with the charge of the plate, is as 1 : 4/ §, that    as the square  is,
roots of the exposed surfaces.
   On examining the intensities of the sphere and plate, they were found to
be, as in the preceding experiments, in an inverse ratio of the exposed sur
faces.  We cannot, therefore, conclude, as already observed (4), that the
capacity of the plate twice that of the sphere.

are actually the same, yet, electrically considered, the plate has twice the
surface of the cylinder, one surface of the cylinder being shut up.
   On examining the charges of the cylinder and plate, they were found to
be, as   in the preceding experiments,      as   1

    All the bodies in which nitrogen is substituted for hydrogen which                   I
have discovered during the last few years* may be divided into two dis
tinctly di<U+FB01>erent classes.        The <U+FB01>rst class comprises those bodies which are
obtained when three atoms of hydrogen in two atoms of an amido-com
pound are replaced by one of nitrogen from nitrous acid.                The members of
the second group are formed by the action of nitrous acid upon one equi
valent of an amido-compound             only. The following equations will best
show these various reactions :—

representatives    of the latter class of compounds, which are derived from
aniline (amidobenzol) and analogous" organic bases; and since the results
which I obtained cannot but excite some interest, I may be permitted to

    This compound is most readily obtained by passing a rapid current of
nitrous acid gas through a solution of nitrate of aniline, saturated in the
cold, until aniline ceases to be separated by the addition of solution of
caustic potash to the liquid.          On diluting the solution then with three
times its volume of alcohol, and adding a su<U+FB02>icicnt quantity of ether, nitrate
of diazobenzol separates in long white needles. In order to remove a trace

   Hydrobromate of diazobenzol is very unstable.              The beautifully white
crystals  change     so  rapidly  that  in a   few  moments    they acquire a reddish
colour, and in a few days the decomposition is almost complete.                  They
explode   on  heating    almost  with  the same    violence  as was  experienced with
nitrate  of diazobenzol.

coloured plates.        The crystals of dibromide are obtained in a perfectly pure

soluble in cold alcohol and ether; and the solutions are rapidly decomposed,

    It has thus been sufficiently shown that diazobenzol deports itself like
an organic base, being capable, like aniline, of forming salts with various
acids.    It possesses, however, also the property of combining with the
hydrates of the metals, thus playing the part of a weak acid.

 of hydrate of potassium with diazobenzol is obtained in a pure state,
 crystallizing in small soft white plates, which rapidly become reddish,

 alcohol; the solutions, however, decompose slowly, and deposit a reddish
 amorphous     body.      Heat   does  not seem to accelerate this decomposition
 materially.

_ On adding to an aqueous solution of nitrate of diazobenzol levigated
carbonate of barium, a feeble evolution of gas ensues, which lasts for several
days, until the original compound has been completely decomposed.
Two new substances are formed, which are very differently soluble in alco
hol, and can thus readily be separated. The easily soluble compound,
which I will call phenyldiazobenzol,             crystallizes from alcohol in yellowish
warty masses; from water (in which it dissolves very di<U+FB01>icultly) in small
rhombic prisms.        The di<U+FB01>icultly soluble one, which I propose to call phe
nyldidiazobenzol,      crystallizes in reddish-yellow needles.              The following

precipitate when an ammoniacal             solution       of phenoldiazobenzol    is treated
with nitrate of silver.
   On heating the platinum-salt of diazobenzol mixed with carbonate of
sodium in a retort, chlorobenzol is obtained, the formation of which may
be expressed as follows :-—

     The same change may also be effected by simply boiling an alcoholic

     The peculiar and often remarkable properties of the diazobenzole-com
pounds have induced me to try whether analogous bodies could not be pre
pared also from bromaniline, nitraniline, dibromaniline,               &c.   Experiment
has fully borne out theory.            These analogous diazo-substitutions       exhibit,
however, so much resemblance to the normal                  diazobenzol compounds, that
 I   should frequently have to repeat almost literally what has already been
said of the latter, were I to describe these compounds in detail.               I may be
permitted, however, to mention a remarkable and interesting fact which their
investigation prominently brought out.               There are, as is well known, two
isomeric nitranilines—the alphanitraniline of Arppe, and the betanitraniline
 of Hofmann and Muspratt.                This isomerism,       I found, extends itself to
 their respective nitrogen-substitution           compounds, and even to their pro
 ducts of decomposition.          On heating, ex. gr., the dihromide of alphadiazo
 nitrobenzol with alcohol, the following change takes place :—
                C, H, (N02) N, HBr,=C, H, (N02) Br+ N.,+Br,.

                       a-dihromide.          Bromonitrobenzol.
      The bromonitrobenzol        thus obtained is identical with that prepared by
  Cooper from benzol derived from coal-tar. It crystallizes in the same form,
  and fuses, like the latter, at 126° C.; sulphide of ammonium converts it
  into bromaniline, which crystallizes in octahedra, and is identical with the
  bromaniline of Hofmann obtained from bromisatine.                    Bromonitrobenzol,
  prepared in a perfectly similar manner by            the    decomposition of the dibro
  mide of betadiazonitrobenzol, possesses, however, widely different properties.
  The a-bromonitrobenzol just described crystallizes in long needles, whilst the
  new benzol-derivative, which I will designate by the name of ;G-bromonitro
   benzol, forms well-developed prisms, the fusing-point of which lies at 56°C.
   Sulphide of ammonium converts it likewise into bromaniline; but this
   base differs in its physical properties entirely from the bromaniline obtained
   by Hofmann.         It forms a colourless oil, which combines with acids, and
   gives rise to a series of beautiful salts, which in their turn differ greatly
   from the ordinary bromaniline salts in their physical properties.                I will
   distinguish this bromaniline by calling it ,6-bromaniline from that obtained
   by Hofmann, which I will call at-bromaniline.
      It deserves   to be mentioned brie<U+FB02>y that there exist likewise two isomeric
              ;

          of the Frog’s Tongue.” By LIONEL S. BEALE, M.B., F.R.S.,

          Anatomy in King’s College, London; Physician to the Hospital,

                                           (Abstract.)
      After alluding to the observations of Axel Key,               whose results accord
   with his own more closely than those of any other                 observer, the author
   refers particularly to the drawings of Hartmann, the             latest writer upon the
    structure of the papillae.        According to the author,      Dr. Hartmann, owing

1864-.]    ]              of the Papilla of the Frog’s         Tongue.                    385
to the detective method of preparation be employed, has failed to observe
points which had been seen by others who had written before him, and
which may now be most positively demonstrated.                        Hartmarm’s process
consisted     in soaking     the  tissue  for  three  days in   solution   of bichromate of
potash, and afterwards adding solution of caustic soda.                     It can be shown
by experiment that many structures                 which   can   be  most    clearly demon
strated by other modes          of investigation, are rendered quite invisible by this
process.       Hartmann’s observations, like those of the author, have been
made upon the papillae of the tongue of the little green tree-frog (Hyla
arhorea).
     With reference to the termination of the nerves in the fungiform papillae
 of the tongue of the Hyla, the author describes a plexus of very <U+FB01>ne nerve
 <U+FB01>bres, with nuclei, which has not been demonstrated                    before.     Fibres re
 sulting from the division           of  the   dark-bordered     <U+FB01>bres in the axis of the
 papilla    can  be   traced   directly  into   this  plexus.    From its upper part <U+FB01>ne
 <U+FB01>bres, which interlace with one another in the most intricate manner,
 forming a layer which appears perfectly granular, except under a power
 of 1000 or higher, may be traced into the hemispheroidal mass of epithe
 lium-like cells which surmounts the summit of the papilla.                      This hemi
 spheroidal      mass   belongs    not  to  epithelial,  but  to the  nervous    tissues.   It
 adheres to the papilla after every epithelial cell has been removed; the
 so-called cells of which the entire mass consists cannot be separated from
 one    another    like epithelial      cells;   <U+FB01>bres exactly resembling nerve-<U+FB01>bres
 can often be seen between them            ;  and very <U+FB01>ne nerve-<U+FB01>bres may be traced
                                                                                               '
 into the mass from the bundle of nerves in the papilla.
     The <U+FB01>ne nerve-<U+FB01>bres which are distributed to the simple papillae of the
 tongue, around the capillary vessels, and to the muscular <U+FB01>bres of these
 fungiform papillae, come off from the very same trunk as that from which
  the bundle of purely sensitive <U+FB01>bres which terminate in the papilla are
 derived.      The <U+FB01>ne nucleated nerve-<U+FB01>bres of the capillaries which the author
 has demonstrated have been traced into undoubted nerve-trunks in many
 instances, so that it is quite certain that many of the nuclei which have
 been considered to belong to the connective tissue (connective-tissue cor
  puscles) are really the nuclei of <U+FB01>ne nerve-<U+FB01>bres not to be demonstrated
  by the processes of investigation usually followed*. These nerve-<U+FB01>bres in
 the connective tissue around the capillaries are considered by the author to
 be the a<U+FB02>erent <U+FB01>bres of the nerve-centres of which the efferent branches
  are those distributed       to the muscular coat of the small arteries.
     The author’s observations upon the tissues of the frog convince him that
  the nervous tissue is distinct in every part of the body from other special
  tissues.     For example, he holds that nerve-<U+FB01>bres never              pass by continuity
                        ‘

that nerves do not in<U+FB02>uence any tissues by reason of continuity of tissue,                       ,

and he holds the opinion that the contractile matter is formed from the                          hp
nuclei.    He adduces observations which lead him to the conclusion that
these nuclei alter their position during life, and that, as they move in one
or other direction, a narrow line of new muscular tissue (<U+FB01>brilla) is as it
were left behind       This

   Although the caudate nerve-vesicles, or cells existing in the spinal cord,
medulla oblongata, and in many parts of the brain, have been described
by  the most distinguished modern anatomists, there yet remains much to
be ascertained with reference to their internal structure, connexions, and
 *   The author feels sure that the conclusions of Kiihne, who maintains that the axis
cylinder of nerve-<U+FB01>bre      actually continuous with the protoplaam (germinal matter)

of the corneal corpuscle, result from errors of observation. The prolongations of the
corneal corpuscles, on the contrary, pass over or under the <U+FB01>nest nerve-<U+FB01>bres, but are
never continuous with them, as may be distinctly proved by examining properly pre
pared specimens     under very high magnifying powers (1000 to 5000 linear).       The
corneal tissue results from changes occurring in one kind of germinal matter—the
nerve-<U+FB01>bres distributed to the corneal tissue from changes occurring in another kind of
germinal matter.     Ifthe connexion    as Kiihne has described,

supported by minute observation. The nuclei of the nerve-<U+FB01>bres are one thing, the
nuclei of the corneal tissues another; and the tissues resulting from these nuclei, nerve
tissue, and corneal tissue are distinct in chemical composition, microscopical characters,
and properties and actions.

mode   of development.     In this  paper I propose to describe some points          of
interest in connexion with their structure.           In the <U+FB01>rst place, however,     I

would remark that there are neither          cello’ nor     vesicles’ in the ordinary
acceptation of these words, for there is no proper investing membrane,
neither  are there ‘cell-contents’     as distinguished       from the membrane or
capsule; in fact the so-called    cell consists of soft solid matter throughout.
The nerve-<U+FB01>bres are not prolonged from the nucleus or from the outer part
of the cell, but they are continuous with the very material of which the
                    ‘
substance of the cell’ itself is composed, and they are, chemically speaking,
of the same nature.      So that in these caudate cells we have but to recog
nize the so—called ‘nucleus’ (germinal matter) and matter around this
 (formed material) which passes into the ‘<U+FB01>bres,’ which diverge in various
directions from the cell   = see Plate  III. (<U+FB01>g. I).
    At the outer part of many    of  these   ‘cells,’ usually collected together in
one mass, are a number of granules.             These are not usually seen in the
young cells, and they probably result from changes taking place in the
matter of which the substance of the cell is composed.               But it is not pro
posed to discuss this question in the present paper.
    My special object in this communication is to direct attention to a pecu
liar appearance I have observed in these cells, which enables me to draw
some very important inferences with reference to the connexions and action
 of these very elaborate and most important elements of the nervous
 mechanism.
    In some very thin sections of the cord and medulla oblongata of a young
dog,   which  had been very slowly acted upon by dilute acetic acid, the ap
pearances represented in Plate III. (<U+FB01>g. l) were observed.              Subsequently,
 similar appearances, though not so distinct, have been demonstrated in the
caudate nerve-vesicles of the grey matter of the brain of the dog and cat,
as well as of the human subject.       I have no doubt that the arrangement is
constant, and examination of my specimens will probably satisfy observers
that the appearance is not accidental.          Each <U+FB01>bre (a, a, a) passing from
the cell exhibits in its substance several lines of granules.         The appearance
is as if the <U+FB01>bre were composed of several very <U+FB01>ne <U+FB01>bres imbedded in a
soft transparent matrix, which <U+FB01>bres, by being stretched, had been broken
transversely   at very short intervals.      At the point where each large <U+FB01>bre
spreads   out  to  form  the  body   of  the   cell, these lines diverge from one
another and pursue different courses through the very substance of the cell,
in front of, and behind, in fact around the nucleus. Lines can be traced
from each <U+FB01>brgaeross the cell into every other <U+FB01>bre which passes away from
it. The actual appearance is represented in Plate III. ; and in the diagram,

cipal lines diverging   from the <U+FB01>bres at the point where they become continuous with
the substance of the     cell. These lines may be traced from one <U+FB01>bre across the cell,
and may be followed     into every other <U+FB01>bre which proceeds from the cell.
they would follow the exact lines here represented; and it must be noticed
that these lines are more distinct and more numerous in fully-formed than
in young cells. They are, I think, lines which result from the frequent
passage of nerve-currents in these de<U+FB01>nite directions.
  Now I have already advanced arguments in favour of the existence of
complete nervous circuits, based upon new facts resulting from observations
upon a, the peripheral arrangement of the nerves in various tissues‘; 6,
the course of individual <U+FB01>bres in compound trunks, and the mode of
branching and division of nerve-<U+FB01>brest; and c, the structure of ganglion
cellsjj. I venture to consider these lines across the substance of the cau
date nerve-cells  as another remarkable fact in_favour of the existence of
such circuits; for while the appearance would receive a full and satisfactory
explanation upon such an hypothesis, I doubt if it be possible to suggest
another explanation which would seem even plausible.

far from the <U+FB01>bres radiating from one cell, or from the nucleus as some
suppose, in di<U+FB02>'erent directions, all the fibres which reach the cell are com

<U+FB01>bres.     Instead of the cell being the point from which nerve-currents
 radiate in di<U+FB01>'erent directions along single <U+FB01>bres, it is the common point
 where a number of circuits having the most different distribution intersect,
 cross, or decussate.       The so-called cell is a part of a circuit, or rather of
 a great number     Q/'dg'[}‘erent circuits.

face with the cell; 6 may be the path of a motor impulse; c and 11 other circuits
passing to other cells or other peripheral parts.   A  current passing along the <U+FB01>bre a
might induce currents in the three other <U+FB01>bres, b, 0, d, which traverse the same cell.
    I conclude  that at <U+FB01>rst the formed material of the cell is quite soft and
almost homogeneous, but that as currents traverse it in certain de<U+FB01>nite
lines, difference in texture and composition is produced in these lines, and
perhaps after a time they become more or less separated from one another,
and insulated by the intervening material.
    It may perhaps be carrying speculation upon the meaning of minute
anatomical facts too far to suggest that a nerve-current traversing one of
these numerous paths or channels through the cell may in<U+FB02>uence all the
lines running more or less parallel to it (<U+FB01>g. 3).
    I have ascertained that <U+FB01>bres emanating from di<U+FB01>'erent caudate nerve
cells situated at a distance from        one another (<U+FB01>g. 4, a, a) at length meet
and run on together as a compound <U+FB01>bre (b, 6, b), so that I am compelled
 to conclude (and the inference is in harmony with facts derived from ob
servations of a di<U+FB01>'erent kind) that every single nerve-<U+FB01>bre entering into the

_very distant parts.        In other words, I am led to suppose that a single dark
 bordered <U+FB01>bre, or rather its axis-cylinder, is the common channel for the
 passage     of many dilferent nerve-currents having different destinations. It is
 common to a portion of a great many different circuits.                  The <U+FB01>bres which
 result from the subdivision         of the large <U+FB01>bre which leaves the cell become
                               '
 exceedingly <U+FB01>ne (the 100,000 th of an inch in diameter or less), and pursue a
 very long course before they run parallel with other <U+FB01>bres.                 As the <U+FB01>bres
 which have the same destination increase in number, the compound trunk
 becomes gradually thicker and more distinct.                The several individual <U+FB01>bres
 coalesce and form one trunk, or axis- cylinder, around which the protective                  i
 white substance of Schwann collects.              At the periphery the subdivision of
 the dark-bordered <U+FB01>bre again occurs, until peripheral <U+FB01>bres as <U+FB01>ne as the
 central component <U+FB01>bres result*.

 from several di<U+FB01>'erent cells unite to form single nerve-<U+FB01>bres, b, b, b. In passing towards
 the periphery these <U+FB01>bres divide and subdivide; the resulting subdivisions pass to dif
ferent destinations. The <U+FB01>ne <U+FB01>bres resulting from the subdivision of one of the caudate
 processes of a nerve-cell may help to form a vast number of dark-bordered nerves, but
 it is most certain that no smgle process everforms one entire axis-cylinder.
      Although it may be premature to devise diagrams of the actual arrange
 ment,     if I permit myself to attempt this, I shall be able to express the in
 ferences to which I have been led up to the present time in a far more

course of    these <U+FB01>bres until many different observations upon which I am

passage of the <U+FB01>bres from the ganglion-cell into the dark-bordered <U+FB01>bres

cells resemble those in the grey matter of the cord, medulla oblongata, and brain.
   The peculiar appearance I have demonstrated in the large caudate cells,
taken in connexion with the fact urged by me in several papers, that no
true termination or commencement has yet been demonstrated in the case
of any nerve,     seems to me to favour        the conclusion    that the action of     a
nervous    apparatus results from varying intensities of continuous currents
which are constantly passing along the nerves during life, rather than from
the sudden interruption or completion of nerve-currents.                So far from any
arrangement having been demonstrated in connexion with any nervous
structure which would permit the sudden interruption and completion of a
current, anatomical observation demonstrates the structural continuity of
all nerve-<U+FB01>bres      with nerve-cells, and, indirectly through these cells, with
one another.

 nerve-cells, in connexion with the nervous   system, which are very closely

 to perform very different functions,——the one originating currents, while the

   When two simple tones which are not of the same pitch are sounded
together, they will alternately reinforce and enfeeble each other’s effect,
producing a libration of sound, termed a beat. The number of these beats
in one second will necessarily be the difference of the pitches of the two
simple tones, which may be termed the beat number.         As for some time
the two sets of vibrations concur, and for some time they are nearly oppo

some time nearly the difference of the two simple extents, and the intensity
of the beat may be measured by the ratio of the greater intensity to the less.

smaller pitch is less than 6 :5, according to Professor Helmholtz.        This
is a convenient limit to <U+FB01>x, but it is probably not quite exact. To try the ex
periment,      I
             have had two sliding pipes, each stopped at the end, and having
each a continuous range of an octave, connected to one mouthpiece.      The
tones are nearly simple; and when the ratio approaches to 6 :5, or the
interval of a minor third, the beats become faint, <U+FB01>nally vanish, and do
not reappear.   But the exact moment of their disappearance is di<U+FB02>icult to
<U+FB01>x, and indeed seems to vary, probably with the condition of the ear. The
ear appears to be most sensitive to the beats when the ratio is about
16: 15. After this the beats again diminish in sharpness ; and when the
ratio is very near to unity, the ear is apt to overlook them altogether. The
effect is almost that of a broken line of sound, as                        ----,
the spaces representing the silences.
   Slow beats are not disagreeable; for example, when they do not exceed
3 or 4 in a second.    At 8 or 10 they become harsh; from 15 to 40 they
thoroughly destroy the continuity of tone, and are discordant.  After 40
they become less annoying.     Professor Helmholtz thinks 33 the beat
number of maximum disagreeableness.      As the beats become very rapid,
from 60 to 80 or 100 in a second, they become almost insensible.     Pro
fessor Helmholtz considers 132 as the limiting number of beats which can
be heard.   They are certainly still. to be distinguished even at that rate,
but become more and more like a scream.

audible in beats.  The di<U+FB01>erential tone is frequently acuter than the lower

As its pitch is the beat number of the combination, Dr. T. Young attri
buted its generation to the beats having become too rapid to be distin
guished.   This theory is disproved, <U+FB01>rst, by the existence of differential
tones for intervals which do not beat, and secondly, by the simultaneous
presence of distinct beats and differential tones, as     have frequently                  I

smaller interval, and therefore generally beating, will be termed pulsative.
The unreduced ratio of the pitch of the lower pulsative tone for which the
beat number      70 to that for which
                   is                     only 10, will be termed the range

of the beat.   The fraction by which the pitch of the lower pulsative tone
 must -be multiplied to produce the beat number, will be termed the beat
factor. The ratio of the pitches of the pulsative tones, on which the
 sharpness of the dissonance depends, will be termed the beat interval.

above the 6th, there may, and probably will, be beats, producing various
degrees of harshness or shrillness, jarring or tinkling.     These, however,
are all natural qualities of tone, that is, they are produced at once by the
natural mode of vibration of the substances employed.         But if we were to
take a series  of simple tones having  their pitches in the above ratios, and to
vary  their intensities at pleasure, we  should  produce a. variety of arti<U+FB01>cial
qualities of tone, some of which might be coincident with natural qualities,
but most of which would be new.           This method of producing arti<U+FB01>cial
qualities of tone is di<U+FB01>icult to apply, but has been used with success by
Professor Helmholtz to imitate vowel-sounds, &c.
   If,                 of using so many simple tones, we combine a few
         however, instead
compound tones, the pitches of which are such that their primaries might
be harmonics of some other compound tone, then the two sets of partial
tones will necessarily combine into a single set, which may, or rather must
be considered by the ear as the partial tones of some new compound tone,
having very different intensities from those possessed by the partial tones of
 either of the combining compound tones. That       an arti<U+FB01>cial quality of   is,
 tone will have been created by the production of these joint harmonics.
 Such an   arti<U+FB01>cial quality of tone constitutes what                           called musical chord.

 The two or more compound tones from which                               it      built up are its consti
 tuents.  The primary joint harmonic     the real root or fundamental bass
                                                         is
 of the chord, which often differs materially from the supposititious root
 assigned   bymusicians.
   If  the primaries of the constituents are disjunct, and all their partial
 tones are disjunct, then the joint harmonics will be also disjunct, unless
 some pulsative differential tones have been introduced.   If, however, the
 constituentshave pulsative partial tones, the chord will also have them.
 Such chords, which are generally without beats, and are only exceptionally
 accompanied by beats, are termed concords, and they are unisonant or dis
 sonant according as the beats are absent or present.        Their character
 therefore consists having the pitches of their constituents as
                       in                                               or as                      l,   3,   5,

The introduction of any one of these tones in conjunction with l, 3, 5 and
their octaves will therefore form a discord, the harshness of which may be
frequently much diminished by the omission of 1 and its octaves for the

the omission of 24 for the constituents 25, 27, 45.

      This notation will show what are the musical names of the constituents
of musical chords, and how they may                                               be approximately                      produced on an
organ, harmonium,                       or pinnoforte.
   By the type of                  a    musical chord    meant the numbers which express the
                                                                       is
relative pitches of                 its constituents, after such octaves below them have been
taken as to leave only uneven numbers, which are then called the elements
of the type.                 By the form of the chord                              is   meant the numbers before such
reduction.              Thus the type                       1,   3,    5     embraces,            among            others,       the forms
1,3,5;             1,   2,   3,5;            2,   3,5; 4,3, 5;                      3,   8,     10;         6,    10,    16;     2,    5,   6,   8,
and so        on; hence the types of musical chords consist of groups of the
elements          1,    3,   5,   7,    9,   15, 17, 25, 27, 45.                       The type of                a   concord     is   l,   3,   5,
and     of   a     discord          1,   3,-5,         P,   or    1,    3,   5,   P, P’, where P, P’                         are any   of the
numbers          15, 17, 25, 27, 45.
                   7,   9,              Discords may be divided into strong
and  weak,  according as  those disjunct tones with which the pulsative tones
principally beat are retained or omitted.    These discords again may be dis
tinguished into those which have one or      two pulsative constituents. The
chords may also be grouped according to the number of elements in their
type, dyads containing two, triads three, tetrads four, and pentads <U+FB01>ve.
The number of elements in the type by no means limits the numbers of
constituents, as any octaves above any of the elements may be added.
     Hence    it    is   possible to classify all the suitable chords                                             of music according
to their type, as in Table Vi., where the notes corresponding to each type
are added in the typical form only.      A simple systematic nomenclature                                                                        is
proposed   in an adjoining column,   and the names by which the true chords
or their substitutes are known to musicians are added for reference.      Occa
sionally two forms of substitution are given,   as they  are of theoretical im
portance, although   confounded   on some  tempered  instruments.       mode of                                                 A

  higher octaves of             some     or all of them; thus           5;     1,   2,    3,          2,   4,   5,

  a  louder joint harmonic, and also which are disjunct and pulsative.  In the
   second part of the Table the extent of each harmonic of each constituent                                                        is
  given on the assumptions already explained.       To <U+FB01>nd the extent of the
  joint  harmonic, we  add the extents of the generating conjunct harmonics,
  and thence <U+FB01>nd the intensity by squaring and dividing by 100. The dif
  ferential tones must then be found      by subtracting the pitches of the pri
  maries (or  in exceptional  cases  of higher and louder harmonics).     The in
  tensity of these differential tones may be called        for single tone, and         l         a                                4

  usually the reciprocal of the relative pitch of the lower pulsative harmonic.

  <U+FB01>nd the intensity, we add and subtract the extents of the pulsative joint
  harmonics; in this case 50 and 33 are the extents of the 8th and 9th
  joint harmonics, and their sum and difference are 83 and 17. Then we
  take the ratio of their squares, each divided by 100, which gives 69: 3.
  This result must not be reduced, as        gives not only the relative loudness

joint harmonics.   It must be remembered that when there are several dis
junct harmonics, their unbroken sound tends to obliterate the action of the
beats.   There is no sensible silence between the beats unless the tones are
 simple and the intensities nearly equal.  The intensities of the beats be
tween joint harmonics and differential tones cannot be reduced to <U+FB01>gures.
It is not large. The history of a beat is therefore given by four fractions,
which in this case are the interval 9 : 8, the factor I : 3, the range 210 : 30,
and the intensity 69:3.
  These calculations have been made for concordant dyads in Table VIII.,
and for concordant or major triads in Table IX.           An attempt has been
made to arrange the 13 forms of the <U+FB01>rst, and the 20 forms of the second
in order of sonorousness, by considering the distribution of the intensities
among the several joint harmonics, the development of pulsative differential
tones, and the nature of the beats, omitting those due to the seventh har
monic of an isolated constituent.                       It has not been thought necessary to
give the history of every beat.                       The intervals of all the beats are seen at
a glance by the list of intensities of the joint harmonics.
  By Table VIII. we see that the only unisonant dyad is the octave                          l, 2*,
which will          be as unisonant     as the constituents themselves.           All other dyads
are occasionally                  Thus the <U+FB01>fth itself is decidedly dissonant
                              dissonant.
when the pitch     of the lower constituent lies between 20 and 140. On a
bass  concertina tuned  justly, I <U+FB01>nd the <U+FB01>fth, C‘G‘, quite intolerable, the <U+FB01>fth,
C G, rough, but D TA nearly smooth, and at higher pitches there is no per
ceptible dissonance.      The beat interval of the major third is 16: I5, and
the range of dissonance is much greater.       The roughness can be distinctly
heard as high as c e; in the lower octaves CE is quite discordant, and C‘E‘
intolerable.    This Table VIII., therefore, establishes the fact that con
cordance does not depend on simplicity of ratio alone; but when the de
nominator           of the beat factor is small the range is lower, and therefore the
 dissonance less felt.       Dissonance also arises from the pulsative di<U+FB01>"erential
tones      7   and 11, so that if the relative pitches are expressed in terms high
enough to differ by 7 and                  ll,
                                the combination will be dissonant.    The ear
is also not satis<U+FB01>ed with forms in which great intensities of joint harmonics
are widely separated by many small intensities.       The four last forms in
Table      VIII.,
               namely, the minor tenth 5, 12, the eleventh 3, 8, and the
 two thirteenths 3, 10 and 5, 16, should therefore be treated as discords
 The Table also suggests how defects may be remedied by introducing new
 constituents to            <U+FB01>ll up gaps, or by duplications.
    Similar observations apply to the triads in Table IX. None of them can
 he unisonant at all pitches.   Some of them, as the last seven, are really
 discordant.   The gaps may be generally <U+FB01>lled up by duplication. Thus

 1, 3, 5 may be converted into 1, 2, 3, 5, and by thus strengthening   the 2, 4,
 and 8 joint harmonics the <U+FB01>nest'form of concord is produced.           In this
 way the series of duplications in Table X. was produced.      In this Table an
 example  has  been added   to each form to facilitate trial; but the great im
 perfection of the major third in the ordinary system of tuning pianos and
 harmoniums materially deteriorates the effect of the chords, which ought
 to be taken on some justly tuned instrument.
   The discords may be deduced from Tables VII. and VIII., when pro
perly extended, by supposing 7, 9, 15, 17, 25, 27, 45 to be used in the <U+FB01>rst,
and their effect allowed for in the second.   The additional discordant effect
of 7 will be necessarily least felt where  7 occurs as a differential tone, but
these are not the best forms of either triad or tetrad.   In the better forms
the dissonances 6, 7 and 7, 8 will always be well developed, and as the
latter is sharper,                    the omission                     of   8,     at least as a constituent                   tone, is
suggested.             If       7%     is used         instead              of   7,   the omission        of    8 becomes more
urgent, while              6,        711;   will beat       less sharply               than   6, 6,   and therefore                almost

the differential tones derived from the upper harmonics of the primaries,
and when the dissonant intervals of the minor tenth and major thirteenth

dissonant, as shown in Table      XI., where an attempt has been made to
arrange  its 20  forms  in order of sonorousness.   The pitches of the differ
ential tones are added, and examples subjoined.       The effect of the minor
chord   is   very much injured by the usual tuning of harmoniums, &c.          A
peculiar     character of these and other discords, when the pulsative con
stituent      not the highest, consists in the quality of tone being due to very
             is
high joint harmonics, except such as are due to differential tones. The
root will be consequently extremely deep when the constituent tones are
taken at a moderate absolute pitch.      This great depth renders its recogni
tion by the ear difficult.   Hence probably the disputes of musicians con
cerning  the roots of certain discords, and their error in considering   to be                                                 5

   Chords will evidently be related to each other when one or more of their
constituents are identical, and natural qualities of tone will be related which
have one or more identical harmonics, or which form parts of related chords.
Transitions between related chords and compound tones will be easy and
pleasing. Hence, in forming a collection of compound tones for use either
as natural qualities of tone (in melody) or as constituents of arti<U+FB01>cial

     In   addition to the chords already noticed, we have now the twenty-seven
tetrad,     1, 3, 5, 27, or                      F
                              CAD, and the twenty-seven triad, 1, 5, 27, or
FAD,           and all the discords derived from                                            1,   3, 5, 9, 15, 25, 27, 45.            But
for those derived from                           7 and 17 substitutes must be employed.     These are
obtained as follows.                            The chord 9, 27, 45, l . 64 is 9 times 1, 3, 5, 74-, so
that      GD         B    Fapproximates to l, 3, 5, 7 in a manner already                                                         tested.
Again,         1 .   32, 3 . 32, 5 . 32, 225 is 32 times 1, 3, 5, 7515, whence                                           FCA ID#
gives the second and closer approximation to                                                      l,    3, 5,7 already considered.
When 7% is used for 7 it will be better to use                                                     1,   3, 5, 7}, 8%, or one-ninth
of   9, 27, 45,           l. 64,        5       .16, that is G                    B D FA, in             place of 1, 3, 5, 7%, 9 or
one-ninth            of   9, 27, 44,             l   .   64, 81, that is G          BD                   FTA, to avoid the disso
nance 5          . 7%,    4   .   9, or 35%, 36.                        This will therefore replace the seven-nine
pentad         1, 3, 5, 7, 9.
  The chord 45, 135, 225, 5 . 64, 3 . 256 is 45 times 1, 3, 5, 7-1;, U115, or
B F# IDj¢ A C, and it forms an excellent substitute for the seven-seventeen
pentad 1, 3, 5, 7,17.   Again, the chord 3 .16, 5 . 16, 15 . 16, 135, or 16
times 3, 5, 15,               16%,      that is           O’    A E F11,              is a su<U+FB01>iciently          close approximation
to the rough discord 3, 5, 15, 17.
   It has already been shown that the alterations in the discords thus pro
duced will be slight, and, under certain circumstances, improvements. The
omission of  7, 17 in the base 1, 3, 5 is therefore justi<U+FB01>ed.   Their insertion
would   embarrass the performer and composer by an immense variety of
tones very slightly differing from each other, as 64, 63 ; 135, 136 ; 255, 256.
As it is, the distinction between 81, 80 is the source of much di<U+FB01>iculty,
and separates chords such as 81, 243, 405, and 5 . I6, 15 . 16, 25 . 16, or
80, 240, 400, that                      is,
                          +A TE C14‘. and    E 101;, which composers desire to        A
consider as identical.     It was shown in my former paper (Proceedings,
vol. xiii. p. 98) that the use of         as  basis requires 72 different tones,
                                                                l,          3,   5     a
exclusive of octaves.                       The introduction of                            7    in the    base would increase this
number by 45, and the introduction of 17 by 30, while the mental effect
produced would be very slightly different. On the other hand,    instead                                                     if
of   l,   3,
          as   base, we took
                 5        a       20, 4T, where v,   are ratios differing
                                                                       1,                                    T
slightly from             3   :   2   and       5 :      4,
                             we might avoid the ratio 81 80, reduce the                                             :
number of tones to  27, and greatly increase the relations of chords.   How
to effect this important result with the least dissonant effect will be con
sidered in the following paper on Temperament.
   The three major triads                      27, 45 are so related as to       3,
                                                               3, 3,

                                                                 .                                         3            3     3
Hence the middle triad forming part of both pentads connects the three
triads into whole, closely related to the middle triad, and therefore to its
                     a
root.      These are called the tonic chord and tonic tone, and the connexion
itself    is   termed tonality.                          If octaves               of these tones be taken, thus,

    ance with the usual practice of musicians.   In the present paper the typical

    XXIV. “ On          the Temperament of Musical Instruments with Fixed
            Tones.”     By ALEXANDER J. ELLIs, F.R.S., F.C.P.S.* Received
            June 8, 1864.
       In the preceding paper on the Physical Constitution of Musical Chords
    (Proceedings, vol. xiii. p. 392), of which the present is a continuation,                   I
    drew attention to the importance of abolishing the distinction between
    tones which differ by the comma 81 :80, on account of the number of
    fresh relations between chords that would be thus introduced.    The con
    trivances necessary for this purpose have long been known under the name
    of Temperament.      I have shown that the musical scale which introduces
    the comma consists of tones whose pitch is formed from the numbers
    1, 3, 5, by multiplying continually by 2, 3, and 5. Hence to abolish the
_
    comma    it will be necessary to use other numbers in place of these. But
    this alteration will necessarily change the physical constitution of musical
    chords, which will now become approximate, instead of exact representa
    tives of qualities of tone with a precisely de<U+FB01>ned root.    It is also evident
    that all the conjunct harmonics will be thus rendered pulsative, and that
    therefore all the concords will be decidedly dissonant at all available
    pitches.    The result would be intolerable          if              Tem
                                                              the beats were rapid.
    perament, therefore, only becomes possible because very slow beats are not
    distressing to the ear.   Hence temperament may be de<U+FB01>ned to consist in
    slightly altering the perfect ratios of the pitch of the constituents of a
    chord, for the purpose of increasing the number of relations between
    chords, and facilitating musical        performance and composition by the re
    duction of the number      of   tones required for harmonious combinations.

composition of tones discovered by Prof. Helmholtz have enabled me to
present it in an entirely new form, and to determine with some degree of
certainty what is the best possible form of temperament.
   Let the compound tones P and Q, of which P is the sharper, form the
concordant interval p : q.    Then P : Q=p : q, or qP=pQ, that           the qth                     is,
harmonic of P and the pth harmonic of             are conjunct.    Now let P be
                                                                       Q
changed into P. (l+t), where              small, and rarely or never exceeds
                                                    t   is

                                                                       (1                        (l
will no longer=pQ.      The difference between the pitch of these harmonics
is qP. (l+t)—pQ=qt .P=pt . Q. Hence the number of beats in                                                  a
second produced by this change in P will be found by multiplying the
lower pitch     by pt, which

this change, but in either case so  slightly that they may be left out of
consideration in comparison with the beats thus introduced.   But the dif
ferential                P—Q becomes
             tone which was                         Q, and    thereforePt+P-                is               9,
tone which  entirely unrelated
                     is        to the original chord, and which  may be
come prominently dissonant.   This    an evil which cannot be avoided by
                                                         is is
any system of temperament, and        about equally objectionable in all
systems.             It    may therefore       be also left out             of consideration in selecting
a   temperament.
   The melody will also suffer from the alteration in the perfect ratios.‘
An interval   best measured by the difference of the tabular logarithms of
                      is
the pitches of the two tones which form it.     Hence the interval error
e=log [P         .    (1   +t)+Q] —log [P           :   Q]=log         (1   +t)=pt,   if   the square and
higher powers of  be neglected, and
                                 t                         p      be the modulus.          Hence the beat
factor which =pt, will =pe—I—p, or                         or    pe.   I    call pe the beat meter, and
represent    it           by   ,8.
   We may assume that the dissonance created by temperament cx ,6’. Hence
for the same just interval      variously represented in different tempera
                                         p :   q,

                                         the harmony varies inversely as B’,
and the melody varies inversely as e’.     Hence for the same interval the
harmony   and melody  both vary inversely as e’.  The general harmony and
melody may be assumed to be best when EB’ and 2e’ are minima, which will
not happen simultaneously.

the errors the same for the same intervals in all keys, that          makes                                            is,

a  single key.   Hence the just intervals are calculated in Table XII.,

       This is proposed by Drobisch as a system of temperament adapted to
    bowed instruments    (Mus. Tonbestim. § 57), allowing them to use a system
    of perfect <U+FB01>fths, and yet play the perfect scale very nearly by substitution.
    Such a system would be more complicated than the just scale for any in
    strument, and would require many more than 27 tones.     It therefore, un               is,
    necessary for the violin, and impossible on instruments with <U+FB01>xed tones.

    number expressed all possible tones. Hence Huyghens’s celebrated Cyclus

     As this is a cycle of twelve equal semitones, it may be termed the Hemi
 tonic temperament.       It is the one most advocated at the present day, and
 generally spoken of     as  “equal temperament” without any quali<U+FB01>cation,
 as  if there were no other.      It was consequently referred to by that name
 only in my former paper (Proceedings,        V0l-  xiii. p. 95).    For its harmonic

    It  has been from the earliest times customary to have only twelve <U+FB01>xed
tones to the octave, on the organ, harpsichord, piano, &c., and to play the
other <U+FB01>fteen by substitution, as shown below, where the tones tuned, ar
ranged in dominative order, occupy the middle line, and the tones for which
they are used as substitutes are placed in the outer lines, and are bracketed.

    The consequence was, that while the Vths in the middle line were uni

(as G1tE[) for .l9Eb or Gi$D#) were strikingly different.               Similar errors

   Ina defective equal temperament the same just concordance is represented
by two  different discordances. As performers limited themselves to twelve
tones to the octave, those who found the Hemitonic temperament No. 50
(35) too rough, accepted this variety of representatives of the same con
cordance as the basis of a temperament, hoping to have better IIIrds in
the usual chords, without the wolves of the defective temperament. Others
conceived that an advantage would be gained by altering the character of
the different keys.   Thus arose unequal temperament, properly so called,
which must be carefully distinguished from any defective equal temperament
with which it is popularly confused.
   Arrange the twelve unequally tempered chords as follows, where the
identical numbers indicate identical chords with different names :—

      system of unequal temperament may therefore be determined by arbi

(in which case all the _1/‘s are equal, and the interval error of the Illrd is
§ X '0l03000='O034333, as in the Hemitonic temperament), at least four
IIIrds must have their interval errors greater than glx '0l03000, that                                                                       is,

inferior to the very bad Illrds of the Hemitonic system.           Kirnberger,                                                                     4

melody, and will have no advantage over   in the relations of chords or the          it

keys with only twelve tones, any system of defective equal temperament
will be inferior to the Hemitonic, on account of the various and distressing
wolf intervals which occur when the music       not con<U+FB01>ned to the six major               is

condition of having twelve tones and no more, does not seem to be inevit
able.       It
           will therefore be necessary to determine what would be the best
system  of temperament for the complete equally tempered scale of 27 tones,
and how great a sacri<U+FB01>ce of musical effect is required by the use of the
Hemitonic system.
   In Table XV. I have calculated for each of the 59 (reducing to 51)
systems of equal temperament already named, the interval errors of the
Vths, IIIrds, and 3rds, and the sums of the squares of the 23 interval
errors and the 6 beat meters of Table XII.          I have then arranged the
temperaments    in order according to each of these  <U+FB01>ve results, and numbered
the order.   Finally, I have added the <U+FB01>ve order numbers together and ar
ranged the whole in the order of these sums. The smallest number would
therefore clearly give the best temperament, supposing that all the <U+FB01>ve
points of comparison were of equal value.    Now the <U+FB01>rst and second tem
perament  on  the list, or No. 26 and No. 2, only differ from each other in
the <U+FB01>fth, sixth, or seventh place of decimals with respect to these <U+FB01>ve re
sults, a difference which no human ear, however <U+FB01>nely constituted by nature
or assisted by art, could be taught to detect. As No. 2, or the Mesotonic
system, is determined in the simplest manner,                         I
                                                 consider it as the real head
of the list. There is, however, little to choose between it and any one of
the ten or twelve systems which follow, except in simplicity of construction
and comparative ease in realization. The Hemitonic system, however, comes
35th in the list, and the old Pythagorean, recently defended by Drobisch
and Naumann (op. cit.), and asserted to be the system actually used by
violinists, is the 45th. No one who has heard any harmonies played on
the Pythagorean system will dispute the correctness of the position here
assigned to   which fully explains the absence of all feeling for harmony
                      it,
among the nations which use it—the ancient and modern Greeks, the old
Chinese, the Gaels, the Arabs, Persians, and Turks.                            No modern quartett
players could be listened to who adopted it.
   The contest lies, therefore, between the Mesotonic                           and the Hemitonic
systems. The Mesotonic   that known as “ the old organ-tuning,” or, since
                                          is                                                         it
was          used as defective twelve-toned system, as the “ unequal tem
       generally                   a
perament.” Within the limits of the nine scales already named, the superiority
of the Mesotonic to the Hemitonic system has long been practically acknow
ledged.  But the extremely disagreeable effect of the wolves (more espe
cially                 himself) has <U+FB01>nally expelled the system from Ger
           to the performer
many altogether, and from England in great measure. On the pianoforte

the Mesotonic          stands 2nd in order        of melodyainappreciably different from
the 1st, and the Hemitonic 39th.
     If the
          3rd harmonic only is developed in the qualities of tone combined,
the beats  of the Vth are heard, but those of the other intervals are not
perceived.   The beats of the IIIrd and Vlth, which are so faulty on the
Hemitonic system, will not be perceived at all unless the 5th harmonic be
developed, and will not be much perceived unless it be strongly developed.
Now the 5th harmonic is comparatively weak on all organ pipes and on
pianofortes, and hence the errors are not so violently offensive on these
instruments.   If, however, the ‘ mixture stops,’ which strengthen the upper
harmonics by additional pipes, are employed on the organ, the effect is un
mistakeably bad, unless drowned by din or dimmed by distance.        On the
pianoforte,  however, these intervals, and even the still worse 3rd and 6th,
depending   on  the 6th and 8th harmonics, which are undeveloped on piano
forte strings, are quite endurable.
   Hence the Hemitonic system, except as regards melody, will not be
greatly inferior to the Mesotonic on a pianoforte and on soft stops of organs,
but will only become offensive on loud stops.      But for harmoniums and
concertinas, violins and voices, where harmonics up to the 8th, and even
higher, are well developed, the Hemitonic temperament is oifensive. The
roughness of harmoniums is almost entirely due to this mode of tuning.
The beats of the Vlth, IIIrd, and 3rd are distinctly heard, and the develop
ment of differential tones is so strong as frequently to form an unintelligibly
inharmonious accompaniment*.   Concertinas having 14 tones to the octave
are indeed generally tuned mesotonically (or intentionally so), thus c cit,

tuned to just intervals, I have been able to make this comparison, and my
own feeling is that the Mesotonic is but slightly, though unmistakeably,
inferior to the Just, and greatly superior to the Hemitonic.
   There are two other points in which the complete Mesotonic system
possesses advantages over the Hemitonic.

                                              The Mesotonic Vllth is rather
flat, but by using the <U+FB02>at Vlllth in its place, when the harmony will allow,
the effect of an extremely sharp Vllth is produced, which is sometimes de
sirable in melodies.   Thus log Mesotonic Vlllb =='28l95, which is sharper
even than log Pythagorean Vll='27840.         The ordinary and <U+FB02>atter Vllth
can be used when necessary for the harmony.            Again, by using the

The ordinary sharper 7th can be used when necessary. Neither of these
effective substitutionsjis possible on the Hemitonic system.
   Considering that singers and violinists naturally intone justly (Delezenne,
lac. cz't.), and that the interval errors of the Mesotonic system seldom
exceed the natural errors of intonation                which may      be expected from                 the
inability of the     to appreciate minute distinctions of pitch,
                             ear                                 appears                   it
desirable to tune harmoniums at least, and perhaps organs, mesotonically.

     In
      the preceding memoirs on the Calculus of Symbols, systems have
been constructed for the multiplication and division of non-commutative
symbols subject to certain laws                      of combination   and these systems su<U+FB01>ice
                                                                                ;
for linear di<U+FB01>erential equations.                      But when we enter upon the consideration                                          '

                                                                                                                                    rm.s'ztrt‘7'
                                         we see at once that these methods do not                                  apply.
It becomes necessary to invent some fresh mode of calculation, and a new
notation, in order to bring non-linear functions into a condition which                                                             .1

lowing memoir.     Professor Boole has given, in his ‘ Treatise on Differential                                                        L

given non-linear function is a complete differential.    This method, as will
be seen by anyone who will refer to Professor Boole’s treatise, is equivalent
to <U+FB01>nding the conditions that a non-linear function may he externally
divisible by the symbol of di<U+FB02>'erentiation.    In the following paper I have
given a notation by which I obtain the actual expressions for these con
ditions, and for the symbolical remainders arising in the course of the
division, and have extended my investigations to ascertaining the results
of the symbolical division of non-linear functions by linear functions of the
symbol      of differentiation.
     Let    F (2,   y,   _1/,, 3/,,        y,,) be any non-linear function,
                                      3/, . . . .                                                            in which

di<U+FB01>'erential      of y with respect to (1).
  Let U, denote _/'dy,, i.e. the integral of                          a function involving          2:, 3/, 3],,   y,   . . .   .
with reference to 3:, alone.
     Let Vr in like manner denote                             when      the differentiation            is supposed
                                                     (%

     The next de<U+FB01>nition is the most important, as it is that on which all our
subsequent calculations will depend.      We may suppose F differentiated
(m) times with reference to _1/,,, y,,_,, or 3/,,_,, &e., and y,,, 3/,,_,, or y,,_,,

It will be seen that the above notation will enable us to obtain expressions
for the conditions indicated by the process of M. Sarrus.

             XY,,,_,U,,,_-_. must be omitted,
changed into X.     The signs of the terms follow this law. A term not
containing X introduced in place of XYU is positive if Z’ occurs in it an
even number of times, negative in the contrary case.    But every X in
troduced in place of XYU occasions ‘a change of sign.      The aggregate
of all the terms thus fonned will give M,.
   We form N thus: construct the term

       to Linear Partial Differential                        Equations,      and the Calculus of

       by Professor S'r0KEs, Sec. R.S.                         Received April 7, 1864*.
  In applying  the calculus of symbols to partial differential equations, we
<U+FB01>nd an extensive class with coe<U+FB01>icients involving the independent variables
which may in fact, like differential equations with constant coe<U+FB02>icients, be
solved by the rules which apply to ordinary algebraical equations;      for
there are certain functions of the symbols of partial differentiation which
combine: with certain functions of the independent variables according to
the laws  of combination of common algebraical quantities.   In the <U+FB01>rst
part of this memoir I have investigated the nature of thee symbols, and
applied them to the solution of partial differential equations.   In the second
part   Ihave   applied  the  calculus  of  symbols   to the  solution  of func
tional equations.    For this purpose I have given some cases of symbolical
division   on a modi<U+FB01>ed type, so that the symbols may embrace a greater
range.     I have then shown how certain functional equations may be ex
pressed in a symbolical form, and have solved them by methods analogous
to those already explained.

      I    have stated, in the Bakerian Lecture read at the Royal Society on
     April   10, 1862, that the boomerang (prominence E)* was not depicted on
     Seiior Aguilar’s photographs.     This   true of the prints which came into
                                                 is
     my   hands  in England.   A   visit to Rome   in November 1862, however,
     afforded an opportunity for the examination of the <U+FB01>rst prints which had
     been taken in Spain on the day of the eclipse, previous to those printed off
     for general distribution by Se<U+FB01>or Aguilar.       Iwas agreeably surprised to
     <U+FB01>nd that the photograph of the <U+FB01>rst phase of totality showed not only this
     prominence very distinctly, but also other details, presently to be described,
     which were quite invisible in Se<U+FB01>or Aguilar’s copies.        had in fact experi
                                                                  I
     enced some di<U+FB01>iculty in comparing measurements of my photographs with
     those of Seiior Aguilar’s, on account of the indistinctness (woolliness) of the
     latter, which    have attributed to Padre Secchi’s telescope not having fol

                  the  most perfect following of the sun’s apparent motion.      For
     instance, my statement that the prominence H (the fallen tree) was not seen
     from having been mixed up with the prominence G,              not applicable to
                                                                  is

     the fallen tree can be made out.
        On expressing to Professor Secchi my surprise at the great discordance
     between the copy of the <U+FB01>rst phase of totality sent to me by Se<U+FB01>or Aguilar
     and that of the same phase in his possession,         was informed that after
                                                            I                         a
     few positive prints had been taken from the then unvarnished negative,           it
     was strengthened            by
                            the usual photographic process with nitrate of silver.
     This look upon as an unfortunate mistake, as the images of the promi
          I
     nences were increased and their details hidden, and the beauty of the
     negative for ever lost.
        It occurred to Padre Secchi and myself that although there was no hope

of procuring more satisfactory prints from the original negative of the <U+FB01>rst
phase of totality, yet some advantage would arise from taking an enlarged
negative from the positive print in his possession, although it could not
be expected to yield as perfect an impression as might have been obtained
by enlarging from the original photograph.      The enlargement has been
successfully accomplished in my presence; and although Professor Secchi
will take such means as he may think proper to make known the results
of comparisons he may make between my photographs and his own, it
will not        be out     of place for   me to add a few remarks by way       of appendix
to my paper.
  Taking the prominences in the order in my index map, Plate XV. :
   Prominence A (the cauli<U+FB02>ower or wheatsheaf) has the same form in
Padre Secchi’s photograph as in mine.      It extends considerably less in
height above the moon’s edge in this copy than in that printed oil" from the
strengthened negative (Se<U+FB01>or Aguilar’s copy); the bright points of the
two branching streams which issue from the summit towards the North are
well depicted in the Secchi photograph, but not the fainter parts.
  There exists a faint indication of the minute prominence B in the S.
 photograph.
    The convolutions of the prominence C (the <U+FB02>oating cloud) are seen in
the S. photograph, and its form coincides absolutely with that of mine; it
is a little nearer the moon’s edge at the point e, probably because the
telescope was uncovered relatively a little later than at Rivabellosa.
    The prominence D cannot be clearly traced in the S. photograph.
    The boomerang E is distinctly visible in the S. photograph; the point e
is apparently prolonged ; but this I attribute to an accidental photographic
 stain, for the bright part e’ can be well made out.
    The long prominence F cannot be made out in the S. photograph, pro
bably from the cause explained in reference to C.
    The fallen tree (H in the S. photograph) corresponds in its minutest
details with its picture in my own.                The articulated extremity
                                                                                      it /l,

in the S. photograph extends further from the edge of the moon than in
mine; and whereas in my photograph the convex boundary next the moon
is  cut of by the moon’s limb, in Padre Secchi’s the convex boundary                           is
complete, and hence in all probability the prominence               Ipresented another

ble in the S. photograph     not seen in mine, which may be accounted for from
our different positions in respect to the central line of the eclipse.
    Between    I and K, at a distance from     I  equal to about two-thirds the
angular interval, there    is in  the S. photograph a prominence consisting of
two round      dots, which extend beyond the moon’s limb to precisely the
same extent as the prominence K protrudes in Professor Secchi’s photo
graph beyond the moon’s limb in excess of what it does in my own.
     The prominence K has precisely the same form in every respect in the S.
photograph as in mine, so far as mine shows it ; but on account of parallax,
more of it is seen in the S. photograph than in mine.
     Beyond K is another prominence, visible in the S. photograph about 17°
distant from K, a small round prominence which could not have been
visible from my station.
     Of the remaining prominences,     L, M, N, O, P, Q, R,   none were visible at
the epoch of the photograph.
     In conclusion, the photographic images of the prominences, so far as they
are common to the two photographs taken at Miranda and Desierto de las
 Palmas, accord in their most minute details.         The photographs must, from
 the difference of position of the two stations, have been made at an abso
 lute interval of about seven minutes; and this fact, while it strongly sup
 ports the conclusion that the protuberances belong to the sun, at the same
 time shows that there is no change in their form during an interval much
 greater than the whole duration of an eclipse.
  II. “ On     Drops.”    By Fannnnrcx Gornara, Esq., Professor of Che
         mistry and Physics at the Royal College, Mauritius. Communi
         cated by Professor Sroxns, Sec. R.S.          Received July 15, 1864.
     In  the following investigation, the word drop is used in a rather more
  de<U+FB01>nite sense than that which is usually attached to it.
      In common speech a drop signi<U+FB01>es any mass of liquid matter whose form
  is visibly in<U+FB02>uenced towards the spherical    by the attraction of its parts, and
  whose sensible    motion  or  tendency  is towards   the earth.   This de<U+FB01>nition
  both includes drops with which we are not here concerned, and excludes
  others which we shall have to consider; for we shall] have to measure the
  size of drops; and it can only be of avail to measure the size of such drops
  as are formed under <U+FB01>xed and determinable conditions.
      How many drops, according to the usual        scope of the term,  are formed
  under inde<U+FB01>nite conditions.       For instance, a rain-drop depends for its size
 upon such circumstances       as the quantity   of vapour at the time and place
  of its formation, the tranquillity and electrical condition of the air, its rate
  of motion, the number and size of the drops it meets with in its course,
   &c., all of which are fortuitous, or, at least, immeasurable conditions.
      With such drops we have here nothing to do, but only with those
   which are formed under <U+FB01>xed circumstances.             On the other hand, we

1864.]                                  Prof. Guthrie on Drops.                               4,4,5
shall have to consider drops which move upwards‘.      Drops of this kind
are so seldom met with that no distinguishing name has been given to
them. We shall <U+FB01>nd it convenient to include them in the general term
drop, though it may appear at <U+FB01>rst inapplicable to them.
   Without attempting to give an exhaustive de<U+FB01>nition, it will be sufficient
to de<U+FB01>ne a drop as a mass of liquid collected and held together by the
attraction of its parts and separated from other matter by the attraction
of gravitation.   This definition will exclude such drops as those of mist or
rain, and will include the upward-moving drops mentioned above.
   It follows that the size of a drop may depend upon and be in<U+FB02>uenced by
                                                                                                      7‘t'llSlH't’7',
variation     in—
   (1)  The self-attraction and cohesion of the drop-generating liquid;
        Its adhesion to the matter upon which the drop is formed;                                     J.
   (2)
   (3)  The shape of the matter from which the drop moves;
   (4)  The physical relation of the medium through which the drop moves,
on the one hand, to the liquid of which the drop is formed, and on the
other, to the matter on which it is formed;
   (5) The attraction of the earth, or gravitation, upon the drop-forming
liquid and upon the medium, as in<U+FB02>uenced by their respective and relative
densities, and by variation in the attracting power of the earth.
   In order to study systematically the in<U+FB02>uence which each of these factors
exerts, each must be varied in succession while the others remain con
stant.
  Denoting         the three states of matter, solid, liquid, and gaseous, by the
symbols S,         L, G  respectively, and considering the symbols in the order
in which they are written to denote respectively the matter from which
the dropping takes place, the drop and the medium, we get a convenient
notation.
   As    we arespeaking at present exclusively of liquid                        drops,    L   must
always hold the middle place in the symbol.
   Of the eight symbolically possible variations,
             (1)       (2)       (3)        (4)         (5)     (5)       (7)       (3)
            SLS, SLL,          SLG,        LLS, LLL,           LLG,      GLS,     GLG,
(1), (4), and (7) are physically impossible on account of the superior
cohesion of solids over liquids, (6) and (8) are physically impossible on
account of the superior density of liquids over gases.
   SLL, SLG,         and      LLL   are therefore the only cases we have to consider.
That is,
  ' Owing to       the numerical preponderance         of downward-moving drops, we are prone to
                                    "                     How far I may be justi<U+FB01>ed philologically
associate   the ideas of “drop          and “ down."
in using    the expression    “drop up," must       depend  upon the relative primitiveness of the
noun and verb      " drop."
                         Once for all, I          beg permission to use the term drop in this more
extended sense.
  Of course, in the absence of positive levity, an upward drop can only be caused by the
downward motion of the medium in which the drop moves.

                LLL,   from a liquid a liquid drops through a liquid.

of the drop may be greater than and overcome the gravitation of the
medium, the drop descends; or the gravitation of the medium may over
come that      of the drop, the drop           ascends.     The   case   SLG cannot be in
verted, because,      at all events,       at the same pressure every known gas is
lighter than every known liquid.
   It will be convenient to consider the              case   SLG <U+FB01>rst,     because instances
of it   comemore frequently under our notice than of the other two, and
because it will be convenient to consider together those cases which are
capable of inversion.
- As we are
              considering the physical aspect of the question, we will only
discuss those cases where no chemical action takes place between the terms,
and where either no solution takes place, or where it is so small as to be
negligible, or of such a kind as to admit of experimental elimination. This
limitation of course excludes a vast number of combinations, but it must
be made in order to study the purely physical and de<U+FB01>nite in<U+FB02>uences which
determine the size of a drop.
               SLG.    From   a    Solid   a   Liquid drops through       a Gas.
   The variable factors are
     1. The self-attraction and cohesion of the liquid               :
          A. Dependent on its purely chemical constitution.
          B. Dependent on the proportion and physical relation                     between     its:
              heterogeneous parts, when a mixture.
          C. Dependent on temperature.
        2. The adhesion between the solid and the liquid:
          A, B, C as in 1. .
          D. Dependent upon the shape of the solid.
     3. The adhesion of thegas to the solid.
     4. The adhesion of the gas to the liquid.
   The factors 3 and 4 may be neglected, as we shall at present only con
sider the case where the gaseous medium is air at the ordinary barometri
pressure.          _
   One of these factors, namely temperature, though varying in ditferen
cases, may be supposed     in the same case to be the -same for the ditieren
kinds of matter present.      Another factor in the same predicament is th
locally constant gravitation at the place where the dropping occurs. Lastly
a condition of great in<U+FB02>uence is the length of
                                                the time-interval between
                                                                                              tll

liquid will always   be   of the   same   size,   if it   is formed of the same liquid
substance and falls from a solid of the same substance, size, and shape,
provided that the temperature remain the same, and the growth-time be
constant.
  The       of the drops may be most conveniently determined by weighing
         size
a noted number of them.     We are concerned rather with the relative than
with the absolute sizes of the drops.    The sizes of drops formed of the
same liquid are proportional to their weights; of different liquids, to those
weights divided by the speci<U+FB01>c gravities of the liquids.

turned   up at the end, and touches                            a       plug of cotton wool at G.   The
sphere H, from which the dropping’ takes place, is hung by three thin
wires from the ring of a retort-stand. The upper half of the sphere is
clothed in cotton wool, which reaches up to the plug at G.      The whole
arrangement   is placed upon a separate table from that which supports the
balance, so as to avoid the vibration caused by opening and shutting the
balance case.    The drops which fall from H enter the funnel L, whose
lower end is somewhat bent, so that the drops are thrown out of the ver
tical, and all upward splashing avoided.  The rapidity of the <U+FB02>ow through
the siphon, and consequent dropping from H, is regulated by raising or
lowering the table C.     The vessel A acts as a regulator for keeping the
level of the liquid in B at a constant height.
  The <U+FB01>rst           of experiments was made with the double object of
                 series
determining how far the rapidity of dropping in<U+FB02>uenced the size of the
drops, and to establish the uniformity of the size of the drops which drop
at equal intervals of time.
   In these experiments cocoa-nut oil was taken as the liquid, an ivory
sphere as the solid, and atmospheric air as the gas. The ivory sphere was
washed in hydrochloric acid, so as to deaden its surface.      Immediately
before and after each batch of drops, the same number of drops were
counted, and their time of falling compared with the time which elapsed in
the actual experiment.   In no case, however, was there a difference between
the two of a single second, so that gt may be considered in each case to be
exactly given.

of it than may be achieved by a succession of drops. On the contrary,
just as by walking more rapid progress may be made than by running, so
may dropping deliver more liquid than passes in a stream.       A uniformly
rapid series of drops may be converted into a stream, and reconverted into
drops under certain restrictions, at pleasure, without altering the quantity
of liquid delivered.       We shall return to this point.

 _  Hence it appears that, within the above limits, on the whole, the weight
or size of a drop diminishes as its growth-time increases. Further, it seems
that between the rates          gt='433 and gt='567             a minimum        occurs, that is,
instead of there being a continuous diminution in the weight as the growth
time increases, there is at <U+FB01>rst a diminution, then an increase, and <U+FB01>nally
a continuous diminution,          so that drops      of the rate gt='500 have sensibly
the same size as those of the rate            gt='633.
    In order to establish more precisely the position of this minimum and
the general relation between rate and size, the observations must be both
more minute and moreextended.                     For this purpose        a fresh sample     of oil
was taken, and the time-intervals             extended from 25" per 60 drops to 240"
per 20 drops;     as before,     four experiments were made at each time-interval.
The mean results       are given       in Table     IV.*,   in which the values of gt           are
obtained by dividing the time-intervals by the number of drops.                                The
mean weights of the single drops are got as in Table                   III.     The weights of
oil passing in one second are found by dividing the terms of column 2 by
those of column     1,  which correspond to them.

rate was faster than 60 drops in 25". A few rather discordant results, got
at the rate of 60 drops in 20", gave a mean of 009264 grm. as the weight
of   a single     drop; this tends to show that at this high rate the drops were
considerably  larger than at any lower rate.
     Towards the end of the Table, at the slower rates, the error                    of time   be
comes so exaggerated (the least alteration in the adjustment of the instru
ment makes so sensible a change in the entire time-lapse) that it is nearly
impossible to avoid an error of about 0"'5 in the whole time of several
minutes.          Although the time-errorthus becomes palpable,                   it nevertheless

inappreciable  errors of the swifter   rates of dropping.
     The numbers of Table          IV.   present us with several interesting            and im      1
portant facts.

             ,,     ,,   ='500   ,, ,, =12'000        ,,    ,, continual diminution.
     The most prominent fact is that,               on the whole,        the drops undergo a
continuous   diminution in weight or                size   as     gt increases.   To such an
extent is this the case, that the most rapidly falling drops of the above
Table are nearly twice as heavy as the most slowly falling ones. The cause
of this is probably to be sought for in the circumstance that when the
<U+FB02>owing to the solid is more slow, the latter is covered with a thinner <U+FB01>lm
of liquid, so that, as the drop parts, the solid reclaims by adhesion more
of the root of the drop than is the case when the adhesion of the solid to
the liquid can satisfy itself from the thicker <U+FB01>lm which surrounds the drop
in the case of a more rapid <U+FB02>ow. The in<U+FB02>uence of rate is seen to extend
even to the exceedingly slow rate of gt=l2".
     This connexion between rate and weight (or quantity) should not                      be lost
sight of by prescribers and dispensers of medicine.      A pharmacist who
administers  100 drops of a liquid drug at the rate of three drops per
second, may give half as much again, as one who measures the same
number at the rate of one drop in two seconds, and so on.
   For our present purpose the effect of rate upon the size of a drop is of
great moment, because it proves that there is no such thing as a drop of
normal size.   At no degree of slowness of dropping do drops assume a size
unaffected by even a slight change in the rate of their sequence. Hence,
whenever a comparison has to be made between the sizes of di<U+FB02>'erent drops,
we shall have to eliminate this source of di<U+FB02>'erence by taking drops which
follow at exactly the same rate.
   About the rate at which the diminution of size takes place for equal
increments of gt, the Table gives us little information beyond the fact that,

on the whole, the sizes of the drops at the slower rates are less in<U+FB02>uenced
by equal increments of gt than are those of the quicker rates. This, how
ever, only appears         distinctly         at and below the rate   of about gt=   1" '00.
    If the   connexion between               gt and the drop-size

                              being  the values of gt, and the ordinates the
corresponding     drop-weights, there is apparently no asymptote parallel to
the axis of X.        The curve presents, however, in its course two secondary
maxima and minima:
                                Secondary maxima.            Secondary minima.

                                                                                                  .___4.-_._

   Although at these minima the drops are less than at the immediately
succeeding rates, yet the quantity of liquid passed in        given time is, at

     The factor, the in<U+FB02>uence of whose variation                       on the size of the drop
we have next to consider, is the constitution                         of the liquid of which the
drop is formed.    For the foregoing experiments concerning the in<U+FB02>uence
of rate, cocoa-nut oil was employed on account of its non-volatility. On
allowing a quantity of                  it,

B    is   constant, yet          it   undergoes   a   series   of slight but

As    even such slight irregularities

gravity of the liquid and thereby determining an earlier separation of the

when the speci<U+FB01>c gravity is 10680, where the drop-size is a minimum.
Further, it is seen from column 5 that the quantity of nitre in a drop in
creases continually as the strength of the solution increases, although both
the weight and the volume of the drop vary.
   Inversely, the regularity of the variation of drop-size, in the case of nitre,
points to the absence of hydrates of that body.
   It would be delusive to endeavour to construct a formula connecting the
speci<U+FB01>c gravity with the drop-size or drop-weight of the solution; but, as
before, a graphic representation serves to show the connexion between the
                                                                                    TCUSZZTM.
variables.   In curve D, <U+FB01>g. 2, the abscissse represent the quantity of
nitrate of potash in solution, the ordinates show the corresponding drop
sizes.   As with chloride of calcium, it is seen that the drop-size of water is     J.
larger than that of any solution of nitre.        Curve E, <U+FB01>g. 2, having the
same abscissae as D, has ordinates which represent the drop-weights.
   It is confessedly a matter of great interest, and still greater difficulty, to
determine exactly the relation which exists between a dissolved solid and
its solvent —that is, to <U+FB01>nd out whether or when a solid should be viewed
as being in combination with a portion of the liquid in which it is dissolved.
Such questions may perhaps receive additional light from experiments
similar to the above, but more extensive, and performed with this special
object in view.   Comparing the curves C and D, for instance, there can be
little doubt that the secondary maximn and minima of C are owing to the
existence of hydrates of chloride of calcium in solution. The only known
hydrates of chloride of calcium are Ca Cl, 2H0 and Ca Cl, 6 HO, the latter
of which contains 50-7 per cent. of Ca Cl. Solution S conta.i11s about 42'5
per cent.   It is noteworthy that, while the six-water chloride in the solid
state absorbs heat on solution, the solution S evolves heat on dilution, as
already mentioned.    In the case of nitre we have in the drop-sizes evidence
only  of the opposite efforts of two cohesions, that of the water and that of
the nitre.    By pursuing this direction of experimental inquiry, evidence
may probably                       the truth of Berthollet’s hypothesis of
                   be got concerning
reciprocal recomposition in the case of the mixture of the solutions of two
salts, AX and BY, where AY and BK are also soluble in water.

in immediate chemical relation.             They were—
              Water.                               Oil of turpentine (turpentol).
              Alcohol.                             Benzol.
              Acetic acid.                         Glycerine.
              Acetic ether.                       Mercury.
               Butyric acid.
    These several liquids were allowed to drop under the same conditions,
from the bottom of a hemispherical platinum cup. The arrangement of the
apparatus was quite similar to that described in Part I., the ivory ball being
replaced by the platinum cup, and the over<U+FB02>ow of the cup being deter
mined by strips of paper bent over its edge.               The case of mercury is the
only one which requires some explanation.                                   I
                                                        A few years ago noticed the
fact that mercury which holds even a very little sodium in solution has
the power of “wetting” platinum in a very remarkable manner.                           The
 appearance of the platinum is quite similar to that presented by amalga
 mable metals in contact with mercury.                But the platinum is in no wise
 attacked.       Further, the amalgam may be washed oil‘ by clean mercury,
 and the latter will also continue to adhere equally closely to the platinum.
 All the phenomena of capillarity are presented between the two. The
 surface of the mercury in a platinum cup so prepared is quite concave; and
 a basin of mercury may be emptied if a few strips of similarly prepared
 platinum foil be laid over its edge—just as a basin of water may be emptied
 by strips of paper or cloth, and under the same condition, namely that the
 external limb of such capillary siphon be longer than the internal one.
     I generally use this curious property of sodium-amalgam for cleaning
 platinum vessels. It enables us now to examine the size of drops of mer
 cury under conditions similar to those which obtain in the case of other
 liquids*.       After the cup had been used for the other liquids, its surface
    * In regard to the above-mentioned property of sodium, the following observations
 may be of interest.     'At <U+FB01>rst the explanation naturally suggests itself, that the effect
 wrought by     the sodium  may be due to an absorption of oxygen, in consequence of the
 oxidation of the sodium, the consequent diminution of the gaseous <U+FB01>lm between the
 two metals, and the resulting excess in the superior pressure of the air. This, however,
 cannot be the true explanation, because it is found that the perfect contact between the
 two, or “ wetting,” takes place equally well in an atmosphere of nitrogen, carbonic acid,
 or -in vacuo.              I
                  Hence, if may venture upon a guess, unsupported by experimental evi
 dence,  I  should be rather disposed to assign the phenomenon to the reducing action of
 nascent hydrogen derived from the contact of sodium with traces of water.          Perhaps
 even the least oxidizable metals are covered with a thin <U+FB01>lm of oxide, which is reduced
 by the nascent hydrogen at the same moment that the mercury is presented to the re
 duced metal. It is found that iron, copper, bismuth, and antimony are also wetted by
 mercury if their surfaces are <U+FB01>rst touched with sodium amalgam. Not only do the
 latter metals lose this power on being heated (as we might expect, in consequence of
 their super<U+FB01>cial oxidation), but platinum, from which the adhering mercury <U+FB01>lm has
 been wiped by the cleanest cloth, or from which it has been driven by heat, also loses
  the power.     It is true that the surface of clean platinum is supposed to condense a

few strips of similarly prepared platinum foil being bent over the edge and

   The experimental numbers obtained are given without omission.         The
liquids are arranged  in the order  of  magnitude  of their  drop-sizes.   It
appears from column 5 (of the speci<U+FB01>c gravities) that some of the liquids
employed were not perfectly pure.      This, however, is quite immaterial in
the present direction of examination, provided that in all cases where the
liquids named are in future employed and compared with those of Table
VII., identically the same liquids are meant.
  The numbers of column 6, with which we are now exclusively concerned,
present several points of great interest. In the <U+FB01>rst place, it appears that
the speci<U+FB01>c gravity of a liquid is not by any means the most powerful de
terminant of the drop-size.     Thus butyric acid, which has sensibly the
same specific gravity as water, gives rise to a drop less than half the size
of the water-drop ; while mercury, of singular speci<U+FB01>c gravity, has no ex
ceptional drop-size.  Lastly, it may be observed how that remarkable body
water asserts here again its preeminence.    The <U+FB01>rst impression which
these numbers make is, that there are three groups of magnitude, n, 2 1:,
371.  But it is possible that a change in the nature of the solid might
throw these drop-sizes into a different order of magnitude; and certainly
until a very much greater number of bodies is examined in this sense, it
would be premature to attempt to establish anything like a law.
     It   is su<U+FB01>icient
                   for the present to point out that the drop-size is not
directly dependent upon either the speci<U+FB01>c gravity or boiling-point; nor
does it stand in any obvious relation to what is sometimes called the liqui
dity, mobility, or thinness ofa liquid.  For we <U+FB01>nd that glycerine                   and
(from  former  experiments) cocoa-nut oil both form smaller drops                   than
water, the one being heavier and the other lighter than that body,                   and
both being viscid or sluggish. On the other hand, alcohol and acetic                acid,
both perfectly mobile liquids, give rise to drops about half         as large as those
of glycerine       *'.
     Hence   it clear that we are still ignorant of that property of liquid
                  is                                                            a
upon which its drop-size mainly depends.        We are not yet in position  a
to connect the drop-size with any of the known physical or chemical pro
perties of liquids.   We approach the solution of the problem by studying
the effects of change in some others of the variables.
     The adhesion between the liquid which drops and the solid from which
it   drops   is   also affected by the curvature and general geometric distribution
of the solid at and about its lowest point. And the variation in the adhe
sion between the solid and liquid, caused by the variation in the geometric
              of the solid, may and does in its turn affect the size of the
gistribution
 rop.
   From this aspect, one of the simplest kinds of variation     that offered
                                                                       is

And this case is an important one, because it undoubtedly offers the key
to all drop-size variation arising from a similar cause. To study this point
we may make use of any one convenient liquid, such as water, and cause
it to drop at a <U+FB01>xed rate from spheres of various radii, including the ex
treme ease of a horizontal plane.         This extreme case, however, presents
certain practical dif<U+FB01>eulties.    From a plane it is almost impossible to get
a series of drops uuifonn in growth-time and in position.          A ripe drop
hanging   from  a horizontal  plane  will seek  the edge thereof. Several drops

   It appears,    therefore, that the drop increases in size according as the radius

 of the sphere increases from which the drop falls, and, further, that the
 difference of drop-size brought about by this cause alone may easily amount
 to half the largest drop-size.   For dispensers of medicine this fact is as im
portant as that pointed out in Part 1., where it was shown that the growth
time so materially influenced the drop-size. The lip of a bottle from which
a drop falls is usually annuloid.    The amount of solid in contact with the
dropping liquid is determined by the size of two diameters, one measuring
the width of the rim of the neck, the other the thickness of that rim.        In
most cases the curvature and massing of the solid at the point whence the
liquid drops is so irregular as not to admit of any mathematical expression.
    The reason why drops which fall from surfaces of greater curvature are
larger than those which fall from surfaces of less curvature is surely
this   :-In the case of a surface of greater curvature the base of the drop
has more nearly its maximum size; the centre of gravity of the liquid <U+FB01>lm
from which the drop hangs is nearer to the centre of gravity of the hang
ing drop   ;   the contact between the two is more extensive and intimate   ; so
that the drop is held for a longer time and therefore grows more.
   On comparing columns 3 and 5 of Table VIII., there does not appear
to be any obvious law of connexion between the two; nor indeed can the
numbers of column 4 pretend to such a degree of accuracy as would justify
us in attempting to establish one. This is seen on comparing inter ac the
numbers of column 4.     Especially with the spheres of longer radii, there
is so much dit<U+FB01>culty in getting a. uniform wetting of the surface whence
the drop falls, and this so materially in<U+FB02>uences the drop-size, that the
numbers found are seen to vary considerably.    Greater accord is obtained
with spheres of less radii. As we might expect, the same absolute increase
in length of radius takes less effect upon the drop-size in the case of longer
than in that of shorter radii.     The in<U+FB01>nite, or at least inde<U+FB01>nitely great
di<U+FB02>"erence between the radii 1 and 2 produces about the same effect upon
the drop-size as the difference of 43 millims. between the radii 2 and 3,
and so on.
   The following Table of <U+FB01>rst diiferences shows this more strikingly :—

   As the diameter of the sphere still further diminishes, the size of the

completely included in the drop.
   It would be interesting, but it would take us too far, to consider the vari
ous cases of liquids dropping from cones, edges, solid angles, cylinders,
rings, &c. We must content ourselves in this direction with the fact that
the size of a drop is greater the more nearly plane is the surface from

  curate to measure drop-sizes ; but it offers a method of making the di<U+FB01>'er
  ence of drop-size visible to any number of persons at once.
      The only other variation in the geometrical relation between the solid
  and the liquid, which we shall consider, is the variation in:the size of a cir
  cular horizontal plane from which drops fall.
      Five disks of copper foil were cut of the radii 5%, 356, 336, 1,96, 716th of an
  inch respectively.      These were fastened horizontally to vertical wires, and,
  having been thoroughly cleaned by momentary immersion in nitric acid
  and washing, water was made to drop from them at the rate gt=2".
      Table IX. shows the influence of this kind of variation upon drop-size.
 The want of accord in the numbers of the largest disk is owing to a pecu
  liar tremor which the drops exhibit at the moment of delivery.               The same
 phenomenon was noticed, but to a less extent, with the next smaller disk.
  With the remainder it was not noticed.
      The curvature and shape of the solid, and its consequent massing towards
  the liquid, is intimately connected with the next phase of variation which
 we shall consider, to wit, the variation in the chemical composition of the
 solid from which the drop falls.          The in<U+FB02>uence of this kind of variation is
 to be studied by examining the size of drops formed under like circum
  stances, from spheres of the same size, but made of different material. Since
 in this case the liquid remains the same, we must limit the solids examined
 to such as the liquid completely wets.          In this case, variation in the drop
 size implies a variation in the thickness of the liquid <U+FB01>lm covering the
 solid.     The latter must be caused by variation in the adhesion between the
 solid and liquid. Finally, such adhesion can only vary through one or both
 of two causes—namel_v, variation in the density of the solid, or in its spe
ci<U+FB01>c adhesion dependent upon its chemical nature.
     The <U+FB01>rst qualitative experiment was made upon three equal spheres of
 brass, glass, and cork. They were hung one above the other in the manner
before described, so that the drop from one sphere fell upon the lower
 one*.      It was found that, in whatever order the spheres were arranged,
when the <U+FB02>ow was uniform and not quicker than _qt=2", the dropping from
the cork took place with the greatest rapidity, that from the glass next,
and that from the brass most slowly——showing that the brass gives rise to
the largest, the glass to the next largest, and the cork to the least drops.
From this it would       seem that the drops are     in the  same
                                                                    order  as  to size as
are the solids as to density.       We shall <U+FB01>nd, however, that this is not always
the case, and that some other_property_ as well as density is at work to in
<U+FB02>uence the drop-size.         The quantitative ‘experiment, the results of which
are given in Table X., con<U+FB01>rms the result of the qualitative experiment
given above, but shows, at the same time, that the joint in<U+FB02>uences of den

each sphere to receive the drops from    the higher one, and, by acting as a reservoir, to
regulate the <U+FB01>ow.

  When a liquid drops from a solid it is not always that the adhesion be
tween the solid and liquid is overcome.   The phenomenon of “ wetting ”
implies a superiority of the adhesion between the solid and liquid over the
cohesion of the liquid ; and in all cases where a liquid drops from a solid
which it wets, the act of separation is a disruption of the liquid, and not a
separation of the liquid from the solid ; that the separation of the drop    is,
isa failure of cohesion and not of adhesion. We are not, however, justified
on this account in anticipating that the size of   drop    una<U+FB01>'ected    the   a             is      by
chemical nature of the solid from which     drops, even in those cases where

                    where the liquid completely wets the solid), because,

part, or drop, depends in great measure upon the thickness of the residual
<U+FB01>lm, as we have seen in examining the influence of the growth-time (in
Part I.) and of the radius of curvature.
   Adhesion may also exist between a                     solid and             a  liquid which does not wet
it,as when a  drop of mercury hangs                     from        a        glass sphere.   But the cohe
sion of the liquid in such    case,   a               by  its effort to bring the liquid to the

surface is scarcely wetted by water.
  As the bodies examined have different coefficients of expansion by heat,
and one of them expands on solidi<U+FB01>cation, it was necessary to test the
equality of their size and remedy any inequality. This was done by ar
ranging three of them, one at each angle of a small equilateral triangle
drawn on a large piece of plate glass. Another piece of plate glass was
then placed upon the spheres so as to rest on them all three, and slightly
loaded.   On passing a gauge between the plates, at their edges, the slightest
            of the spheres could be detected, because the gauge lifted the

sulphur and phosphorus were, for the same purpose, washed in ether.
  Although there is only      a slight difference between the consecutive terms
of column    3,   yet between the extremes of antimony and tin a well-marked
difference exists.
   This Table shows that the drop-size stands in no simple relation either to
the equivalent density or chemical character of the solid, and establishes
the existence of a speci<U+FB01>c adhesion independent of these.       Although the
differences of Table IX. may be partly owing to the differences of density
of the solids cork, glass, and brass, yet we see from Table X. that there
is about half as great a difference between the sizes of drops from antimony
and tin as between those from cork and brass, although the difference of
density between the <U+FB01>rst two is small compared with that between the last.
 Again, sulphur gives rise to drops intermediate between those of antimony
and cadmium.     Without, therefore, venturing to assert that density is with
out in<U+FB02>uence on drop-size, it is clearly proved that it does not exert the
most powerful in<U+FB02>uence.
   We have <U+FB01>nally to examine the direction and extent of variation in drop
size caused by change of temperature.      By altering the density of the
liquid,   a change in its temperature may affect the drop-weight without
altering the drop-size.    It may further alter the drop-size by altering the
size and therefore the curvature of the solid.     Any error introduced by
the <U+FB01>rst of these sources is eliminated by dividing the observed weight by
the speci<U+FB01>c gravity at the proper temperature, as in the case of different
liquids at the same temperature.      Errors from the second source may he
certainly safely neglected, being far within the errors of observation.
   In the place where these experiments were made, the range of natural
atmospheric temperature is very small.      From the coldest to the hottest
season the di<U+FB01>'erence scarcely exceeds 10° C.     This circumstance made an
extended and minute study of the in<U+FB02>uence of temperature impossible, by
preventing more than one observation at each temperature being made.
   The liquid taken was water, and the solid was glass. The water was heated
to the boiling-point and placed in the apparatus (Part I. <U+FB01>g. 3).       The
sphere from which the water fell was the bulb of the thermometer which

 measured the temperature. Fully the upper half of the sphere was covered
 with cotton-wool, so that the whole of the sphere was kept wet. The con
 siderable mass of mercury in the bulb of the dropping sphere or thermo
 meter itself served to make more uniform the temperature of the drops;
 while the actual contact between the drops and the spherical bulb ensured
 a tolerably close approximation between the actual temperature of the drops
 and that indicated on the stem of the instrument.              Although, therefore,
 the temperatures observed cannot pretend to any even approximate positive
 accuracy,  yet they are certainly in the actual order of magnitude.               The
 arrangement is seen in Plate IV. <U+FB01>g. 6.

    In the above Table the temperatures are so grouped together that the
means of the groups differ from one another by about 10° C. The single
drop-weights are correspondingly grouped, and the mean of each group is
then divided by the speci<U+FB01>c gravity of water         (0°=l)     at the mean tempe
rature of the group.
   It  appears then that, for-a range of 20° Centigrade, or 36° F., the dif
ference in drop-size effected by change of temperature in the liquid is in
appreciably small, not being more than 000277, a quantity almost within
the limits of experimental error ; for on referring to Table X. we <U+FB01>nd that
the greatest difference between the numbers for glass, which should be
equal, amounts to 000044 grm., or a sixth of the greatest difference due
to variation in temperature.                                  -
   On the whole, then, we may conclude that the temperature has very little
in<U+FB02>uence on the drop-size in the case of water between the above limits.

    structure, the drop-size would be subject to sudden changes of magnitude.
    A few experiments with other liquids, namely turpentol, acetic acid, and
    alcohol, showed that with them the drop-size was almost equally insensible
    to change of temperature; and in all cases, as with water, the lower the
    temperature, on the whole, the larger the drop.
      We have now examined seriatirn all the chief           causes   upon which the
    drop-size depends in the case SLG.      They are,          1.   Rate of delivery;
    2. Solids held in solution; 3. Chemical nature of         liquid; 4. Geometric
    relation between   solid and liquid;    5. Density and chemical nature of solid;

      Our data, however, are still insu<U+FB01>icient  for us to predict, under all cir
    cumstances, the relative sizes of the drops of liquids under known external
    conditions.  Clearly the missing term is closely related to the speci<U+FB01>c co
    hesion of the liquid. But what is cohesion’! and how can it be measured?
    It lies perhaps in the nature of things—it seems at least inevitable—that
    the nomenclature of elementary properties should be vague and unsatisfac
    tory. The propcrties of solids~hard, soft, brittle, tough, tenacious, elastic,
    mallcable—do not stand in any de<U+FB01>nite relation to one another. Even the
    hardness which resists abrasion, the hardness which resists penetration, the
    hardness which resists crushing are by no means identical; so that one
    body may possess more of the one sort of hardness than a second body
    does, while the second body exceeds the <U+FB01>rst in another sort of hardness.
    Nor do any of the above-mentioned properties of solids stand in any simple
    relation to that resistance to the separation of the contiguous parts which
    is called cohesion.    Thus, by no attribution of this single property of co
    hesion could we de<U+FB01>ne iee or shell-lac, bodies which are at the same time
    tough, brittle, elastic, and soft.
      We     are forced to the conceptionof two distinct kinds of cohesion—stub
    horn and persistent.    These may coexist, but are not identical.     The one
    is strong to assert, the other pertinacious to maintain.   The four following
    substances may serve to illustrate the possession of these two cohesions in
    various quantity.
       Talc has little stubborn and little persistent cohesion.
       Glass has much stubborn and little persistent cohesion.
       Gold has little stubborn and much persistent cohesion.
       Iron has much stubborn and much persistent cohesion.
       The necessity for such a discrimination exists in a yet higher degree in
    liquids. If we conceive two liquids of different nature dropping from the
    same substance which they both wet, and if there be only one kind of co
    hesion, the one which has the greatest cohesion will tend most strongly to
    assume the spherical form ; and this would tend to cause it to drop sooner,
    or have a smaller drop-size than the other.    On the other hand, the liquid
    of stronger cohesion will cling most strongly to the <U+FB01>lm of liquid adhering
'
    to the solid ; this will keep it longer from falling, and thereby increase its
    drop-size.   Hence an increase of cohesion tends to produce two contrary

 effects. But if there be a similar distinction between the two kinds of co
hesion of liquids, as above pointed out in the case of solids, we have the
following consequence. It is the persistent cohesion which causes the as
sumption of the spherical form, the stubborn which resists the separation
of the drop.   The former tends to diminish, the latter to increase its size.
As one or other predominates, the size of the drop varies.
   Accordingly the drop-size is by no means a measure of what is generally
called the cohesion of the liquid, but rather a measure of the di<U+FB01>'erence
between the two cohesions, stubborn and persistent; and the law is, that
the drop-size varies inversely as the persistent, and directlyas the stubborn
cohesion of the liquid.
   In mercury, water, and glycerine the stubborn cohesion is greater in
proportion to the persistent cohesion than in the other liquids examined ;
but it by no means follows that persistent cohesion is wanting in mercury
or stubborn in alcohol.
    When a drop is in the act of falling its stubborn cohesion is in equili
 brium with the resultant of two forces—the one, the persistent cohesion,
 tending to produce a spherical form, the other the weight of the drop.
 Since the former of these component forces               is,
                                                for the same liquid, constant,
it  seems as though the weight of the drop might be taken as          measure        a
 and expression of the stubborn cohesion. But such       not the case, because
                                                                 is

that in larger drops this hypothetical surface of stubborn cohesion      larger          is
than in smaller drops.    Further, unless we know the exact shape of drop                 a
in all cases, we are not in position to deduce the size of the surface of
                                     a
cohesion from the drop-size or drop-weight.
     In the cases   where   it   has been tried,   ithas not been found that the nature
of the gaseous medium in the case of SLG exerts any appreciable or de<U+FB01>
nite in<U+FB02>uence upon the drop-size.   Taking glass for the solid and water
for the liquid, the medium was changed from air to nitrogen, hydrogen,
and carbonic acid.       The exceedingly slight variation wrought in the
drop-size by  this change may probably have been due to the different solu
bility of the gases in water, and the consequent alteration in the cohesion
of that liquid.
   Having now traced the effect of variation in the conditions which deter
mine the size of     drop in the general case SLG (or where from

p_entol and benzol here employed had the speci<U+FB01>c gravities of 0863 and
0'864 respectively; they may therefore be considered of equal density.
Hence variation in the liquid medium, independent of variation in its den
sity, produces an enormous effect upon drop-size. We shall have occasion
to return to this case.
   The in<U+FB02>uence which the liquid medium exerts on the drop-size, and the
share of that in<U+FB02>uence due to the speci<U+FB01>c gravity of the medium, will be
well seen on comparing the drop-sizes of mercury which falls through
various liquid media.
  The arrangement of the apparatus for this purpose is seen in Plate V.
<U+FB01>g. 8. As far as A it is similar to fig. 7. The siphon A, <U+FB01>g. 8, is a capillary
tube; its lower end, which is turned verticallydownwards, rests upon a sphere
of brass, R, which has been washed with nitric acid and sodium-amalgam, and
allowed to soak for some days under mercury.   Mercury adheres perfectly
to such a sphere.   In every case the sphere was immersed just halfway
in the liquid. A small capsule S is supported in the liquid on a stand                                '1‘
about half an inch lower than the bottom of the sphere. As soon as gt
becomes constantly         =5", the     vessel   V   is   moved so that     S   comes under          R.
Five drops of    mercury having been caught, the cup moved horizontallyis
as before, taken out and replaced by fresh one, and so on. The batches

Table XV.
   We may, however, previously notice here with advantage phenomenon             a
which attends the separation of drops under several circumstances, but
which can be watched most narrowly in the cases of SLL, because in                                    a
liquid the separation of drop a less abrupt than in

Sometimes not, under apparently similar circumstances.        No doubt the
proximate cause     that the drop at the instant of separation
                      is                                           not sphe           is
rical; the persistent or retentive cohesion, which brings      almost imme      it
diately to its normal shape, does not allow time for its more excentric parts
to collect to the main mass   they are therefore
                                   ;                              by

   The same phenomenon        seen much more distinctly when water drops
                                   is
at this rate (_qt=5") through benzol or turpentol. In these cases the per
sistent cohesion of the liquid medium comes also into play.
   But the most striking example of supplementary drops                              is       seen when

It is impossible to determine whether they both have their origin at the

they have not, but that one is <U+FB01>rst separated from the main drop, and the

plementary drops in the case of mercury falling from copper through gly
cerine were determined as follows :—A number of porcelain cups (<U+FB01>g. 9)
were arranged at the bottom of a shallow dish full of glycerine; when the                         J.
rate   of dropping         was uniform   at   gt=4", the dish         was shifted horizontally
so that every drop with its two supplements was caught in a separate cup.
The globules of mercury in each cup were removed by a little scoop of
copper foil.  Te11 of each kind were collected. After washing and drying,
they were weighed, with the following result :—

            The values of W2 form column 6.
            The liquid media are arranged according to the order of magnitude of the
        numbers of column 4.          The salient points of Table XV. are chie<U+FB02>y these :—
             1. The drop-size of a liquid which drops under like conditions through
        various media does not depend wholly upon the density of the medium and
         consequent variation in the weight, in the medium, of the dropping liquid.
        Thus glycerine, whose density is above that of all the other liquids ex
        amined, does not, as a medium, cause the mercurial           drop to assume either
        its minimum or maximum size.                                                  _
            2.  The liquids in Table XV. are in the         same  order as in Table     VII.
         In   other words,    if  there be two liquids, A and B, which drop under like
         conditions through      air,  and the drop-size of the one, A, be greater than
         that of the other, B; then if a third liquid, C, be made to drop through A
         and through B, the drop-size of C through A is greater than the drop-size
         of C through B.
            3. Further, on comparing Tables XIII. and XV. it appears that, whether
        water or mercury drops through turpentol and benzol, the drop through
       benzol is greater than the drop through turpentol.              This we shall after
       wards     <U+FB01>nd   con<U+FB01>rmed     in  other instances  into the law, If the drop-size of
       A    through   B  be  greater than the drop-size of A through C, then the drop
       -size of D through B is also greater than the drop-size qf D through C.
            It is further observed that, while mercury exhibits its largest drop when
       falling through air, water assumes its smallest drop-size under this condition.
            This method of the examination of liquids by drop-size in the case SLL,
       which brings so prominently forward a comparatively slight di<U+FB02>'erence be
       tween similar      liquids, may be used, not only to detect commercial adulte
       rations of one liquid by another, but perhaps to distinguish between those
       remarkably-related isomeric liquid bodies (the number of which is quickly
       increasing)     between whose terms the difference has until lately escaped
       detection.      Of these bodies perhaps the <U+FB01>rst most remarkable instance was
       furnished by the two amylic alcohols ; but the greatest number at present
       known is amongst the hydrocarbons.
            We may take an example illustrating the use of the stalagmometer in
       approximately measuring the proportion, in a mixture, of its two chemically
        and physically similar, but not isomeric constituents.
       ‘    Suppose we had a liquid which we knew to consist wholly of a mixture
         of benzol and turpentol, and we wished to <U+FB01>nd the proportion in which

 these two ingredients were present.              We could scarcely approach to an
 answer by any of the means hitherto employed.                      The speci<U+FB01>c gravities of
 the two liquids are so close ('864, '863) that the density of the mixture
would give us no substantial aid. Though there is a considerable differ
 ence (80° C.) in their boiling-points, no one who is familiar with the diffi
 culties of fractional distillation would place any reliance upon a quantita
 tive separation based upon volatility.              Their refractive indices are nearly
 the same*.         Their vapour-densities, 2"/'7, 4"/'6, though comparatively
 different, are not absolutely very wide apart.                 They are active and passive
 towards most of the same chemical reagents, and interfere with one another’s
reactions.     If  we have recourse to chemical analysis (C12 He, C2° H“), a very
 small experimental error would point to a great difference in the proportion
 of the two.
    To <U+FB01>nd how far the stalagmometer (Plate V. <U+FB01>g. 7) is applicable in this
 case, it was <U+FB01>lled with <U+FB01>ve liquids in succession :—

    Hence a difference        of l6'6 per cent. in one of the constituents corre
sponds to an observed difference, under the most unfavourable conditions,
of three drops. In other words, the stalagmometer is sensitive to an alter
ation of about      6 per cent.      By increasing the capacity of the recipient, it is
clear that the drop-numbers, and therefore their differences, might be in
creased at pleasure.         Thus by counting the number of drops necessary to
<U+FB01>ll a volume six times the size, we could tell to within one per cent. how
much turpentol and how much benzol were present.
    But it is perhaps in the cases of the still more proximate identity of iso
meric bodies mentioned above that the stalagmometer may be used rather
   * The refractive index of turpentol is 1476; that of benzol does not appear to have
been measured; but that     it is almost identical with that of turpentol is seen on mixing
the two.   In  those  cases  in which I propose chie<U+FB02>y to use the stalagmometer, namely
with isomeric liquids, the method of refraction is useless, because isomeric liquids
 seem always to have the same refractive indices.

   From Table XVI. we gather the general law concerning three liquids,
two of which are insoluble in the third.               If
                                             a liquid, A, drop downwards
under like conditions in succession through two liquids, B and C, then its
drop-size through any mixture of B and C is intermediate between its
drop-size through D and its drop-size through C; and the greater lhe
proportion   of         in the mixture, the more nearly           does the   drop-si:e of   A

  We have already examined the in<U+FB02>uences on the drop-size in the case
SLG of the density of the dropping liquid, and of its persistent and stub                       J.
born cohesions respectively.  Increase in the former two tends to diminish
the drop-size; increase in the last to increase it. Let us examine in like
manner the in<U+FB02>uence of the similar properties of the medium.
  1. The density of the medium.——Incrense    in the density of the medium
is equivalent to diminution in the density of the dropping liquid, and must
therefore be followed by a tendency to increase in the drop-size.
   2. Stubborn cohesion of medium.——The resistance to displacement, or
stubborn cohesion of the medium, tends to keep back the drop in its place,
and makes it necessary for a larger quantity of the dropping liquid to ac
cumulate; that         is,
                      increases the drop-size.

  3. Retentive            of medium.—The same force of persistent or re
                       cohesion
tentive cohesion which eauses    drop of liquid to take the spherical form,
                                        a          a
would also   cause   the liquid to give or tend to give    spherical form to an
                                                                   a
irregularly-shaped volume of       solid, liquid, gas, or vacuum in it.

gas-bubbles   in liquids have  an approximately spherical   form, not by reason
of the cohesion of the parts of the gas, but by the persistent cohesion of
the liquid medium which moulds the gas into that form by which the co
hesion of the liquid    most grati<U+FB01>ed.
                              is       Hence increase in the retentive or
persistent cohesion of the medium tends to diminish the drop-size of the
dropping liquid.

       This scheme is' veri<U+FB01>ed by the experimental results obtained.                Of all
   liquids water forms the largest drops            in  falling through-air, because in it
   the stubborn cohesion prevails to the greatest degree over the joint action
   of persistent cohesion and weight.            In water mercury forms drops greater
   than in all other liquids, because in water (as a medium) stubborn cohesion
   and weight prevail to the greatest degree over persistent cohesion.
       The case SLL_may be inverted if the drop-forming liquid be speci<U+FB01>cally
   lighter than the medium liquid. Thus every case of SLL which we have
   examined in which a liquid, A, drops downwards through a liquid, B, has a
   counter case in which the liquid B drops upwards‘ through the liquid A.‘
       In  order to measure the size of such ascending drops, the stalagmometer
    (<U+FB01>g. 7) is modi<U+FB01>edin form. It is not found possible to cause the dropping
   liquid to adhere with sufficient completeness and uniformity to a solid
   sphere immersed in the denser medium, in the cases experimented on.
   The end of the siphon A was turned upwards, and served as the solid
   whence the liquid dropped, without the interposition of a sphere or other
  ‘solid.    The measuring-tube D was removed from the neck of the cup 0,
    a stopper being inserted in its place.             The cup C was <U+FB01>lled with water,
    and the measuring-tube       D,     being also <U+FB01>lled with water, was inverted into
    it and supported by the holder H. The modi<U+FB01>ed stalagmometer is seen
  _in Plate V. <U+FB01>g. 10.       Care was taken that the end of the siphon A should
    always   be at the  same   depth beneath the surface of the water in C.
       The drop-sizes of the liquids of Table XVI. were <U+FB01>rst examined by this

    stalagmometer.
       The following Table XVII. shows the number of drops of the various
    liquids, dropping through water, required to <U+FB01>ll the measuring-tube up to
    the given mark. The measuring-tube employed was different from that
    used in forming Table XVI.              On this account, and because the deliver

    It               that supplementary drops are found in the cases just
         is remarkable
considered, just as in the case of water dropping through the same liquids.
But the supplementary drops of benzol and turpentol through water bear
a much smaller ratio to the main drops than do those of water through
benzol and turpentol to their main drops. Judging only from the equality
                                                                                                         .l.Tt’(l5Zl7'l’7'|
in their rate of ascent through the measuring-tube, all these supplementary
drops are very exactly of the same size.    The supplementary drops were
not further examined, but                were      always collected and measured with the
main drops.
  Viewed as a means of quantitative chemical analysis, the measurement
of the drop-sizes of liquids which drop up through water is yet more
sensitive than that of the drop-sizes of water falling downwards through
the liquids.          Thus, from Table          XVII.,
                                      the least proportional difference of
drop-number, caused by an alteration in the proportion of the liquids, is
between T and BT,, where a diminution of 33'33 per cent. in the turpen
tol and an addition of 33'33 per cent. of benzol                       causes a difference    of 35'3
in the drop-number.

Or this stalagmometer shows the composition                             of the liquid to within

we could determine the proportion, on an average, to within 0'33 per cent.
    Itmay be noticed with regard to SLL that the value of gt is of much
less in<U+FB02>uence upon the drop-size than in the case SLG.     It is generally
su<U+FB02>icient in the former case that the average value of gt should be con
stant.    This is especially the case where the drops are formed from a tube
 (as the end of a siphon), and not from a convex solid.         The reason is
obviously    that in the former  case the thickness of the residual <U+FB01>lm, upon
which we have found the size to depend, is at all rates inde<U+FB01>nitely great,
while in the latter case it depends upon the rate of supply.

  The main results with regard to drops may                      be collected        into the follow
ing laws :
                                                 SLG.
   Law 1.—Tbe drop-size depends upon the rate of dropping.        Generally,
the quicker the succession of the drops, the greater    the drop; the slower is
the rate, the more strictly     this the case.
                                         is      This law depends upon the
diiference, at di<U+FB01>'erent rates, of the thickness of the <U+FB01>lm from which the
drop falls.
   Law 2.——The drop-size depends upon the nature and quantity of the
solid which the dropping liquid holds in solution.      If the liquid stands in
no chemical relation to the solid, in general the drop-size diminishes as
the quantity of solid contained in the liquid increases.     The cause of this
seems  to be that  the stubborn cohesion of the  liquid     diminished   by the
                                                                              is
solid in solution.    Where one or more combinations between the liquid
                                                                                                    '
and solid are possible, the drop-size depends upon indeterminate data.
   Law 3.——The drop-size depends upon the chemical nature of the drop
ping liquid, and little or nothing upon its density.   Of all liquids exa
mined, water has the greatest, and acetic acid the least drop-size.
   Law 4.-—The drop-size, depends upon the geometric relation between
the solid and the liquid. If the solid be spherical, the largest drops fall
from the largest    spheres.    Absolute di<U+FB01>"erence in radii takes    greater             a
effect upon drops formed from smaller than upon those formed from
larger spheres.    Of circular horizontal planes, within certain limits, the
 size of the drop varies directly with the size of the plane.
   Law 5.——The drop-size depends upon the chemical nature of the solid
from which the drop falls, and little or nothing upon its density. Of all

drops.
   Law 6.-— The drop-size depends upon temperature; generally, the higher
the temperature the smaller the drop. With water, the e<U+FB01>'ect of a change
of temperature of 20° C. about 30° C. is very small.

  IV. “   On the Chemical Constitution of Reichenbach’s Creosote.”—
        Preliminary Notice.        By Huoo MiiL1.Ea, Ph.D. Communicated
        by WARREN Dr: LA RUE, F.R.S.              Received October 1, 1864.
     This  substance,  which has been discovered by Reichenbach amongst the
  products of destructive distillation of wood, has been repeatedly the sub
 ject of chemical investigation, but owing to the difficulty attending its puri
 <U+FB01>cation, the chemical nature of creosote remained doubtful until 1858, when
  Hlasiwetz published his elaborate research on this subject.
    Up to that time Reichenbach’s       creosote was frequently confounded with
 phenol (phenylic     alcohol, carbolic  acid) ; and, indeed, the latter had very
 nearly supplanted the true creosote in its application. Hlasiwetz <U+FB01>rst prepared
 the creosote in a chemically pure state, and ascertained its chemical formula
 to be Gs H10 92, and showed that this substance, although having some cha
 racteristic properties in common with phenol, was a distinct chemical
 substance, and otherwise in no way related to this body.
    At the time of publication of Hlasiwetz’s memoir I was myself engaged
 with the investigation of creosote prepared from wood-tar ; and such results
 as  I  had then arrived at completely coincided with those obtained by

    Having    a considerable quantity of pure material at my disposal,         I took
 up this subject again, with the view of obtaining some insight into the
 chemical constitution of creosote, and     I think I am now able to lay before
 the Society a few results which may serve as a contribution            towards the
 solution of the questions at issue.                                           ,          ,
    I will reserve  a full description of my experiments for     a future occasion,
 and con<U+FB01>ne myself in this communication merely to the description of one
reaction, which I consider best calculated to illustrate the results I have              ;
obtained.
    When pure creosote, boiling constantly (in hydrogen) at 21 9°C., is brought
into contact with concentrated hydriodic acid and heated to boiling, it is
acted upon, iodine is set free, and iodide of methyl distils over.            As the
free iodine interferes with the result   of the reaction, I varied  the experiment
by substituting iodide of phosphorus for hydriodic          acid, in the following
manner : the creosote is shaken up with a small quantity of water, of which            I
                                                                                       1
it dissolves a certain portion, then ordinary phosphorus is introduced, and
the whole gently warmed.         The iodine is now added in small quantities at
a time, care being taken that there is always an excess of phosphorus after
the iodine has been converted into iodide of phosphorus.           If the tempera
ture is now gradually raised to about 95° C., the reaction makes itself
manifest by the evolution of vapour of iodide of methyl, which distils                l
over, and which is condensed in an ice refrigerator.              As soon as the
reaction diminishes, fresh portions of phosphorus and iodine are added, and
the experiment so continued until the substance in the retort              becomes
 gradually thicker and thicker, and viscid if allowed to cool.

   The distillate collected in the receiver consists mainly of iodide of methyl
mixed with some unaltered        creosote, from which it is readily liberated by
distillation, and agitation with a solution of caustic alkali.
   The residue contained in the retort, on being mixed with water, now readily
dissolves, with the exception of a small quantity of a heavy brown oil which
contains unaltered creosote.        The_aqueous solution is mixed with a large

   I am still engaged with the determination of the composition of the latter
substance; but, from its chemical nature, so far as I have made myself ac
quainted    with   it,   and from         other considerations,   I   think   it   more than
probable that this substance bears the closest analogy to oxyphenic acid

ings, June 16, 1864), naturally suggested the investigation of analogously
constituted bodies in a similar direction.             My attention has in the <U+FB01>rst
place been directed to       the  study  of  a compound which, from its mode of
formation, ought to be designated as toluidine-blue.
    When a salt of rosaniline (the acetate for instance) is heated with double
its weight of toluidine, phenomena present themselves which are similar to
those observed in the analogous experiment with aniline.              In the course of
a few hours the rosaniline passes through          all the different shades     of violet,
and is ultimately      converted into a dark lustrous        mass, which dissolves in
 alcohol with      a deep indigo-blue   colour.    This substance is the acetate of
 tritolylrosaniline.      By treatment with alcoholic ammonia, and subsequently
 addition of water to the solution, the free base is easily obtained, from
 which the several salts may be prepared by the usual processes.                   I have
 examined only one of these salts, viz. the hydrochlorate.                    Repeatedly
 crystallized from boiling alcohol, this salt is obtained in small blue crystals
 insoluble in water, which at 100° C. contain

     I have   not examined in detail the properties of this new series of colour
 ing matters.       Generally speaking they are more soluble than the corre
 sponding phenyl-compounds,          and therefore less easily obtained in a state         -'
 of purity.
     When one of these salts (the        acetate  for instance) is submitted to dry
 distillation,   water and acetic acid are evolved in the <U+FB01>rst place; then follow
 oily products, which, as the temperature rises, become more and more viscid
  and ultimately solidify into crystalline masses, ammonia being abundantly
 evolved during the latter stages of the process.            Unless the operation has
 been    carried out on rather a large scale, a comparatively small amount of              41
  a light porous charcoal remains in the retort.          The oily distillate contains
  several bases.      Those boiling at a low temperature are almost exclusively
  aniline and a little toluidine.    The principal portion of the products boiling
 at a higher temperature is a beautifully crystallized base which is easily
  puri<U+FB01>ed.       By pouring cold spirit upon the interwoven crystals, a brown
  mother liquor containing other bases is readily separated; the residuary
  substance has only to be crystallized from boiling alcohol in order to pro
  cure a compound of perfect purity.
     The chemical deportment of the new substance is very similar              to that of
  diphenylamine.        Like the latter it unites with acids, forming salts of        very

green, but nevertheless so similar to the analogous colour-reaction          of
diphenylamine,    that by this test alone the two substances could not pos
sibly be distinguished.    The two bases ditfer, however, essentially in their
solubility, their fusing- and boiling-points, and lastly in their composition.
The new    base is far less soluble in alcohol than diphenylamine;  it fuses
only  at  87°  C., while  the fusing-point of  diphenylamine is 45° C.;  the
boiling-point of the new base is 334‘5° C. (corr.), at which temperature

        have done so in the hope of gaining additional data for the investigation of
        the remarkable colouring matters from which these bases are derived.
        Both constitution and mode of formation of these colouring matters are             J.
        still involved in darkness.   Theory, as it often happens, has not kept pace
        with practice.    The anticipation I expressed in a former note, that the
        study   of  the behaviour  of the colouring matters under the in<U+FB02>uence of
        chemical agents might disclose their true nature, has only very partially
        been realized.    Up to the present moment, chemists have not succeeded in
        giving a satisfactory account either of the atomic construction of these
        compounds. or of the mechanism of their formation; and it would there
i
        fore scarcely be worth while to return to this question before its de<U+FB01>nite
        solution, unless the publication of erroneous statements by M. Schi<U+FB02>' had
        threatened to divert the researches of chemists from this subject.
         '
           According to M. Schi<U+FB02>' *, the transformation of aniline into aniline-red by
        means of stannic chloride is represented by the equation
               20C6 H7     N +10 Sn Cl,=3(C,o Hlg N3, HCl)+ 6(C6    H1   N, HCl)+
                     H4   NCl+ 10 Sn Cl+4 C8 H7 N.
          The formation by         of mercuric nitrate'|" by the equation
                                  means
          20CB     H7 N + 20 HgNO,=3(C,,, H,, N,, HNO,)+ 6(C6 H, N, HNOS) +
                     H4 N, NO,+ l0Hg, NO,+4CG H, N.
          The latter process is accomplished at as low a temperature as 80° C.,
        and, according to M. Schi<U+FB02>', is so elegant that he was enabled to make
                                   “ Within a few hundredths,” he          “ we
        quantitative experiments.                                    says,
        have obtained the requisite quantities of the sought-for materials.”
          M. Schi<U+FB01>"s equations are not conspicuous for elegance and simplicity,
        but they are absolutely inadmissible for other reasons. These equations
    .   utterly ignore the very essence of the process. I have pointed out, some
        time ago, that the formation of rosaniline involves the presence of both
        aniline and toluidine.  Pure aniline furnishes no rosaniline, nor can this
        body be procured from pure toluidine.      This fact I have since further
        established by many varied experiments, both on the small and on the
        large scale. The formation of rosaniline thus becomes the means of
        ascertaining rapidly the presence of toluidine. The amount of the latter

in crude aniline* may become so minute that its presence can no longer
be traced by distillation, or by conversion into oxalates.     It may be
recognized, however, with the utmost facility by submitting the mixture to
the action of either corrosive sublimate or arsenic acid; on application of
a gentle heat the crimson colour is immediately              produced.
     In the equations proposed by M. Schi<U+FB02>' there <U+FB01>gures, moreover, ammonia
as an essential term.   The existence of ammoniacal salts in the crude
rosaniline was pointed out  some time ago by Prof. Bolley.      But this am
monia (which, as      I
                    have satis<U+FB01>ed myself, is scarcely ever absent)   accord        is,
ing to my opinion, not an essential product of the reaction that gives
to the formation of aniline-red.    have established by special and careful
                                        I
experiments that appropriate treatment of     mixture of aniline and tolui

producing very considerable quantities of rosaniline without elimination .of
more than    trace of ammonia.
             a                  The ammonia generally observed belongs
to   different phase of the reaction, being more especially due to the
     a
almost invariable production of small quantity of aniline-blue.
                                       a
     If
     we wished, even now, to represent in formulae the relation between
rosaniline and the substances‘ which give rise to its formation, the equation
                          06   H,N+2C.,H,,N=C20        H19   N3+6H
might     be looked   upon      as an expression closely approaching     truth. The
hydrogen  <U+FB01>guring in this equation             is   eliminated in the form of water,
hydrochloric, hydrobromic, hydriodic acids, &c.
  But even this equation gives no account of the mechanism of this re
markable process; indeed we cannot hope for the solution of this chemical
problem before we shall have succeeded in splitting up the molecule of
rosaniline into the atomic groups which enter into its composition.                      It   is
true its transformation into aniline- or toluidine-blue, as well as into the
              which are generated

prove even now  that the rosaniline-molecule  still contains three atoms of
typical hydrogen, and hence that the complex atom C,0 H,8 functions in
this triamine with the value of six atoms of hydrogen; but this indeed
is the limit of the experimental evidence as yet obtained.
   With regard to the number and nature of the simpler, radicals into which
the carbon and hydrogen atoms of the complex atom C20 H“, are grouped,
we can only speculate. Derived from the radicals phenyl, H5, and-tolyl;  C6
C, H.,, under the in<U+FB02>uence of dehydrogenating                agents, this complex atom
   * Aniline obtained by distillation with potash from certain varieties of indigo,
is apt when treated with corrosive sublimate, to furnish traces of rosaniline.            I
infer from this result that aniline thus produced contains     small proportion of
                                                                  a
toluidine. The formation of this substance from indigo would be as readily
intelligible as the conversion under certain condition of indigo into salicylic acid,
a fact established by Cahours’s observations.
   Aniline prepared from crystallized isatin does not yield trace of rosaniline.

by  Dr. Hugo  Muller, and communicated to me by my friend while these
pages are passing   through the press, may possibly assist in further eluci
dating   the nature  of this class of bodies. Dr. Muller has found that
rosaniline and its coloured derivatives are instantaneously decolorized by
cyanide of potassium, a series of splendidly crystallized, perfectly colourless
bases being produced.    The composition of these bodies, which will pro
bably be found analogous to a substance similarly obtained from harmaline
by Fritzsche,     remains to be established.

      The author commences by showing the importance of bringing analysis
  by the prism to bear upon the remarkable class of bodies known as nebulae,
  especially since the results obtained by the largest telescopes hitherto con
  structed appear to show that increase of optical power alone would prpbably
  fail to determine the question whether all the nebulae are clusters of stars
  too remote to be separately visible.
      The little indication of resolvability, the absence of central condensation,
  the greenish-blue colour, and the intrinsic brightness characterizing many
  of the nebulae classed by Sir W. Herschel as planetary, induced the author
  to select chie<U+FB02>y nebulae of this class for prismatic observation.
      The apparatus employed is that of which a description is given in the
  paper,   “On the Spectra of some of the Fixed Stars,” by the author and
  Dr. W. A. Miller, to which this is a supplement.

  of di<U+FB01>'erent refrangibilities, and does not therefore form a continuous
  spectrum.       It consists of light of three de<U+FB01>nite refrangibilities only, and,
  after passing through the prisms, remains concentrated in three bright lines.
      The strongest of these occupies a position in the spectrum about mid

observation, to be coincident with the brightest of the lines of nitrogen.
   A little more refrangible, a second line is seen. At about three times the
distance of the second line, a third, very faint line occurs; this coincides
in position with Fraunhofer’s F, and one of the lines of hydrogen.   Besides
the three bright lines, an exceedingly faint continuous spectrum of the cen

Vulpecula 4532, 27 M., gave spectra identical with the spectrum of 37
H. IV.,  except that in the case of some of these the strongest only of the
three bright lines was seen.
  It   is obvious that these nebula: can no longer be regarded as clusters of
stars.    In place of an incandescent solid or liquid body transmitting light
of all refrangibilities through   an atmosphere   which intercepts by absorption
some of them, such as our sun and the <U+FB01>xed stars appear to be, these
nebulae, or at least their photosurfaces, must be regarded as enormous
masses   of luminous   gas or vapour.
   On this supposition the absence of central condensation admits of ex
planation; for even if the whole mass of the gas is luminous, the light
emitted by the portion of gas beyond the surface visible to us would be in
great measure absorbed by the portion of gas through which it would have
to pass, and for this reason there would be presented a luminous surface
only.   The small brilliancy of the nebulae, notwithstanding the considerable
angle which in most cases they subtend, is in accordance with.the very
inferior splendour of glowing gas as compared with incandescent solid or
liquid matter.
   The extreme simplicity of constitution         which the three bright lines
suggest, whether   or not we regard them as indicating the presence of
nitrogen, hydrogen, and a substance unknown, is opposed to the opinion
that they are clusters of stars.

  In the spectrum of 31 M., the nebulae in Andromeda, and in that of the
companion nebula,‘32 M., the red and part of the orange are wanting.

  The <U+FB01>rst Report of the Scienti<U+FB01>c Relief Committee               was   read to the
Meeting by the Treasurer, as follows :
  “ In presenting this, the <U+FB01>rstReport of the proceedings of the Royal Society
Relief Fund Committee, it may be advisable very brie<U+FB02>y to explain the
circumstances under which the Fund originated, as well as the distribution
of the Income arising therefrom.
   “ On the 26th of May, 1859, a statement was presented to the Council,

496                            Anniversary Meeting.                  [Nov. 30,
intimating      a desire on the part    of several of the Fellows of the Royal
Society, to promote the establishment of a permanent fund for the aid         of
such scienti<U+FB01>c men, or     their families, as may from time to time require and
deserve     assistance.  A  scheme   having been suggested, it was after some
modi<U+FB01>cation approved, and adopted by the Council of the Royal Society,
and copies thereof were forwarded to the Fellows of the Chartered So
cieties.
    “  It formed no part of the scheme to attempt the grant of annuities; it
was rather intended to afford prompt relief of the immediate wants of
those upon whom sudden a<U+FB01>iction had fallen; although at the same time,
it in no way debarred a continuation of such relief being given should the
funds admit thereof.
    “ The Committee, as originally named by Council Minutes of 22nd
December, 1859, consisted of Mr. Busk, Dr. W. A. Miller, Mr. Wheatstone,
Dr. Tyndall, and Mr. Gassiot. Subsequently Dr. Carpenter, Mr. Sylvester,
and Mr. Huxley were appointed to succeed those Members who retired
by rotation; and this year Dr. Miller and Mr. Gassiot will also retire;
it being     a regulation that no member can remain for a longer period than
<U+FB01>ve consecutive years on the Committee.
    -‘
       The <U+FB01>rst Meeting took place on the 19th March 1860, Mr. Wheatstone
in the Chair. At this time £3204 148. had been received, and invested in
 £3351 7s. 6d. New 3 per Cents.          In 1860 there was only one applicant
 for relief; a sum was voted, but in consequence of the applicants sudden
 decease, the cheque was subsequently returned to the Treasurer and
 cancelled.
    “ In 1861 there were six applicants, to <U+FB01>ve of whom relief was afforded.     ,
    “  In  1862 there were four applicants, of whom three were relieved.
    “In    1863 there were <U+FB01>ve applicants, of whom four were relieved.
    “ In 1864 there were two applicants-—both were relieved.
    “ The total amount thus expended has been £460 ; and there still remains
 £233 1s. 11d. applicable for relief, exclusive of £17 2s., subscriptions to
be invested.
    “ The amount of the Fund, as invested, consists of £5300 New 3
                                                                       per cent.
 Consols, every shilling (With the above exception of £17 2s.) which has
 been received having been invested, without any deduction for expenses;
 the economical principle on which this Fund was originally founded has
 been thus strictly carried out.        The Council of the Royal Society grants
the use of a room, as well as the little stationery that is from time to time
required, and permits the Assistant-Secretary to summon a meeting of the
Members as soon as any application for relief is received.          One of the
members of the Committee undertakes the duties of a Secretary, and in
this simple manner all expense is avoided, while the relief, if granted, is
immediate. The amount at disposal for distribution is necessarily limited
 to the accumulation of interest, the gross amount of subscriptions being
                   '                                                        ‘

     “ Thepeculiar and distinctive character of the Royal Society Relief
Fund    is,
         that although relief has invariably been granted with the greatest
promptitude, the claims have nevertheless been most carefully examined
by those whose pursuits in life enable them to form the most correct con
clusion aa to the character of the claimant. The Committee can most con
scientiously state that, in no instance, has any applicant having the slightest
claim on the Fund been refused assistance.        Sometimes the payments to
recipients have been the <U+FB01>rst information they have received of such       fund    a
being in existence; the Committee may have on some occasions regretted
that   ithad not    larger sum at command, but the relief, whatever its
                                                                                                  T6’a5lU‘L’1'.

                         is
to meet any sudden emergency that may arise; at this time there appears
a balance somewhat larger than usual, but this arises from there having
been only two applicants this year instead of <U+FB01>ve, as in 1863.     very       It   is
                                                                                              '

     The PRESIDENT then           addressed   the Society as follows :—
      Gnxrnnmm,
WHEN   I   had the honour of addressing you at the Anniversary Meeting
in 1862, informed you of the steps which had been taken by the
            I
Council towards the formation of an Index to the Scienti<U+FB01>c Periodical
Literature of the Nineteenth Century, or, more precisely,        Cataloguea
of the Titles of Scienti<U+FB01>c Memoirs contained in the Scienti<U+FB01>c Perio
dicals, in all languages, from the commencement of the present century"
to the year 1860. The preparation of this work has progressed steadily                   ;
and, so far as regards     Manuscript Catalogue to be kept in our own
                              a
library for the use of the Fellows generally,      may be considered to be
                                                        it
very nearly complete.    The  limit in point of time to which the entries of
the Titles should be restricted has been extended to 1863 inclusive.      A
circular which has been addressed by the Foreign Secretary to seventy

 Academies with which the Royal Society is more or less in communi
 cation, as .well as to several other institutions and individuals, to ascer
 tain whether they possessed any works suitable for cataloguing which
 were not in our library (enclosing at the same time a list of the works
  already indexed), has been largely replied to; and we have thus been
  enabled to considerably extend our Catalogue.       The number of titles
 which it at present includes exceeds 180,000, entered in manuscript
 volumes, available for reference in our library.     Our communications
 have been responded to in several instances with offers of assistance, and
 in general with strong expressions of interest in the progress of the
 work, and of anticipated advantage from its publication.
     After a. full consideration of the different modes in which such a
 publication might be effected, the Council decided that the manuscript
  should in the <U+FB01>rst instance be offered to Her Majesty’s Government,
 to be printed at the public charge, at Her Majesty’s Stationery O<U+FB02>ice
 or otherwise, as might be deemed expedient; and that a. certain number
 -of copies should be presented to Scienti<U+FB01>c Institutions at home and
  abroad, in the name of the British Government and of the Royal
  Society; the remainder of the impression being offered for sale at the
 cost_of paper and printing only, and the proceeds applied towards the
  discharge of the expense incurred in the printing, no pecuniary return
 being looked for on the part of the Society.
     The Council have availed themselves of the good o<U+FB02>ices of a. valued
 Fellow of the Society, Sir Henry Holland, who had been a member of
 the Council whilst the Catalogue was in progress, to bring the subject
 of the publication under the consideration of Her Majesty’s Govern
ment, whose favourable reply has been this morning received.
     From the best judgment which the Council can form, there is reason
 to believe that by the time the Government may be ready to commence
 the printing, the Catalogue will have been completed withiall the titles
 that can be obtained. The manuscript, as at present prepared, contains
 the Titles in the order in which they stand in each of the periodical
works indexed; but for publication it will be arranged according to
authors’ names, and be followed by an Alphabetical Index according
to subjects.      The expense hitherto incurred by the Society in its
preparation amounts to about £1400; and possibly £300 or £400 more
will be required in the preparation of the Index of Subjects, and in the
general revision of the press.
    It is with great satisfaction that we see the value and importance of
the Philosophical Transactions recognized increasingly from year to
year both at home and abroad. Besides the contributions from our
own members and countrymen in the past year, to some of which              I
may brie<U+FB02>y advert in the sequel, we have received a. very valuable
paper from Professor George Forchhammer, of Copenhagen, to a brief

1864-.]                         President’: Address.                            499
notice of which, as being presented to us from abroad,            I
                                                             will give the
<U+FB01>rst place.
   This communication forms a valuable contribution to a great subject
—-the history of the Sea.     It contains a full and compendious inquiry
into the constituents of the water of the ocean, divided into seventeen
geographical regions, each of which is studied separately from samples
taken both at the surface and at various depths. An accurate view is
thus          for the <U+FB01>rst time of the sea as a whole, and conclusions of
great generality are obtained.      The minute analytical processes fol
lowed in several hundred analyses were so conducted as, in the opinion
                                                                                       .l.1‘6‘G$lU'€7'~
of competent judges, to inspire entire con<U+FB01>dence. They con<U+FB01>rm the
presence in sea-water of the twenty-<U+FB01>ve        elements already reported
by other chemists, and add two others, boron and aluminium, to the
number.     But it is chie<U+FB02>y by the application of the data thus obtained
to the elucidation of various geographical problems of great and general
interest that we are led to recognize the full importance of this memoir.
I  may permit myself to notice one or two of the most remarkable of the
conclusions established by it.
   In the Atlantic the saline ingredients in the sea-water (the samples
being taken at proper distances from the land) decrease with increasing
depth. This is found to hold good even to extreme depths. The exist
ence of a Polar current in the depths of the Atlantic is hence inferred,
since it is a well-established fact that the equatorial seas are richer,
and the polar seas poorer, in saline ingredients.
   The large amount of saline contents found by analysis of the water
of the well-known current <U+FB02>owing from north-east to south-west, be
tween Iceland and the east coast of Greenland, shows it to be, not as
heretofore supposed, a polar current, but one of equatorial origin. The
inference     that
            is,   it   is returning branch of the great Gulf-stream which
                            a
we have recently had reason to recognize as extending to the shores of
 Nova Zembla and to the north coasts of Spitzbergen, carrying to Nova
 Zembla the <U+FB02>oats of the Norwegian <U+FB01>shermen, and to Spitzbergen the
 same <U+FB02>oats, mingled with wood from Siberia.        May    not be possible
                                                             it
 that the “ iceless sea, teeming with animal life,” described by the ad
venturous American explorer Dr. Kane as viewed from the promontory
 which formed the northern limit of his research,      is,
                                                        as he himself sur
 mised, but an extension of the same equatorial stream which produces
 correspondingly abnormal effects at Spitzbergen, as well as at every
 other point to which its course has been traced?
    When physical researches shall be resumed within the circle which
 surrounds the Pole, this perhaps will be one of the earliest problems to
 receive so1ution—a solution rendered now so simple by the method of
 inquiry which Professor Forchhammer has made known to us.
    In   Astronomy the most important results in the year             are   Sir John

 Herschel’s Catalogue of Nebula, which forms Part I. of the Transac
tions for 1864:; and Mr. Huggins‘s application of the spectroscope to
study those mysterious forms, and to examine the chemical constitution
of stars and planets. The nebulae are so widely different from the
other heavenly bodies, that ever since their <U+FB01>rst discovery they have
been objects of wonder and speculation.     For a long time only three or
four of them were known, till about a century ago Messier added about
100 more.     His labours, however, were completely eclipsed by the elder
 Herschel,  who   gave unprecedented power to the telescope, and used it
with skill and sagacity which have never been surpassed. He was
rewarded by discovering 2500 of thee objects, and <U+FB01>nding in them
 varieties of <U+FB01>gure of the most unexpected character.
    After such a harvest it might have been thought that little was left
 to be gleaned in this <U+FB01>eld; but his accomplished son was not less suc
 cessful in the northern hemisphere; and when his zeal and-energy led
 him to the Cape of Good Hope, he found in that almost unexplored
 sky the opportunity of even surpassing his father, and connecting more
 than 1000 other nebulae with his own name.          Since then the great
 Achromatics of Poulkova and Harvard, and the gigantic re<U+FB02>ectors of
 Rosse and Lassell have revealed many strange arrangements in them,
 some of which are scarcely reconcileable with ordinary dynamics; and
 it is evident that the study of their nature is likely to occupy much of
 the attention of astronomers for years to come.
    At such a crisis no more acceptable gift could be made to.Nebular
 Astronomy than a work which should embody in a practical manual the
 sum of our actual knowledge of this department, and do for it what the
 Catalogue of the British Association and others are performing for the
 stellar branch.   And none was so <U+FB01>t for this task as Sir John Herschel
 himself.   Besides his own unequalled familiarity with the subject, and
 thorough cognizance of the labours of others, he had an advantage in his
 acquaintance with his father’s manuscripts and the labours of his aunt, a
 person not less an honour to her name, such as none other could possess.
 And yet more, he had an interest in this pursuit such as can be ex
pected in very few, but without which the labour that must have been
expended on this catalogue would have been insupportable.      It contains,
 arranged in Bight Ascension, the places of 5079 nebulae for 1860 with
the precessions so chosen that they will be available for at least sixty
years to come. Each nebula has its discoverer indicated, the number
of observations, and a description of its form and character, composed
of a very few letters, but to any one who will learn their symbolic mean
ing, of marvellous fullness and precision.  Oopious notes and references,
and an introduction which gives full historical information, complete all
that can be required by observers.
    And that observers will be numerous as soon as Mr. Huggins’s re
 searches become generally known, must be anticipated.        At our last

the spectra of the <U+FB01>xed stars ; their results have appeared in our Trans
actions for this year, and can scarcely be estimated too highly. Be
fore them Fraunhofer, and recently Donati, Secehi and some others had
examined a few stellar spectra with more or less success ; but with in
ferior apparatus, and far less extensively.       Their superiority is mainly
 due to their referring the spectral lines to no more instrumental scale
 (which, from the inevitable variations of the spectroscope-prisms, must
 be liable to error), but to standard spectra of known elements which are
 formed in juxtaposition with that to be examined, and to which its lines
 can be compared with extreme precision.        As the stars are but points
                                                                                 reasurer.
 in a good telescope, it is necessary to expand these images into lines
 that the details of their spectra may be perceptible.    This weakens their     1
 light, already feeble; and therefore the telescope to which the spectro
 seope is applied must be of considerable power; in this instance it has
 8 inches aperture. They have examined more than <U+FB01>fty stars, and <U+FB01>nd
 all to have a constitution analogous to that of our own sun, and like
 it to show the presence of several terrestrial elements.
     The lines due to sodium seem universal ; so also those of magnesium
 and iron. Hydrogen is also frequent; in two stars it is wanting.         The
 absence of nitrogen from all is very singular, unless it be present under
 conditions which alter its relation to light. It is to be regretted that
 the spectra were not compared with nickel, chromium, and the other
 elements that have been found in aerolites; this, however, we hope
 will be done for those elements, and indeed for all the other terrestrial
 ones. The explanation given of the dilferent colou.rs of the stars is
 doubtless the true one; it arises from the existence of different bands
 of absorption in particular parts of the spectrum. Thus in the beau
  tiful star [3 Cygni, these bands are crowded in the blue end of the
  spectrum of the orange star, and in the red end of that of the blue
  star.   Possibly further investigation of elements may enable us to
  conjecture why in dichromic double stars the small one is always blue
  or green. In the planets a. closer conformity to the spectrum of the
 sun, by whose light they shine, might be expected-—and is found.          In
 the moon there are      no  lines  whatever  due  to an atmosphere,   nor  in
  Venus.    In Jupiter and Saturn, besides the solar lines, there are some
_identical  with those produced by our own atmosphere, and one which
  must be due to the presence of some peculiar gas or vapour.         Mars is
  still more peculiar; but the appearances give no countenance to the
  notion that his red colour is due to the chemical composition of his soil.
  Mr. Huggins has gone yet further and attacked the nebulze, though
  their extreme faintness might seem to elude all the power of the spectro
  scope.   The result is at once a strong proof of the soundness of Ba.con’s
                                “ Fiat
  precept in doubtful cases,           experimentum,” and a demolition of
  more than one accepted hypothesis.      The notion of the elder Herschel,

  that these strange bodies were masses of vapour, gradually condensing
  by radiation of heat and the action of gravity, and that (according to
  Laplace) in condensing they threw of rings which shrunk up into planets,
  satellites, and comets, was long in favour with Cosmogonists.             Lord
  Rosse’s discovery, that many of them which were cited as evidences of
  this, were in truth mere clusters of stars; that many more, though not
  totally resolvable, were yet dotted over with lucid points, produced a re
  action which led to doubt the existence of any but stellar materials in
  the remote heavens.      But here we have a totally different view opened.
  Mr. Huggins began      with  the planetary nebula, so called from present
 ing well-de<U+FB01>ned luminous disks (which, however, Lord Bosse has found
  in all that he examined to be complicated ring and spiral formations).
  To Mr. Huggins’s great surprise he found them to be totally different
 from the stars; instead of continuous spectra interrupted by a multi
 tude of dark lines, he found (which made it possible to observe them at
 all) that their light consisted entirely of three bright lines; the faintest
 indicating the presence of hydrogen, the next some unknown element,
 and the third a line which coincides with the brightest of nitrogen, but
 which he hesitates to refer to that body because no others of its bright
 lines are present.     In some of them a very faint star-spectrum is also
 visible, due of course to the small stars which are found in many ne
 bulae, often in such numbers that their presence can scarcely be merely
  optical.   Some nebulaa, and all the clusters which in ordinary telescopes
 look like them, do not show the distinctive three lines, but merely star
                                                         “
 spectra. The importance of this new view, this new Explorator Abyssi,”
 toborrow a phrase of Hooke, cannot be rated too highly; and youwill           I
 am sure join me in expressing our hopes that these gentlemen will press
 onward in the bright path which they have opened, and perhaps with
 even higher instrumental powers.
    One who has not taken part in this kind of observation must speak
 with reserve; but    I  cannot refrain from expressing a wish that their
 telescope were of much greater aperture—as two or three feet. The
 object of the telescope is in this case more concentration of light, and it
will probably be attained without anything of that perfect <U+FB01>nish which
is required for exact de<U+FB01>nition.     If so, a mirror of silver-ed glass, or even
copper, and of comparatively short focus, or one of Fresnel’s Light
house lenses, might be a powerful auxiliary.

    The remarks which ventured to make in my Address at the last
Anniversary, on the expediency of combining Pendulum Experiments
with the Astronomical and Geodesical operations of the Great Indian
Arc, have given occasion to a correspondence between Colonel Walker,
the Superintendent of the Indian Trigonometrical Survey, and myself,

 of the Royal Society conversant with such subjects, written in reply to

for a loan of two of the pendulums which had been previously employed
in similar experiments, with their attendant clock, has been acceded to;
and a Vacuum Apparatus convenient for transport, in which the pendu

Kew Observatory.      Captain Basevi, of the Royal Engineers, appointed
to conduct the experiments in India, has resided for some weeks at Kew

pendulums on their return from India at the close of the operations ; and
will, moreover, supply a convenient locality for future occasions of a
similar kind, as well as for the comparison of the pendulums of other
countries.   We may not unreasonably anticipate that such experiments
may henceforward be regarded as an appropriate accompaniment to the
measurement of arcs in all parts of the globe.
    I
   am glad to be able to add that Colonel Walker has also directed
that the Indian Survey should be provided with instruments for deter
mining the absolute values of the three magnetic elements at the Indian
stations.   We may thus hope to obtain a further investigation of the
(apparent) systematic anomaly in the direction of the lines of magnetic
force in the central parts of India, which is so remarkable a feature in
the admirable magnetic survey of that portion of the British dominions
executed by the Messrs. de Schlagintweit.
  Whilst on the subject of terrestrial magnetism,   I may be permitted
                                                                            '

                                                            have called
the attention of the Society to a very remarkable feature, made known
by the comparison of the disturbances of the magnetic declination in
England, and at stations nearly in the same latitude in the eastern parts
of Asia. The days in which such phenomena occur are almost without
exception the same in both localities; the hours (of absolute time) at
which the maxima and minima of disturbances characterized by a com
mon type take place are, within very small limits, also the same; but
the direction in which the magnet is at the same moment de<U+FB02>ected in
these otherwise most accordant phenomena is systematically opposite in
England and in eastern Siberia.    I  attach of course far more import
ance to the fact itself than to the hypothesis which guided me to its
anticipation, and thence to its discovery; still, an hypothesis which has

itself to some consideration; whilst no one can doubt that a knowledge
of the fact itself strengthens the desire for the multiplication of station
in distant parts of the globe, at which these phenomena are systematic
ally observed; and inthis view the Society will hear with pleasure tha
by intelligence very recently received, we learn that the authorities i
the colonies of Mauritius and Victoria have decided on the establishmen
of magnetical observatories supported by colonial funds, to be equippe
with similar instruments to those at Kew, and to be conducted on th
system which is there exempli<U+FB01>ed.               We are led in these two instance
to recognize the advantage which a colony derives from having a Go
vernor whose education has <U+FB01>tted him to appreciate the importance 
 cultivating the physical sciences.
    We have learnt with satisfaction from Stockholm that the Swedis
 Expedition to Spitzbergen has returned from the second year of
 survey preliminary to the measurement of an arc of the meridian
 and that the result has been that no doubt is entertained of the prac
 ticability of the measurement of an arc of at least 3°, with a possibilit
 of further extension.         The report of the completion of the preliminar
 survey is be published in the early part of the winter; and the summe
 of 1865 is looked forward to for the commencement of the are itself.
     In Meteorology, we        have,  in the 2nd Part of the Philosophical Tran
 actions for 1863, the <U+FB01>rst of a series of papers by Dr. Hermann d
 Schlagintweit on the “Numerical Elements of Indian Meteorology,”
 based on observations made chie<U+FB02>y by officers in the late East Indi
 Oompany’s Service at 207 stations, the original records of which wer
 placed by the Indian Government in the author’s hands for reductio
 and coordination.         The present paper discusses the temperatures an
 the isothermal lines over India, both for the entire year and for eac
 of the meteorological seasons. The differences between the forms 
 the isothermals in the different seasons are excessive, and full of in
 struction to climatologists who will study their causes.                 For the fu
 elucidation of the subject, however, we must await a similar coordina

  I proceed to announce the awards which the Council has made of the
Medals in the present year; and to state the grounds on which those
awards have been made.
   The Copley Medal has been awarded to Charles Darwin, Fsq., F.R.S.,
for his important researches in Geology, Zoology, and Botanical Phy
siology.
   In 1832 Captain FitzRoy, commissioned by the Admiralty to pro
ceed in command of the ‘Beagle,’ on a Voyage of Survey to the
Southern Hemisphere, liberally offered, in the interest of science, to
give up half his cabin to any quali<U+FB01>ed naturalist who would volunteer
to serve on the Expedition, no remuneration being attached to the duty.
                                                                              T€a8lM'M'
Mr. Charles Darwin, then a ripe student at Cambridge, ardently devoted
to the study of natural history, having heard of the offer, like Sir Joseph
                                                                              1
Banks, in the earlier of Cook's Voyages, eagerly came forward as a
volunteer.    The voyage of the ‘ Beagle’ extended over the consecutive
years from 1882 to 1836, and embraced regions presenting such fertile
<U+FB01>elds for research in the Volcanic, Coral, and other Islands of the Atlan
tic and Paci<U+FB01>c Oceans, that the results of his observations actively occu
 pied, after his return, ten years of Mr. Darwin’s time in publication;
and have since mainly suggested and determined the most prominent
 of his latest labours. His scienti<U+FB01>c works and memoirs have included
 a very wide range of subjects, which may be classi<U+FB01>ed under the heads
 of Geology, Zoology, Physiological Botany, Physical Geography, and
 Genetic Biology, each of which he has enriched with important original
 contributions.    The award of the Copley Medal has been founded
 on Mr. Darwin’s researches in the three <U+FB01>rst-named branches of                 ‘Q
 science.
   Geolo_qy.—Mr. Darwin has been preeminently successful in the solu
tion of a great problem in physical geography, and in applying it to the
explanation of geological phenomena, by his important work on the
 Structure and Distribution of Coral Reefs, which appeared in 1842.
 The successive voyages of many eminent navigators had shown that
 vast tracts in the deepest parts of the Paci<U+FB01>c and Indian Oceans were
 studded with circular groups of Coral Islets enclosing lagoons ; and that
 long detached reefs of the same formation <U+FB02>anked lines of coast in a
 nearly unbroken stretch of about 1000 miles. The reefs and islands
 have been carefully mapped and surveyed;        and the different forms
 exhibited by   them  had been accurately classi<U+FB01>ed under the names of
 “ Atoll Islands,” “
                     Encircling Reefs," “ Barrier Reefs,” and “ Fringing
 or Shore Reefs.” Eminent naturalists had observed the habits and mode
 of growth of the Zoophytes in the most favourable localities; and the
  comparatively shallow depths at which the reef-building species live
 had been determined.     But no satisfactory explanation of the pheno
 mena was arrived at—why Atolls assumed their peculiar form, and why
  Barrier Reefs included broad lagoon channels between them and the

506                          Anniversary Meeting.                 [Nov. 30,
contiguous coasts. Some explanations were indeed propounded, but
were manifestly inadequate to meet all the conditions.
   The subject was in this state when Mr. Darwin took it up. Com
bining careful observation upon Coral Reefs and Atolls with re<U+FB02>ections
upon the range and distribution of Volcanic Islands, he divided the area
of the Paci<U+FB01>c and Indian Oceans into tracts of elevation and depression.
All the Coral Phenomena of Atolls, Encircling Reefs, and Barrier Reefs
were accounted for upon the supposition of a long-protracted but gra
dual subsidence under the ocean of large areas of land, admitting the
Coral Formation to grow up whilst its foundation sunk down; while
Fringing Reefs were explained as appertaining to areas of elevation
where the land had risen up or was progressively rising.       On this view
the apparently    discordant  facts ranged  themselves in perfect harmony.
Fringing Reefs were thus converted into Barrier Reefs, and Encircling
Reefs into Atolls, “the instant the last particle of land sinks beneath
the ocean.”    Representing on a map the two classes of facts by dif
ferent colours, it was shown that active volcanos are absent in the
region of Atolls and Barrier Reefs, while they abound in areas of Coral
Fringes and of elevation.
   Mr. Darwin’s researches were received by naturalists with -lively
satisfaction as <U+FB01>xing an era in the history of the investigation, and as
contributing one of the most important illustrations which geology had
received since it had been shaped into a science. A <U+FB02>ood of light was
thus thrown upon the ancient calcareous formations which enter so
largely into the composition of the super<U+FB01>cial crust of the earth; and
something like a de<U+FB01>nite idea was arrived at respecting areas of depres
sion and elevation.
   In addition to his researches upon coral reefs, Mr. Darwin has
made    numerous contributions to Geology, both in the descriptive
and theoretical divisions of the science. As belonging to the former
class may be cited his admirable
                                      ‘
                                        Journal of Researches,’ containing
observations on the Geology of the various countries visited during the
                 ‘
voyage of the Beagle ’; notes during a survey of the east and west
coasts of South America, with a transverse section of the Cordilleras
between Valparaiso and Mendoza; Geological observations on South
America, published as a separate work in 1846; Geological observa
tions on the Volcanic Islands visited during the voyage of the ‘Beagle,’
with brief notices of the Geology of Australia, New Zealand, and the
Cape of Good Hope, also published as a separate work; on a remark
able Bar of Sandstone off Pernambueo ; on the Deposits containing
extinct Mammalia in the neighbourhood of the Plata; on the Geology
of the Falkland Isles ; on the Distribution of Erratic Blocks in South
America.
   In theoretical or speculative geology may be cited his memoir on
 the connexion of certain Volcanic Phenomena in South America, and

on the Origin of Saliferous deposits. From the Ossiferous Super<U+FB01>cial

subject of a separate volume by Professor Owen.         In his memoir ‘ On

common earthworm, be furnished a fresh and instructive illustration of

    The present occasion admits of little more than a bare enumeration
of these labours, which are stamped throughout with the impress of the
closest attention to minute details and accuracy of observation, combined
with large powers of generalization.      The Geological Society of London
signalized its estimate of their importance by the award of a Wollaston
Medal.
    Zoolo_qy.—In zoological science Mr. Darwin’s eminent merits were to
some extent acknowledged ten years ago by the award of a Royal Medal.
On that occasion the zoological work that was most particularly dis
tinguished was his Monograph on the Cirripeds, a class of animals whose
life, history, structure, and classi<U+FB01>cation had previously been involved in
the greatest obscurity and confusion.       Notwithstanding the di<U+FB01>iculties
attending the study of these animals, and the extraordinary anomalies
presented in their structure, habits, and a<U+FB02>inities, Mr. Darwin was suc
cessful, as the result of un\vearied labour and patience, and of the
exercise of the most acute and accurate observation, in clearing up all
that was obscure, and in disclosing for the <U+FB01>rst time numerous facts of
the utmost interest and importance.         But since the principal points
contained in this monograph have been already detailed in the Pro
ceedings of the Royal Society on the occasion referred to, it is needless
here to recapitulate them. It will be su<U+FB01>ieient to remark that the just
ness of the estimation then placed upon Mr. Dnrwin’s labours has since
been completely con<U+FB01>rmed by the concurrent voice of all Zoologists, and
that the Monograph on the Cirripeds is universally acknowledged to be
a model of what such a work should be, and as fully entitling its author
to a place inthe foremost rank of zoological observers and authors. His
 labours in the same department were completed by the publication,
 about the same time, of two monographs on the Fossil Cirripeds of
 Great Britain, published by the Palaeontological Society.     This subject,
 which had before received scarcely any attention, and was left in the
 greatest obscurity, is in these monographs treated in the most com
 plete and exhaustive manner; and all itsdi<U+FB02>iculties were removed for
future observers by the lucid and admirable de<U+FB01>nition of the various

parts, and the light thrown upon the structure and relations of the
animals.
    In other departments of zoology Mr. Darwin’s labours, though not
 given in the same complete form as in the Monographs, have been
 numerous     and important. They are distinguished by the same extent
 and variety of knowledge, the same scrupulous <U+FB01>delity, accuracy, and
 minuteness of observation, and by the sagacity with which the most
 important generalizations have been drawn. Amongst these contribu
 tions should more especially be noticed the observations on the distri
                                                      ‘
 bution and habits of the animals described in the Zoology of the Voyage
                                J                       ’
 of the Beagle,’ and in the ‘ ournal of Researches in the course of that
 voyage, in which most interesting and justly popular work we <U+FB01>nd <U+FB01>rst
 distinctly enunciated the important “law of the succession of Types,”
 or the law that existing animals have a close relation with the extinct
 species found in the same regions.          Nor, amongst the many other
weighty    and  interesting  remarks contained  in this volume, should notice
 be omitted of those which have reference to the common assumption
 that the presence of the remains of large animals necessarily implies
that the country inhabited by them must have possessed a luxuriant
 vegetation.     The fallacy of this assumption is plainly shown by Mr.
 Darwin, and the importance of his correction of a prevalent error of
 this kind can hardly be overrated.
     In his most recent work ‘ On the Origin of Species,’ although opinions
 may be divided or undecided with respect to its merits in some respects,
 all will allow that it contains a mass of observation bearing upon the
 habits, structure, a<U+FB02>inities, and distribution of animals, perhaps unri
valled for interest, minuteness, and patience of observation.           Some
 amongst us may perhaps incline to accept the theory indicated by the
title of this work, while others may perhaps incline to refuse, or at least
 to remit it to a future time, when increased knowledge shall afford
stronger grounds for its ultimate acceptance or rejection.          Speaking
genemlly and collectively, we have not included it in our award.         This
on the one hand; on the other hand,          I believe that, both collectively
and individually, we agree in regarding every real bond<U+FB01>de inquiry into
 the truths of nature as in itself essentially legitimate; and we also know    4
that in the history of science it has happened more than once that

    Batu/nical Pkg/siolo_q_1/.—Mlr. Darwin’s <U+FB01>rst botanical work, ‘ On the

the most masterly treatise on any branch of vegetable physiology that
has ever appeared.    The objects which the author had in view in enter
ing on a comprehensive study of the sexual system of Orchidea, were to
show that the contrivanccs by which they are fertilized are as varied
and almost as perfect as any of the most beautiful adaptations of the
animal kingdom, and that these contrivauces have for their main object
the fertilization of one <U+FB02>ower by the pollen of another.     In pursuance
of this object Mr. Darwin set himself to investigate, <U+FB01>rst, the structure
and development of the <U+FB02>ower of living specimens of nearly every British
species; secondly, to observe how impregnation was naturally effected
                                                                                      J.T¢'(l$M7'('7'.
in each; thirdly, to make a similar structural investigation of the prin
cipal exotic forms; and, fourthly, to ascertain by experiment the method
by which these also are in all probability fertilized.   To these investi
gations Mr. Darwin brought all the resources of a most skilful micro
scopic dissector, of an unwearicd and exact observer, of a sagacious
experimentalist fertile in resources, of an entomologist versed in the
structure and habits of insects, and of an excellent judgment in inter
preting obscure phenomena, and drawing from them correct conclusions.
   The result is a work no less remarkable for the novelty of its facts,
and for the importance of their bearing, than for its being the <U+FB01>rst
which correlates the structure with the functions of the <U+FB02>oral organs
of one of the largest and most conspicuous of the families of plants.
It would not be difficult to justify this strong encomium by examples
of great interest taken from the work itself, but it would be incom
patible with the limits of this Address; su<U+FB02>ice it therefore to say, that
the general conclusion to which Mr. Darwin arrives   is,that all the forms,
even the most grotesque, which the <U+FB02>oral organs of Orchids possess, are
directly and obviously of use, and that every structural and physio
logical modi<U+FB01>cation, however minute, tends, with scarcely an exception,
to ensure the fertilization of the ovules of one plant by the pollen of
another.
   Mr. Darwin’s next contribution to physiological botany          entitled
                                                                   is
“ On the two forms, or                         in             of
                         dimorphic condition,     the species    Pri/mula,
and on their remarkable sexual relations.” The phenomenon of there
being two distinct forms of <U+FB02>ower in the genus Primula has long been
familiar to naturalists, but the real nature of the difference between
them, and of their respective functions, had not occurred to anyone.
Mr. Darwin <U+FB01>rst suspected that the relations between the forms might
be sexual, and he has since, with consummate skill, incontrovertibly
proved this to be the case. By most searching examination of vast
                                 a                                          a
number of specimens of each form, in cultivated varieties as well as in_
species, he found that, in all, the two forms presented in their stigmatie
surfaces, ovules, and pollen, constant differences, unbroken by      single
                                                                        a
instance of transition between the distinct forms. By experiments
continued for several years, he proved that in this genus complete fer

tility is only obtained by impregnating   one form by the pollen    of the
other, each species of _P1-imula being divided into two sets or bodies,
which cannot be called distinct sexes, for both are hermaphrodite; yet
they are so in a certain sense, for they require reciprocal union to effect
perfect fertility. This remarkable fact has as yet no known parallel.
The cross impregnation is effected by insects, the structure of insect and
<U+FB02>ower being such that one form cannot by this means he impregnated
either by its own pollen or by that of a {lower of its own form.
   In a. subsequent paper Mr. Darwin has shown that in a species of the
genus Linwm, which is also dimorphic, whilst the pollen in the two forms
is absolutely undistinguishablc microscopically, and the stigmas differ
but slightly and not in any apparently important respect, the pollen of
one form is ineffectual when placed on the stigma of its own <U+FB02>ower, but
acts immediately upon that of the other form.      The generally received
idea that the impregnation of plants may be effected indifferently by
wind or by insects, is shown to be fallacious; plants being structurally
adapted for the one or the other, and not indiiferently for either.
,  He has similarly investigated a still more complicated case in the
common Lg/tkrum salicaria of our ditches, which, as regards its <U+FB02>owers,
is trimorphous, there being three instead of two sexual forms, differing
in the relative lengths of their two series of stamens and of their styles.
In estimating the novelty and value of Mr. Dar-win’s 'botanical dis
coveries, we should not overlook that they have all been obtained by
the study of some of the most familiar and conspicuous of our native
plants, and some of the best-known and easily procured cultivated
exotics.

Esq., F.R.S., for his observations on the Total Eclipse of the Sun in
1860, and for his improvements in Astronomical Photography.
   The advantages which photography affords in the delineation of
celestial objects and phenomena are now generally recognized.       This
art has been already successfully applied to depict the in<U+FB01>nitely diver
si<U+FB01>ed surface of the moon; the sun with its spots and faculae, and those
mysterious appendages which are only to be seen during a total eclipse ;

  Ithas also been employed to measure the apparent distances and
 angles of position of double stars, and to record the time of the sun’s
 passage over the wires of a transit instrument with much greater
 accuracy than could be done by an actual observer ; and it is probable
 that the number of the useful applications of the art to astronomy
 has by no means reached its limit.
   Among those who have successfully cultivated this comparatively
 new department of astronomy, it may perhaps be fairly said that Mr.
 De laRuc stands preeminent.  It is not that he claims any priority in
                                                                                       reasu 1'07‘.
 making this application of the photographic art.    Several astronomers
 have made experiments in celestial photography, and some of these
                                                I
 earlier than Mr. De la Rue, but no one, believe, has devoted himself                  4
 so systematically and assiduously to overcome the many di<U+FB02>iculties
 which are met with in the process, and no one has been so successful
 in the results which he has obtained, particularly in regard to the sun
 and moon, his photographic pictures of which bodies are su<U+FB01>iciently
 delicate in their details to admit of the most precise measurement. N 0
 one who has not seen Mr. De la Rue’s pictures of the moon can form
an idea of their exquisite sharpness and beauty of de<U+FB01>nition.   No doubt
part of the superiority of these pictures is due to his employment of a
rgiecting telescope of exquisite de<U+FB01>ning power, the large mirror of
which was <U+FB01>gured by his own hands, and by peculiar machinery of his
own contrivauce.       Thus be entirely avoided those imperfections of
the actiuic image which arise from outstanding chromatic dispersion in
  the very best refractors, especially when, as usual, they are achroma
  tized for the luminous and not for the chemical rays of the spectrum.
     The late Professor Bond, of Cambridge, in the United States, with
  the assistance of Messrs. \Vhipple and Black, of Boston, was the <U+FB01>rst
 to make a photographic picture of any heavenly body. In the year
 1845 he obtained good pictures of a Lyrze and of Castor, and in 1850,
 by means of the great re<U+FB02>ector of the Harvard Observatory, he obtained
 a daguerreotype of the moon, which was placed in the Exhibition of 1851.
 It was the sight of this which <U+FB01>rst gave the impulse to Mr. De la
 IR-ue’s labours in this direction.
     At the latter end of 1852, Mr. De la Rue took some successful
positive lunar photographs on collodion by means of an cquatorially
mounted re<U+FB02>ecting telescope of 13 inches aperture, made by him
self; and he was probably the <U+FB01>rst to employ in celestial photo
graphy the thcn recently discovered collodion process, which is that
now exclusively adopted.        At that period he had not applied any
driving motion to the telescope, and was therefore obliged to follow
the apparent motion of the moon by means of a sliding frame <U+FB01>xed in
the eyepiece holder, and moveable by the hand; but in 1857 he applied
a driving clock to the telescope, the rate of which could be adapted to

approach   to perfection  was  attainable.
    In the department of solar photography, Mr. De la Rue stands
almost alone. Assisted by the suggestions of the late Mr. John Welsh,
he devised the Kew photoheliograph, which is now regarded as a model
instrument for taking instantaneous sun-pictures. This instrument was
taken to Spain by Mr. De la Rue in 1860 in order to observe the
total solar eclipse, and the undertaking was perfectly successful.
Numerous photographs were taken during the partial phase, and two
during the totality, that showed the forms and positions of the red_
protuberances much more perfectly than had ever been done before.
The experience gained respecting the photographic energy of the light
of the prominences is also very valuable; for it is shown that a much
 shorter time of exposure than Mr. De la Rue ventured upon would
have been su<U+FB01>icient to obtain good pictures, so that it may be expected
that in future eclipses astronomers will be able to get a greater number
 of photographs during the totality, while the photographs themselves
 will be sharper and better de<U+FB01>ned. The photographs obtained in the
solar eclipse of 1860 have been discussed by Mr. De la Rue in a most
elaborate paper in the Philosophical Transactions for 1862, forming
the Bakerian Lecture. In this memoir, and in his reports on the pro
 gress of Celestial Photography in the volumes of the British Associa
 tion for 1859 and 1861, Mr. De la Rue has fully described his processes
 and instruments, and has thus deepened the feelings of obligation to
him, by giving others the bene<U+FB01>t of his long experience in the art,
though even with this guidance no one can hope to attain to great
pro<U+FB01>ciency in its practice without time, patience, and perseverance.

  reward for his enlightened and persevering labour in investigating the
  structure of the central organs of the nervous system, we may not
  inappropriately recal to mind that one of those who, in former times,
  most signally advanced this department of anatomical knowledge was
  an early Fellow of this Society, Dr. Thomas Willis, and that his cele
  brated treatise on the Anatomy of the Brain was illustrated by draw-_
  ings from the pencil of no less eminent an associate than Sir
  Christopher Wren, also a Fellow, and afterwards President of the
  Society.   But in that day, and down to a recent period, the investiga
  tion was carried on with the naked eye, and accordingly the more
                                                                               T603117??
  intimate structure and organization were hidden from view until
  brought to light in our own time by the aid of the microscope.       It is
  true that the tissue of the brain and nerves did not escape the notice       J.
 of the earlier microscopic observers; of this, indeed, there is well
  known evidence in the early volumes of our own Transactions ; still
 their inquiries were almost entirely con<U+FB01>ned to the microscopic cha
 racters of the <U+FB01>bres and other constructive elements of the cerebral and
 nervous tissues, whereas the application of the microscope, in tracing
 the arrangement of these elements, and their combination into an
 organized structure, dates little further back than the last twenty years.
     In this <U+FB01>eld of inquiry Mr. Clarke has been one of the most able
 and successful workers.     No sooner had he entered upon it than he
 introduced an important improvement into the method of investiga
 tion. The observations had previously been made on opaque sections
 of the parts examined, _on which only the coarser features of the struc
 ture could be discerned; but Mr. Clarke devised a process for render
 ing them transparent, whereby it became possible to trace the <U+FB01>ner;
 and more intimate arrangement ; and this method has not only, in his
 own hands, proved fruitful in valuable results, but, having been adopted
by his fellow-labourers in the same pursuit, has been most in<U+FB02>uential
 on the general progress of the inquiry.
    The investigation itself, even with every available aid, is singularly
di<U+FB02>icult and laborious. Section after section of the spinal cord through
out its whole length, and of its complex cranial prolongation, must be
carefully scrutinized, thoughtfully compared, and, for the most part,
minutely delineated; and sometimes many different specimens must_
be prepared and examined in order to make out a single point.           In
this exhausting work Mr. Clarke has long and meritoriously persevered.
amid the calls of an active professional life.        The results of his
labours are made known in his various papers, published chie<U+FB02>y
in the Philosophical Transactions, and in the elaborate delineations
with which they are illustrated.      And it is pleasing to know that, in
all essential points, his observations have been con<U+FB01>rmed by the most
accurate and trustworthy of his contemporaries.
    After what has been said of the di<U+FB01>iculties of the inquiry, it will be

    readily conceived that Mr. Clarke’s investigations, successful though
    they have been, have left not a few intricacies of structure still to be
    umavelled ; and, in speaking of the advances actually made, it will be
    su<U+FB01>icient here to indicate the chief points which have either been made
    known for the <U+FB01>rst time, or more exactly determined and-placed in a
    clearer light through Mr. Clarke’s labours.
     '
       One of the principal subjects of investigation was the grey substance
    which forms the interior part of the spinal cord.        The <U+FB01>gure which
    this part assumes in different regions of the cord has been more
    exactly described and delineated, and the nature and arrangement of its
    constituent elements more fully examined and more clearly exposed
    than heretofore.      Two columns or tracts, composed of nerve-cells, and
    previously undescribed, have been shown to exist in the grey substance
    through nearly the whole length of the cord, and two others in It
    shorter extent.      Moreover Mr. Clarke was, as we believe, the <U+FB01>rst to
    point out that the central canal of the spinal cord is lined with
    epithelium, and he certainly <U+FB01>rst explained the true nature of the tissue
    immediately surrounding the canal, which had previously been mistaken
    for nervous substance.
       The course and connexions of the <U+FB01>bres of the nerve-roots after they
    enter the substance of the spinal cord have, as yet, been by no means fully
    made out; but Mr. Clarke’s investigations have shed considerable light
    on that obscure point     of_ anatomy, and, amongst other observations of
    moment, he has shown that          part of the posterior or sentient roots
                                        a
    take,  in the <U+FB01>rst  instance,   downward direction-——an unlooked-for ana
                                    a
    tomical fact, which was afterwards strikingly shown by Brown-Sequard
    to be in harmony with physiological experiment.
    '
       The structure of the medulla oblongata, and the relation of its seve
    ral tracts or divisions to the columns of the spinal cord, as well as the
    intimate nature of the grey masses which are there superadded, and
    their connexion with special sets of <U+FB01>bres and nerve-roots, are ques
    tions which have long tried the skill and patience of anatomists, and
    which have received fresh elucidation from the keen scrutiny and saga
    cious interpretation of Mr. Clarke; and in this branch of his inquiry he
    has arrived at new facts, and has been able to correct serious errors
    which had been introduced on respected authority.
      But the researches of Mr. Clarke on the spinal cord have not been
    con<U+FB01>ned to its perfected structure; he has investigated the mode of its
_   development    in the foetus; and one of his papers in the Philosophical
    Transactions contains minute account of the changes observable in the
                          a
    form and structure of both the white and grey substance at successive
    stages of development, in man, mammalia, and birds; also,      a descrip
    tion of the intimate structure of the intervertebral ganglia, and of the
    mode of development of the cells and <U+FB01>bres which enter into the for
    mation of these different parts.

       Finally, although it must he confessed that the knowledge acquired
    of the intimate structure of the nervous centres has as yet afforded
    but little direct insight into their functional mechanism, it cannot be
    doubted that approved and trustworthy investigations of structure tend
    powerfully to promote physiological truth, by enabling us to distinguish
    between true and false anatomical data when used as a basis of physio
    logical reasoning, and by sweeping away the imaginary groundwork of
    much vain speculation    and erroneous doctrine.

    to you, on the recommendation of those in the Council most competent
                                                                                     J.
    to judge of the subjects on which you are engaged, as a well-earned
    reward of your persevering labours, which the Council is well aware
    have demanded from you the devotion of all the leisure remaining to
'
    you amidst the duties of an active professional career.     I
                                                              need scarcely
    add that the Council hopes that this mark of approbation of services
    already performed will also be an incitement to further labours in the
    same or in kindred <U+FB01>elds of research.
       The Council has awarded the Rumford Medal to Professor John
    Tyndall, F.R.S., for his researches on the Absorption and Radiation of
    Heat by Gases and Vapours.
       Previously to the researches of Professor Tyndall, hardly anything
    had been done in the way of an experimental determination of the
    absorption of radiant heat by gases and vapours.         Melloui had inferred
    from his experiments that atmospheric air is sensibly diathermanous in
    a length such as that of an ordinary room, while Dr. Franz came to the
    conclusion that a column of air only 3 feet long absorbed more than
    31} per cent. of the heat-rays   from an argand lamp.        The discrepancy
    of  these  results gives  some  view  of the  difficulty of the experiments;
    but it is only by the perusal of the earlier part of Professor Tyndall’s
    <U+FB01>rst memoir on the subject, that the skill and patience can be appre
    ciated with which the various sources of error were one by one detected
    and eliminated by him.
       In his <U+FB01>rst memoir he shows that the elementary gases, hydrogen,
    oxygen, nitrogen, as well as air freed from moisture and carbonic acid,
    when examined in a length of about 4 feet, exert on the heat radiated
    from lampblack at 212°, an absorption not exceeding about 3% per cent.,
    and liable to be altered by the slightest impurity present in the gases.
    The results obtained with compound gases and with vapours, on the
    other hand, were very di<U+FB02>'erent,—o1e<U+FB01>ant gas, for instance, in the same
    length absorbing 81 per cent. of the incident heat. About twenty gases
    and vapours were examined, and that not only at atmospheric pressure
     (or, in the case of vapours, in a state of saturation), but also at avariety

 of inferior pressures. Among these substances ‘may particularly be
 mentioned, as being constituents of our atmosphere, carbonic acid and
 aqueous vapour, both of which, but more especially the latter, were
 found to exert a considerable absorptive action, so that Professor Tyn
 dall concludes that it is to its aqueous vapour that the absorption of
 radiant heat by our atmosphere is mainly due. He also shows that the
 gases operated on when heated, radiate heat in an order corresponding
 to that of their absorption.
     In his second memoir, besides continuing the same subject, he has
 struck out a new and remarkable method of determining the absorption
 and radiation of heat by gases and vapours, depending on what he calls
 dynamic radiation and absorption.        In this method the results are
 arrived at without the use of any extraneous source of heat or cold
 whatsoever, but simply by the heat or cold produced by the condensa
 tion or rarefaction of the gas itself, or of a mixture of the vapour with
 air or a diathermanous gas.
     It may serve to show the difficulties which beset the inquiry, arising
 from the interference of disturbing causes, to state that two such expe
 rienced physicists as Professor Tyndall and Professor Magnus of Berlin
 should have arrived at, and long maintained, opposite conclusions,re
 specting the absorption of radiant heat by air, and the in<U+FB02>uence of
 aqueous vapour.     This led Professor Tyndall in a third memoir to con
  sider more especially the case of aqueous vapour, which he had already
 treated in his two former papers.       The result is that his conclusions
 have   been so con<U+FB01>rmed   by  a system of checks and counterchecks, and
 by the complete harmony which they present with what we know to be
 true in other cases, that it seems impossible to doubt their correctness.
    The conclusion that the chief absorbing action of the atmosphere on
 non-luminous heat is due to the aqueous vapour which it contains, has
 numerous and important bearings on meteorology, and has been applied
 by Professor Tyndall to the explanation of some phenomena which
 appear hitherto to have been imperfectly understood.
    In his fourth memoir, besides various other subjects of investigation,
he compares the absorption of heat by vapours with that produced by
the same substances in the liquid state, and concludes that for non
luminous radiant heat (in accordance with what we know for light) the
general character of the absorption is the same, in whichever of the two
states the substance may be found.
    In a <U+FB01>fth memoir, just published, he examines among other things
the penetrative power of the heat radiated from various <U+FB02>ames, and
shows that such heat is absorbed with especial facility by the gases
which result from the combustion.          _
    Professor Tyndall concludes from his researches that, as a general
rule, the opacity of a substance_with respect to radiant heat from a
 source of comparatively low temperature

in which the law is found to be true. Whatever may be thought of our
ability to explain the law in the present state of our knowledge respect

highly remarkable.

 embarrassed in the choice of the expressions which should accompany it

 personal regard and admiration which                I

 myself to say, from the very commencement of your scienti<U+FB01>c career in
 this country.    It has been your fate, Sir, that each last achievement                     J.

 it.  Iwill only add the expression of my heartfelt hope that your health,
 so valuable to us all, and which ought not therefore to be lightly com
 promised, will be preserved to enable you to accomplish fresh labours
 which shall still surpass those which have gone before.

1864.]            Prof. A. H. Church                on certain Etllylphosphales.                     621
of the methylsulphuric, phenylsulphurous, nitrophenylsulphous and other
series, but have lately turned my attention to the analogous compounds                                   of
the phosphoric series.   Some remarkable substances have been thus made,
their constitution seeming to have a direct bearing upon the important
question of the atomicity and equivalency of certain of the metallic elements.
   Several substances might have served as starting-points for these new
inquiries.       A curious compound, phenylphosphoric                              acid, Cu H511,   P0,,
was prepared          ;   but its instability, and the oxidation to which it and its salts
are    liable,        it unsuited for the present purpose. I intend to

describe in the present paper but one series of salts, formed from Pelouze’s
ethylphosphoric acid,    II, II, PO‘. This compound, containing two atoms
                                    (1,
of easily replaceable hydrogen, appeared admirably adapted for the pur
pose in view.    It    readily prepared

     Fromthe etbylphosphoric acid thus formed the barium salt was prepared
inlarge quantity and of perfect purity.   This compound, C2115, Baa, PO‘

                 is       for being  less soluble in boiling water than in
water at 70° C., or even at l5°—a characteristic property of several other
cthylphosphates.     Boiling water, in fact, affects this barium salt    peculiar              in
                                                                                                a

crystallized salt be added, the crystals instantly assume          pearly aspect,     a
and are found, after having been <U+FB01>ltered o<U+FB01>', washed once with boiling
water, and dried in vacuo over sulphuric acid, to have lost 511,0, and
thus to have the formula
                                          C,   H,   Ba‘,   PO‘+Aq.
      They thus contain             the proportion           the majority of the
                                                       of water found         in
ethylphosphates.     When, on the other hand, cold water         poured on these     is
crystals, or on the salt dried at 100°, the lost water    regained, the nacreous

aspect of  the dried salt disappears, while   great increasea  in its bulk occurs.
   From the barium salt the lead and silver compounds are readily made.

 the water-oven, it retains one atom of water of crystallization, and has the
 formula C2 H, Ag, PO,+Aq.            It was chie<U+FB02>y by double decomposition with
 the barium, lead, and silver salts that the compounds presently to be
 described were formed.         The perfect purity of the substances used was
 established by rigorous experiment ; a silver-determination, for instance, in
 the argentic ethylphosphate used in many of the reactions to be detailed
 further on, gave the following numbers :—
    l0'27 grains of the salt dried at 100°C. gave 8'22 grains of Ag Cl.
 This result corresponds to 6024 per cent of Ag, while the percentage
 required by the formula C, 11,, Ag,, PO,+Aq is 60-33. The other analyses
 were equally satisfactory.
    I  give, in the present communication, a selection      of the most interesting
 of the numerous results obtained during the course of my experimental
inquiry.      Many points of departure for other researches have occurred-—
 the investigation, for example, of the products, volatile and <U+FB01>xed, of the
 destructive distillation of the ethylphosphates, and the determination of the
varying amount of water of crystallization in several of the salts prepared.
 I may cite the barium salts as illustrations.       Not only do the salts already
mentioned exist, namely one containing 6 Aq and the other 1 Aq, but a third
compound may be obtained by evaporating at about 50° or 60° C. a saturated
solution of the ordinary barium salt, and <U+FB01>ltering off the deposited crystals
rapidly.      The slender pearly plates thus formed are perfectly de<U+FB01>nite and
constant in composition; they probably consist of equal equivalents of the
two former salts.       Analysis gave the following numbers :—
      704 grains gave 5'01 grains of Ba, SO‘.
    1288 grains lost at 130° C. 2'5 grains of H,O.
    These ‘results correspond to 41'85 per cent. of Ba, and l9'407 per cent.
of H, O ; the formula 2 (C, H, Ba2 PO‘) + 7 Aq demands 4228 per cent. of
Ba, and 1944 per cent. of H, O.
    Ferric Ethylph0ephate.—Equivalent          proportions of argentic. ethylphos
phate and pure crystallized anhydrous ferric chloride were weighed out.
The silver salt was mixed with some quantity of hot water, and the ferric
chloride, previously dissolved in hot water, then added, the liquid being
kept warm for some time.          On <U+FB01>ltering, a pale yellow liquid was obtained
which contained no silver, and the merest trace of chlorine.            On heating
this liquid    to  the boiling-point, pale straw-yellow <U+FB01>lms separated from it:
a quantity     of these was collected, washed with cold water and with alcohol,
and,  after  having been dried in the water-oven, analyzed with the following
results :—

the simpler formula be correct, then any other replacement but that of

process made use       of   to effect the replacement causes                  a    coalescence   of three
atoms of the original salt, in order that one more complex atom of the new
mixed compound may be thereby constructed.

separated removed by <U+FB01>ltration. In other cases absolute alcohol was
added to the warm concentrated solution till   part only, often buta   small                     a

             on the whole satisfactory; the total amount of iron agreed nearly with that
             demanded by theory, though the amount of ferrosum in the salt was never
             less than '5 per cent. below the required proportion.  It was in fact impos
             sible entirely to prevent oxidation of the salt; but  will be perceived that

             derable error into the determinations.     Nor did any inconvenience arise
             from the presence of phosphovinic acid, which, curiously enough, was found
             to be without reducing action on the permanganate, even in the presence
             of sulphuric acid.    The following results were obtained in the analysis of
             the ferroso-ferric ethylphosphate.
               The ferroso-ferric ethylphosphate was dried in vacuo over sulphuric acid.
             In each experiment with the permanganate solution '5 gramme of the iron

    The    mean     of the <U+FB01>rst four experiments gives 14022 as the percentage
 amount     of   ferrosum    in the compound.            The theory (C, 1],), (1-‘¢,~"'),(l~‘¢'),
 3 I’O,+3Aq         demands     l~l'84   l.
    The  mean      of the last two experiments gives 24102 as the total percentage
 of iron in the compound. The theoretical percentage is 2-P745. If the
 experimental mean percentage of ferrosum be deducted from the total mean
 percentage of iron arrived at by experiment, thus, ‘Z-l'~l0‘2— l4'02‘.2= l0'38,
 the number arrived at gives the percentage of ferricum in the compound ;
 the formula above given requires {T894 per cent.: thus the experimental
 percentage exceeds the theoretical by ‘-186 per cent.——-a small error, cousi
 dering the very great di<U+FB02>iculties attending the manipulation of this easily
oxidized salt.
    Uranylic       E1143/lpltoapllale.-—Some           pure uranic oxide, Ur,O,, was pre.
pared by repeatedly acting on uranic nitrate with alcohol, the pasty mixture
being heated on awater-bath.                  When the separation of the oxide was com
plete, it was mixed at a temperature of about 60° or 70° with a weak solu
tion of ethylphosphoric acid. After dilution with hot water and digestion,
the solution was <U+FB01>ltered and evaporated.                      As soon as the boiling-point
was attained, the solution almost solidi<U+FB01>ed from the separation of clear
yellow gelatinous masses of the new salt. These were collected by <U+FB01>ltration
of the boiling liquid after           a   portion of the water had evaporated.             Sub
mitted to analysis, they gave             results    leading   to the  formula C, II,, U, 0,,
PO,-{-Aq. This uranie salt thus agrees in constitution with the inorganic
uranic phosphates already known, and lends additional support to Péligot’s
Uranyle theory.          The following list gives the formula: of various uranylic
phosphates, uranyle being represented by the expression U,O :—

       C, H,, 2 U2 O, PO,-l-Aq               . . Diurano-ethylphosphate.
   This new uranic salt, like many other ethylphosphates, is less soluble in
water at 100° than in water at 60° or 70°.                    It separates from its solutions
in pale yellow <U+FB02>ocks, which dry up in the water-oven into amorphous brittle
masses    of  a bright lemon-yellow colour.                Attempts to replace a portion of
the uranyle in this salt by calcium and by silver led to no de<U+FB01>nite results.
The following are the analyses of the uranylic ethylphosphate dried at 100° :
      I.  '51’/' grm. gave       'l06 grm. of Co, and 'O835 grm. of H, O.

            discovered. Water gradually decomposes this salt, giving arsenious anhy
            dride and ethylphosphoric acid. Although the analysis of the <U+FB01>rst crop
            of crystals
                     was tolerably satisfactory, the original method of preparing the
            compound was abandoned, and another plan adopted.       It was found that
            ethylphosphoric acid readily dissolves arsenious acid at the boiling-point,
            and that on heating and evaporating the solution, beautiful crystals of the
            arsenious  ethylphosphate separate.   In order to study this reaction more
            closely, the experiment was repeated, substituting, however, common ortho

            phosphoric for the ethylphosphoric.      The arsenious anhydride readily
            dissolved in considerable quantity on ebullition;    and after <U+FB01>ltration and
            cooling, an abundant crop of brilliant crystals was deposited from the <U+FB01>ltrate.
            These crystals were not perceptibly aifeeted by washing with cold water,
            and proved to be completely volatile when heated in            test-tube over        a                  a
            spirit-lamp.   In fact they were   nothing  but  octahedra  of  arsenious anhy
            dride.      Further experiments              showed that        it   was not possible in this manner
            to form an arsenious phosphate; so that the statement                            in Gmelin’s Hand
            book, referring to this salt as probably obtainable                             bythe process above
            given, would seem to require correction.                         The normal arsenious phosphate,

   The arsenic in the arsenious ethylphosphate was determined as sulphide,
the precipitation being effected according to the directions given by Fre
senius. The salt was dried by pressure between folds of <U+FB01>lter-paper, it
was then placed in cacao over sulphuric acid, and <U+FB01>nally heated for a short
time in the water-oven.             Thc'arsenious    sulphide obtained on its analysis

mitted to analysis in the latter case having been partially decomposed by
washing, ethylphosphoric acid being thus removed, and consequently an
excess of arsenious anhydride remaining in the residual salt.

to hope that similar success would attend experiments made     with another
triatomic      element,

terchloride of phosphorus and ethylphosphate of silver, an oily product
may be removed from the mass by means of anhydrous ether, but it yields
on analysis results less de<U+FB01>nite than could be wished. Yet the reaction is
a promising one: I hope to recur to it shortly, and to experiment in a
similar manner with antimony and bismuth compounds.

in an oil-bath for some time loses ammonia as well as water, but yet appears
to yield, among other products, ethylphosphamic acid. A different and
much more de<U+FB01>nite kind of decomposition takes place with the compound
next to be described.

lose their transparency, most probably because they have thus parted with
some of their water of crystallization. The salt is intensely soluble in cold
water, and deliquescent. The analyses of this salt were not exact, but
corresponded su<U+FB02>iciently with the formula of an ethylphosphoric acid in
which two atoms of hydrogen had been replaced by two atoms of tetrethy

     features   of interest.    The ammonium, nickel,             chromic,       mercurous, an
     platinic compounds were investigated more particularly.                     The mercurou

    supposed    that  I consider   them   conclusive    so far   as   regards the theoretica
    considerations introduced into the present paper.                   It is possible that th
    various aluminium and iron salts described may be mixtures only, in spite
    of their apparent constancy of composition ; or, again, it may be that thei
    formulae ought to be doubled or quadrupled.                 Moreover the constitution
     of ethylphosphoric acid itself has not been made out:               I trust that the stud
     of dicthyl-, cthylpyro-, and ethylmeta-phosphoric acids, and of the pro

ducts of the action of heat on the ethylphosphates, may aid in determining
this question.       Meanwhile the observation, already recorded, as to the
stability of ordinary ethylphosphoric        acid and its salts in the presence of
permanganate       of  potassium requires   a  word or two of further comment.
When argentic diethylphosphate is acted upon with iodine, the silver and
one atom    of‘ ethyl may be removed, and after treatment with <U+FB01>nely divided
silver and a little oxide of silver to remove any iodine and_ hydriodie acid,
and then with excess of carbonate of barium, an ethylphosphate of barium
is obtained, which, unlike the ordinary salt, immediately reduces perman
ganate of potassium ; perhaps the ethyl in this salt exists in a different and
less intimate form      of combination.     I am inclined to    think that the per
rnanganates     will afford, in some cases, criteria for the detection of' slight
differences in isomeric compounds, although it would be premature at
present to hazard an exact interpretation of the phenomena to which they
give rise. I may add that treatment of an cthylphosphate with strong
nitric acid fails   to decompose the ethylphosphoric acid ; so that phosphoric
acid cannot thus be separated from this remarkably stable body;

    fessor J.   CLERK l\Iax\vr:r.L, F.R.S.        Received October 27, 1864-.
                                      ( Abstract.)
    The proposed Theory        seeks for the origin   of electromagnetic   effects in
the medium surrounding the electric or magnetic bodies, and assumes that
they act on each other not immediately at a distance, but through the
intervention of this medium.
    The existence of the medium is assumed as probable, since the investi
gations of‘ Optics have led philosophers to believe that in such a medium
the propagation of light takes place.
    The properties attributed to the medium in order to explain the propa
gation of light are
    lst. That the motion of one part communicates motion to the parts in
its neighbourhood.
    2nd. That this communication is not instantaneous but progressive, and
depends on the elasticity of the medium as compared with its density.
    The kind of motion attributed to the medium when transmitting light is
that called transverse vibration.
    An elastic medium capable of such motions           must be also capable of a
vast variety of other motions, and its elasticity       may be called into play in
other ways, some of which may be discoverable           by their effects.
    One phenomenon which seems to indicate the          existence of other motions
than those of light in the medium, is that discovered by Faraday, in which
the plane of polarization of a ray of light is caused to rotate by the action

              of magnetic force. Professor W. Thomson* has shown that this pheno
              menon cannot be explained without admitting that there is motion of the
              luminiferous medium in the neighbourhood of magnets and currents.
              _  The phenomena of electromotive force seem also to indicate the elasticity
              or tenacity of the medium.    When the state of the <U+FB01>eld is being altered by
              the introduction or motion of currents or magnets, every part of the <U+FB01>eld
              experiences a force, which, if the medium in that part of the <U+FB01>eldis a con
              ductor, produces a current.   If the medium is an electrolyte, and the elec
              tromotive force is strong enough, the components of the electrolyte are
              separated in spite of their chemical affinity, and carried in opposite direc
              tions.    If
                         the medium is a dielectric, all its parts are put into a state of
              electric polarization, a state in which the opposite sides of every such part
              are oppositely electri<U+FB01>ed, and this to an extent proportioned to the intensity
              of the electromotive force which causes the polarization.      If the intensity
              of this polarization is increased beyond a certain limit, the electric tenacity
              of the medium gives way, and there is a spark or “ disruptive discharge.”
                  Thus the action of electromotive force on a dielectric produces an elec
              tric displacement within        it,
                                            and in this way stores up energy which will re
              appear when the dielectric      relieved from this state of constraint.

“                 A  dynamical theory of the Electromagnetic Field must therefore assume
"I            that, wherever magnetic effects occur, therelis matter in motion, and that,
              wherever electromotive force      exerted, there
                                                    is             medium in

              straint; so that the medfum must be regarded as the recipient of two kinds
              of   energy—the actual energy of the magnetic motion, and the potential
              energy of the electric displacement. According to this theory we look for
              the explanation of electric and magnetic phenomena to the mutual actions
              between  the medium and the electri<U+FB01>ed or magnetic bodies, and not to any
              direct action between those bodies themselves.
                 In the case of an electric current <U+FB02>owing in circuit A, we know that
                                                                                a
              the magnetic action at every point of the <U+FB01>eld depends on its position rela

              added to those due to A, according to the well~known law of composition
              of forces, velocities, &c. According to our theory, the motion of every part
              of the medium depends partly on the strength of the current in A, and
              partly on that in B, and when these are given the whole      determined.        is

referred to A, and the effect of the force on B is to increase the momentum
referred to B. The simplest mechanical example is that of a rod acted on
by two forces perpendicular to its direction at A and at B. Then any
change of velocity of A will produce a force at B, unless A and B are
mutually centres of suspension and oscillation.
  Assuming that the motion of every part of the electromagnetic <U+FB01>eld is
determined by the values of the currents in A and B, it is shown—
   lst. That any variation in the strength of A will produce an electrome
tive force in B.
  2nd. That any alteration in the relative position of A and B will produce
an electromotive force in B.
  3rd. That if currents are maintained in A and B, there will be a mecha
nical force tending to alter their position relative to each other.
   4th. That these electromotive and mechanical forces depend on the value
of a single function M, which may be deduced from the form and relative
position of A and B, and is of one dimension in space; that is to say, it is a
certain number of feet or metres.
   The existence of electromotive forces between the circuits A and B was
<U+FB01>rst deduced from the fact of electromagnetic attraction, by Professor llelm
holtz* and Professor W. Thomsony, by the principle of the Conservation
of Energy.  Here the electromagnetic attractions, as well as the forces of
induction, are deduced from the fact that every current when established
in a circuit has a certain persistency or momentum—that                   is,
                                                                 requires the   it
continued action of an unresisted electromotive force in order to alter its
                                     ”
value, and that this “ momentum        depends, as in various mechanical pro
blems, on the value of other currents as well as itself.  This momentum                              is
                                                                            A
what Faraday has called the Electrotonic State of the circuit.
  It may be shown from these results, that at every point in the <U+FB01>eld there
isa certain direction possessing the following properties            :
     A
     conductor moved in that direction experiences no electromotive force.

such    a    disturbance must be entirely transverse to the direction of propaga
tion.        In 1846 there were no data to calculate the mathematical laws of
such propagation, or to determine the velocity.
  The equations of this paper, however, show that transverse disturbances,
and transverse disturbances only, will be propagated through the <U+FB01>eld, and
that the number which expresses the velocity of propagation must be the
same as that which expresses the number of electrostatic units of electricity
in one electromagnetic unit, the standards of space and time being the same.

   At the outset of the paper, the dynamical theory of the electromagnetic
<U+FB01>eld borrowed from the undulatory theory of light the use of its lumini
ferous medium.                 It now restores              the medium, after having tested its powers
of transmitting undulations, and the character of      those undulations, and
certi<U+FB01>es that the  vibrations  are transverse, and that  the velocity  that of                           is

    The theory does not attempt to give 'a mechanical explanation of ‘the
nature of magnetic disturbance or of electric displacement, it only asserts
the identity of these phenomena, as observed at our leispre in magnetic and
electric experiments, with what occurs in the rapid vibrations of light, in a
portion of time incoueeivably minute.
    This paper is already too long to follow out the application of the elec
tromagnetic theory to the different phenomena already explained by the
undulatory .theory.     It discloses a relation between the inductive capacity
of a dielectric and its index of refraction. The theory of double refraction
in crystals is expressed very simply in terms of the electromagnetic theory.
The non-existence' of normal vibrations and the ordinary refraction of rays
polarized in a principal plane are shown to be capable of explanation; but
the veri<U+FB01>cation   of the theory      is di<U+FB02>icult at present,   for want of accurate
data concerning the dielectric capacity     of crystals in dif1"erent directions.
    The propagation of vibrations in a conducting medium is then considered,
and it is shown that the light is absorbed at a rate depending on the con
ducting-power of the medium.           This result is so far con<U+FB01>rmed by the
opacity of all good conductors, but the transparency of electrolytes shows
that in certain cases vibrations of short period and amplitude are not ab
sorbed as those of long period would be.
_
    The transparency of thin     leaves of gold, silver, and platinum cannot be
explained  without   some such hypothesis.
    The actual value of the maximum eleetromotive force which is called
into play during the vibrations of strong sunlight is calculated from
Pouillet’s data, and found to be about 60,000,000, or about 600 Daniell’s
cells per metre.
    The maximum magnetic force during such vibrations is ‘I93, or about {0
of the horizontal magnetic force at London.
    Methods are then given for applying the general equations to the calcu
lation of the coefficient of mutual induction of two circuits, and in parti
cular of two circles the distance of whose circumferences is small compared
with the radius of either.                   .

pared with the value dedueed from a comparison of experiments in which
this coe<U+FB01>icient enters as a correction, and also with the results of direct
experiments with the electric balance.

The total quantity of urine obtained after death was between two and three
drachms.
   Experiment      2.—This lasted    seven hours and a half,     in consequence     of
an interruption caused by the melting of nearly all the ice surrounding the
rabbit.    The temperature fell from 101° F. in the mouth to 69° F. after
death. The urine made before the application of cold contained no sugar.
The quantity of urine obtained after      death was so small that       I was unable
to prove to my own satisfaction that sugar was present in it.
   Experiment 3.—This lasted four hours and <U+FB01>ve minutes. The tempe
raturc at the commencement was 101° F. in the mouth.               The urine made
before the icing was alkaline from <U+FB01>xed alkali.         It  did not give any trace
of sugar, and when mixed with yeast and put in a warm place it rapidly
putre<U+FB01>ed.      Its speci<U+FB01>c gravity was 1014.      The urine obtained after death
was strongly acid, and contained crystals of oxalate of lime. It gave a plen
tiful reduction of oxide of copper when boiled with sulphate of copper and
liquor potassaa. When boiled with liquor potassae alone, it deepened
markedly in colour.       When mixed with yeast it quickly fermented most
distinctly.     The speci<U+FB01>c gravity was 1020.
   I sent   my results to Professor Briieke, and I asked him to repeat my ex
periments, and I have received from him the following account written in
June    1864.
   “The urine of rabbits always shows small quantities of sugar. No regi
men could make it disappear entirely.         Hay, grass, carrots ; hay and grass
mixed, and absolute fasting were tried, but all showed traces of sugar in
the urine.
   “ The
            quantity of urine obtained  was too little to allow of the fermentation
test being successful, but by using the lead process, the potash, the bismuth,
and the copper test gave very feeble evidence of sugar. The experiments
agreed so well, that      I can have no doubt that sugar is always present.
The rabbit proved to be pregnant, and as I had found that in the last stage of
pregnancy sugar is often increased in the urine,         I  thought this might ac
count for the sugar in the urine; so      I took a strong male rabbit, and then
again I found that traces of sugar occur normally in the urine of rabbits as
in the urine of man.
   “ Then    I repeated  your experiment. Notwithstanding what I had found,
                                                                                       M“
the results were striking.      The quantity of sugar in the urine after freez
ing was incomparably greater (war ganz unvergleichlich gross).
   “ The urine after freezing differed also from the urine of health in the fact
that, after precipitating with acetate of lead and <U+FB01>ltering, the clear <U+FB02>uid
gave avery small precipitate with basic acetate       of lead; but   on the addition
 of ammonia, a plentiful white precipitate fell and        deposited   itself, leaving
 the <U+FB02>uid clear.

   Action of Chloride of Iodine on Iodide of Ally/le.—In order to determine
the union of these bodies, it was simply necessary to mix and agitate them.
The chloride of iodine                   used was in the form                   of     a   watery solution.  During
the agitation the mixture became warm, and assumed                                               a dark colour from
the liberation          of iodine.      the reaction, it was gently heated
                                                 To   complete
over the lamp for a short time.   By these means a dark oily liquid was
obtained, which was separated from the excess of chloride of iodine, washed
with dilute potash, then with pure water, and distilled.  Almost the entire
liquid passed over between 190° and 215° Cent.        The fraction distilling
between 205 and 210 being very considerable in quantity, was collected
separately and analyzed, having been previously decolorized by agitation
with mercury. The numbers obtained correspond sufficiently well with the

   This body    I suppose       I must   call iodo-chlor-brom-aldehydene.                  It is a
colourless oil, is insoluble in water, and, like the former body, has a sweet                      -
and biting taste.      It is formed by the direct addition of one atom of chlo
ride of iodine to one atom of bromide of aldehydene.
   I  have also tried the action       of chloride of iodine on cyanide of allyle, in
the expectation of forming the body C, H, Cy Cl I, and from this. by the
action of potash, the acid C, II, 0,.                My expectations, however, were not
realized.    On heating these substances together as in the former cases, all
the iodine of the chloride of iodine was set free; and                     I  obtained on evapo
rating  the  liquor, instead of an      oil,  a mixture      of   chloride of ammonium and
an organic acid, probably crotonic.
   The solution of chloride of iodine employed in                   these and my former ex
periments on ethylene and propylene gases, was made by conducting a
stream of chlorine into H300 grains of water holding in suspension 700
grains of iodine.        The mixture was kept cold and agitated repeatedly
during the passage      of the gas, which was interrupted when all the iodine,
with the exception of a trace, had been dissolved.
   It is highly probable that bromide of acetylene (C, H, Br,) and similar
non-saturated bodies may be also made to combine directly with chloride
of iodine.

of the roots, two roots equal, and also in some form two roots differing
1 ; also that in some form of the roots the algebraic sum of the roots w
be equal to 1.
  If a’+a+b“-—(m"'+m+n’)                              be equal to any number whatever, odd
even,   it must equal         a number represented by                   p”—(c’+    c)    ;   and as
                         a’+a+b*—(m’+m+"’)=1>”—(¢’+c).
                                 a’+a+b’+c”+c=m’+m+n”+p’.
These two expressions are equivalent to each other, and any number wh
is of the one form is also of the other form; and if they be doubled a
 1 be added to each, they will become
            2a’-1-2a+l+2b’+2c’+2c, 2m”+2m+l+2n’+2p"'-,
and either of them will represent any odd number whatever.   For                                      a’+a
b’—(m’+m+n’)      not  only equals p’—(c*+c),  but it also equals                                     p’—

          2m’+2m+l+2n”+2p’+2q=2a’+2a+1+26’-i-20’-4-2c;
if thereforeto either form any even number (2q) be added, it is still of 
form of the other, and therefore still of its own form, that is,

is still of the form 2m’+2m+                      1   +2n’-+210’, and that form therefore rep
sents any odd number.
  It is shown in the paper that when 2a’+ 211+ 1, 2/2’, 2c”+ 2c is expand
2a’-l-211-}-I becomes a series (by the addition of 4, 8, 12, &c.) who
terms will be 0, 0, 0,           1 ;   0, 0, 1, 2 ; O, 0, 2, 3, &c., and may be considered
a line whose general expression is O, O, a,                          (a+1).
   When 26’ is added to                  each   term by'the addition of 2, 6, 10, 14, &c
becomes a square whose                      general term is 6, 6, a, a+l (these being ro
whose squares added together form the term in the square). Lastly, wh
2c’-I-20 is added_(by decreasing a and increasing 11+ 1, 1, each time) 
the squarejbecomes a. cube, every term has two roots equal, but is compos
of not exceeding         4 square numbers ; and as on the addition to any term
any even number                the term so increased will still be within the c

2m”-1-2m-Iv 1 +21? be formed into a square, and then by the addition ot'2
be raised into   cube (the terms 11, h in each term being one increase
and the other diminished by        every term     the cube will have

        Received    December         14-,  186 L.
    I  cannot doubt that your attention has been drawn to the discovery
announced by Sir Charles Lyell in his Presidential Address at the late
Meeting of the British Association, of large masses of a fossil organism re
ferable to the Foraminiferous             type, near the base of the Laurentian series
of rocks in Canada.         The geological position of this fossil (almost 40,000
feet beneath     the base of the Silurian system) is scarcely more remarkable
than its zoological relations; for there is found in it the evidence of a most
extraordinary development of that Rhizopod type of animal life which at
the present time presents itself only in forms of comparative insigni<U+FB01>cance
-—a development which enabled it to separate carbonate of lime from the
ocean-waters in quantity sufficient to produce masses rivalling in bulk and
solidity those of the stony corals of later epochs, and thus to furnish (as
there seems good reason to believe) the materials of those calcareous strata
which occur in the higher parts of the Laurentian series.
 _  Although a detailed account of this discovery, including the results of
the microscopic examinations into the structure of the fossil which have
been made ‘by Dr. Dawson and myself, has been already communicated to
the Geological Society by Sir William E. Logan,                   I  venture to believe that
the Fellows of the Royal Society may be glad to be more directly made ac
quainted with my view of its relations to the types of Foraminifera which I
have already described in the Philosophical Transactions.
    The massive skeletons of the Rhizopod to which the name Eozoon Cana
dense has been given, seem to have extended themselves over the surface of
submarine rocks, their base frequently reaching a diameter of 12 inches, and
their thickness being usually from 4 to 6 inches.                   Avertical section of one
of  these masses exhibits      1.  more or less regular alternation of calcareous        and

                            of calcareous and siliceous layers which is characteristic of the basal 
                            tion of these masses, frequently gives place in the more super<U+FB01>cial part

                            lected in continuous bands, so as to give it a granular instead of a stri
                            aspect. This difference we shall <U+FB01>nd to depend upon a departure from
                            typical plan of growth, which often occurs (as in other Foraminifera) in
                            later stages-the minute chambers being no longer arranged in continu

lubalilulion, in which the animal matter is replaced (particle by particle)
by some mineral substance, over that of mere penelralion.
   The Eozoon in its living state might be likened to an extensive range of
building made up of successive tiers of chambers, the chambers of each tier
for the most part communicating very freely with each other (like the
secondary chambers of Carpenteria<U+FB01> so that the segments of the sarcodie
layer which occupied them were intimately connected, as is shown by
the continuity of their siliceous models.      The proper walls of these
chambers are everywhere formed of a pellucid vitreous shell-substance
minutely perforated with parallel tubuli, so us exactly to correspond with
that ot'NummuIilea, C_1/cloelypeus, and Opereulinaf; and even these minute
tubuli are so penetrated by siliceous in<U+FB01>ltration, that when the calcareous
shell has been removed by acid, the internal casts of their cavities remain
in the form of most delicate needles, standing parallel to one another on
the solid mould of the cavity of the chamber, over which they form a
delicate <U+FB01>lmy layer.
   But,          the proper walls of the successive tiers of chambers, there
             between
usually intervene layers of very variable thickness, composed of a homo
geneous shell-substance; and these layers represent the “intermediate” or
“supplemental” skeleton which I have described in several of the larger
Fonammrn-zaa, and which attains a peculiar development in Oalcarina I.
And, as in Calearina and other recent and fossil FORAMINIFERA, this “in
                                " is traversed     “
termediate skeleton                            by a canal-system ”§ that                     gave passage
to the prolongations of the sarcode-body, by the agency of which the calca
reous substance of this intermediate skeleton seems to have been deposited.
The distribution of this canal-system, although often well displayed in
transparent sections, is most beautifully shown (as in P0/_1/alomella       by                         |])
the siliceous casts which are left after the solution of the shell, these casts
being the exact models of the extensions of the sarcode-body that origi_
nally occupied its passages.
   In those portions of the organism in which the chambers, instead of
                                                            “ acervuline ”
being regularly arranged in <U+FB02>oors, are piled together in an
manner, there       little trace either of “intermediate skeleton” or of
                          is
“canal-system”; but the characteristic structure of their proper walls                                       is
still unmistakeably exhibited.
   Whilst, therefore, most fully accord with Dr. Dawson

Eo:0on Canadense, notwithstanding its massive dimensions and its zoophytic

immediate allinity as being rather with the Nummuline than with the
Rotaline serics—that affinity being marked by the structure of the proper
wall of the chambers, which, as have elsewhere endeavoured to show 1T,

is acharacter of primary importance in this group, the plan of growth a
the mode of communication of the chambers being of secondary value, a
the disposition of the “intermediate skeleton” and its “canal-system
being of yet lower account.
   I   cannot refrain from stopping to draw your attention to the fact, th
the organic structure and the zoological affinities of this body, which w
at <U+FB01>rst supposed to be a product of purely physical operations, are th
determinable by the microscopic examination of an area no larger than
pin-hole—and that we are thus enabled to predicate the nature of t
living action by which it was produced, at a geological epoch who
remoteness in time carries us even beyond the range of the imaginatio
with no less certainty than the astronomer can now, by the aid of “ spectru
analysis,” determine the chemical and physical constitution of bodies who
remoteness     in space alike transcends our power to conceive.
   The only objections which are likely to be raised by palazontologists
such a determination of the nature of Eozoon, would be suggested by 
zoophytic mode of growth, and by its gigantic size.              The <U+FB01>rst objectio
however, is readily disposed of, since I have elsewhere shown * that
minute      organism long ranked as zoophytic, and described by Lamar
under the designation Millepora rubra, is really but an aberrant form
the Rotaline family of FORAMINIFERA, its peculiarity consisting only
the mode of increase of its body, every segment of which has the chara
teristic structure of the Rotalinw; and thus, so far from presenting
difficulty, the zoophytic character of Eozoon leads us to assign it a place
the Nummuline series exactly corresponding to that of Polytrema in t
Rotaline. And the objection arising from the size and massiveness
Eozoon loses all its force when we bear in mind that the increase of FOR
MINIFERA generally takes place by gemmation, and that the size whi
any individual may attain mainly depends (as in the Vegetable kingdom
 upon the number of segments which bud continuously from the origin
stock, instead of detaching themselves to form independent organisms;
that there is no essential       di<U+FB01>'erence  save that   of continuity, between t
largest mass of Eozoon and an equal mass made up of a multitude
Nummulitea.         Moreover there is other evidence that very early in t
Palaeozoic age the Foraminiferous type attained a development to which 
have nothing comparable at any later epoch; for it has been shown 
Mr. J. W. Salter 1' that the structure of the supposed coral of the Sil
rian    series  to which the name Receptaculites has been given, so close
corresponds with that which I have demonstrated in certain forms of t
 Orbilolite type I, as to leave no doubt of their intimate relationshi
although the disks of Receptaculites           sometimes attain a diameter of
inches, whilst that of the largest Orbitolite          I have seen does not rea

115-tbs  of  an inch.   And it is further remarkable in this instance, that the
gigantic size attained by Receptaculites proceeds less from an extraordinary
multiplication of segments, than from such an enormous development of
the individual segments as naturally to suggest grave doubts of the charac
ter of this fossil, until the exactness of its structural conformity to its
comparatively minute recent representative had been worked out.
    In a private communication to myself, Dr. Dawson has expressed the
belief that Slrosualopora and several other reputed corals of the Palaaozoic
series will prove in reality to be gigantic Zoophytic Rhizopods, like Eczema
and Receplaculilea; and I have little doubt that further inquiry will
justify this anticipation. Should it prove correct, our ideas of the import
ance   of the Rhizopod type in the earlier periods of     geological history will
undergo a vast extension; and many questions will         arise in regard to its
relations to those higher types which it would seem       to have anticipated.
    In the present state of our knowledge, however,       or rather of our igno
rance,   I  think  it better to  leave  all such questions undiscussed, limiting
 myself to the special object of this communication—the application of my

        Philosophical Society.         Communicated by Ronmvr        L1-:1-2, M.D.
        Received November 1, 1864.
                                     ( Abstract.)
    After some introductory remarks, the author observes that the intes
 tines of the fmtus, between the <U+FB01>fth and ninth months of intra-uterine life,
 “contain a <U+FB02>occulent substance of orange-pink colour in the duodenal
 portion, a slimy green substance (the ineconium) in their lower portion.
    “The nature of the former was ascertained by Dr. Prout to be highly
 albuminous and nutritious.         The nature of the latter, of which Dr. John
 Davy has given a complete analysis (Trans. Med. Chir. Soc.), is simply
 excrementitious. In the intermediate portion of the intestine the substance
 is of intermediate character; the more nutritive its property, the higher its
 position in the intestine.”                                                      »
    He next points out that the mesenteric glands which belong to the

duodenum are most numerous, and that they diminish towards the lower
portion of the intestine; so that they are in greatest number where the
intestine contains most nutritive substance.
    “ From this examination,” the author continues, “              no further   proof is
required that digestion and absorption are performed, as Harvey believed,
during fmtal life.                                _
    “The origin of     the albuminous      substance     in the intestine was supposed
by Harvey to be the liquor amnii, which he attempts to prove is swallowed
                                                                          '
by the ftetus in utero.
  “ In the Bird, as will be seen, the origin of this albuminous substance
was ascribed by John Hunter to the yelk-sac.
    “ In   the year 1829       it   was shown by   Dr. Robert Lee, in    a paper pub
                                                    ‘
lished in the Philosophical Transactions,  On the Functions of the Foetal
Liver and  Intestiues,’ that Harvey’s explanation was not correct, and that
there is satisfactory evidence to prove that the Liver is the source of this
                                                                                 '
albuminous substance.”
    In   the foetal   bird                of incubation, or later, “ the liver
                             on the twelfth day
is seen to occupy both sides of the abdomen, as in the human foetus.      The
yelk-sac is seen <U+FB01>xed to the small intestine; the white more than half
absorbed.   The umbilical vein receives blood from the chorion membrane,
in which it has been exposed to the in<U+FB02>uence of the oxygen of the atmo
sphere; it receives blood also from the yelk-sac and from the white.        So
that the nature of the blood in the portal vein of the fmtal bird is both
highly nutritious and arterial in character.
   “The intestines are in the same condition as in the human foetus.
   “ The origin of the albuminous substance may be ascertained to be from
the same organ, namely, from the liver.
   “That John Hunter was mistaken in supposing that albumen passed
through the vitelline duet (that part of the yelk-sac which is connected
with the intestine), is generally allowed ; and his supposition may be almost
disproved by the fact that it is not possible to inject any <U+FB02>uid into the
yelk-sac from the intestine.    Besides, Hunter states that it passes through
only at     the time of hatching, which is not the case, as the intestines
are   full long before the bird is hatched. The lacteals of the ftntal bird
cannot be seen.
    “To  take another class of animals, the Marsupialia.  The liver in the
foetal kangaroo at the time of birth (that     in the sixth week of mere
                                                        is,
gestatiou), in the words   of Professor Owen, ‘consisted of two equal and
symmetrically diposed lobes’ (Art. ‘Marsupialia,’ Cyclopsed. Anat. and
Physiology). As soon, however, as the mode of life        changed and the
                                                                   is
umbilical vein closed, the liver begins to diminish in size.  Yet there                is
this resemblance between       Marsupial animal <U+FB01>ve or six months old, and
                                    a

nutrition     different, yet the intestines are supplied with nutritive sub

in one    case being derived    from the    placenta, in the other        from    the
mamrna    of the mother kangaroo.
   “ From the foregoing facts certain conclusions may          be drawn.
   “ I. With regard to the placenta.
   "Since the organs of the fatal bird are in the same condition as in the
human foetus, the nature of the blood supplied to them is probably the
same.    If so, the umbilical vein of the human fretus contains blood highly
nutritious and arterial in character, and therefore the function of the
placenta corresponds to that of the chorion membrane, yelk, and white
combined ; it is in fact the means of absorption, as the veins absorb
the yell: and white, and the substitute of the lung in adult life.          There is
no need of lymphatic vessels in the placenta.
   “ 2. With regard to the liver.
   “That the function of this organ is to separate a highly nutritious sub
stance from the blood of the portal vein ; and this is true both of the liver
of the furtal bird and of the human fwtus.
   “ 3. That this albuminous substance is not in a condition to be directly
absorbed from the umbilical       vein, but is elaborated and separated           for
absorption by the lacteal vessels.
   “ 4. That there is reason to believe that this function of the liver con
tinues to  a great extent during adult life   ;   for the portal vein in that state
receives veins which correspond to the umbilical vein         in the fact that they
proceed from the source of nutrition.         That the liver must be actively
engaged after the introduction     of food into the intestinal canal, and its
secretion then more plentiful than at other times."

succeeded   in climbing Mount Walnis [marked 1r], a mountain 1100 feet
high, surrounded by glaciers, and laid down as an island on the existing
charts.   [From this mountain the station marked A in Mr.Chydenius’s

White Mountain [and is marked v on the Map]. From this summit they
saw on a clear bright day the South Cape of North-east Land (;1), Mount
Liiven about the middle of llinlopen Straits on the west shore, and the
station marked        in   on the eastern shore.     Having thus     ascertained       satisfac
tory points in the Stortjord, they proceeded again to the west coast of
Spitzbergen, with the intention of pushing to the northward as far as
possible, but had not proceeded far when they fell in with several boats
with the      crews   of wrecked sealing        vessels.   Of   course they were obliged
to take these men on board          ;    and being short   of provisions for   the increased
number of hands, and the season drawing towards its close, they put back
to Tromsoe.  The sealing vessels had been wrecked on the east side of
North-East Land, having got there by the north of the island. The men
had afterwards made their way in the boats through Hinlopen Straits,
having thus circumnavigated North-East Land—a feat said never to have
been accomplished before.

       Action of Total Daylight." By llt;.\'ni' E. Roscoe, B.A., l".R.S.
       Received November        8, 1864.
                                     (Abstract .)
    The aim of the present communication is to describe a simple mode of
measuring the chemical action of total daylight, adapted to the purpose of
regular meteorological registration.         This method is founded upon that
described by Prof. Bunsen and the author in their last Memoir* on Photo
chemical l\lensuremt-nts,    depending upon the law that equal products of the
intensity of the acting light into the times of insolation correspond within
very wide limits to equal shades of tints produced upon chloride-of-silver
paper of uniform sensitiveness—light of the intensity 50, acting for the
 time l, thus producing the same blackening effect as light of the intensity
 1 acting for the time 50.      For the purpose of exposing this paper to light
 for a known but very short length of time, a pendulum photometer was
 constructed ; and by means of this instrument a strip of paper is so exposed
 that the different times of insolation for all points along the length of the
 strip can be calculated to within small fractions of a second, when the
 duration and amplitude of vibration of the pendulum are known.                  The
 strip of sensitive paper insolated during the oscillation of the pendulum
 exhibits throughout its length a regularly diminishing shade from dark to
 white; and by reference to a Table, the time needed to produce any one of
 these  shades   can be ascertained.      The unit of photo-chemical action is
 assumed to be that intensity of light which produces in the unit of time
 (one second) a given but arbitrary degree of shade termed the standard
 tint. The reciprocals of the times during which the points on the strip
 have to be exposed     in order to attain the standard tint, give the intensities
 of the acting light expressed in terms of the above unit.
    By means of this method a regular series of daily observations can be
 kept up without di<U+FB02>iculty ; the whole apparatus needed can be packed up
 into small space; the observations can be carried on without regard to wind
 or weather  ;  and no less than forty-<U+FB01>ve separate determinations can be made
 upon 36 square centimetres of sensitive paper.             Strips of the standard
 chloride-of-silver paper tinted in the pendulum photometer remain as the
 basis of the new mode of measurement.               Two strips of this paper are
 exposed as usual in the pendulum photometer           : one of these strips is <U+FB01>xed

              memoir.
        The <U+FB01>xed strips are prepared in the pendulum apparatus, and after
      wards <U+FB01>xed in hyposulphite of sodium.     A series of experiments   nex     is
      detailed, carried out for the purpose of ascertaining whether these <U+FB01>xe
      strips undergo any alteration by exposure to light, or when preserved in th
      dark.   Two consecutive strips were cut o<U+FB01> from large number of differen
                                                           a
      sheets, and the point upon each at which the shade was equal to that         of th
      standard tint was determined.       One half   of these strips   were carefully pre
      served in the dark, the other half exposed to direct and diffuse sunlight fo
      periods varying from fourteen days to six months, and the position 
      equality of tint with the standard tint from time to time determined.      I
      appears, from large number of such comparisons, that in almost all cases a
                        a
      irregular, and in some cases    arapid fading takes place immediately afte
      the strips have been prepared, and that this fading continues for about s
      to eight weeks from the date of the preparation.      It was, however, foun
      that, after this length of time has elapsed, neither exposure to sunlight no
      preservation in the dark produces the slightest change of tint, and that, fo
      many months from this time, the tint of the strips may be considered a
      perfectly unalterable.
         The value of the proposed method of measurement entirely depend
      upon the possibility of accurately determining the intensities of the variou
                 of the <U+FB01>xed strip in terms of the known intensities of the standar

giving the results obtained in several series of determinations, in order that
the amount of experimental error may be estimated.          Curves exhibiting
the graduation  of several strips are also given;  and from  these the author
concludes that the determinations agree as well as can be expected from
such photometric experiments, the mean error between the positions 40
and 80 min. on the strip in one series of graduations not exceeding 1 per
cent. of the measured intensity.  To each <U+FB01>xed strip a Table is attached,
giving the intensity of the light which must act for I second upon the
standard paper, in order to produce the tints at each millimetre of the
length of the strip.
  The methods of exposure        and reading are next described.             The exposure
of the paper is effected very simply by pasting pieces of standard sensitive
paper upon an insolation band, and inserting the band into a thin metal
slide having a small opening at the top and furnished with a cover, which
can be made instantly to open or close the hole under which the sensitive
paper is placed.   When one observation has thus been made, and the time
and duration of the insulation noted, the remaining papers can be similarly
exposed at any required time; and thus the determinations can he very
easily carried on at short intervals throughout the day.
  The reading-instrument consists of a small metallic drum, furnished
with a millimetre scale, and upon which the graduated strip is fastened.
The drum turns upon a horizontal axis, and the insolation band, with the
                                                                                       by
                          it,
exposed  papers upon      isheld against the graduated strip, so that
moving the drum on its horizontal axis the various shades of the strip are
made to pass and repass each of the papers on the insolation band, and the
points of coincidence of tint on the strip and on each of the exposed
papers can be easily ascertained        by   reading of? with the monochromatic
soda-<U+FB02>ame.
  In the next   section   of   the paper the author investigates the accuracy
and trustworthiness of the method.           This   is   tested   in the <U+FB01>rst place    by
making simultaneous measurements of the chemical action of daylight by
the new method and by means of the pendulum photometer, according to
the mode described in the last memoir, upon which the new method                       is
founded.    Duplicate determinations of the varying chemical intensity
thus made every half-hour on four separate days give results which agree
closely with each other, as  seen by reference to the Tables and <U+FB01>gures
                                is
showing   the curves of daily chemical intensity which are given in the
paper.   Hence the author concludes that the unavoidable experimental
errors arising from graduation, exposure, and reading are not of su<U+FB01>icient
magnitude   materially to affect the accuracy of the measurement. As                    a
second test of the trustworthiness and availability of the method for actual
measurement,   the author gives        results of determinations made with two
instruments independently       by   two observers at the same time, and on the
same spot.   The tabulated results thus obtained serve              as   a  fair sample of
the accuracy with which        the actual measurement        can   be   carried out; and

 the curves given represent graphically the results of these double obse
 tions. From the close agreement of these curves, it is seen that the met
 is available for practical measurement.
     In order to show that the method        can be applied to the purpose
 actual registration,   the author gives the results of determinations of
 varying intensity   of  the chemical action of total daylight at Manchester
 more than forty days, made at the most widely differing seasons of
 year.     These measurements reveal some of the interesting results to w
 a wide series of such measurements must lead.         They extend from Aug
  1863 to September 1864;       and  Tables  are  given in which the detail
 observations are found, whilst the varying chemical intensity for each
 is expressed graphically by a curve.
    As a rule, one observation was made every half-hour; frequently, h
 ever, when the object was either to control the accuracy of the meas
 ment or to record the great changes which suddenly occur when the
 is obscured or appears from behind a cloud, the determinations were m
 at intervals of a few minutes or even seconds.                        .
    Consecutive    observations   were carried on for each day for nearl
 month, from June ltith to July 9th, 1864; the labour of carrying
 these was not found to be very great, and the results obtained are of g
 interest.    By reference to the Tables, it is  seen that the amount of che
 cal action generally corresponds to the amount of cloud or sunshine
 noted in the observation; sometimes, however, a considerable and sud
 alteration   in the chemical intensity occurred when no apparent chang
 the amount of light could be noticed by the eye.            The remarkable
 sorptive action exerted upon the chemically active rays by small quanti
 of suspended particles of water in the shape of mist, or haze, is also cle
 shown.      For the purpose of expressing the relation of the sums of all
 various hourly intensities, giving the daily mean chemical intensities of
place, a rough method of integration is resorted to: this consists in de
mining the weights of the areas of paper inscribed between the base-
and the curve     of daily intensity, that chemical action being taken   as 1
which the unit of intensity would produce if acting continuously
twenty-four hours.        The remarkable differences observed in the chem
intensity on two neighbouring days is noticed on the curves for the 2
and 22nd of June 1864: the integrals for these days are 50'!) and 1
or the chemical actions on these days are in the ratio of 1 to 2'34.
    The chemical action of light at Manchester     was determined at the win
and summer solstices, and the vernal and autumnal equinoxes: the res
of these measurements are seen by reference to the accompanying cur
The integral for the winter solstice is 4'7, that of the vernal equinox 36
 that of the summer solstice 119, and that of the autumnal equinox 2
 Hence,    if the chemical action on the shortest day be taken as the u
 that upon the equinox will be represented by 7, and that upon the long
  day by 25.

   The results of simultaneous      measurements   made  at  Heidelberg and
Manchester, and Dingwall and .\ianchester, are next detailed.
   From the integrals of daily intensity the mean monthly and annual
chemical intensity can be ascertained, and thus we may obtain a know
ledge of the distribution of the chemically acting rays upon the earth's
surface, such as we possess for the heating rays.

  of the Admiralty Court of Scotland and author of a well-known work on
  the law of Scotland respecting tithes.      He was born in Edinburgh on the
  30th of November 1794. Having received his early education at the High
  School of that city, he (in l808) entered the University, where he studied
  under Playfair, Leslie, Dugald Stewart, and Hope.           Mr. Connell then be
  came for a time a student in the University of Glasgow, and having there
 obtained a Snell Exhibition, he went to Balliol College, Oxford, in l8l2.
  In 1817 he passed Advocate at the Scotch Bar, but never practised;         follow
 ing a decided turn for science which had early shown itself, he devoted
 himself to the pursuit of chemistry, which became his main occupation,
 and in 1840 he was appointed to the professorship of that science in the
  University of St. Andrews.        In St. Andrews Mr. Connell continued to
 study and teach his favourite science till l8.36, when the fracture of a limb,
 and its effects upon a constitution already long enfeebled, completely in
 capacitated him for active duty.
     Mr. Connell   was chosen a Fellow    of this Society at the annual election
 in 1855; from     1829 he had been a Fellow       of the Royal Society of Edin
                   ‘              ’           ‘                                     ’
 burgh, in whose Transactions or in the Edinburgh Philosophical Journal
 his various scienti<U+FB01>c memoirs and communications have appeared. Most
 of his published researches belong to the province of mineral analysis, in
 which he justly attained a high reputation for skill and accuracy.        To him
 is due the merit of establishing several new mineral species, and of showing
 that in certain minerals baryta exists in combination with silicic acid; and
 as an example of his nicety as an analyst, we may refer to his determination
 of the constitution of Greenockite from     a single grain  of that mineral.    But
 Mr. Connell’s labours as a chemist were not con<U+FB01>ned to a single <U+FB01>eld of
 inquiry; he was the author of valuable researches on voltaic decompositions,
published in the Transactions of the Royal Society of Edinburgh; and he
contrived an instrument for ascertaining the dew-point, which is superior
 in some respects to that generally used.
     Mr. Connell died   on the 31st of October 1863.          He was of a modest,
retiring  nature  and  gentle disposition.      To  those  who enjoyed his private
friendship, it was well known that the merit he evinced as an earnest and
faithful worker in science was but the manifestation, in that special direction,
of the excellent qualities which belonged to his natural character.
    EDWARD Josnua Coon-zn, one of our most distinguished amateur
astronomers, received the <U+FB01>rst impulses which made him pursue that
science from his mother's early teaching, and from his visits to the Armagh
Observatory while at the endowed school of that city.           Thence he passed
to Eton, and from it to Christ Church, Oxford, where it may be feared
that in those days he met little encouragement in his favourite pursuit.

       After leaving Oxford            he travelled extensively, with    a   sextant,   chronometer,
       and telescope as his inseparable companions.   While at Naples in 1820
       he met Sir William Drummond, some of whose wild inferences from the
       Dendera Zodiac he showed to be inconsistent with sound astronomy.   Sir
       William replied that  these objections were based on the inaccuracy of the
       existing drawings   and ;Mr. Cooper met that by going to Egypt, securing
       the services of an accomplished Italian artist, and bringing home correct
       plans of the Dendera ceiling, which, with many other drawings, he printed
       for private distribution under the title ‘Egyptian Scenery.’      He thence
       visited Persia, Turkey, Germany, and Scandinavia as far as the North
       Cape, accumulating      great mass of observations of latitude and longitude,
                                   a
       which  unfortunately remain unpublished.    Shortly after his return to
       Ireland the death of his uncle placed him in possession of   large estate,       a
1'-'   and enabled him to carry out on great scale the plan which he had formed
                                                   a
       of determining some portion of the small stars which were in general
       neglected by the great observatories.  In the year 1831 he purchased, from
       Cauchoix of Paris, an object-glass of 133 inches aperture and 25 feet
       focus, the largest then existing, which in 1834 was mounted with perfect
       success at his magni<U+FB01>cent mansion of Markree, on an equatorial constructed
       by Mr. Grubb of Dublin. It        of cast iron (the <U+FB01>rst application of that
                                                  is
       material to astronomical instruments), and stands in the open air, encircled
       by the buildings of    <U+FB01>rst-rate observatory, which contain, among other
                                   a
       chq/Is-d’aeuvres,<U+FB01>ne meridian-circle by Ertel, with eight microscopes, and
                           a
       an 8-inch object-glass. These instruments were at once applied to active
       work, in which he had most able cooperator, his <U+FB01>rst assistant, Mr. A.
                                         a
       Graham; and the Memoirs of the Royal Astronomical Society and of the
       Royal Irish Academy (of both which he was            member) bear ample
                                                                         a
       testimony of their diligence. One result of their labours was the discovery
       of the planet Metis     but his greatest work
                                   ;                    his ‘Catalogue of Ecliptic
                                                                    is
       Stars.’    This (which
                            was published by aid from the Government grant
       placed at the disposal of the Royal Society, and which the Royal Irish
       Academy honoured with their Cunningham Medal) contains upwards of
       60,000 stars down to the 12th magnitude, of which very few had been
       previously observed.            The    places   are reduced to 1850, and though only
       approximate, possess     sut<U+FB01>cient degree of precision for the use to which
                                   a
       they were destined.    Their probable error     -_|_-2"'6, both in right ascen

       sion and in declination.  The value of this Catalogue to future astronomers
       can scarcely be overrated, for many facts tend to show that much          to be      is
       learned by studying these minute stars.  As an instance,    may be stated  it
       that <U+FB01>fty stars of his own Catalogue and twenty-seven of others’ were
       found to have disappeared during the progress of the observations. Many
       of these, no doubt, are variable; many probably are unknown planets;
       some perhaps have great proper motion.           But when shall we have such               a
       survey    of the whole sky       that of this comparatively small zone!
                                         as
          He promised      a   <U+FB01>fth volume, the materials for which are nearly complete,

   as is also the case with a set     of star-charts, in which,    besides all the stars
   actually observed, as many are inserted as could be interpolated by the eye.
   It is much to be desired that these should not be lost to astronomy; and
   all who love that science will express a hope that his representatives will
   complete a work which has done such honour to their name.
      Mr. Cooper continued to observe almost up to his death, which occurred
  on   April  23, 1863, shortly after that       of his wife, to whom he was deeply
  attached.     The   date  of his election into the Royal Society is June      2, 1853.
   He   represented   the county   of Sligo in Parliament for many years,       and was
  a kind and good landlord, making great exertions to educate and improve
  his numerous tenantry.           His personal qualities were of a high order,
  blameless and fascinating in private life, a sincere Christian, no mean poet,
  an accomplished painter and linguist, an exquisite musician, and possessing
  a wide and varied range of general information.
      Joanna FIELD        was a member     of  a  well-known <U+FB01>rm of Civil Engineers
  at Lambeth.       The chief occupation of his life was mechanical engineering,
  and he had an important share in the improvements which have been made
  during his time in the construction of marine steam-engines.                Mr. Field
  was one    of the founders of     the  Institution of Civil Engineers,     and one  of
  its earliest Vice-Presidents.       In  1848    he was elected President, on which
  occasion    he, in his inaugural      address,   gave a sketch of the progress of
  improvement      in   steam   navigation.     He   became a Member of the Royal
  Society in 1836.         His death took place on the 11th of August 1863,
  at the age of 76.
      RICHARD Fowum, M.D., the oldest Fellow of                the Royal Society, died
  at his residence,       Milford, near Salisbury, April       13,  1863,  in his 98th
  year.     He   was   born   in London, November 28,           1765, and at an early
  age was so feeble in health, that it was thought necessary to send him to
  reside with a relation in Sta<U+FB01>brdshire.          He was thence sent to Edinburgh
  for his education.       While yet a youth he was entered for the medical pro
  fession,  and   while pursuing his studies he eagerly embraced the oppor
  tunity of attending the lectures on Moral and Political Philosophy of
  Dugald Stewart, to whose in<U+FB02>uence he ever afterwards referred with grati
  tude. From Edinburgh he proceeded to Paris, at a time when Louis XVI.,
  Marie Antoinette, and the Dauphin were yet to be seen in their regal state;
  and Dr. Fowler was fond of telling how he saw them thus, and also of
  having exchanged         greetings with Talleyrand while yet the young and
  courtly Bishop of Autun.          He remained long enough in Paris to witness
  much of the strife of the <U+FB01>rst French Revolution.              He was personally ac
, quainted with Mirabeau, and often listened to his eloquence in the National
  Assembly.       On his return to Edinburgh he was admitted, in Nov. 1790, a
  Member of the Speculative Society of that city, which had been founded in
  1764, and has numbered among its members some of the most eminent
                                                                          b 2

        men       of Great Britain.   Dr. Fowler   was an active member, and brought
        forward questions on politics and social economy for discussion.       He early
        adopted   the Liberal side in politics, and that of  complete toleration in reli
        gion, and throughout his long career     he  was   asteady supporter of  Liberal
        principles.   In 1793 he published       work entitled ‘Experiments and Ob
                                                   a
        servations relative to the in<U+FB02>uence lately discovered by M. Galvani, and
        commonly called Animal Electricity.’ The work consists of 176 pages,
        and contains an account of numerous experiments with different metals on
        frogs, the earthworm, the hearts of cats and rabbits, &c. The work also
        contains    letter from Professor Robison giving an account of some ex
                      a
        periments with dissimilar metals. Dr. Fowler took his medical degree at
        the University of Edinburgh, Sept. 12, 1793; he was admitted Licen
        tiate of the Royal College of Physicians of London in March 1796, about
        which time he settled at Salisbury, and was elected Physician to the In
        <U+FB01>rmary of that city, an office which he <U+FB01>lled during forty years; after
        which he continued to be one of its consulting physicians to the time of
        his death.  In 1802 he was elected     Fellow of the Royal Society.
                                                       a                       In
        1805 he married the daughter of William Bowles, Esq., of Heale House.
        He had an extensive medical practice during many years, and    still more
                                                                           a
        extensive acquaintance with the leading men of the day, for which he was
        partly indebted to his early friendship with the Marquis of Lansdowne and
        Lord Holland, and also to his own social qualities and conversational
        powers, the latter being enlivened by anecdote, apt quotation, and varied
        knowledge, which enabled him to say something agreeably and well on
        almost every subject; at the same time his kindly nature mellowed and
        improved everything he said and did.   In 1831 he became      Member of
                                                                         a
        the British Association, and during  number of years made frequent com

                            it

        in his 94th year,        the journey to Aberdeen for the purpose of being
                              made
        present at the Congress.    He took great interest in the mental condition
        of the deaf, dumb, and blind, and was fond of inquiring how         was that
                                                                           it

        sagacious of the lower animals, and how by touch alone the meaning of
        others can be communicated to the blind and deaf, and instantly inter
        preted.   During the later years of his life, Dr. Fowler was himself af<U+FB02>icted
        with loss of sight.  Indeed, in his work published in 1793, he complains
        (page 76) that the weak state of his eyes did not permit him to look in
        tently at minute objects. Nevertheless his mental activity was so great,
        that when he could no longer see to read he kept employed two men and
        two boys in reading to him, and writing down from his dictation memo
an--'
        randa for future papers. One of his latest acts, in conjunction with Mrs.
        Fowler, was to purchase and endow     suitable home for the Salisbury and
                                                   a
                   Wiltshire Museum, in which he took great interest, and bestowed
                                                           a
        South
        on   it   alarge portion of his books and collections. Dr. Fowler was also    a

                                          V
   Fellow of the Antiquarian Society, and a member of the Zoological Society,
  and of the Edinburgh Medical and Speculative Societies.
      Panza Haanv (born Dec.       17, 1813, died   April 23, 1863) was the son
  of  an o<U+FB02>icer in the artillery, and the brother    of Mr. T. Duifus Hardy of
  the Record Office and Mr. William Hardy of the Duchy of Lancaster.
  He was educated for an actuary, was placed in the Equitable O<U+FB01>ice in l829,
  was appointed actuary of the Mutual Assurance O<U+FB01>ice in 1837, and of the
  London Assurance Ot<U+FB01>ce in 1850.          The details of his professional life,
  active and well employed as it was, o<U+FB02>'er nothing to record.         He distin
  guished himself in l839 by the publication of a sound mathematical work
  on interest, containing tables subdivided into quarter rates per cent.        In
  1840 he published a system of notation for life contingencies, which, besides
  its ingenuity, was of a practicable character.      In 1848 he was one of the
  founders of the Institute of Actuaries.    He was elected Fellow of the Royal
  Society in 1839, immediately after the publication of his <U+FB01>rst work.
  Mr. Peter Hardy possessed that talent for research which has contributed
 to render both his brothers eminent in their several walks of life.          His
 walk, indeed, did not offer any opportunities; but the taste found vent in
 the collection of old books and the study of early printing.         In this he
 would have been eminent, had it been anything but an employment of
 leisure.    His library, very large for that of an actuary, contained rare
 specimens, of which he knew the history and the literary value.
     Joan Tavnoa       was born at  Norwich, on the 22nd of August 1779,
 and died   in London on the 5th of April 1863.         He was the eldest of <U+FB01>ve
 brothers belonging to a well-known and respected family in his native city.
 In early youth Mr. Taylor showed a natural turn for mechanical contrivance,
 and a decided   bent towards the profession   of an engineer;  but as his native
~distriet a<U+FB01>'orded but little scope for engineering    work, he was brought up
 to land-surveying, as the employment within reach which seemed to fall in
 most nearly with his natural taste.       From this occupation, however, he
 was called off at the early age of nineteen, to take the management of the
 Wheal Friendship Mine in Cornwall.          Inexperienced as he then was in
 all that specially concerned mining work, he was, nevertheless, appointed
 to that charge, in reliance on his ability to master the task he was to
 undertake, and on his diligence and integrity in the performance of it.
     Soon after he became thus engaged, Mr. Taylor published, in the ‘ Phi
                        ’                       “ On the History of Mining in
losophical Magazine (for 1800), an article
 Devon and Cornwall ;” and in succeeding years he communicated to the
 world, in that and other journals, the results of his experience concerning
the operations and processes followed in mining, and the means of im
proving them, and on the general economy of mines.
     But whilst his daily occupation was in directing practical work, it was
Mr. Taylor’s constant aim to elevate the art of mining and place it on a

     scienti<U+FB01>c basis. With this purpose he (in 1829) undertook the editorship,
     and, to a considerable extent, the cost of a publication which he hoped
     would conduce to the end in view. This work, which was entitled ‘Re
     cords of Mining,’ did not meet with the support he had looked for, and was
     not continued; but the part published contains four contributions from
     his own pen. One of these, which deserves especial notice, is an excel
     lent and well-digested paper, in which he advocates the establishment of a
      School of Mines in Cornwall, and presents a “ Prospectus,” setting forth
     the details of a plan for the foundation, government, and maintenance of an
     institution of that kind, and for regulation of the instruction it should
     afford.    This proposal did not meet with encouragement at the time, but
     the establishment of the present School of Mines, although he had no
Iw
     active share in       it,
                       may be traced to Mr.Taylor’s earnest and judicious
     representations.
        In 1812 Mr. Taylor settled in London, and engaged with his brother in
     a  chemical manufactory at Stratford in Essex; but although he had long
     applied himself to chemistry as      scienti<U+FB01>c pursuit, and attained
                                              a                            high   a
     reputation as   metallurgic
                       a         chemist,  he was  compelled to relinquish  as a  it
     profession in consequence of the increased extent and importance of his
     mining business.
       Throughout his eminently practical life Mr. Taylor strove constantly to
     maintain     healthy reciprocity between science and practice; and while
                   a
     availing himself of his scienti<U+FB01>c knowledge for the improvement of tech
     nical processes, he was no less earnest in turning to account his experience
     and opportunities as mining engineer and metallurgist for the promotion
                                 a
     of the sciences of geology, mineralogy, and chemistry. We accordingly
     <U+FB01>nd his name enrolled as        a   member of various scienti<U+FB01>c bodies, both British
     and Foreign.      He    was one   of the earliest Fellows of the Geological Society,
     and from 1816 to 1844 <U+FB01>lled the office          of its Treasurer.  In 1825 he was
     elected   Fellow of the Royal Society, and repeatedly served on the Council.
               a
     But of the   several Societies to which he belonged, the British Association
     for the Advancement of Science has been the most indebted to Mr. Taylor’
     useful cooperation, both scienti<U+FB01>c and administrative.      He was, indeed,
     present at its  birth, and the <U+FB01>rst meeting of its <U+FB01>rst Council was held at
     his house.     This was on the 26th of June 1832.     He was also the <U+FB01>rst
     Treasurer, and held that o<U+FB01>ice till September 1861, when the in<U+FB01>rmities
     of age constrained him to retire from it. On relieving him from the
     duties he had so long and so well discharged, the Council of the Associa
     tion joined in    unanimous expression of respect for his character and
                       a
     gratitude for his long and valuable services to the cause of science. The
     Council of University College, London, expressed themselves in no less
     respectful and grateful terms when, for the same reason, he retired from
     the Treasurership of that Institution, which he had held for many years.
         Wrnuam Tooxn            was born on the 22nd   of November   1777, at St. Peters

                                        vii
 burg, where his father was then Chaplain to the factory of the Russian
 Company.      Mr. Tooke was a solicitor by profession, but amidst the calls
 of business he was able to devote much time and attention to public
 a<U+FB01>airs, and took part in the formation of various public institutions which
 were established   during the active period of his life.   He was long a lead
 ing member and Vice-President of the Society of Arts, and was elected
 President on the vacancy caused by the death of His Royal Highness the
 Prince Consort.     His election to the Royal Society was in 1818.       From
 1832 to I837 he sat in Parliament for the borough of Truro.           Besides
 a compilation on French history, in two volumes, which appeared in 1855,
 and occasional contributions to magazines, Mr. Tooke, when a young man,
published, anonymously, an edition of Churchill's Poems, with notes and a
Life of  the  Author, which   was favourably reviewed by Southey.      He died
in London on the 20th September 1863.
    Rear-Admiral   J oar: WASHINGTON was born on the 1st of January 1801.
 He entered the Navy in l8l2, on board the ‘Juno,’ <U+FB01>tting for the American
station, where he served for the next two years, and took part in various
active and successful   operations against the enemy.     In [814 he returned
to England, and entered the Royal Naval College at Portsmouth.          During
the two years he spent as a student in that Institution he applied himself
diligently to the scienti<U+FB01>c study of his profession, and laid the foundation
of that skill and accomplishment which he afterwards attained in nautical
surveying and hydrography, and through which in the after course of his
life he was able to render much valuable service to the maritime interests of
this and other countries.
    After serving at sea for some years, and rising to the rank of Com
mander, he returned home for a time, but in 1841 he was appointed to
continue the Survey of the North Sea, in which duty he was employed
until the close of 1844.      In 1842 he was promoted to the rank of Post
Captain.
    This Survey   was Captain Washington’s    last service a<U+FB02>oat; but his ex
perience and judgment were       tnmed   to public account at different times,
when he acted as a Royal Commissioner on important questions affecting
the interests of navigation and of our maritime industry.          In 1853 he
visited some of the Russian fortresses in the Baltic, and the results of his
observations proved of the greatest value in the conduct of the warlike
operations which soon followed.
    On the retirement of Sir Francis Beaufort, Captain Washington was
appointed Hydrographer to the Admiralty, and was promoted to the rank
of Rear-Admiral in 1862.       His anxious and unremitting application to the
various duties of his ot<U+FB01>ce is believed by his friends to have shortened his
valuable life, which was closed at Frascati, near Havre, on the 16th of
September    1863.    He was a member of various learned Societies at home
and  abroad,  and was Secretary of the Royal Geographical Society from

      1835 to 1841.      His   election into the Royal Society is dated February 13,
      l 845 .
         Ciisan MANsUi*.'rE Dnsrnrrrz was born at Lessines in Belgium, on the
      13th of May 1789.         At an early age he came to Paris for the purpose of
     devoting   himself  to  the study of chemistry and physics.      His intelligence
     and industry soon attracted the attention of Gay-Lussac, who appointed
     him répétiteur of his course of lectures on Chemistry at the Ecole Poly
     technique. He became the Professor of Physics at the Sorbonne'in 1837,
     having previously held a similar of<U+FB01>ce in the Ecole Polytechnique and the
     College Henri IV. In 1822 the Academy awarded him the prize for the
     best memoir on the causes of animal heat.            In 1825 he published an
     elementary treatise on Physics, which in 1836 reached a fourth edition;
    and in 1830 the Elements of Theoretical and Practical Chemistry. He was
    the author of numerous memoirs published in the ‘Annales de Chimie’
    and in the ‘Comptes Rendus,’ dating from 1817 up to 1858.                   These
r   memoirs    give an account of researches on the speci<U+FB01>c heat and conductivity
?   of metals and various mineral substances; on the propagation of heat in
    liquids; on the transmission of heat from one solid body to another; on
    the heat absorbed in fusion; on the elastic force of vapours; on the density
    and latent heat of vapours; on the corfpressibility of liquids; on the
    density of gas under different pressures; on the displacement and oscilla
    tions of the freezing-point of the mercurial thermometer; on the heat
    developed during combustion; on the expansion of water, and the tempera
   ture at which water and saline solutions attain a maximum density; on the
   modi<U+FB01>cations which metals undergo under the joint action of heat and
   ammoniacal gas; on the chemical action of voltaic electricity, the light and
   heat of the voltaic arc, and the intensity of the voltaic current; on the
   electricity developed by muscular contraction; on chloride of boron; on
   the decomposition of water, carbonic acid, and acetic acid; on the decom
   position of salts of lead; on the limits of high and low musical notes; on
   the fusion and volatilization of some refractory substances under the triple
   action of the voltaic battery, the sun, and the oxyhydrogen blowpipe.
        Though not successful in making any brilliant theoretical discoveries, the
  important scienti<U+FB01>c facts he has observed and arranged bring his name
  perpetually before the reader of any modern treatise on Physics.                 He
  laboured hard to ful<U+FB01>l to the utmost his duties as a Professor at the Sor
  bonne; and his lectures, being carefully prepared and well illustrated by
  experiments, attracted a numerous auditory.           He was elected a Foreign
  Member      of this  Society  in  1862.
       His character was upright and benevolent, his tastes simple, and his
  habits regular in the extreme.          It was his custom every year to make a
  long excursion      in  England, Germany, or Italy, by himself, and without
  letting any one know the day of his departure from Paris.
        His last illness was preceded by several slight attacks of cerebral con

                                         ix
gestion. These were followed by congestion of the lungs, of which he died
on the 15th of March I863.
   EILHARDT Mrrscmzaucn was born on the 7th of January 1794, in
the village of Jever in Oldenburg.       His father was pastor of Neuende; his
uncle, the well-known philologer, was Professor in Giittingen.           He was
educated at the Gymnasium of Jever, under the historian Schlosser.
Following the example of his uncle, and encouraged by Schlosser, he
devoted    himself to the study of history, pliilology, and especially the
Persian language.      In order to prosecute these studies, he went in ltlll
to the University of Heidelberg, and in 1813 to Paris.          He had hoped to
be allowed to accompany an embassy         to Persia, but was prevented by the
fall of Napoleon.      In  I81-1, on his return to Germany,       be commenced
writing   a  history of the Ghurides and Kara-Chitayens, compiled from
manuscripts in the Giittingen Library, and of which a specimen was
                                         “ llirchondi historia Thaheridarum.”
published in l8l5 under the title
Unwilling to renounce his favourite project of travelling in Persia, he de
termined to accomplish it without any extraneous assistance.           The only
way in which it appeared possible to travel was in the character of a phy
sician; accordingly he resolved to study medicine.         He went to Gottingen
for this purpose, and <U+FB01>rst applied himself to          the introductory sciences,
especially to chemistry, which so fascinated him that he gave up philo
logy and his intention to visit Persia.        In 1818 he went to Berlin for the
purpose of obtaining license to lecture.        Link allowed him to carry on his
researches   in  the laboratory   of the  University.    Here he undertook the
examination of the phosphates and arseniates, and con<U+FB01>rmed the accuracy
of the latest conclusion arrived at by Berzelius, viz. that phosphoric and
arsenic acid contain each <U+FB01>ve equivalents of oxygen, while phosphorous
and arsenious acid contain three equivalents.           He noticed at the same
time that the similarly constituted phosphates and arseniates crystallized
in similar forms.     Up to this period   he had never paid any especial atten
tion to crystallography, but the conviction that he was on the eve of a
great discovery allowed him no rest; he studied the laws of crystallo
graphy, learned the method of measuring the angles of crystals, and soon
satis<U+FB01>ed himself that the phosphates and arseniates are not merely similar
but identical in form, and that, consequently, bodies exist of dissimilar
composition having the same crystalline form, and that these bodies are
compounds containing respectively the same number of equivalents. Many
minerals appeared to con<U+FB01>rm this law, viz. the carbonates, dolomite, chaly
bite, diallogite and calcite, and the sulphates, baryte, celestine, and Angle
site. In con<U+FB01>rmation, however, of this discovery he considered it neces
sary to appeal to arti<U+FB01>cial salts which crystallize readily and distinctly, and
are easily obtained of sufficient purity, so that his conclusions might be
con<U+FB01>rmed by any one without dit<U+FB01>culty.            The neutral sulphates of prot
oxide of iron, oxide of copper, oxide of zinc, and magnesia, which all con

       tain water, mostly in different proportions, appeared peculiarly well <U+FB01>tte
       for this purpose. He found that the following were similar in form :—
       (l) sulphate of copper and sulphate of protoxide of manganese; (2) sul
       phate of protoxide of iron and sulphate of oxide of cobalt; (3) sulphat
       of magnesia, sulphate of oxide of zinc, and sulphate of oxide of nickel. H
       also found that the salts which had dissimilar forms contained     a   di<U+FB01>'erent
       number of equivalents of water, and that those which had similar form
       contained the same number.     He then mixed the solutions of the differen
       sulphates, and found that the resulting crystals had the form and the sam
       number of equivalents of water as some one of the unmixed sulphates
       Lastly, he examined the combinations of these sulphates with sulphate o
       potash, and showed that the double salts had all similar forms belonging t
       the oblique system, and that they were composed of one equivalent of th
       earthy or metallic sulphate, one equivalent of sulphate of potash, and si
       equivalents of water. The memoir in which these observations are recorde
       was presented to the Berlin Academy on the 9th of December 1819.    In th
       course   of   the preceding August Berzelius came to Berlin, on his way from
       Paris to Stockholm.   He became acquainted with Mitscherlich, and con
       ceived such an opinion of his talents, that he suggested him to th
       Minister Altenstein as the most <U+FB01>tting successor to Klaproth in the chai
\-‘I
       of Chemistry in the University of Berlin.      Altenstein did not at th
       moment act upon this suggestion, but consented to the proposal tha
       Mitscherlich should perfect his chemical education by working for some
       time under the guidance of Berzelius.   In Stockholm he continued an
       extended his researches on the phosphates and arseniates, and wrote 
       memoir on the subject, which appeared in the Transactions of the
                           '
       Swedish Academy.      In  he described with great care the forms of the
                                  it
       acid and neutral phosphates and arseniates of potash, soda, and ammonia
       the neutral double salts of potash and soda, and of ammonia and soda, and
       the phosphates and arseniates of oxide of lead.   He showed in every case
       that the phosphates and arseniates have similar forms and analogous com
       positions.  Urged by Berzelius to give      aname to this newly detected
       property of the chemical elements, be designated       it  by the term iso
       morphism.    This  discovery was  of the  highest importance to the theory o
       chemical equivalents, inasmuch as     it explained the exceptions to the law
       of de<U+FB01>nite proportions in the mineral system of Berzelius.        It appeared
       moreover, from the crystallization of the mixtures of the di<U+FB01>'erent sulphates,
       that isomorphous substances combine in all proportions; and that they re
       place one another in inde<U+FB01>nite proportions in the composition of minerals
       was proved by Mitscherlich’s fellow-students, Heinrich Rose and Bons
       dorff, in the cases of augite and amphibole.
         The doctrine of isomorphism, moreover, was an admirable test of the
       determination of the equivalents of the different elements, whilst the
       smallness of the number of changes in the equivalents of the simple sub
       stances that followed the discovery of isomorphism,  an indication of the
                                                             is

                                           xi
admirable sagscity with which they had been determined by Berzelius.
Mineralogists and chemists had long been occupied with researches on the
relation between chemical composition and crystalline form; they had
discovered a number of important facts bearing upon the subject, but no
one had discovered the basis upon which           the phenomena rested.       Fuchs
had already observed that some of the constituents of a mineral might be
replaced by others without any change of form, and had called these con
stituents vicarious, but by adducing the sesquioxide of iron and lime as
vicarious constituents in Gehlenite, he showed that the true explanation
had eluded his grasp. Fuchs had moreover remarked the close resemblance
of the mineral sulphates to one another, as well as that of the rhombohedral
carbonates.        He also showed that strontianite was not rhombohedral as
 Hauy supposed, but prismatic, and that it resembled Aragonite in form.
The small percentage of strontian detected in Aragonite by Stromeyer was
 regarded by Fuchs as the cause of the resemblance of the forms of the
 two minerals, as the very small quantity of carbonate of lime in chalybite
 had been supposed the cause of its resemblance to calcite. The only con
 clusion which Fuchs drew from the resemblances of these minerals was, that
 certain substances       possess such an overpowering     force of crystallization,
 that, even when present in small quantity, they constrain other substances
 to assume their form.
     In November l82l Mitscherlich returned to Berlin, was elected a Mem
 ber of the Academy of Sciences and appointed Professor extraordinary
 in the University, and remained in that position till H425, when he became
 Professor in ordinary.       In the summer of 1822 he gave his <U+FB01>rst lecture on
 Chemistry to      a large audience.    He also continued his researches on isomor
  phism, and those which he had commenced in Stockholm, especially those
  which bore upon the arti<U+FB01>cial formation of minerals.          He exhibited to the
  Academy a collection of about forty crystallized substances, which he had
  found in the        slag-heaps surrounding the copper-smelting furnaces of
  Fahlun during a visit he paid to that place in 1820, in the company of
  Berzelius.      Of these, however, he described only two, a silicate of prot
  oxide of iron isomorphous with olivine, and a mica, the composition of
  which approximates closely to that of a black mica of Siberia.              He re
  sumed these researches along with Berthier in the winter of 1823 and
   1824, which      he passed in Paris, and by fusing the mineral constituents
  together    in  proper proportions, succeeded in producing diopside, idocrase,
  and garnet.
      In the course of his examination of the phosphates and arseniates he
  had observed that the acid phosphate of soda crystallizes in two totally
   different forms, both of which belong to the prismatic system, but cannot
  be    referred to the same parameters.         From this he inferred that the
   ultimate atoms of crystallized bodies by change of circumstances may ad
   mit of a change in their arrangement, and hazarded the opinion that, as
   Aragonite     resembles   strontianite and cerussite in form, and calcite re

      sembles dolomite, chalybite, and diallogite,      possible for the substances
                                                       it   is
      isomorphous with Aragonite to crystallize in the form of calcite, and the
      substances isomorphous with calcite to crystallize in the form of Aragonite,
      and so greatly enlarge each group of isomorphous bodies. This opinion
      was looked upon with great distrust by chemists and mineralogists.         All
       the examples he had brought forward were taken from compound bodies,
       which possibly might have contained admixtures which analysis had failed
       to detect, and the substances assumed to have the same composition might
       after all be different.   These doubts were suggested by the analyses of
      Aragonite, which had been pronounced by some of the most eminent che
      mists of the time to be pure carbonate of lime; then Stromeyer detected
      strontia in       it,
                     which, notwithstanding that its amount was very small, and
      different in Aragonite from different localities, was immediately regarded as
      the cause of the difference of its form from that of calcite; lastly, Buch
      holtz proved the existence of     variety of Aragonite absolutely free from
                                           a
      any admixture of strontia, to which, therefore, the difference of form could
      not by any possibility be due.   At this conjuncture Mitscherlich made the
      remarkable discovery that sulphur also takes different forms under di<U+FB01>erent
      circumstances. The crystals obtained from solutions belong to the pris
      matic system, and are identical in form with those which occur in nature      ;
      but when sulphur      fused and allowed to cool, with proper management
                                  is
      distinct crystals are obtained, but they are entirely di<U+FB01>"erent from the
      former, inasmuch as they belong to the oblique system.       This observation
      was of great importance, because sulphur being     simple
                                                             a    substance crystal
      lizable at pleasure in either of its two forms, the difference of form could
      not be attributed to     difference of composition.
                                   a                       He had already proved
      that the acid phosphate of soda and carbonate of lime possessed the same
      property of crystallization in two different forms, which he now considered
      asappertaining to all simple substances and their chemical combinations,
      and to which he gave the name of dimorphism.      He regarded       it,
                                                                        more
      over,   affording an explanation of the fact that bodies possessing analo
                 as
      gous chemical constitutions are not always isomorphous.    The memoir on
      the dimorphism of sulphur was presented to the Academy on the 26th of
      July      1826.
-<,        It   was found that the forms   of isomorphous
                                                      substances are not absolutely
      identical, except, of course,    when they belong to the cubic system, but
      exhibit some differences, showing that the chemical nature of the substance
      is not altogether without in<U+FB02>uence on the form.     In order to determine
      the difference between the angles of isomorphous bodies with greater
      accuracy than was attainable by the use of the ordinary Wollaston’s gonio
      meter, he caused      goniometer to be constructed by Pistor, provided with
                              a
      four verniers, each reading to 10' and with
                                            ',        telescope magnifying twenty
                                                       a.
      times for viewing the re<U+FB02>exions of the signal in the faces of the crystal.
      With this instrument, in the summer of 1823 he began to measure the
       angles of calcite from Iceland, and was surprised to find differences in the

                                         xiii
angle between the same pair of cleavages amounting to 20", a difference
which, though small, was too large to be attributed to errors of pointing
or reading. The observations were made in the morning and in the after
noon in a room facing the south.       The morning observations differed from
those made in the afternoon, but the observations made at the same period
of the day agreed well with one another; also the temperature of the room
in the afternoon     was nearly 4° C. higher than in the morning.          He there
fore concluded that the variation of the angle could only be due to the un
equal expansion of the crystal in different directions.          Ile increased the
ditference of temperature by immersing the crystal in a bath of heated
mercury, and found that the cleavages became more nearly at right angles
to one another, by 8' 34", for an increase of temperature of 100° C.               In
dolomite from Traversella, Breunnerite from P<U+FB01>tsch, clialybite from Ehren
friedersdor<U+FB02>’ similar changes occurred amounting to 4' ti", 3’ 29", and
2' 22" respectively, for a change of temperature of 100° C.                 A large
number of other crystals examined by him afforded like results.               In the
winter of I823-1824, during his stay in Paris, he measured               the expan
sion of calcite in volume by Dulong’s method, and found                 it equal to
0'00l96l for 100° C. Hence it appears that by an increase               of tempera
ture of 100° C. the crystal expands 000288 in the direction              of its axis,
and contracts 000056 in a direction at right angles to its axis. He con
<U+FB01>rmed the accuracy of this most unexpected result by comparing, at
different temperatures, the thicknesses of two plates of calcite of nearly
equal thickness, bounded by planes parallel and at right angles to the axis
respectively, and the thickness of a plate bounded by planes parallel to the
axis with that of a plate of glass of nearly the same thickness, the expan
sion of which was known.        His memoir on this important discovery was
presented    to the Academy on the l0th of March I825.
   The large goniometer which be employed in these observations being too
cumbersome, and also too costly to be used by mineralogists in measuring
the angles of crystals, he contrived an instrument more convenient for
ordinary use, reading to half a minute, and provided with a telescope
having a magnifying power of not more than three. The signal consists of
cross wires in the focus of a collimator, as in the goniometers of Rudberg
and Babinet.       The adjustment of the crystal is effected byavery ingenious
contrivance due to M. Oertling, by whom many of these instruments have
been constructed.       By the invention of this goniometer, which has come
into general use under the name of Mitscherliclfs goniometer, he conferred
a great  boon on mineralogists.     A minute description of it     appeared in the
Memoirs of the Berlin Academy        for  1843, a considerable time after it was
originally contrived, and not till its value had been tested by long use.
   Of his observations on the effect of heat on the double refraction of
                                                                ‘           ’
crystals, little is known beyond a notice in Poggendor<U+FB02>"s Annalen of the
remarkable changes which occur in gypsum when heated.              At the ordinary
temperature     of the atmosphere the optic   axes lie in a plane at   right  angles

   to the plane of symmetry, and make angles of about 60° with a normal to
   the plane of symmetry.          On warming the crystal the optic axes approach
               of  symmetry,     and   at about 92° C. they coincide, exhibiting the
   the plane
   phenomena of a uniaxal crystal, and on further increasing the temperature
   they open out in the plane of symmetry.
       In 1827 Mitscherlich discovered selenic acid, and the isomorphism of
   seleniate of potash with sulphate of potash, and afterwards                   of other
   seleniates   with the corresponding sulphates.            In 1830 he observed        the
   isomorphism     of  manganate     of  potash  with  sulphate of potash.       This   led
   him to a further examination of manganese, and to the discovery of                   the
   isomorphism of the permanganates with the perchlorates, and to                       the
   isolation of the hydrate of permanganic acid.           At a later period (1860)      he
   repeated, by new and more accurate methods, the analysis of permanganate
   of potash, which had been called in question, con<U+FB01>rming the exactness of
   the earlier analysis; he succeeded at the same time in isolating the
   anhydrous permanganic acid.
       The crystallographic researches         he carried on about       the time of the
   discovery of the new acids          were extremely numerous,        yet very little has
   been made known respecting them.                He prepared a large number of
   salts in his laboratory, determined the systems to which they belonged,
   measured some of the angles, and drew by hand the <U+FB01>gures of their
   principal combinations.          But this, though it satis<U+FB01>ed his own curiosity,
   was manifestly      insufficient   for publication, and the new discoveries that
   presented themselves were much more attractive than the wearisome and
   time-consuming task of preparing his researches for the press.               He made,
   however, an attempt to carry out his intention of describing the forms of
   the most important simple and compound bodies.                   He commenced with
   the sulphates,    seleniates,   and  chromates,  because   these  salts present almost
   all the phenomena on which the laws of crystalline form and chemical
   composition are founded. He described the sulphates and seleniates of
    soda and of oxide of silver; the sulphate, seleniate, and chromate of oxide
   of silver  and ammonia;        the sulphate and seleniate     of oxide of nickel, and
    the seleniate   of   oxide   of zinc    the anhydrous and hydrous chloride            of
II
                                          ;
    sodium; iodide of sodium          and bromide of sodium;          sulphate, seleniate,
    and chromate     of potash,    and sulphate    of ammonia.       Unfortunately these
    were his last regular contributions to crystallographic chemistry.                Long
    afterwards he described the forms of the chloride and iodide of mercury,
   the latter of which is dimorphous, and the forms of phosphorus, iodine, and
    selenium crystallized from solution in hisulphide of carbon, which proved
   to be in an isomeric state differing in density from fused selenium.
       In 1833 his crystallographic labours were interrupted by the publication
    of his ‘ Treatise on Chemistry.’        For this work he had been long preparing
    himself by original researches, by associating with the most eminent
     chemists  of Europe, by visiting their     laboratories,   and the most important
     chemical manufactures      and smelting-furnaces.        A large  number of original

                                     XV
observations of his own are embodied in this work, which had never
appeared in any scienti<U+FB01>c journal.   A <U+FB01>fth edition was commenced in 1855,
but left un<U+FB01>nished.   In this year  he commenced his important labours on
the density of the vapour of bromine, sulphur, phosphorus, arsenic, and
mercury, nitrous acid, nitric acid, sulphuric acid, &c., and on the relation
of the density of vapours   to their chemical equivalents.  In the same year
he commenced    his researches on bensoyl, which suggested to him a simple
theory of the constitution of those organic combinations in which compound
radicals are assumed to exist.    His experiments on the formation of ether
led him to the doctrine   of chemical combinations and decompositions by
contact, whereby dormant a<U+FB02>inities in mixtures, or compounds held together
by feeble a<U+FB02>inities, become active by mere contact with a substance
chemically inactive. These labours in the domain of organic chemistry
wholly occupied him for nearly twelve years.    At the conclusion of
this period he turned his attention to geology.    Indeed, ever since
he had engaged in researches on the arti<U+FB01>cial production of minerals,
he    used to theorize on the   formationof rocks, and on the existence
of mineral springs and volcanos. In his earlier travels, while his main
object was the examination of chemical manufactures and smelting
furnaces, his attention was also directed to the geology of the countries
through which he passed.    He frequently devoted the concluding lectures
of each half-year's course to  a sketch of the geological structure of the
earth, and the changes which its surface had undergone.       Year after year
he made systematic journeys   in the Eifel, with the intention of publishing
a    complete description of the extinct volcanos of that district, and
connecting it with  a theory of volcanic action.    And, as the study of this
region made a comparison with the volcanos of other countries desirable,
he visited in succession the principal volcanic districts of Italy, France, and
Germany. But, notwithstanding all this preparation, the description of
the Eifcl was never printed, with the exception of some pages distributed
among the hearers of lectures of a popular character given by him in the
winter of 1838 and 1839.     In these he states the views of the nature of
volcanic processes which he then entertained. They appear to have been
founded on a very careful study
                                 of volcanic phenomena. He supposes the
explosive action to be caused by the vapour of water. The only hypothesis,
however, by which the presence of water in an active volcano could at that
time be accounted for, was beset by serious difficulties. These have since
been removed  by the beautiful experiment made by Daubrée, which shows
that when one side of a stratum of porous rock is heated, water in contact
with the opposite side makes its way through       in the direction of the
                                                   it,
heated part, notwithstanding the high pressure of the vapour generated on
that side.
   During the autumnal vacation of 1861 he made his last geological
excursion in the Eifel; in December of that year he began to su<U+FB01>'er from
disease of the heart, the complaint increased in severity in the summer of

                                       xvi
 1862, and he had much difficulty in completing his course of lectures. In
the autumn of this year he went again to the Rhine, but only to stay in a
 country-house near Bonn, the home of his son-in-law, Professor Busch.
 Here his health appeared to revive, and he returned to Berlin feeling so
much better that he commenced his winter lectures; a fortnight before
Christmas, however, he was obliged to give them up, never again to be
resumed.      In the spring of 1863 he retired to a country-house at
Schoneberg, near Berlin, and here, on the morning of the 28th of August,
his valuable life was closed by a painless death. His name will ever be
cherished in the annals of that science which he had so greatly enriched.
Few philosophers have ever united such a versatility of genius with a mind
so severely disciplined, or who, possessing such a talent for observing, were
able to deduce such important results from their observations.
    He  was member    of probably every Academy in Europe.     He was elected
Foreign Member of the Royal Society in 1828; the Royal Medal was
awarded to him in 1829, “for his Discoveries relating to the Laws of
Crystallization, and the Properties of Crystals.”
    In 1852 he was elected Foreign Associate of the French Institute, in the
place of Glrsted.
    The greater part of the preceding notice is extracted from an Address
to the German Geological Society by Professor G. Rose, Mitscherlich’s
successor as President of the Society.
   CARL LUDWIG CHRISTIAN Riiivrxrsn was born on the 28th of May 1788,
at Neubrandenburg in Mecklenburg-Strelitz, in the service of which State his
father held an important position.      After a careful preparatory education
at home, he was sent to the Graue Kloster at Berlin, and later to the
Engineering Academy’of that place. In 1807 he passed the Government
examination for quali<U+FB01>cation as an engineer and architect.
    In consequence of the gloomy aspect of affairs in Prussia after the peace
of Tilsit, he endeavoured to establish himself in Hamburg; but here also,
<U+FB01>nding no prospect of occupation in the profession he had adopted, he
resolved   in 1808 to go to England with the intention    of devoting himself
to a seafaring life.   Accordingly, in the 21st year of his age, he began the
world anew, under the most unfavourable circumstances, in a strange coun
try, without friends, and entirely cut off from his home by the continental
blockade. With an energy and strength of character peculiarly his own, he
overcame the di<U+FB01>iculties of his situation, and obtained an appointment as
Midshipman in the Navy of the East India Company.          Feeling dissatis<U+FB01>ed
with this service, he entered into that of the German house of Riicken in
London, and visited many parts of the world in their ships.        In 1811 or
1812 he obtained admission into the Royal Navy, and served during the
latter part of the war on board various ships of the Mediterranean <U+FB02>eet.
He was <U+FB01>rst appointed to the ‘ Benbow ’; afterwards he became Naval In
 structor on board the ‘ Montague,’ Captain Peter Heywood (formerly of the

                                                xvii
‘
  Bounty     of whom he used to speak in terms of the greatest regard, as the
             '),
most kind-hearted and excellent man he had ever known.         He was then
transferred to the ‘Albion,’ and on his passage out from England to join Sir
Charles Penrose, fought at the battle of Algiers.
   During visit to Genoa R<U+FB01>mker became acquainted with the Baron v.
             a
Zach, to whom he submitted the results of various astronomical observations
in order to obtain his opinion of their value. The Baron soon discovered his
talent for astronomy, encouraged him to cultivate that science, and aided
him with his advice and the use of his astronomical library.     Riimker’s
<U+FB01>rst observations, occultations, and the determination of the latitude and
longitude of Malta, where he was stationed for     considerable time, were
                                                              a
published     in   v. Zach's       Correspondance Astronomique.’
                               ‘
    ln l8l7, when the Fleet returned to England,                   he quitted      the Naval
Service and went to Hamburg, carrying with him the friendship and
esteem of his comrades of all ranks, which he had won by his ability and
energy, combined with          a     peculiar suavity of manner.         Here he was ap
pointed Principal of the School of Navigation.                    In             of Schu
                                                                       the society
macher, the Director of the Observatory of Altona, Repsold, and \Voltmann,
his taste for astronomy was strengthened, and he found many opportunities
of extending his knowledge of the subject.  As at that time Hamburg did
not possess an Observatory, he built one at his own expense on the Stint
fang.
    In I821he resigned his post at the School of Navigation in order to
accompany Sir Thomas Brisbane, Governor of New South Wales, to whom
he had been introduced by Captain Heywood, and to take charge of the
Observatory which Sir Thomas purposed founding in that colony.
   Riimker’s labours in the Observatory of Paramatta are well known to
astronomers.    In 1822 he observed the <U+FB01>rst calculated reappearance of
Encke’s comet, which was invisible in Europe,_aud thereby <U+FB01>rst con<U+FB01>rmed
the shortness of its periodic time.  He afterwards observed and discovered
many  other comets,   some  of which were not seen in Europe. He observed
the sun in the solstices,          made   many observations with Kater’s pendulum,
and determined the magnetic declination and inclination.            These and other
observations were published in   separate volume of the Transactions of
                                          a
the Royal Society for 1830.  His observations of the stars of the southern
hemisphere are in part contained in the Brisbane Catalogue,’ and in the
                                                   ‘
  Preliminary Catalogue of Fixed Stars in the Southern Hemisphere,’ pub
‘
lished by himself at Hamburg in 1832.      In after years, however, he was
never able to find leisure for continuing              the work, and the greater part of
the observations remain still unpublished.
   In 1829 he returned to Europe to resume           his post as Principal of the
School of Navigation,          and to undertake the Direction of the New Obser
vatory built by the Senate of Hamburg.       He devoted himself with the
most unwearied diligence to the duties of these two o<U+FB02>ices. After nights
passed     in observing,   he made his appearance         at the School    of Navigation   at
    voL.    XIII.                                                              c

  eight both in summer and winter, and remained there teaching for <U+FB01>ve and
  even seven.hou1-s, regardless of his failing health, which was unable to sus
  tain so severe a trial.
      Under his care the school attained an unexpected prosperity.         It pro
  duced the most distinguished sailors of the German merchant navy, and
  the teachers     of almost all the Schools of Navigation on the coast of the
  North Sea have been his pupils. The number of students, which at the
  time of his appointment to the school was only 60, amounted to 250 in
   1857.      He possessed in an unusual degree the art of teaching. By the
   clearness of his methods, and a singular patience and mildness which encou
   raged the self-respect of his pupils and gained their con<U+FB01>dence, and espe
   cially by his power of adapting his teaching to the comprehension of each
   individual,   he succeeded in preparing the most uncultivated    sailor for the
   examination in navigation often in   a surprisingly short time, so as to enable
   him to pass it with credit.
            ‘
       His    Handbook of Navigation,’ which appeared in 1843, and has gone
   through three large editions, is used as a text-book in most of the Schools
   of Navigation on the shores of the North Sea, in Austria, and in Russia.
       He devoted himself with equal or even still greater energy to his duties
   in the Observatory. The principal instruments consisted of an equatorially
      ~
   mounted refractor of 5-feet focal length by Fraunhofer, and a meridian
    circle constructed by the brothers Repsold, which was mounted in 1836.
    The observations made with the refractor are published in Schumacher’s
    ‘Astronomische Nachrichten,’ and in the Monthly Notices of the Astro
    nomical Society. With the meridian circle he undertook the determination
    of the places of all the <U+FB01>xed stars visible through its telescope,—a work of
    many years’ duration, the results of which he published in the years
    1843-59 under the title of a Catalogue of 12,000 <U+FB01>xed stars, but in reality
    containing upwards of 15,000.
‘
       In speaking of the observations made with the refractor, at the Anniver
    sary Meeting of the Astronomical Society in 1854, when the medal of the
    Society was awarded to M. Riimker, the Astronomer Royal, President of
    the Society, expressed himself in the following terms :—
       “ For a very
                      long time M. Riimker has been known as furnishing extra
    meridional observations of comets and newly discovered planets, possessing
    the highest degree    of accuracy, and extending to times when the objects
    which he could successfully observe were lost to other astronomers fur
    nished apparently with much more powerful means.         I have myself visited
    the observatory and inspected the instruments which have been devoted to
    these observations,   and I have inquired, How is it that with instruments
    so insigni<U+FB01>cant you have been able to see so much more than others could
    see who are so much better equipped ? The answer was very simple.
    Energy, care, patience,—in these, I believe, is contained the whole secret,
     M. Riimker perhaps possesses in perfection the sensibility of eye and the
     <U+FB02>cuteness of ear which are required for the most delicate observations; but

                                      xix
these powers,   which might seem at <U+FB01>rst to be original gifts of nature, have,
I do not doubt, acquired very much of their activity from their careful and
energetic use."
   Adverting to the Catalogue of <U+FB01>xed stars, for which more especially the
medal was bestowed,     Mr. Airy observes,
    “ Had this                               an observatory of which the per
                Catalogue proceeded from
sonal establishment was      charged with no other labours, we should have
considered it as a highly meritorious work. . . . . What, then, shall we say
to this work in the circumstances under which it has reached us?           It has
come, the voluntary enterprise of an individual, who could not, by any con
struction of his connexion with the Hamburgh Observatory, be supposed
to owe to the world a hundredth part of the labour which it has cost.           It
is the fruit of observations made in the watches of the night, and calcula
tions made in the leisure hours of the day, by a person who would seem,
to vulgar eyes, to be engrossed     to the limits of human endurance        by an
onerous    professional office. Well may we consider it as a remarkable
instance of voluntary labour, undertaken under di<U+FB02>icult circumstances, not
for public display, but as an aid to science, and skilfully and steadily
directed to that purpose alone.”
    M. Riimker was a Member of the Royal Academies of Munich and Got
tingen, the Batavian Society of Rotterdam, the Royal Astronomical and
many other English and Foreign learned Societies. He was elected Foreign
 Member of the Royal Society in 1855.
    After having laboured long and pro<U+FB01>tably,       repeated   attacks of illness,
accompanied     by an asthmatic cough which increased       in severity at each
relapse, forced him at length (in 1857) to rest from his labours, and to
 seek a milder climate for the bene<U+FB01>t of his shattered health.
    At his suggestion the    care of  the  Navigation School was entrusted to
 M. Niebour, who had been his assistant for many years, and that of the
Observatory to his only son, George Riimker, at that time the Astronomer
 of the Durham Observatory, and now his successor as Director of the
 Observatory of Hamburg.
    He had visited and been pleased with Lisbon during his earlier voyages,
 and was induced to select that place for his retreat.  There, after a residence
 of six years, tenderly watched over by his wife, a lady of English birth, and
 the discoverer of the comet     VI  of  1847, retaining full possession   of his
 faculties, he died on the 21st of December 1862.
    Having served in the British Navy, and received the medal given to those
 who shared in the battle of Algiers, he was followed to the grave by officers
 of the British <U+FB02>eet in the Tagus, and by his German friends. He lies
 buried in a spot chosen by himself, close to Fielding’s grave in the cemetery
 of the church of Estrella.
