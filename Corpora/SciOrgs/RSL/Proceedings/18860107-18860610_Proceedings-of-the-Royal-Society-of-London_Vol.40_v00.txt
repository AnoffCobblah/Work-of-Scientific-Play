   The apparatus employed in the present investigations was the same
thermo-electric one that was used in the experiments on conduction of
heat in bone, brain-tissue, and skin, described in a former paper,* but
the mode of application of the thermo-pile to the tissue was somewhat
different.    The tissue, whether hard or soft, was placed on a thin
copper plate, which formed the floor of a square hole cut in the bottom
of a small light wooden box.         The pile, having been applied to the
upper surface of the tissue, was held in place by means of a paste
board collar, which was made fast with pins to the edges of the box.
In the case of the soft tissues, light weights were affixed to the pile to
regulate the pressure.     With bone, in order to insure intimate contact
between the pile and the tissue, and between the latter and the copper
plate, a little marrow was used.          The unoccupied space in the box
was filled with finely chopped cotton-wool.           The box had pasteboard
uprights attached to its sides, by which it was suspended from the

brought in contact with water of a temperature lower than that of the
air by fractions of a degree of centigrade, as in the former experiments
referred to.
                              Experiments on Muscle.
    The muscles examined were those of the head, thigh, and leg of the
sheep.
    It soon was noticed that the rate of transmission differed somewhat,
according as the muscle was examined in the direction of its fibres or
perpendicularly to them ; and this fact led to the division' of the
experiments into two classes, according               as the   line of conduction
was parallel or at right angles to that of          the fibres.
             I

respectively.       The results represent 104        observations on conduction
parallel to tbe direction of the fibres, and         100 observations    on conduc

   The    conductivity   of muscle,     unlike that        of the other tissues
examined,    does not appear to depend, at least         in any marked manner,
upon the degree of freshness of the tissue.            So long as the muscle is
kept in a moist state, it seems to conduct equally well whether
recently removed from the animal or after decay has commenced ;
and when the conductivity has been decidedly lowered by exposure
to the air, it generally can be partially, and sometimes completely,
restored, by moistening the tissue with water or fresh animal juices.

   Both compact and spongy tissues lose their conducting power more
or less rapidly after removal from their natural surroundings ; spongy
tissue much more quickly than compact.            Spongy tissue may regain
the greater part of the loss of its conductivity, after the application of
water or fresh animal      matter, but this is not the case with compact

tissue ; however, moisture seems to slightly reduce the rate of loss in
the latter.    With regard to the compound tissue — compact-spongy,
the changes which its conductivity undergoes present simply a varying
mean of those of its two components.      After long exposure to the air,
the bone being well dried, the conductivities of compact and of
spongy tissue are fonnd to closely approximate    each other.
                          Experiments on Brain.
    The experiments on this tissue had reference only to the changes of
its conductivity, due to exposure to the air, and to the effect of
moisture and fresh animal liquids on these changes.
    Like liver and kidney, the tissue of brain quickly loses its power of
conduction after death, and neither moisture or fresh animal matter
can restore this loss, although they may diminish its rate.
II, "Further      Researches into the Function of the Thyroid
      Gland and into the Pathological State produced by Removal
      of the same." By Professor Victor Horsley, B.S., F.R.C.S.
      Communicated by Professor Michael Foster, M.D., Sec. R.S.
      Received December 10, 1885.
    In December,   1884, I showed  that the thyroid gland was intimately
connected with the process of mucin metabolism, that if the thyroid
gland in monkeys was removed with antiseptic precautions (the same
ensuring healing of the wound in three days) the consequences to the
animal were — (1) symptoms of general nervous disturbance evidenced
 by tremors, paroxysmal convulsions, functional paralysis, mental hebe
 tude, and finally complete imbecility ; (2) profound anaemia coupled
 with leucocytosis ; (3) all the symptoms of the disease discovered
 within the last decade and termed myxcedema; (4) that just as in the
 acute form of the disease just named there was found to be a great
 accumulation of mucin in the connective tissues throughout the body
 (mucinoid degeneration), and in the blood, and as a consequence the
 same post-mortem appearances ; (5) that at the same time there was a
 great activity in the rnucin-secreting glands, and, further, that the
 parotid gland under these abnormal circumstances secreted mucin in
  large quantity, the gland cells at the same time disintegrating.
     During the past year   I have confirmed my previous observations,
 and greatly extended them, and have firm basis for my original
 opinion that the function of the thyroid gland is indispensable to the
 higher animals, and that it is duplex, since, in the first place, it
  regulates  the formation of mucin in the body     ; and, in the second

1886.]              On the Function   of the  Thyroid Gland.               7
place,   it aids in the manufacture of blood-corpuscles.       My researches
during the past year (1885) have been directed towards the investi
gation of (1) the circumstances which influence the course of the
extensive disturbance of general nutrition which follows the loss of the
gland ; (2) the direct effect of the said fall in nutrition upon the
nerve-centres ; and (3) the hsemapoietic function of the gland.
    (1.)  I find that the determining factor par excellence of the value of
the gland as regards its influence on the general metabolic processes of
the animal is Age.        The effect of removing the gland in the young
animal is the rapid appearance of violent nerve symptoms and death
in a few days ; in a rather older animal, i.e., a one-year old dog, the
symptoms are less violent, later in their appearance, and the animal
survives perhaps for a fortnight or three weeks; in a very old animal
the removal of the gland simply hastens the torpor of old age ; these
observations refer to dogs and cats.        In the higher animals, monkeys,
the operation on a young individual produces the same result as in a
                        I
yonng dog, but, as showed last year, an older animal, if kept under
ordinary circumstances, will survive for six or seven weeks, dying at
 the end of that time of myxcedema.              On the whole, therefore, it
 appears    that  the thyroid   gland is of  extreme  importance when tissue
 metabolism is most active, and that it diminishes as the senile state
 advances.      Huschke ,has shown that the relative weight of the
 thyroid body to the body weight is greatest at birth, that it rapidly
 diminishes during the next few weeks, and that it steadily decreases
 as age advances.       Finally, the structural degeneration of the gland in
 old age is well known. It is clear, therefore, that the gland plays an
 important and constant part in the metabolism of the body; I desire
 here to draw special attention to the fact that the symptoms of old
 age, namely,        wasting of the actively functional parenchymatous
 tissues, atrophy, and falling out of the hair, decay of the teeth, dryness
 and harshness of the skin, tremors, <fec., are exactly the most prominent
 features of the myxoadematous state, whether it occurs naturally in
 the human being, prematurely, as in cretinism, or artificially, as in
 my experiments on monkeys.            It is, perhaps, well to remark here
 that, as might have been foreseen, the previous state of nutrition of
 the body determines to a large extent the rapidity of onset and the
  course of the symptoms.
     The next circumstance of extreme importance which influences the
  course of the symptoms is the Temperature at which the animals are
  kept after the gland has been removed.          I showed last year that one
  of the most obvious features of the fall of nutrition which follows the
  loss of the gland was a steady diminution of the body heat, this sug
  gested to me a line of- research which has yielded a striking result. I
  have kept another series of animals (on whom I have performed
   thyroidectomy under the conditions above stated) at a constant tern

 8                            Prof. Victor Horsley.                       [Jan.   7,
perature of 90° F.,* and when they exhibited any nerve symptoms, i.e.,
tremors, Ac., were placed in a hot-air bath at a temperature of 105° F.
 The effect of this has been to lengthen the duration of life (in all but
very young animals) four or five times the extent of that observed in
the first series. Instead of living four to seven weeks they now live
as many months.          At the same time several additional facts of im
portance are noted, and the symptoms before referred to are so modi
fied as to require     the addition of a third stage to the two        I described
in 1884.     (These observations refer solely to monkeys.)           The animals
kept    under  the extra   high   temperature    above  noted  thus pass   through
                —
three stages (1) neurotic, (2) mucinoid, (3) atrophic.                I  have said
that the neurotic stage under these circumstances                may be scarcely
marked, or if the nerve symptoms occur,            and  the animal  be put in the
hot-air bath, they soon disappear.          Next the animal lives through the
mucinoid stage,     i.e., myxoedematous condition, and arrives in the third
stage — the atrophic.        Now, the symptoms of the second stage are
just as   much   subdued    as- those' of the first, there is no excessivesecre-
tion of mucus, the parotid glands do not swell; and the post-mortem
examination does not reveal the extensive mucinoid degeneration
observed in the first series.         Finally, the third* atrophic, stage into
which the animal passes is evidenced by great emaciation, functional
paresis and paralysis, imbecility, falling blood pressure and tempera
ture, with death by coma.
    I am disposed to regard this fact of the animals passing through
these neurotic, mucinoid stages, and dying at the end of the atrophic,
as the key to the observation that cretins in whom the thyroid gland
is very slowly destroyed, and very chronic cases of myxoedema, do not
exhibit much mucinoid degeneration.
    (2.) I will now briefly enumerate the direct effect of the falhof nutri
tion produced by the loss of the thyroid gland on the nerve-centres :
(a) Effect on cortex.t The tetanus obtained by stimulating the cortex iR
remarkably changed (even as soon as one day after the thyroidectomy
in a dog, who exhibited violent symptoms- in twenty-four hours) by
the fact of the fall (when the current w&6 shut off) being as sudden
as that observed on stimulating the corona radiata.               Next, that the
tetanus in a more advanced case is soon exhausted, the curve
approaching the abscissa soon after the initial rise ; at the same time
the curve is folkjMd by clonic epileptoid spasms, which', however, are
soon exhausted.        Stimulation of the corona radiata' and' spinal cord
also gave the customary tetanns, which, like that of the cortex, was
rapidly exhausted.         These stimulations of the nerve-centres             sup-
   * In my first experiments
                              (1884) the animals were kept at a temperature varying
from 60° to 70° F.

pressed the thyroid tremors just as voluntary movements do. Another
evidence of the changes in the cortex is the frequency with which
continuous stimulation will evoke the appearance of clonic spasms on
the original tetanic curve, the latter not being followed by epilepsy
when the current is shut off.
   (6.) Effect on the spinal cord. The tetanus obtained by stimulating
the spinal cord like that of the cortex rises slowly to the highest point,
and then steadily falls towards the abscissa although the stimulation
is maintained, and> when the current is shut off the muscle completely
relaxes, having absolutely lost its tone, and this tonic paralysis is not
recovered from for ten to fifteen seconds. Stimulation of the spinal cord
to fatigue, after some time has elapsed so as to produce exhaustion of
the preliminary tetanus, evokes a tremor of eight to ten per second.
   Tracings from an old animal (cat);which had survived the operation
some months, and also from a dog, in which case the symptoms had
been very severe for some days, exhibited only a very feeble tetanus
in the former instance, and' no reaction at all in the latter ; this being
 the ultimate state of depression of function which the nerve-centres
 had arrived to.
    (3.) I have thought it as well to add to the anatomical and physio
logical proofs I gave last year of the thyroid gland being a' haema-
poietic structure by counting the number of corpuscles in the blood
of the thyroid artery and vein respectively.          After' discounting any
possible alteration   in  the relative number   of the corpuscles in the two
vessels by changes in the fluid constituent of the blood which may
have happened in the gland, the much greater number of corpuscles
in the vein ( + 7 per cent.) confirms the deductions- drawn* from my
previous observations.
   To sum up, the functions of the thyroid gland appears to me to be
two-fold as already suggested, viz. : (1) Control of mucin metabolism,
(2) Haemapoiesis.- The metabolic processes in the body may be
regarded broadly as resulting in Construction and Destruction.           The
products of destruction are the waste products of tissue change, and
being, as such, harmful to the organism, are cast out by the excretory
organ.    It appears to me that the thyroid gland aids in excretion of
mncinoid substances or their precursors, not of course by excretion
properly speaking, that is, casting them out from the body, but by
metamorphosing      them into some other form which is useful to the
system.    That  this  process, whatever it is, is of vital importance to
the young mammal (seeing that interference with it causes death in a
few days) is obvious, and such as it is the loss of it is distinctly con
nected with the appearances of the diseases known as myxcedema,
cretinism, and senile degeneration.        Finally, this defect in the circle
of metabolism determines the appearance of so-called functional
disorders  of the nervous system.

Scyllium catulus, and Acanthias vulgaris.             He then refers to the
distribution of the cranial nerves, especially of the trifacial and
vagus, pointing out the resemblance of the distribution of the last-
mentioned nerve in Rhina to that described by Gegenbaur* in
Hexanthus ; the difference lying in the fact that in the former the
rami branchiales of this nerve, the number of which correspond to
the number of the branchial arches, divide into two terminal branches
only, the rami anteriores and posteriorea, the third, the rami pharyngei,
 being absent.
    On the other hand, in Scyllium the rami branchiales do not divide,
the terminal twigs, representing the rami pharyngei, only being
 present.
    The lobi olfactorii consist of two parts, the lobe proper and the
peduncle.     The lobe itself is more or less pear-shaped, broader at the
anterior end where it abuts on to the olfactory organ, and narrower
behind where it passes into the peduncle.           It consists of three layers,
counting from before backward, or from outside inward. The posterior,
which is also the internal layer, occupies more than half of the lobe,
and consists entirely of a mass of small eells embedded in a network
 of fibrillaa and granular neuroglia.           This network is of extreme
 tenuity, and the cells contained therein are oval, pear-shaped, or
 spherical in shape, and contain a nucleus and nucleolus ; they give off
 processes which join the network.         In front of these, and outside to
 a certain extent, is found a layer consisting of glomeruli olfactorii ;
 these are elongated or pear-shaped masses arranged with their long
 axes in the direction of the nerve fibres.          They consist of a central
 core of closely intertwined fibrillar ; externally the fibrils are of rather
 larger size ; they run longitudinally in reference to the glomerulus ;
 in their course elongated cells are developed.
     The anterior or external layer consists of interlacing bundles of
 fibres which pass from the anterior ends of the glomeruli into the
  olfactory organ.   The bundles themselves are flat, but the fibrillar of
  which they are composed are round.

   The structure of the peduncle resembles that of the olfactory lobe,
and gradually passes into that of the cerebrum at the posterior end.
In Scyllium, Rhina, and Acanthias it contains a passage which puts
the ventricle of the olfactory lobe into communication with that of the
cerebrum.     In Raja, however,      both the lobe and the peduncle    are
solid.
   The cerebrum contains two ventricles which posteriorly commnni-
caie   with a single chamber, the foramen of Monro ; this is the case in
Scyllium, Rhina, and Acanthias, but in Raja only a very small
ventricle is present which represents the foramen of Monro, the
remainder of the cerebrum being solid.          Round the external surface
of the cerebrum there is a layer of grannlar neuroglia with compara
tively few cells. The remainder of the parenchyma consists of a mass
of cells, larger ones, 13/i to 10^, in diameter, occupying the centre,
and smaller ones predominating towards the internal surface.            In
Scyllium the cells are arranged in groups of four or five, and in Raja
also in groups of from nine to twenty-one, which make a meandering
pattern through the parenchyma in some parts. At the base of the
cerebrum there are four special groups of cells, two being placed in
the outer walls and two in the inner walls ; the outer groups are
associated with the fibres of the anterior commissure, and the inner
groups are associated with the fibres of the crura cerebri.
   The third ventricle is a gutter-shaped channel, 'long in Scyllium,
but shorter in Raja, which leads from the cerebrum into the optic
lobe ; above, it is closed in by processes of the pia mater which enter
the ventricle and the foramen of Monro, forming a choroid plexus ;
below, the third ventricle communicates by a passage, the infundi-
bulum, with the ventricles of the hypoarium ; the parenchyma in this
lobe contains numerous cells measuring from about 13/i by 7fi to 6u in
diameter, which give off numerous processes to join a fine network
which pervades the whole.       The ventricle is lined by an endothelium
which is continuous with a space in the hypophysis cerebri. There is
a small tubercle in front of the optic lobe which corresponds to the
tuberculum intermedium of Gottsche,* and from it a bundle of fibres
can be traced passing towards the ventral surface of the medulla
oblongata, which corresponds to the fibres of Meynert.
    The optic lobes which homologise with the anterior corpora
 quadrigemina form a cover arching over the aqueduct of Sylvius, in
the same position as in the Teleostei ; they are much thicker, but more
simple in strnctnre. Neither the tori longitudinales nor the tori
semicircnlares, those tuberosities which form prominences on the floor
of the aqueduct in the Teleostei, are present in the Plagiostomata.
Three layers may be distinguished in the optic lobe; the external

occupies about two-thirds of the thickness, and consists of longitudinal
fibres which are derived from the optic tract, and numerous cells
which attain their maximum number in this layer ; they are mostly
spherical, but fusiform cells with their long axes placed radially are
occasionally found.
   The second layer consists of bundles of transverse fibres partly
derived from the lateral columns of the medulla oblongata, and partly
from the commissura ansulata ; they correspond with the transverse
fibres in the tectum lobi optici of the Teleostei.
   The third layer is characterised by large cells, which are rounded
or sometimes pyriform ; they usually give off only one process which
is directed outwards, and joins the above-mentioned transverse fibres.
These cells differ in their arrangement in the different species, they
are spread out in a flat layer in the optic lobe of the Scyllium and
Raja. In Rhina and Acanthias they form a group in the central
tuberosity that projects into- the aqueduct of Sylvius, resembling the
arrangement in the Turtle.      The small cells which were described in
the first layer extend in diminishing numbers into this third layer.
   The cerebellum in Scyllium, Rhina, and Acanthias presents a very
large ventricle which in Raja is nearly obliterated ; the intimate
structure resembles that of the Teleostei.      There are the four layers,
the molecular with Purkinje cells, thegranular and the fibrous layers.
The latter is connected by the crura cerebelli ad medullam through
an inferior lobe with the restiform bodies of the medulla oblongata ;
there is also an anterior cord passing longitudinally into the optic
lobe which represents the crura cerebelli ad cerebrum (Quain).          In
the granular laj-er, in addition to the numerous cells forming that
layer, there are little masses of fibrillae inextricably wound together
resembling glomeruli on a small scale ; in other respects there is
nothing peculiar in the structure of the cerebellum.
    The molecular and the granular layers are continued on the surface
of the restiform bodies in all the species examined, and in Raja nearly
as far as the posterior end of the fourth ventricle, but the absence of
the Purkinje cells marks a difference of structure.
    In the spinal cord the grey substance of the ventral cornu contains
numerous large cells arranged in an imbricated manner with their
long axes directed obliquely from the ventral to the dorsal surface.
 Their shape is generally elongated, and they give off several processes.
 In the cord the ventral cornua are directed horizontally, but towards
 the posterior end of the medulla oblongata they are gradually depressed
 toward the ventral surface, and are finally lost in the grey substance
 on the floor of the fourth ventricle.        The dorsal cornua contain
 numerous nuclei.     There are four longitudinal columns in the spinal
 cord, the ventral longitudinal columns beneath the central canal, the
 lateral columns at the sides, and the dorsal columns above. Mauthner's

 fibres are not present in the Plagiostomata, the fibres of the ventral
 longitudinal columns varying very slightly in size; but perhaps, it
 may be mentioned here that large fibres, two in number, occupying
 positions corresponding to those of the Mauthner's fibres in Teleostei,
 occur in Ceratodus ; they have the peculiarity of possessing several
 axis cylinders inclosed in a single medullary sheath.
    The ventral columns form projecting longitudinal cords in the floor
 of the fourth ventricle.   They can be traced into the ventral side of
 the posterior commissure which occupies the usual place at the pos
 terior boundary of the third ventricle.
    The lateral columns on passing forward diminish greatly in number,
 the internal fibres are lost in the neighbourhood         of the posterior
 commissure; those that are external seem to join the transverse fibres
 of the optic lobe, those between the two disappear in the region above
 the hypoarium, some crossing the crura cerebri which disappear in the
 game region.
    The optic nerves form a chiasma, the lower part of which is formed
 by the nerves of the two sides intersecting each other in bundles, bnt
 in the upper part the remainder cross each other en masse. The
 principal origin of this nerve is the optic lobe, where the outer two-
 thirds are occupied by its tract ; a few fibres, however, are derived
 from the hypoarium.
     The oculo motorii are derived from two ganglia situated on the
 floor of the aqueduct of Sylvius ; they pass nearly straight down to
 the ventral surface of the, medulla oblongata.      At this region there is
 a system of transverse commissures connected with the second layer
 of the optic lobe, which corresponds to the commissure, ansnlata of
  Teleostei (Gottsche).*
    The ganglion of origin of the trochlearis was not found, but the
 fibres decussate at a part between the optic lobe and the cerebellum
 corresponding to the valve of Vieussens.
    The trifacial is derived from three roots, one of which comes for
 ward from the posterior part of the medulla oblongata, where it can
 be traced into the lateral columns.            The other comes backward
 through the tuberosity of the trifacial by the side of the medulla;
 these two cross each other at their entrance into the nerve, the third
 comes from a group of cells in the grey substance of the floor of the
 fourth ventricle.
    The abduceus can be traced from the ventral surface of the medulla
 oblongata at about its centre into the lower edge of the ventral
 longitudinal columnB.
    The facial can be traced into a small bundle of fibres which passes
 backward into the spinal cord in the substantia gelatinosa centralis
just above the central canal.

      About this region there is a system of arched commissural fibres,
   the fibrae arcuatae.      They seem to be connected with the crura cere-
   belli and medullam.         They occur not only through the external part
  of the ventral surface, but also through the central portions.
      The acusticus and glossopharyngeal arise from the grey substance
  on the floor of the fourth ventricle.
      The vagus arises from a series of rounded tuberosities situated on
  the side of the floor of the fourth ventricle ; each root arises from a
  separate tuberosity.
      The spinal nerves arise by dorsal and ventral roots ; the latter from
  the ventral horn of grey substance.              The former pass obliquely into
  the interior of the cord and there divide into two bundles ; one bundle
  from the anterior part of the root is directed backward, the other
  bundle from the posterior part of the root is directed forward. They
  pass over the next nerve both in front and behind, and join the
  lateral columns of the cord.         This arrangement was first, described by

  similar conditions of temperature and the like, but screened from
  light, swarmed in a very few days with countless saprophytes.
      By means of suitable absorptive media, we learned that the most
  active rays were those of the more refrangible end of the spectrum.
      Seeking an explanation of the facts thus observed, we proceeded
  in the first instance by analogy.
      We found that light had an oxidising action on many organic sub
  stances of comparatively simple composition, and we demonstrated
  that, in the presence of free oxygen, the molecule of oxalic acid might
  be speedily and entirely resolved into water and carbonic acid by the
  action of light, more especially by those rays to which I have
  already referred.
      Proceeding to more complex substances, we applied the same method
  to one of those singular bodies, the so-called soluble or indirect
  ferments.
      In less than a month the properties, and, inferentially, the sub
  stance, of the invertive diastase of yeast were destroyed by light.
      Once more we found that we had to deal with an oxidation.
  Finally, our inference that the action of sunlight on the organisms of
 our cultures would likewise prove to be an oxidation was confirmed
 bv direct experiments, in which the effect varied in proportion to the
 amount of free oxygen present.
      As yet no one has repeated these investigations in their entirety,
 but sufficient confirmatory evidence has accumulated to justify me,
 I  think, in briefly placing the case before the Society as it now stands,
 with one or two additional observations of my own, and to afford me
 an opportunity of replying to one or two points of criticism.
     The earliest corroboration of our work came out on the reading of
 onr first memoir on this subject.
     Mr. Warington had that same evening, in a paper to the Chemical
 Society, notified, but was unable to explain, the inhibitory action of
 light on the process of uitrification. Our experiments at once sug
gested to Dr. Gilbert the interpretation, since confirmed by several
observers,* that light was inimical to the nitrifying ferment.
     Gladstone and Tribe (" Journ. Chem. Soc.," August, 1883) found
that light was detrimental to the development of fungoid growths in
 solutions of cane-sugar exposed to atmospheric air.f                  Tyndall re-

glaucum developed in oil at the most illuminated spots.      I  have not been able to
see the original paper, and am therefore not acquainted with the conditions of the
experiment, especially as regards the nature of the illumination, and the access of
free oxygen.

16                           Dr. A. Downes.           On the              [Jan. 14,
ported to the British Association in 1881 the results which he had
obtained in exposing flasks of animal and vegetable infusions to the
influence of an Alpine sun.             Corresponding flasks shaded from the
light became       turbid   in   twenty-four hours, " while thrice this time
left the exposed ones without sensible damage to their transparency."
He satisfied himself that this was not due to differences of tempe
rature.       The amount of insolation was insufficient, however, to per
manently sterilise the cultures after removal to a warm kitchen.
   Confirmatory evidence ; also, invested with a special value by the
author's great experience of saprophytic life, has more recently been
adduced by Professor E. Dnclaux.*               With the usual precautions he
introduced into a flat-bottomed Pasteur flask a drop of pure culture
of the organism to be studied, and dried it under a desiccator.               After
the desired period of exposure to the sun, the flask was charged with
sterilised nutrient liquid, of a kind specially suitable to the development
of the particular organism, and placed at a favourable temperature in
an incubator.       Corresponding flasks were kept in the dark.
   He finds that the general rule, that the spores of these organisms
resist adverse influences better than their vegetative forms, holds
good in regard to the effects of light.               This accords with our own
observations on the insolation of germs in water. f M. Dnclaux, how
ever, reserves for a future memoir his conclusions on the insolation of
the micrococci — among which the formation of spores is not certainly
known.
   The very hardy spores of the Bacillus, to which he has given the
name of Tyrothrix filifnrmis,% were destroyed by thirty-five days' ex
posure to an autumnal sun.              T. geniculatus was more resistant, but
showed signs of commencing enfeeblement.                      T. scahe-r was only
retarded in development by insolation during the month of August,
 1884, but a further exposure to the end of September — a not very
fine month     — sterilised two flasks out of four.
    Similar spores had survived for three years in the dark. Like
Professor Tyndall, he was satisfied that these results were not
effects of temperature ; his insolated flasks scarcely reached any point
higher than their fellows kept in darkness in an incubator.
   He concluded, also, from further experiments, that the injurious
influence of light here manifested was probably an affair of oxida
tion.
   M. Dnclaux very rightly insists on the importance of careful adap
tation    of the nutrient liquids to the organisms operated upon, ob
serving that, otherwise., spores might be regarded as dead which had

     As regards tho earlier of our memoirs, to which M. Duclaux refers,
this criticism is just. At that date knowledge of revivification of
germs       in different media was neither so generally diffused nor so
precise as it now is. This advance we owe not least to Professor
Duclaux himself.           Accordingly, in our first experiments we regarded
non-appearance of life in our insolated tubes of Pasteur solution, or of
urine, as proof of destruction of the organisms which they had ori
ginally contained.          In our second and more complete memoir, how
ever, we reserved oar opinion on this point.
     But it was an essential principle of the method on which we worked,
and the key to our success, that our nutrient fluids should be suffi
ciently resistant to bacterial growth to hinder the development of
organisms, through the night, or during cloudy days, from outrunning
the inhibitory effects of insolation. It would probably, for example,
not often be possible to secure in England the results which Tyndall
obtained on the Alps with apparently considerable bulks of very
putrescible materials.         Pasteur solution and the like are at their best
 but limited media of nutrition ;* yet under special circumstances, as,
 for example, in the demonstration of the action of diffused daylight
 given below, it is necessary to largely increase their resistance to
 decomposition.
     Moreover, the question whether the germs in our solutions were or
 were not actually dead, does not affect the truth of our induction.              I
 cannot put this more pithily than has Professor Duclaux himself, in
 a very courteous communication with which he has favoured me.
 '•
    You have clearly shown," he says, " that an insolated germ is a sick,
 sometimes very sick, germ ; death is but a step further."t
     It was an a priori probability that micro-organisms should vary
 considerably in their powers of resistance to the oxidising influences
 of light. In our previous' papers, indeed, we gave examples of this
 in the frequent survival over Bacteria of some less sensitive form of
 Saccharomyces or Mucedo.
     I have lately met with an instance which may be worth recording,
 as it enabled me to isolate a Bacterium of which I can find no previous
  description. In each of a number of thickish glass tubes I had sealed
  up 3 c.c. of distilled water, together with a small bulb containing an

strength). Some of these tubes were insolated on an outside shelf
facing south ; others were incased in laminated lead alongside.
    After the desired period of insolation, the bulbs were broken by a
jerk, and the tubes, now containing 6 c.c. of peptone solution of ordi
nary strength (2 per cent.), were removed to a warm cupboard kept
at about 20° C. By a week's exposure, May 29 — June 5, bacterial
development was already retarded (sixty hours as compared with
twenty -four).          After insolation for nearly four weeks, May 29—
June 24, ordinary bacterial development appeared in two incased
tubes in thirty-six hours.             In two insolated tubes, at the same date,
nothing was seen till the fourth day, when small flakes began to form,
and by August 3 had settled into a dirty-white collection, leaving
the supernatant liquid clear, presenting a notable contrast to the
uniform turbidity of the incased.
    These flakes were found to consist of compact spherical or cylin
drical nodulated masses of zoogloea.                   They closely resembled in
general      appearance        the    Ascocoecus    Billrothii    or Ascobacteria of
 v. Tieghem, but         I  was utterly unable to demonstrate the gelatinous
 envelopment from which those organisms take their name.

 felted small rods, motile when freed from the mass, about                            dia

 the insolated contained flakes, such as             I have    above described.      In  a
 day or two later similar flakes formed in another of these tubes.                    The
 third insolated tube subsequently broke down with a scanty develop

 incased.*
     It is evident      that the zoogloea-lump-forming           Bacterium was espe
  cially resistant to sunlight, and so became isolated in almost pure
  cultures in four-fifths of the tubes insolated for a month and upwards.
     I  wish now to direct attention to the fact that the tubes of the
  experiment which           I have just described, were exposed repeatedly to
  considerable elevations of temperature.               The meteorology of Green
  wich may be taken as sufficiently identical with that of Chelmsford,
     * This experiment — an     insolation of germs in water only — might be regarded, and
  possibly rightly so, as confirmatory of what we hare previously written on the
  resistance of germinal matter in a fluid devoid of nutrient material.      But it should
  be remembered       that the supply of free oxygen was necessarily limited in these
  Bcaled tubes, being rather less than 5 c.c. in each, and   I  am unable at present to say
  whether this amount would be sufficient to oxidise the germs ordinarily present in
  3 c.c. of distilled water.

where the investigation was made.*               At the Royal Observatory             the
means of the maxima in the sun's rays were : —
                      June                1261°  F. (52-3° 0.).
                      July                143-0 F. (61-6 C).
                      August              129-2  F.   (54-0     C).
   It cannot be      doubted that these tubes were often exposed to a tem
perature     of  140° F. (60° C), and on at least one occasion (July 27) to
160°   F. (71° C).
   The     incased     tubes had for radiant heat a somewhat greater
absorptive      power    than the bare glass of the insolated.           For tempera
tures below 100° F. (38° C.) this difference was comparatively slight ;
at 100°   F. it was 4-5° F. (2-5° C).
   It is certain, therefore, that any deleterious influence of heat should
tell more on the incased than on the insolated.                   Yet at the end of
four   months      Bacteria  appeared,    retarded   in   development, it is true,
but still morphologically identical with the forms originally found in
similar solutions.
    I  lay stress on these facts, because an Australian observer has
declaredf that we, and Professor Tyndall with us, have mistaken
effects of heat for supposed effects of actinism.             J
    But Dr. Jamieson's paper in abstract has gone the usual round of
German year-books and periscopic notes of English journals, until an
impression has arisen that there is no satisfactory evidence of inju
rious influence of light on micro-organisms.                I  trust, therefore, to be
permitted a few words in reply.
    Dr. Jamieson insolated Cohn's solution in phials, and found that in
a short space of time bacterial development might thereby be entirely
prevented.        But in some of his experiments he thought that he suc
ceeded better in hot weather than in cool, and he failed to produce
any effect in diffused light.         He asked himself, therefore, whether the
results he had noted might not have been, after all, due to heat.
    This was a very legitimate question, but, instead of solving it by
direct observation, he unfortunately recalled to mind experiments§ in
which B. termo had apparently been killed by seven days' exposure to
4o° C. (113° F.), by fourteen hours at 47° C. (116-6° F.), by three or

   X We cannot dispense with some word such as this to connote energy not neces
sarily coincident with effects either of solar heat or luminosity.      In using it above,
I go a little further than Professor Tyndall, who has not, I believe, yet given any
 opinion as to the form of radiant energy, except that it is not heat, which he found
to hinder bacterial development.

four hours at 50—52° C. (122— 125 6° F.), and by one hour at 60° C.
(140° F.).     He argued that some of these temperatures were com
monly    attained  in the sun's rays in Australia, and even in England ;
he thought that 125* F. (51-6° C.) would occasionally be experienced
for a few hours, and be concluded that his, our own, and Tyndall's
results were all effects of temperature.
   The argument is fallacious.        It is true that some organisms in
certain stages of their development may be destroyed by lower degrees
of heat than is commonly supposed. Duclaux has given au instance
in which forty-eight hours at 38° C. (100-4° F.) was fatal to some very
old yeast globules.
    But even of these it is true only in their vegetative forms ; their
spores (and the spore-form is doubtless that in which the micro
organisms originally existed in our nutrient liquids) resist elevations
of heat far surpassing anything noted above. Were it otherwise
bacterial life would probably soon cease to be.           It is obviously incor
rect to argue that, because some organisms in some phase of their
existence are destroyed by moderate heat, all organisms, in all phases
and under all conditions, are so too, and any inference drawn from
such reasoning must be rejected.
    Moreover,   I have already shown that the laminated lead used in our
experiments absorbed radiant heat in greater degree than the bare
glass, and consequently that our incased tubes would be more affected
by solar heat than our insolated.           And     I  need only refer to our
previous    demonstration,    that the greatest effect on micro-organisms
is produced     by those rays which occupy the cooler portion of the
spectrum.
    Dr. Jamieson failed with diffused light. His failure was due to his
method of experimenting.*
    I have already said that an essential element of success is to appor
tion the natural resistance of the cultivation liquids to the amount of
light available.     Bacterial development once started usually outruns
even direct sunlight, both by increasing the opacity of the fluid, and
by quickly reducing the amount of oxygen.               Naturally diffused light
would be far slower in action than the direct solar ray, and we must
select either very cool weather for the experiment, or must choose
solutions of considerable resistance.
    Keeping this principle in view,       I have found it easy to show that
diffused light possesses properties differing only in degree from those
which we have demonstrated in regard to direct sunlight.                  I  have
made a number of experiments in which ordinary thin test-tubes
plugged with cotton-wool were placed in a box (20p5 cm. cube) lined
   * Moreover, he seoms to have placed his bottles inside a window. The
                                                                           absorp
tive power of glass has always prevented me from succeeding in such circum
stances.

with white paper, having one side open, and tilted at such an angle as
to receive diffused light straight from the white clouds of the northern
sky. By no possibility could direct sunlight find an entrance.         In
the box were placed maximum and minimum thermometers, each
pair with bulbs respectively incased or left bare.
   In September, 1883, using Cohn's solution five times the ordinary
strength, in five days, four out of six incased tubes were noted as
" turbid," and the other two as " hazy," with bacteria. The exposed
tubes were recorded "beautifully clear." At the end of two days
more the latter were still clear, but in each were specks of mycelium.
The survival of mycelial growth over bacterial has already been
alluded to in the present paper, and is seen in Dr. Jamieson's own
experiments.
  But mycelial growth itself may be hindered by diffused light.
  In March, 1884, a sliglUly acid Cohn's solntion, two and a half times
ordinary strength, being specially selected, I found that at the end of
ten days     of the incased tubes contained mycelial specks, the six

to be the better radiators, and conditions of temperature were accord

    Pringsheim operated on chlorophyll tissues. By means of a lens
and a heliostat     he concentrated upon them sunlight, from which by
suitable media he had sifted out the heat rays. In a few minutes the
green colouring matter was destroyed, the protoplasmic circulation
arrested, the protoplasm disorganised, and the cell flaccid and inert.
He found, as we had found, that the more refrangible rays were the
most powerful, and he, too, concluded that he was dealing with an
oxidation, for in an atmosphere of hydrogen or of carbonic acid these
destructive results no longer ensued.
    The experiments of Siemens* and Deherainf also demonstrate both
the destructive influence of the electric light on vegetation and the
protective effect of a glass screen.

1886.]           Straining   of Ships  caused by Rolling.             23
actions which the rolling of a ship brings into play, or of the effect
of those straining actions upon the material of which the hull is com
posed.    Various writers, from Bonguer in 1746, down to Professor
Macquorne Rankine in 1866, and Sir E.         J. Reed in 1871, have dis
cussed the straining actions that are caused by longitudinal racking
and bending when a vessel is floating in statical equilibrium.       Sir
E.  J. Reed elaborately investigated the snbject in a paper contained
in the " Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society" for 1871,
and gave examples of the amounts and distribution of the stresses
caused by such straining actions in several typical ships of Her
Majesty's Navy. Mr. W. John supplemented this by a paper on the
strength of iron ships, read before the Institution of Naval Architects
in 1874, in which similar results were given for various classes of
vessels in the mercantile marine.
   The later investigations of these longitudinal straining actions
apply not only to the case of a ship floating in equilibrium in still
water, but also to cases in which she is (1) in instantaneous statical
equilibrium across the crest of a wave ; and (2) in instantaneous
statical equilibrium across the hollow of a wave — the wave-length
being equal to the length of the ship.
   Cases frequently occur which show, that the maximum stresses of
the material of a ship's hull are not in proportion to the results
obtained by the ordinary calculations; and that certain deductions
that have been drawn from those results are by no means sound.
For instance, it is said to follow from the analogy between the longi
tudinal bending action upon a ship afloat and that upon a loaded
girder, that there is little or no stress exerted upon that portion of a
ship's plating which is in the vicinity of the neutral axis for the
upright position ; and the inference has been drawn that, subject to
the consideration of the sides being occasionally brought, in some
degree, into the positions of flanges of a girder by large inclinations,
the thickness of the material may be decreased with advantage near
the neutral axis.     Now it cannot be shown that the plating which
is in the vicinity of the neutral axis when the ship is upright, is ever
brought into such a position by the rolling of a, vessel as to be much
affected by mere longitudinal bending.
   The reason commonly given for not decreasing considerably the
thickness of side plating in the vicinity of the upright neutral axis,
viz., that when a ship is in an inclined position, this plating may be
so placed as to offer the greatest resistance to longitudinal bending
is seen, if the matter be properly considered, to be obviously unsatis
factory.
    Other propositions respecting the relative distribution of stress
 in various parts of the structure have been deduced from consi
 derations and assumptions upon which the ordinary calculations of

2i                       Prof. F. Elgar.     On the               [Jan. 14,
longitudinal strength are based ; and rales have, in consequence, been
proposed for regulating the strength of the principal component part9
of ships' hulls.    It is only necessary here to say, that many of these
deductions, like the one already noticed, are unsound, and are not
consistent with the effects that may be observed of straining action
at sea.
    A considerable experience at sea, where the writer has closely
observed the effects of straining action caused by twisting moments,
and a further experience in investigating the stresses to which the
various portions of ships' hulls are subjected according to the theories
referred to, and in comparing the results so obtained with the visible
 evidences of straining action, have convinced him that the stresses
 caused by twisting moments are much greater than is generally sup
 posed, and that no rules for regulating the strength of ships can be
 satisfactory if based upon hypotheses that exclude all practical con
 sideration of twisting moments.
    The straining action which will be considered in this paper is that
 caused by the twisting moments which operate when a ship rolls
 from side to side ; and which are caused by differences in the longi
 tudinal distribution of the moments of the forces that cause rotation,
 and those which resist rotation.
    Let a unit of length included between two transverse vertical
  sections be taken at any point in a ship's length, and let fig. 1 be tho
  section of the ship at that point.       The section may be taken as
 uniform over this short length. The energy of rotation of this unit
 of length will  be ~ wk2  ; where w is the angular velocity in the upright

1886.]               Straining   of Ships   caused by  Rolling.             2.r>
position, w is the weight of the unit of length and its contents, and
 -&5  is the moment of inertia of the nnit of length about the axis of
rotation.
    In order to form an equation of energy and work, we require to
assume an axis of rotation for the ship ; and the assumption hero
made is, that the axis of rotation is a principal longitudinal axis
through the centre of gravity G of the whole ship and her contents.
A ship's axis of rotation is not, in reality, fixed ; but that may for
the present be disregarded.           The important point in connexion with
it iB that, whatever position the instantaneous axis may occupy at
any given moment, it is the axis about which each unit of length of
the ship is then rotating, with the same angular velocity.          This con
dition follows from the rigidity of the ship, or rather from the
structure being so nearly rigid that any motion of one part relatively
to another, about the axis of rotation, is so small that it may be
neglected.
    When the unit of length shown in section in fig. 1 is inclined to an
angle 0 from the upright, the principal forces which act upon it are —
 first, the weight w of every part of the ship and her contents that is
contained in this length, acting vertically downwards through its
centre of gravity g ; and, secondly, the weight of the volume of dis
placement d for the unit of length under consideration, acting ver
tically upwards in a line, dm, through its centre.            These forces are
equivalent      to  the  couple   d X gz, and  a vertical force at g equal to
«c —  d.
     Let G be the point in which the axis of rotation through the
centre of gravity of the ship intersects the section in fig. 1.           Then
 the moment which resists the inclination of the section at any angle 0
 will be the resultant of the two couples dxgz and — (w— d)Ga. Let
 w—d=c. The work done in inclining the unit of length in fig. 1 to
 the angle of inclination 9 will       be d\ gzdO— B\   GadO.   If a curve bo

    The difference between the energy of rotation of any portion of the
vessel's length AX and the work expended in inclining that portion,
in opposition to the moments of the forces exerted by its weight and
the fluid pressures upon it, is equal to the area MEA in fig. 2. This
area measures the excess of energy of rotation in the volume between
A and X, which is communicated through the hull of the ship to some
other part of her length at which the energy of rotation per unit of
length is less than the work required per unit of length to incline it to
the angle 9. This excess of energy is transmitted, by means of a
twisting moment upon the hull, to the part of the ship's length where
it is utilised in overcoming resistance.
   A graphical representation of the longitudinal distribution of the
mean twisting moments which act upon the hull when the vessel is
rolling to an angle 9 on each side of the upright position, may be
made by means of a curve so that any ordinate of the curve will give
the mean value of the twisting moment upon a section at the point for
which the ordinate is drawn.
   The values thus obtained for the twisting moments will be mean
values only.      The variation of twisting moment at any section of the
hull during a roll, and consequently the maximum twisting moment,

may be readily determined        ; and a method of doing this is described at
length in the paper.
    The results given by the investigations described apply only to
ships rolling from side to side in still water, assuming that the water
offers no resistance to rolling motion.             It is obvious, however, that
the twisting moments thus obtained must often be greatly exceeded
when a vessel is rolling and pitching while lying or moving across a
series of long ocean waves.          In these circumstances the bow or stern
frequently has so little immersion that the righting moment acting
upon a portion of one end is momentarily very small, and almost the
¦whole of the energy of rotation is applied to the production of twisting
moments.       The resistance of the water would also often increase the
twisting moments.
    It now remains to be seen what can be done in the way of deter
mining the stresses upon the hull which are caused by the twisting
moments.       We can learn something of the nature and distribution of
those stresses ; but, at present, their amounts cannot be calculated
with any reliable approach to accuracy. Experiments are required
upon the torsion of thin shells of various prismatic forms in order to
furnish the requisite data for dealing with so complicated a case as
that of a ship's hull. The difficulty of obtaining such data is very
great ; but pending the time when it is to be hoped this want will be
supplied, it may be useful to draw attention to some of the general
considerations which affect the twisting moments and the distribution
of the twisting strains and stresses over a ship's hull ; and to the
bearing which these have upon the important practical problems that
relate to the structural strength of ships.
    The best data available for guidance in judging of the distribution
of strain and stress due to twisting over the structure of a ship are
to be found in M. de St. Venant's investigations of the torsion of
prisms.*      These investigations assist us to form a general idea of the
manner in which a ship's structure may be strained by twisting ; and
they also indicate the nature of the experiments that are necessary to
furnish data for more exact investigations. The mean amount of the
twisting moment upon a ship's hull at any transverse plane of division,
and also the maximum twisting moment, may be obtained by the
method described in the present paper. The torsional strength of the
hull at that section will depend (1) upon the thin iron or steel shell
of which the structure consists, being stiffened internally so as to
effectually resist change of form ; and (2) upon the ratio which the
strength of a section of such form, when so stiffened, bears to that of a

hollow circular cylinder of the same thickness and the same sectional
area. Experiments upon the torsional strength of hollow prisms of
various forms, having the same sectional area and thickness of shell,
can alone determine the latter point ; while, at the same time, such
experiments would serve the further purpose of showing how the
condition above referred to — that the shell shall be stiffened internally
so as to effectually resist change of form — can best be complied
with.
   The distribution of the torsional stresses over the transverse section
of a ship's hull is obviously different from the distribution of the
stresses due to longitudinal bending.     The parts subjected to greatest
stress by twisting are those which are near to the centre of gravity of
the transverse section ; and they are the side plating near the neutral
axis of longitudinal bending in the upright position and the middle
portions of the plating of the decks.      Those parts of the hull which
are usually made the strongest, viz., the strakes of side and bottom
plating that are farthest from the neutral axis, and the upper deck
stringer plate, are those which are least affected by twisting.       It is
probably owing, in great measure, to the straining action caused by
twisting, that experience has proved it to be necessary to make the out
side plating of a ship of nearly uniform thickness over the whole section ;
and it cannot be because of the reason sometimes given, that the
plating in the vicinity of the neutral axis when a ship is upright i*
often brought by rolling into positions in which it is greatly strained
by longitudinal bending.
   The importance of many of the structural arrangements of ship*
that are described in the present paper, which practical experience
has shown to be necessary, may be understood from these considera
tions ; and it will also be seen that no rules for regulating the strength
of ships are likely to be satisfactory if based, as is often done, upon
the hypothesis that the straining actions caused by longitudinal
bending are so much more important than all others that it is suffi
cient to regard them alone.

directed to the seed. No doubt special facilities for investigation are
afforded thereby, for the different bodies can be detected there by the
aid of the microscope, and their behaviour under the action of
different reagents watched.                   Hence valuable results have been
arrived       at, and our knowledge of vegetable metabolism has made
considerable advance. By the investigations of Hoppe-Seyler,* Wejl,t
and Zoller,J the similarity of vegetable proteids to those occurring in
animals was pointed out, members of the globulin family at least
being shown to exist. Later Vines, by an exhaustive examination,
both macroscopic and microscopic, of a very large number of seeds,
 has added greatly to our knowledge of these bodies, proving that
besides globulins, a form of albumose, albuminates, and coagulated
 proteids are to be isolated, and showing the actual conditions and
 proportions in which these are present in the seeds. §
    It is evident, however, that our knowledge of the seed, even if made
complete, will not give us all the information we require concerning
 the nitrogenons metabolism of the plant.                        The condition of the
 proteid      matter    at  a   time   antecedent      to   its  appearance as reserve
 material must be considered as equal in importance and in interest.
 The round of changes going on normally in the leaves and the soft
 tissues of the stem has hitherto remained unknown, nor had we any
 knowledge of the condition and characters of the proteid bodies circu
 lating in the plant, and met with in the latex and in the soft green
 parts until recently, when Martin|| published an account of his in
 vestigations into the nature and action of the ferment present in the
 Papaw plant (Cariea papaya) and has therein described certain pro
 teids which he has fonnd to be present in the dried milk of the fruit
 of the plant. These he says are four in number, two belonging to the
 group of the albumoses, a globulin and an albumin.                     To the albumoses,
 which are the most plentiful in amount, he gives the names of
 a and     /3 phytalbumose.
     During the summer of 1884 I was enabled, through the kindness of
 Mr. Thiselton Dyer, Assistant Director of the Royal Gardens, Kew,
 to make        some investigations into            the composition        of the latex of
 several caoutchouc-yielding plants belonging                     to  the   natural orders

quantities of caoutchouc, resinous matters, &c., the latter being very
variable in amount, and absent from some samples. The material was
collected in the Malay Peninsula from the plants, and a little alcohol
having been added as a preservative, was sent to England in sealed
bottles.      On its arrival at the laboratory, some of the bottles had
their contents hardly at all changed except that the large amount of
caoutchouc contained in the fluid had undergone the process techni
cally known as coagulation, and was floating in a milky liquid.
Others had become quite spoiled in transit, the latex having deposited
a quantity of amorphous matter, which gave a xanthoproteic                          reac
tion, and seemed to be coagulated proteid. In the debris besides
this, there appeared under the microscope, a number of small droplets
of caoutchouc, a few sphaero-crystals, some spicular crystals, and some
flat plates of rhomboidal form.
     Examination of these last as to proteids not being practicable,
attention was given to the uninjured samples, which differed in no
way from each other.            The particular experiments, whose results are
detailed     below,  were    made   upon the latex of a plant, the Malay name
of which was given as
                               " Gegrip puteh."*
     The mass of caoutchouc floating in the fluid was allowed to drain
dry, and was then with difficulty cut up into small pieces and mace
rated some in water and some in salt solutions. Soaking for several
days failed to extract anything of a proteid nature from it. Atten
tion, therefore, was directed to the liquid remaining after its separa
tion.      This, as said above, was milky in appearance, of a faintly
yellow colour, aromatic smell,[and neutral reaction.              Under the micro
scope it was      at  once   apparent     that the milky appearance was due to
minute droplets of caoutchouc which had not separated out with the
bulk. There was nothing granular or amorphous visible, showing
that the proteids had not been precipitated by the alcohol used. To
free the latex from the caoutchouc, filtration under vacuum pressure
through a porous pot was necessary, when the droplets formed a film
round the earthenware, and as the liquid was gradually removed they
fused together, giving rise to a thin sheet of india-rubber.                  The fluid
passed     through    the  pot  clear  and  in a condition  fit for  examination.
     In this liquid so prepared a very curious proteid body was found
to exist, differing in important particulars from any hitherto described
as occurring in plants. t             Its presence was readily shown by the

xanthoproteic reaction, the orange colour on the addition of the
ammonia being very marked.                  On warming the liquid gradually to
boiling point there was no coagulation or opalescence, and on adding
nitric acid there was no precipitate.              Hence the body does not belong
to the groups of albumins or globulins.                  On dropping the boiled
liquid into large excess of alcohol, a precipitate was slowly formed,
which after standing some hours settled to the bottom of the vessel.
These reactions suggested a member of the class of peptones, and as
these proteids, though thrown down from their watery solutions by
alcohol, are not changed by contact with the spirit, the precipitate
was allowed to remain as it settled for about three weeks.                    At the
expiration of that time the alcohol was decanted off, and the precipi
tate dried.      It was then found to be freely soluble in distilled water,
and to give, as the original latex did, a well-marked xanthoproteic
reaction.
    A further resemblance between this body and the group of peptones
was revealed by its behaviour when submitted to dialysis. A quantity
of the solution of the precipitate that had been standing nnder alcohol
was put into a dialyser and suspended in twice its volume of distilled
water. After two days the fluid outside the dialyser was examined.
It gave readily the xanthoproteic reaction, and on addition of a large
volume of alcohol a marked opalescence appeared, which on standing
became a precipitate.            Hence this proteid body appeared to have
considerable resemblance to the group of peptones, if not to be a
member of it.
    Further examination, however, brought to light some points that
indicated a relation to the albumoses also. Saturation of the solution
of the alcohol precipitate by solid MgS04 gave a copious precipitate,
which was redissolved on adding water.                    The liquid outside the
dialyser in the last experiment behaved similarly. The precipitation
took place with equal readiness whether the reaction of the solntion
were neutral or slightly either alkaline or acid. Till recently the
precipitation of a proteid by saturation of its solution with a neutral
salt was held to be a mark of a globulin, but this reaction cannot now
be held to be sufficient of itself to prove this. Halliburton has shown*
that it is possible to precipitate serum albumin by such a process, the
salt necessary being the double sulphate of magnesium and sodium.
Heynsius has statedf that peptone itself may be thrown down from
its solntion by ammonium sulphate in similar quantity ; a statement
that is endorsed by Martin.            J    Pollitzer§ denies this, as far as true

peptone is concerned, and shows that by the process peptones and
albumoses may be separated.               A recent paper by Kiihne* also dis
cusses this question, and shows that true peptone remains in solution
while the ammonium             sulphate throws down all the albumoses.          He
further explains the          results  that  Heynsius  arrived  at, by showing
that the commercial          specimens of peptones that the latter used and
thought to be pure           were largely mixed with albumoses.            Though
peptone has not yet           been precipitated by saturation of its solution
 with neutral salts, it      seems to be almost the only form of proteid that
has refused to behave so, and it seems to be rather a question of what
salt will throw down a particular proteid, than that such precipitation
 is a mark of any particular group.
     The solution of the alcohol precipitate differed also from that of an
 animal peptone, in not giving a pink colour on the addition of sodic
 hydrate and a drop of cupric sulphate (biuret reaction). It agreed
 with it, however, in not giving a precipitate with potassic ferro-
 cyanide and acetic acid.
     Careful investigation of this body disproved the idea that it might
 really consist of a mixture of an albumose and a peptone for the
 solution of the precipitate, whether prepared by saturation with
 neutral salt, or by treatment with excess of alcohol, uniformly
 answered all the tests applied as described above.           The dialysate also
 behaved on all these points just as the solution before dialysis.
 There is no doubt, therefore, that the body was a single one and not a
 mixture.
     In examining the proteids found in other plants this body was again
  met with, and its reactions investigated at some length. It will be
  convenient therefore to postpone summarising them until later.
     A little later in the year Mr. Dyer kindly sent me a bottle of the
  latex of Mimusops globosa, Gaartu (Sapotacece).^            This differed very
  much from that of the East Indian latex-yielding trees, being a thick,
  almost pasty, liquid of white appearance and sour smell.                It would
  not filter clear through paper and was therefore submitted to the
  action of the filter-pump used before. The diluted filtrate, and a
  watery extract of the dried residue, were taken for examination.
     The solution thus obtained proved on investigation to contain two
  proteid bodies, which could be separated from each other with
  tolerable ease.        On heating the solution gradually, having first
  neutralised, a little opalescence appeared, but it did not become par
  ticulate even at the boiling point. When the liquid was made either

acid or alkaline, however, it behaved differently. In a nitric acid
solution an opalescence was noticeable when the temperature had
risen to 85— 90" C. This was not removed by the addition of more
nitric acid. On keeping the vessel for some time at this temperature,
the opalescence     became a precipitate,        which was soluble at ordinary
temperatures in alkalis, slightly so in water, but not in nitric acid.
The solutions gave the xanthoproteic reaction. A curious point about
this body was the slowness with which the precipitate formed, it
appearing not at all like the usual conversion into coagulated proteid
on a rise of temperature, but more like a slow precipitation by the
reagent at that particular point. This was confirmed by several ex
periments,     one of which, often repeated, was the following.                 A
quantity of the extract was made acid with nitric acid and warmed
to 75° C, a point considerably below that at which the precipitate was
first observed to form. It was then allowed to cool, and as the tem
perature was gradually falling, the precipitate slowly separated out.
The body seemed then to be slowly precipitated by nitric acid, but
not at the ordinary temperature.
   In an alkaline solution its behaviour was somewhat different. The
opalescence set in at 79° C, and a bulky precipitate settled out slowly
at 85° C.     This was soluble to a large extent in nitric acid, and was
reprecipitated     when the liquid was made alkaline.              A solution in
caustic soda of the precipitate caused by nitric acid at 85° C. behaved
similarly.     The precipitation here also seemed to be caused by the
 reagent   and  not by the temperature, for the alkaline liquid deposited
the proteid body on cooling just as the acid one did, and in about the
same time as when the temperature was kept constant at 85° C.
Both precipitates were unaltered in the separation ; each went into
solution readily in its appropriate medium, the solutions all giving
the xanthoproteic reaction.
   This proteid gave no precipitate with acetic acid and potassic ferro-
cyanide.
   After removal of this body by repeated boiling and filtration, the
clear fluid gave a good xanthoproteic reaction.             On applying some of
the tests used in the case of the East Indian latex, the same peptone
like body was found to be present.                It dialysed readily, and the
solution in water gave a precipitate 'on saturation with solid MgS04.
   Hence it appears that the latex of Mimusops globosa contains two
proteids, one a member of the albumose group, precipitated under
certain conditions by nitric acid or by potash, but not by boiling, and
the other more nearly related to the peptones.

containing, among other constituents, a fibrous matter of animal
nature, which was obtained by evaporating the latex down to dryness,
washing the residue with essential oils to free it from waxy and
resinous matters, and then getting rid of the essential oils by pressing
dry and boiling with water. This treatment left them a brown mass
which contained nitrogen.           On heating this on hot iron they say it
burned, giving off an odour similar to that coming from meat heated
in the same way. This matter was not soluble in alcohol, and when
obtained by repeated extraction with hot spirit, was left as a residue
composed of white flexible threads.              Thinking it possessed all the
characteristics of animal fibrin they gave it the same name.
   Since the date of their paper no information has been forthcoming
as to the real nature of this vegetable fibrin.               A quantity of the
latex was obtained by Dr. Vines from Dr. Ernst of Caracas, and a
bottle of it was, by his kindness, made available for the purposes of
this investigation.       The fluid had been mixed with a small amount of
alcohol with a view to its preservation during its transit to England,
and the treatment had been not quite so successful as that of the East
Indian latex, some, bnt not much, of the proteid having been
coagulated by the spirit.         Still the fluid was of thick creamy con
sistency, and on digestion with water, and subsequent filtration,
yielded a strongly proteid solution.* Extracts were made with water
and with solutions of neutral salts, but the resulting liquid behaved in
the same manner by whichever method it was prepared.
   This extract contained two proteids, one of which was of the nature
of an albumin. When the solution made with distilled water was
examined, it was found to contain no salts capable of holding a
globulin in solution, the only ones present being a mere trace of
phosphates.       The solution, on being dialysed till free from salts
altogether, did not deposit any precipitate.            On being boiled there
was a well-marked coagulum, and after filtration the now coagulated
matter gave a strongly marked xanthoproteic reaction.                    When the
solution was gradually heated in the usual apparatus^ the coagula
tion of the proteid took place at 68° C. The other tests for a proteid
were fairly satisfactory, but were applied with more difficulty than
with an animal albumin.           With Millon's reagent there was a white
precipitate, which went brick-red on boiling ; with copper sulphate
and sodic hydrate the violet colour was obtained, but not unless the
 soda solution was very strong.            There was, however, no precipitate
 with acetic acid and potassic ferrocyanide.

       This body is of great interest, as till lately no true albumin has
  been      described as occurring in plants.                Ritthausen's albumins,
  described by him in 1872,* as found in seeds, have been shown by
  later observers, notably by Vines, to be rather globulins held in
  solution by the neutral salts present in the seeds.               Even Ritthausen
  himself admits that the existence of a true albumin in seeds had not
  been established satisfactorily as lately as 1877.J              In Martin's paper
  already referred to, he describes a body which he has found to be
  present in Papaw juice, which has the properties of an albumin. It is
  coagulated on boiling, is not precipitated on dialysing an extract of the
 juice, nor on saturating the solution by solid neutral salt. The body
 just described as occurring in the latex of Brosimum seems to be
 identical with this.            It is noteworthy that both in the case of
 Martin's albumin and that which has just been described, the albumin
 appears to be a form of the circulating and not of the reserve proteid.
 Boussingault's vegetable fibrin was probably this albumin coagulated
 by the action of the hot alcohol used in its extraction.                      There
 was no other body in the latex that would become coagulated
 proteid.
      The other proteid found in this latex remained in solution after
 boiling and filtering off the coagulated albumin.                 It was hence not
 changed by heating ; it dialysed easily through a membrane, was pre
 cipitated but not coagulated by alcohol, and was precipitated by
 saturation of its solution by solid MgS04.               It was therefore the same
body      as   described   above    as  a  constituent   of   the East Indian latex.
 In the Brosimum latex there was a larger amount of it present, 'and
its reactions were therefore carefully confirmed.                     Besides those
 already mentioned, two more peculiarities were noticed.                    In dilute
 solution, a stream of C02 passed through it for several hours caused
a precipitate.        On submitting it in concentrated or dilute solution to
the action of artificial gastric juice, it underwent conversion into a
true peptone, which gave a biuret reaction as readily as peptone pre
pared by the same method from fibrin or other animal proteid.
There was not, however, during the digestion, any formation of acid
albumin.
     To protect the result from a danger of error arising from peptone
being present in the artificial gastric juice employed, the experiment
was performed as follows : —
     A certain amount of the proteid was taken from under alcohol, dis
solved in water, and the solution decolorised by filtration through
animal charcoal.          A solution of pepsin in 0'4 per cent. HC1 was
made and filtered.           To a quantity of the proteid solution an equal

 bulk of this extract was added, and a similar quantity of the same
 was added, in another vessel, to as much water as the quantity of the
  proteid solution taken.       The two were submitted to a temperature of
  40° C. for twenty-four hours.          The biuret test was then applied to
 both, care being taken to have equal quantities taken, and the same
 amount of caustic soda and copper sulphate added to each. Peptone
 was shown to be present in both, but the colour was the deeper in the
 case of the proteid solution.         Hence, though a trace of peptone was
 present in the juice employed, the experiment showed formation from
 the proteid in the latex.
    All the material investigated so far had been taken from the plant
 a considerable time before being examined ; also a certain but varying
 amount of alcohol had been mixed with it. There was consequently
 a donble  possibility of decomposition of some sort having taken place.
 In  one case at least there was no doubt         that   a certain   portion of the
 proteid had been coagulated.           It seemed desirable therefore to in
 vestigate certain plants that could be obtained in fair quantity in the
 fresh condition, and as laticiferous tissues were those in which most
 proteid matter would be found, choice was made of Manihot glaziovii
 Muell. Arg. (Eu-phorbiacece)* and the common lettuce, Lactuca sativa,
L. (Compositce) . A considerable number of the young plants of the
former of these was kindly raised by Mr. Irwin Lynch, at the Botanic
 Garden, Cambridge, and on their attaining a height of about 10 feet
they were cut down and examined.               On wounding them a milky latex
exuded, but it was impossible to get this to flow in sufficient quantity
to work with, hence another method of extracting it proved necessary.
The young plants were cut down, their stems taken and freed from
leaves and branches, and the cortex scraped off by a blunt knife. The
mass of tissue was then finely minced, pounded in a mortar, and put
into a quantity of water just sufficient to cover the pulp.                    After
standing    for  twenty-four      hours   the   whole   was   strained   in  a press
through a coarse cloth, yielding a filtrate, turbid, and full of small
particles of debris, chlorophyll granules, &c.                In quantity it was
about twice the bulk        of  the  water   used  ; this solution therefore    was
diluted latex, containing also any soluble matter originally present in
the parenchymatous tissue of the cortex.              Filtration, repeated many
times, freed it ultimately from all colouring matters and debris
arising from the preliminary treatment.             Any soluble proteid existing
temporarily or permanently         in the tissue was hence in this extract.
    The proteids normally present in the sieve tubes of Manihot have
not been determined, but it is fair to assume that they do not materi
ally differ from those of Cucurbita.          From these Zachariasf has found
it possible to extract a proteid body which behaves like a globulin.

 It is insoluble in distilled water or in sulphate of soda solution, but is
soluble in weak acids or alkalis. Its precipitate in distilled water is
changed by contact with alcohol into a white stringy mass.          It gives
the xanthoproteic reaction, and that with copper sulphate and potassic
hydrate. Fischer* has observed also that the fluid contents of the
sieve tubes in Cucurbita become coagulated on heating.
    The first investigation of the extract prepared as above, was not
easy on account of the difficulty of getting rid of the soluble phos
phates, which were found to be present in considerable quantity.
They were removed by warming with ammonia, but the last traces
were very hard to throw down.          The liquid finally, however, ceased
to give a precipitate with ammonium molybdate.           Besides the phos
phates the salts present were sulphates and chlorides, but both were
much smaller in amount than the phosphates.
    Having freed the extract from phosphates, it was found to coagu
late on boiling, and the coagnlum gave the xanthoproteic reaction.
On heating it more slowly an opalescence was found to appear at 74 —
 76° C, which was replaced by a precipitate at about 80° C.            After
filtering this precipitate off, no further opalescence took place up to
boiling point. Dialysis for some time caused a precipitate, though
not a very bulky one. Saturation of the neutralised liquid with
MgS04 gave a precipitate, and a stream of C03 through a weak
solution did the same.       These reactions, taken together, indicated the
presence of a globulin, of pretty much the same character as that
found in Cucurbita by Zacharias and Fischer.          They were not, how
ever, quite conclusive, as several of the methods used would have
 thrown down, if it were present, the body described as occurring in
 latices examined before.       This body was therefore looked for and
 found. After getting rid of the globulin by heating and filtering, the
liquid gave the same reactions as those described before as belonging
to that body.       The dialysis especially was well marked, alcohol
giving a proteid precipitate readily with the liquid outside the
dialyser. The globulin was not so readily isolated, but it proved
possible to get it by dialysis.        It was not present in such large
quantity as the other, and was more readily precipitated completely
from its solution by saturation with solid MgS04, for the fluid, when
both were present, gave a xanthoproteic reaction after it had ceased
to give a precipitate on boiling. It was also precipitated on very large
dilution.
    Hence in the extract of Manihot are two proteids, one being
globulin in nature and agreeing in its reactions with that of Zacharius
and of Fischer ; being satisfactorily separated from the other without
injury only by dialysis ; both giving precipitates on saturation with
solid MgS04. A similar body to this globulin has been described by
          •   " Berichte   d. deutsch. bot. Gesell.," vol.   ii,   No.   7,   1885.

precipitated on boiling, the coagulating point being 70 — 74° C. ; pre
cipitated on dialysis ; by C03 from dilute solution ; and by saturation
of its neutral solution with MgS04.            The two appear to be identical.
   An extract of Lactuca sativa was prepared in a similar way to that
described     in the case of Manihot.       In this there was no globulin, but
instead a proteid resembling Vines'sf hemialbumose.                It was pre
cipitated on the addition of nitric acid, and the precipitate was largely
soluble in excess.        Addition of potassic ferrocyanide to this solution
gave a precipitate.         On filtering off the nitric acid precipitate it was
found to be soluble in water and dilute alkalis, and the solution was
not coagulated on boiling. The precipitate gave the xanthoproteic
reaction.      It  differed from Vines's body in its solutions not giving
the biuret reaction, but agreed with it in not dialysing. After
removal of this albumose the extract contained in solution a quantity
of the dialysable proteid described as occurring in previous cases.
   Before leaving       the investigation it seemed well to examine a plant
which should        belong to an order not specially laticiferous.          The
common cabbage (Brassica oleracea, L.), being succulent, was selected.
Its examination was not particularly fruitful, bringing to light only
the fact that the dialysable proteid was present there as well as in the
other     plants.    It  was not in this case examined very closely.         No
other proteid was found.
   My researches, so far, agree with those of Martin in not showing
the presence of true peptone in plants.

       Stokes, P.R.S. Received January                   6, 1886.
                                       (Abstract.)
    The author has had occasion, whilst investigating the internal
friction of metals, to determine the coefficient of viscosity of air.
The viscosity of air has already engaged the attention of several dis
tinguished experimenters, amongst others, of G. G. Stokes, Meyer, and
Clerk Maxwell.         The results obtained, however, differ so widely that
it was considered necessary to institute fresh researches into the same
subject.
   The author employed the torsional vibrations of cylinders and
spheres, suspended vertically from a horizontal cylindrical bar, and
oscillating in a sufficiently nnconfined space.             The bar was suspended
by   a rather   fine wire    of  copper   or silver attached   to its centre, which,
after having been previously subjected to a certain preliminary treat
ment with a view of reducing the internal molecular friction, was set
in vibration. The vibrations were performed in a large box, which
was rendered sufficiently air-tight to prevent currents of air from
vitiating the results.          The wire, which was about 97 cm. in length,
was suspended in an air-chamber, the donble walls of which enclosed
between them a layer of water.                  This air-chamber was in turn
surrounded by a second, also provided with double walls which con
tained sawdust in the space between them.                   The object of the two
air-chambers was to protect the wire as much as possible from small
fluctuations of temperature, which last had been found to render the
internal friction of the metal very uncertain.
    The coefficient of viscosity of air was obtained from observations of
the diminution of the amplitude of vibration, produced by the resis
tance of the air to the oscillating spheres or cylinders attached to the
horizontal bar, arrangements having been made so that the vibration-
period of the wire should remain the same, whether the cylinders or
spheres were hanging to the bar or not.                 In deducing the value of
the coefficient of viscosity from the logarithmic decrement, the
author has availed himself of the mathematical^ investigations of
Professor G. G. Stokes.*
    Five sets of experiments were made with hollow cylinders and
wooden spheres, in the construction and measurement of which con
siderable care was taken.              When the cylinders were used arrange-

Maxwell     has proved* that the coefficient of viscosity of air is inde
pendent of the pressure and directly proportional to the absolute
temperature.     We can, therefore, calculate from the above data what
would be the value of the coefficient of viscosity at 0° C. ; and when

   [The method followed by Maxwell is liable to be vitiated to a very
sensible degree by small errors of level of the movable disks, especially
when they are closest to the fixed disks. The final adjustment is
stated to have been that of the fixed disks, and no special precautions
seem to have been taken to secure the exact horizontality of the
movable disks.    By a calculation founded on the equations of motion

   I propose to express by formulae the relation that subsists between
the statures of specified men and those of their kinsmen in any given
degree, and to explain the processes through which family peculiarities
of stature gradually diminish, until in every remote degree of kinship
the group of kinsmen becomes undistinguishable from a group
selected out of the general population at random.      I shall determine

    I  selected stature for the subject of this inquiry, for reasons fully
set forth in two recent publications,* which dealt with one small
portion of the ground covered by the present memoir, and from
which it will be convenient that             I should make as      I  proceed occa
sional short extracts, in order to complete the present argument and
to save cross-reference.           The reasons that combine to render stature
an excellent subject for hereditary inquiry are, briefly, the ease and
frequency of its measurement, its constancy during adult life, its
inconsiderable influence on the death-rate, its dependence on a mul

tiplicity of separate elements, and other points that shall dwell on
as   I  proceed, namely, the ease with which female statures are trans

equal terms with male statures, the tendency of the parental statures
to blend in inheritance, and the disregard of stature in marriage
 selection.
    Stature-schemes. — It is an axiom of statistics that large samples
taken out of the same population at random are statistically similar,
 and in snch inquiries as these which do not aim at minute accuracy,
 they may be considered identical. Thus the statures in every group,
 say of 1000 male adults, when distributed in order of their mag
 nitudes at equal distances apart and in a row, will form almost
 identical figures ; it being only towards either end of the long row
 that irregularities will begin to show themselves.                These are unim
 portant    in the present    inquiry   and  I disregard  them.     The Diagram S,
 fig. 1, shows the outline of such a group of statures.              It is drawn to
 scale, each of the statures being supposed to have been represented
 by a vertical line of proportionate length, standing on a horizontal
 base, the lines being at equal distances apart, and the whole system
 being compressed into the space between two termini, which may
 be set at any convenient distance asunder.                 The vertical lines in
 the figure     do  not    indicate    these   statures, but    they are divisions,
  ten in number, between each of which 100 stature lines are com
  pressed.     The first and last stature will not touch the termini,
  but will be removed from them by a half-interval.                      As it will
  be convenient to assign a name to this figure, I will call it a

"stature-scheme." The numerous cases near mediocrity that differ
little from one another, cause the middle portion of the upper
boundary of the stature-scheme to assume a gentle slope, which
 increases rapidly towards either end, where the increasing rareness
of more and more exceptional cases causes that boundary line to slope
 upwards, as an asymptote to one of the termini, and downwards as
an asymptote to the other.
    Now suppose that instead    of compressing 1000 statures between
the termini,    I compressed  1000 x 1000, or a million of them, the
 stature-scheme   would be unaltered, except that such small irregular
 ities as might have been previously seen would become smoothed.
 The height of the middlemost or median stature-line would remain
 the same as before, aud so would the heights of the lines standing at
each quarter, each tenth, and at every other proportionate      distance
 between the termini.     Or again, instead of arranging the lines in a
  single scheme, we might arrange them in a thousand schemes, which
 as we have seen, would be practically identical in shape, and we may
 place these schemes side by side, as is done in Z, fig. 1, forming a

 upon a square base. Our squadron may be considered as made up of
 ranks (parallel to the plum' of zx) as in Z, or of files (parallel to the
 plane of zy) as in A.        The ranks, as we have seen, are all similar
 stature-schemes,     the files are all rectangles which have the same
 breadths but are of dissimilar heights.
    It is now easy to give a general idea, to be developed as we proceed,
 of the way in which any large sample of a population gives rise to a
 group of distant kinsmen in any given degree, who are statistically
 (in all respects except numbers) undistinguishable as regards their
 statures from themselves.        I  must suppose for convenience of ex
 planation, that tall, short, and mediocre men are equally fertile
 (which is not, however, strictly the case, the tall being somewhat
 less fertile than the short*), and then on referring to fig. 2, the
                                      Fig. 2.
fortunes of the distant descendants of two of the rectangular files of
squadron A will be seen traced.
    As the number of kinsmen, in any remote degree we please to
specify, of the men in each of the two files is about the same ;           I take
1000 of them in each case.         Again, as the stature- schemes of those
kinsmen are identical with those of equal numbers of men taken at
random, as samples of the general population, it follows that they

will be identical with one another.               Every other rectangular file
being similarly represented, a complete squadron Z of the kinsmen
is produced.       It is obvious, then, that the squadrons A and Z are
identical, and as the ranks of Z have proceeded from the files of A,
the result is that the two squadrons will stand at right angles to one
another.       The upper surface of A was curved in rank, but was
horizontal in file ; that of Z is curved in file, but is horizontal in
rank.
    Kinsmen in near degrees are represented by squadrons of inter
mediate form.        These will not have lost the whole of the curvature
in rank of A, nor will they have acquired the whole of the curvature
in file of Z. Consequently they will be curved moderately in both
ways.* Also it will be found that the intersection of their surfaces by
the horizontal plane of median height forms in each case an approxi
mately straight line that assumes different and increasing inclinations,
in the successive squadrons of intermediate shape between A and Z.
These lines are indicated by straight lines on the squares below the
squadrons in fig. 4, which represent the square bases upon which the
squadrons stand.
    I   shall now show how         these curves    in rank and file should be
treated.      But before doing so, it is necessary to remark that female
adult stature (I speak throughout of adults) may be safely trans
 muted to its male equivalent by multiplying it by a constant constant,
 which as regards my data is 1"08.               After this has been done, the
transmuted female statures may be treated on equal terms with the
male statures, and the word " men
                                               "

include both sexes, unless otherwise stated distinctly. This procedure
is adopted in the present memoir.
     It is now generally recognised that the statures in every ordinary
 population     are distributed in approximate          conformity with what
might have been inferred, if it were known that their variations were
governed by such conditions as those upon which the exponential law
of frequency of error is based. Therefore the upper boundary of the

 which are not strictly symmetrical.        The numerical value of the

    Construction of Stature? Schemes and of Ogives from Observations. —
 The method of drawing an ogive from observations of stature is as
follows. The observations (see Tables III, IV, and V, and compare with
VI and VII) are sorted into grades, such as " . . . cases of 60 inches
and under 61,"     "...  cases of 61 inches and under 62," &c.  If we are
constructing a stature-scheme, or desire to obtain the median value of
the series, we have to consider these values of inches, but in con
structing no more than an ogive, which is only the upper boundary of
a   stature-scheme,  it suffices to consider them   as successive  grades
of 1 inch each, and I reckon the first grade not as 0, but as 1.
This has been done in column A, Table VI, for the sake of
treating different groups on a uniform plan.             The number of
cases in these grades are then summed from the beginning, and
the sum, up to each grade inclusive, is written down, as shown

 48                           Mr.  F. Galton.                    [Jan. 21,
in column B in Table VI. The percentage values of these, taking the
total number of observations as 100, are written in column C. A series
is there obtained which shows how many per cent, of the statures fall
short of the parting value that separates each pair of adjacent grades.
Thus if n per cent, of the statures fall within the first r grades, that
is to say, are less than the value of the rth parting line, then 100 — n
per cent, of them will exceed that value. Consequently, if the observa
tions are read off and recorded to the utmost nicety, r will be the value
of the ordinate representing the stature which has to be erected on a
base line at n per cent, of its length from one of its ends.      In short,
a base line of any convenient length has to be divided into 100 parts,
and an ordinate of a length proportionate to r erected at the division n.
As observations are never read off and recorded with perfect accuracy,
a correction has here to be applied according to the circumstances of
the particular case, whenever we are drawing a stature-scheme, and
not merely an ogive.       If the records are kept to the nearest mth
                               "                     " would
part of an inch, the phrase      exceeding r inches           really mean
exceeding r — 1/m inches."     This then is the true parting value corre
sponding to the nominal r. In drawing ogives, and not stature-
schemes, this correction may of course be disregarded.             Having
erected   ordinates  corresponding   to each value   of r, their tops are
connected by straight lines forming a polygonal boundary that
approximates to the curvature of an ogive, and would become one if
it were corrected with a free hand, or otherwise smoothed. The
ceDtre of the ogive lies at the intersection of the curve with the
ordinate drawn from the base at the fiftieth division, and the hori
zontal axis of the ogive runs through that point of intersection (see
fig. 3).
    A half-ogive, whose ordinates are the mean lengths of the symme
trically disposed ordinates of the complete ogive, is constructed on the
same general principles, but more simply, because the base from
which it is plotted coincides with the axis of the ogive, and the
graduations run alike, viz., from 0° to 50°.
   In Table VII, the entries in the first lines of each of the three
groups it contains, are the lengths of the ordinates that have been
measured from the bases of ogives constructed from the data in
Table VI. The abscissas corresponding to the measured ordinates,
are in every case the same fractional lengths of the bases.            The
entries in the second lines are the differences between these several
ordinates and the median ordinate ; they are, therefore, the deviates.
The entries in the third lines are the negative deviates written under
the corresponding positive ones. The entries in the fourth lines are
the means of the values of the positive and negative deviates, dis
regarding their signs.

observations, its aria is divided into 100 parts, the fiftieth division
being reckoned as 0°, then the deviates standing at the + graduations
of 10°, 20°, 25°, 30°, 40°, and 45° are measured.            The mean of each
pair of lengths, not regarding signs, has then to be divided by the
mean lengths of the deviates at + 25°, that is by the quartile deviate,
and so is made to yield a series that is directly comparable with
column B in Table I. The closeness with which it conforms to that
standard series is the test of the closeness with which the observations
conform to the law of frequency of error.
   Table   II effects this comparison for all the series that         I  have to
deal with in the present paper.       The values are entirely unsmoothed,
except in two named instances, being taken from measurements made
to the above-mentioned       polygonal boundary.          I  thought it best to
give these interpolated values in this, their rudest form, leaving it to
be understood that with perfectly legitimate correction the accordance
would become still closer. I do not cany the comparison beyond 45°,
partly because my cases are not numerous enough to admit of a fair
comparison being made, and chiefly because             I   am well aware that
conformity is not to be expected towards the end of any series.            I am
content to deal with nine-tenths of the observations, namely, those
between 0° and 45°, and to pay little heed to the remaining tenth,
between 45° and 50°.       It will be seen that the conformity of more
than one half of each series is closer than to the first decimal place,
and that in absolute measurement it is closer than to one-tenth of an
inch.
   Arithmetic and Geometric Means. — I use throughout this inquiry the
ordinary law of frequency of error, which being based on the assump
tion of entire ignorance of the conditions of variability, necessarily
proceeds on the hypothesis that plus and minus deviations of equal
amounts are equally probable. In the present subject of discussion our
ignorance is not so complete ; there is good reason to suppose that
plus and minus deviations, of which the probability is equal, are so
connected together that the ratio between the lower observed measure
ment and the truth is equal to that between the truth and the upper
observed measurement.        My reasons for this were explained some
years ago,    and   were  accompanied by a memoir by Mr. Donald
Macalister, showing how the law of frequency of error would be
modified if based on the geometric, instead of on the arithmetic mean.*
Though in the present instance the former process is undoubtedly the
more correct of the two, the smallDess of the error here introduced by
using the well known law is so insignificant that it is not worth
regarding. Thus the mean stature of the population is about
<U+2666>38-3  inches, and the quartile of the stature-scheme (the probable
error) is 1*7 inch, or only about one-fortieth of its amount, and the

   Regression. — It is a universal rule that the unknown kinsman in
any degree of any specified man, is probably more mediocre than he.
Let the relationship be what it may, it is safe to wager that the
unknown kinsman of a person whose stature is 68j + x inches, is of
some height 68^ + x inches, where x' is less than x. The reason of
this can be shown to be due to the combined effect of two causes :
(1) the statistical constancy during successive generations of the
statures of the same population who live under, generally speaking,
uniform conditions ; (2) to the reasonable presumption that a sample
of the original population and a sample of their kinsmen in any
specified degree are statistically similar in the distribution of their
statures.      To fix the ideas, let us take an example, namely, that of
the relation between men and their nephews : — (a.) A sample of men,
and a sample of the nephews of those men, are presumed to be statis
tically alike in stature, that is to say, their mean heights and their
quartile deviates of height will be of the same value.                 I
                                                                    will call the
value of this quartile p.            (6.) Each family of nephews affords a
series of statures that are distributed above and below the common
mean of them.         They are deviations from a central family value, or,
as we may phrase              it,
                             from a nepotal centre, and       will be found as
                                                                  it
we proceed (it results from what appears in Tables III, IV, and V)
that these deviations are in conformity with the law of error, and
that the quartile values (probable errors) of these systems of devia
 tions, which we will call             are practically uniform, whatever the
                                        /,
 value of the central nepotal family stature may be.             (c.) It will be
 found, as     it    reasonable enough to anticipate,
                    is                                     that  the system of
 nepotal centres        distributed above and below the median stature of
                         is
 the population, in conformity with the law of frequency of error, and
 with a    quartile value that we will call d. It follows from (a) that we
 possess data for an equation between p,            and f, which, from a well-

the squadron of known men. We have seen that                ,  becomes 0 in
remote degrees of kinship,      and   I  shall show that in intermediate
 degrees the value of x'jx is constant for all statures in the same
degree of kinship. This fraction is what      I call the ratio of regression,
 and I designate it by w. Consequently the above formula becomes
 w2pi+f!=p2, which is universally applicable to all degrees of kinship
 between man and man, so long as the statistics of height of the
 population remain unchanged.
    Hence in the squadrons, the curvature in rank is an ogive with the
 quartile value of wp, and in file with one having the quartile value of
/, these two values being connected by the above formula. If the
 squadron is resolved into its elements, and those elements are redis
 tributed into an ordinary stature-scheme, the quartile of the latter
 will be p.
    Another way of explaining the universal tendency to regression may
 l>e followed by showing that this tendency necessarily    exists in each of
the three primary relationships, fraternal, filial, and parental, and there
 fore in all derivative kinships.   Fraternal regression may be ascribed
 to the compromise of two conflicting tendencies on the part of the
 unknown brother, the one to resemble the given man, the other to
 resemble the mean of the race, in other words to be mediocre. It will
 be seen that this compromise results in a probable fraternal stature that
 is expressed by the formulae (p2— b2)/p2, in which b is a constant as
 well as p, therefore the ratio of fraternal regression is also a constant.
 Filial regression is due (as I explained more fully than 1 need do
 here, in the publications alluded to in the second paragraph) to the
 concurrence of atavism with the tendency to resemble the parent.
The remote ancestry in any mixed population resembles, as has been

peculiarities are transmitted in a diluted amount.             Parental regres
sion   is shown to be the necessary converse of filial regression by
mathematical considerations, kindly investigated for me by Mr. Dick
son, in the Appendix to this memoir in Problem 1. It is easy in a
general way to see that this would be the case, but            I find it not easy
otherwise to prove it.         Still less would it be easy to prove the con
nexion between filial and mid-parental regression, which depend on
considerations that are thoroughly investigated in the Appendix.

   Data. — will now describe the data from which I obtain my
conclusions.       They consist of two sets of practically independent
observations, though they do in some small degree overlap.
   (1.) Special observations.           These concern variation in height
among brothers.         I  circulated cards of inquiry among trusted cor
respondents,    stating   that  I wanted records of the heights of brothers
who are more than 24 and less than 60 years of age ; not necessarily
of all the brothers of the same family, but of as many of them as
could be easily and accurately measured, the height of even two
brothers being acceptable. If more than one set of brothers were
entered on the same card, the entries were of course to be kept
separate.      The back of the card was ruled vertically in three
parallel columns : (a) family name of each set of brothers ; (6) order
of birth in each set; (c) height, without shoes, in feet and inches.
A place was reserved at the bottom for the name and address of the
sender.     The circle of inquiry widened, and          I closed it when I had
obtained returns of 295 families, containing in the aggregate 783
brothers.
   I  look upon these returns as quite as trustworthy as any such
returns are likely to be. They bear every internal test that               I  can
apply to them very satisfactorily. They are commonly recorded to
quarter and half inches.
   (2.) R.F.F. data. By this abbreviation I refer to the Records of
                             I
Family Faculties that obtained in the summer of 1884, in reply to
an offer of prizes.       I have been able to extract from these the heights
of 205 couples of parents, with those of an aggregate of 930 adult
children of both sexes.         I have transmuted all the female heights to
their male equivalents, and have treated them thus transmuted on
equal terms with the measurement of males, except where otherwise
expressed.      These data have by no means the precision of the special
observations.       There is in many cases considerable doubt whether
the measurements refer to the height with the shoes on or off; many
entries are,     I  fear, only estimates, and the heights are commonly
given only to the nearest inch.          Still, speaking from a knowledge of
many     of the    contributors,   I am   satisfied that a fair share of these

  1880.]                  Family Likeness in Stature.                         53
  returns are undoubtedly careful and thoroughly trustworthy, so that
   I have reason to place confidence in mean results. They bear those
                                                         I
  internal tests that I apply to them better than should have expected,
  and when taken in connexion with and checked by the special data,
  and used with statistical caution, they have proved very valuable to
  me.
      I have discussed these materials in a great variety of ways to guard
  myself against rash conclusions, but        I   shall not present more than
  three primary tables, which contain sufficient materials         for determin
  ing the constants of the formulae to be used.
     The first of them (Table     III) refers to the children    of what   I call
  " mid-parents " of various      statures.   A    mid-parent is the imaginary
  mean of the two parents, after the female measurements have been
  transmuted to their male equivalents, so that a mid-parent of 70
 inches in height refers to a couple whose mean stature under the above
 reservations is    70 inches.   I have                       "
                                         given data in the Journ. Anthrop.
  Inst." (loc. eit.) to show that we need not regard differences in stature
 between the parents, inasmuch as the distribution of heights among
 the children proves to be statistically the same, so long as the mid-
 parentages are alike, whether the two parents are the same or of
 different statures.     This blending of paternal and maternal qualities
 in the stature of the offspring is one great advantage in selecting
 stature as a subject for the present inquiry.
      General Population. — (1.) Its variability.      The value of the quartile
 deviate in the population ogive (that is to say, the probable error)
 may be deduced from the bottom lines of any one of the three Tables
 III, IV, and V. Those in        III and IV refer to data that are in part
 but by no means wholly the same, that of V refers to almost totally
 distinct data.      The work is shown in Tables VI and VII; in the
 former the ordinates are calculated whence the ogive is drawn, in the
latter    I  have given the values of the measured ordinates at the same
 points along its axis as those to which the ordinates given in Table I
refer.      The values of the quartile that     I  obtain in this way from the
 three cases are 1*65, 17, and 1*7.       I should say that the more careful
treatment that       I originally adopted happened to make the first of
these values also 1*7, so I have no hesitation in accepting 1*7 as the
 proper value of p for all my data.
     (2.) Variability of system of mid-parents.        I have published data in
the memoir already alluded to, to show          that   marriage selection takes
small account of stature, which is another great merit in stature as a
subject for this inquiry.       Some further proof of this may be got by
comparing the variability of the system of mid-parents with that of
the general population.        If the married couples had paired together
regardless of stature, their mean heights would be elements of a
statistical system identical with one in which the pairs had been

selected at random.        In this latter    case the quartile value of the
system of mid-parents would he 1/^/2 .p=V21 inch. Now,                 I find the
quartile   of the  series of  the   mid-parental system      obtained  from   the
two columns in Table III, that are headed respectively " Heights of
                    " and " Total number of
the mid-parents                                       mid-parents," to be
inches,* which is an unexpectedly exact accordance.
    (3.) Median Stature.      I  obtain the values 68 2, 68S, 68 4, from the
three series mentioned above, but the middle value, printed in italics,
is a smoothed value. This is one of the only two smoothed values in
the whole work, and has been justifiably corrected because the one
ordinate that happens to accord closely with the median is out of
harmony with all the rest of the curve.            This fortuitous discrepancy
amounts to more than O'lo inch. It does not affect the quartile value,
because neither the upper nor the lower quartile is touched, and,
therefore, the half-interquartile remains unchanged.                It must be
recollected that the series in question refers to R.F.F. brothers, which
are a somewhat conditioned selection from the general R.F.F. popula
tion, and could not be expected to afford as regular an ogive as that
made from observations of men selected from the population at
hazard.     It is undoubtedly in this group that the least accuracy was
to have been expected .
    Mean Ratios of Regression in the Primary Degrees of Kinship. — (1.)
From the stature of mid-parents of the same height, to the mean of
the statures of all their children.      I  have already (loe. cit.) published
the conclusions to which       I  arrived about this, but it is necessary to
enter here into detail.       The data are contained in Table III, where
each line exhibits the distribution of stature among the children of all
the mid-parents in my list, who were of the stature that forms the
 argument to that line.       The median stature in each successive line
is the mean stature of all the children, and is given at the side in the
column headed " Medians." Their values are graphically represented
 in fig. 5. It will be there seen that these value are disposed about
 a straight line.   If the median statures of the children had been the
 same as those of their mid-parents this line would have accorded with
 the line AB, which, from the construction of the table, is inclined at
an angle of 45° to the line "Mean Stature of Population," which
represents the level of mediocrity.        However, it does not do this,       but
its position is inclined at a smaller angle, 0, such that
                             tan 0 : tan 45   : : 2 : 3.
This gives us the ratio of regression (=«>) in the present            case  ; and,
 therefore, in the notation    I adopt  m>=§.

parents have a deviate of +x, the mean of the deviates of all of their
family centres will be         It follows that if one parent only has
that deviate +x, and if the stature of the other parent is unknown,
and, therefore, on the average, mediocre, the mean of the statures of
their children will be half the above amount, or        I cannot test this
conclusion very satisfactorily by   direct observation,  for my data are
barely numerous enough to enable me to deal even with the mid-
parentages. They are consequently insufficient to deal with a question
involving the additional large uncertainty of the stature of one of the
parents.   I have, however, tabulated the data, but do not think it
worth while to give them. They yield a ratio of regression of O40
instead of 0*33 as above.     I
                              disregard        it,

Table    III
           in the same way as we have just dealt with the horizontal
lines, we obtain results of the same general form as in the last para
graph but one, though of different values.
   Taking the height of group of men of the same stature (viz., the
                          a
" Adult Children   ")  as given in the line that forms the heading to
the table, we find the median stature of all their mid-parents, whence
I  deduce in this case            The apparent paradox that the same
table should give results by no means converse in their values for
converse degrees of kinship, will be more conveniently         examined
later on.

in any one line of Tables III,            IV, V, or of other tables constructed
on a like principle. They are the kinsmen in a specified degree, not
of a single person, but of a group of like persons, who probably differ
both in ancestry and nurture.       For example, the persons to whom the
entries opposite 68"5 in Table            III
                                         refer are not brothers, but they are
what   I call " co-fraternals," or from    another point of view, "co-filials,"
namely, the children of numerous mid-parentages, differing variously
in their antecedents, and alike only in their personal statures.
   Co-filial Variability.
                          — It appears from Table                      III
                                                            that the mean of
the quartiles derived from the successive lines, and which I designate
by /, is 1*5 inch ; also that the quartiles are of nearly the same value
in all of the lines, allowance being made for statistical irregularities.
A protraction on a large sheet of the individual observations in their
several exact places, gave the result that the quartile was a trifle
larger for the children of tall mid-parentages than for those of short
ones.   This justifies what was said some time back about the use of
the geometric mean ; it also justifies the neglect here of the method
founded upon        it,

   Converse Ratios      Regression. — We are now sufficiently advanced
                          of
to be able to examine more closely the apparent paradox that the
ratio of regression from the stature of mid-parents of the same height
to the mean of the statures of their sons should be       while that of          §,
men of the same stature to the mean of the statures of their several

 intersection of the lines that separated the vertical columns with
 those that separated the horizontal lines, the sums of the four adja
cent entries.   Then  I drew lines with a free hand through all entries,
or interpolations between entries, that were of the same value.       These
lines formed a concentric series of elliptical figures, passing through
 values of z that diminished, going outwards.        Their common centre
at which z was the greatest, and which therefore was the portion of
maximum frequency, lay at the point where both x and y were of the
same value of 68^ inches, that    is,of the value of the mean stature of
the population. The line in which the major axes of the ellipses lay
was inclined nearer to the axis of x than that of y. It was evident
from the construction that the median value of the entries, whether
in each line or in each column of the table, must lie at the point
where that line or column was touched by the projection of one of these
ellipses.   It was easy also to believe that the equation to the surface
of frequency and the lines of loci of the above-mentioned points of
contact, admitted of mathematical expression.       Also that the problem
to be solved might be expressed in a form that had no reference to

to another one (also given in the Appendix), in the course of my
further remarks.
   As regards the present subject of the connexion between the regres
sion in direct and in converse kinships,         appears that
                                                    it               wholly it
depends on the relation between the quartiles of the two series of
"arguments," and     is expressed by the formula e2w=piw'.          In this
case   cs=(l-21)2=l-46, and p5=2         89   ;   also   w=§;       therefore    «/=£
nearly.
  It will be observed that in all cases of converse kinship, from man
to man — as from man to brother, and conversely   from man to nephew,
                                                         ;
and conversely ;  from father to son, and conversely  c=p, therefore
                                                                ;
in these the ratio of regression   the same in the converse as in the
                                  is
direct kinship.
   Brotherly Variability. — The size of human families         much toois
small to admit of the quartile of brotherly variability being deter
mined in the same way as that of the population, namely, by finding
the quartiles in single families, but there are four indirect ways of
finding its value, which will call
                          I             b.
   (1.) A collection of differences (see Table VIII) between the statures
of individual brothers, in families of n brothers, and the mean of all
the n statures in the same family, gives a quartile value, which      will      I

 qnartile would be b. Then if we select from       at random, numerous          it,

only as many differences should be taken out of each family as are

                                     1
should be taken.     I  did not appreciate this necessity at first, and
selected pairs of brothers on an arbitrary system, which had at
all events the merit of not taking more than four pairs of differences
from any family, however numerous.       It was faulty in taking three
differences instead of only two from        family of three, and four

giving an increased weight to those families, but in other respects
the system was hardly objectionable.      On the whole the introduced
error would be so slight as scarcely to make     worth while now to go
                                                                 it

      The R.F.F. results refer to brothers only and not to transmuted
  sisters, except in method (2) , where the pancity of the data com
  pelled me to include them.         I should point out that the data used in
  these four methods differ.                I
                                    In (1) did not use families under four.
  In (2) and (3) I did not use large families.             In (4) the method of
  selection was as we have seen, again different.           This makes the ac
  cordance of the results still more gratifying.             I  gather from the
  above that we may securely consider the value of b to be less than
  1*10, and allowing for some want of precision in the special data, the
  very convenient value of I/O inch may reasonably be adopted.
     We are now able to deal completely with the distribution of
  statures in every degree of kinship of the kinsmen of those whose
 statures we know, but whose ancestral statures we are ignorant of or
  do not take into account.        We are, in short, able to construct tables
 on the form of III, IV, and V, for every degree of kinship, and to
 reconstruct those tables in a way that shall be free from irregularities.
 The fraternal relation as distinguished from the co-fraternal has also
 been clearly explained.
     In constructing a table of the form of III, IV, and V, we first find
 the value of w for the degree of kinship in question, thence we deduce
/   by means of the general equation w»ps+/2=jp2 (p is supposed to be
 known, or for the general purpose of comparing the relative nearness
 of different degrees of kinship as tested by family likeness in stature,
it may be taken as unity). The entries to be made in the several
 lines are then to be calculated from the ordinary tables of the " pro
 bability integral."
     As an example of the first part of the process, suppose we are con
structing a table of men and their nephews. A nephew is the son
of a brother, therefore in his case we have w = £ X § = ; and               f
/=pv/(l-w2),=l-66.

    Trustworthiness of the Constants. — There is difficulty in correcting
the results obtained solely from the R.F.F. data, by help of the
knowledge of their general inaccuracy as compared with the

1886.]                   Family Likeness in Stature.                         61
 special data.     The reason is that this inaccuracy cannot be ascribed
 to an uncertainty of equal + amount in every entry, snch as might
be due to a doubt of "shoes off" or "shoes on."              If it were so, the
 quartile deviate of the      R.F.F. would be greater than that of the
specials,  whereas    it proves to be the same.      It is likely that the in-
accuracy is a result of the uncertainty above mentioned, which would
increase the value of the quartile deviate, combined with a tendency
on the part of my correspondents to record medium statures when
they were in doubt, and which would reduce the quartile deviate.
 What the effect of all this might       be on the  value of w in Table IV,
which is a datum of primary importance,           I am not prepared to say,
except that it cannot be great.       While sincerely desirous of obtaining
a revised value of w from new and more accurate data, the provisional
value   I  have adopted may be accepted as quite accurate enough for
the present.
    Separate Contribution of each Ancestor to the Heritage of the Child. —
I  here insert a short extract from my paper in the " Journ. Anthrop.
Inst.," with slight revision,    as this memoir would be incomplete with
out it.
   When we say that the mid-parent contributes two-thirds of his
peculiarity of height to the offspring, it is supposed that nothing is
known about the previous ancestor.            But though nothing is known,
something     is implied,  and this must   be eliminated before we can learn
what the parental bequest, pure and simple, may amount to. Let
the deviate of the mid-parent be x (including the sign), then the im
plied deviate of the mid-grandparent will be              of the mid-ancestor
in the next generation ±x, and so on. Hence the sum of the deviates
of all the mid-generations that contribute to the heritage of the off
spring is x(l+$ + ±+&c.)=,%.
   Do they contribute on equal terms, or otherwise ?               I have not
sufficient data to yield a direct reply, and must, therefore, try the
effects of limiting suppositions.        First, suppose the generations to
contribute in proportion to the values of their respective mid-deviates;
then as an accumulation of ancestral deviates whose sum amounts to
of, yields an effective heritage of only :r| , it follows that each piece of
heritable property must be reduced, as it were, by a succession tax, to
>- of its
          original amount, because X   f f
   Another supposition is that of successive proportionate diminutions,
the property being taxed afresh in each transmission to 1/r of its
amount, so that the effective heritage would be —
                                           x\, whence -=— .
                                                        T    6
and  this must,    as before, be equal to

C>2                          Mr. F. Galton.                        [Jan. 21,
     A  third possible supposition of the mid-ancestral deviate in any one
remote generation contributing more than would be done by an equal
mid-parental deviate, is notoriously incorrect.       Thns the descendants
of "pedigree wheat       " in the (say) twentieth generation show no sign
of the remarkable size of their mid-ancestors in that degree, bat the
offspring in the first generation do so unmistakably.
    The results of our only two valid limiting suppositions are therefore
(1) that the mid-parental deviate, pure and simple, influences the
offspring to £ of its amount ; (2) that it influences it to the -jSj. of its
amount.        These values differ but slightly from      and their mean is
closely       so we may fairly accept that result.     Hence the influence,
pure and simple, of the mid-parent may be taken as               of the mid-
grandparent         of the mid-great-grandparent       and so on. That of
the individual parent would therefore be           of the individual grand
parent -fa, of an individual in the next generation -fa, and so on.
    [I do not propose here to discuss the reason why the effective
heritage of the child should be less than the accumulated deviates of
his ancestors.       It is obviously connected with considerations that
bear on stability of type.]
    Pure breed. — In a perfectly pure breed, maintained during an in
definitely long period by careful selection, w would become =0, and
the value of b would be changed, but apparently only a little. Call its
new value   /3.   It may be roughly estimated as follows. In mixed breeds
the value of      6includes the probable uncertainty of the implied value
of the contributions inherited from the mid-grandparents, and from
the mid-ancestry of each preceding generation.           This can be but a
trifle.    Suppose the quartile of the uncertainty in the implied stature

IL " The Early        Development         of Julus terreshis."' By F. G.
      Heathcote, M.A., Trin. Coll. Cam. Communicated by
      Professor M. Foster, Sec. R.S. Received January 6, 1886.
   The following are the principal results of my investigations on the
early development of Julus terrestris since June, 1882.
   When laid the eggs are oval in shape, white, and covered with a
thick chitinous chorion.         The nucleus is situated in a mass of
protoplasm in the centre of the ovum.             This mass of protoplasm is of
irregular shape,    but its long axis corresponds with that of the ovum.
From it, anastomosing processes radiate in all directions, forming a
network throughout the egg.              The yolk-spherules are contained
within the meshes of this network. The nucleus is not a distinct
vesicle but its position is marked by chromatin granules.                There is no
nucleolus.
    Early on the second day the nucleus and the central mass of
protoplasm apparently divide into two parts. But this division is not
complete, the two resulting masses with their nuclei remaining con
nected by a network of protoplasm.               Each of these divides in the
same incomplete manner, so that we now have four segments all
connected together.        This process is continued until there are a
considerable number of segmentation masses present, and early on the
   • Mr. J. D. Gibson Carmichael, F.L.3.,  has kindly identified the  species for me as
Julys terratrit, Leach, 1814.

third day the first formation of the blastoderm begins.       Early on the
third day some of the segmentation masses make their appearance on
the ontside of the ovum at different parts, and there undergo rapid
division, the resulting cells spreading out to form the blastoderm.
At the close of the blastoderm formation, the ovum consists of an
external layer of flat cells — the epiblaast — with deeply stained oval
nuclei, these cells being continuous on the one hand with one another,
and on the other with the cells in the yolk by means of fine processes
of protoplasm.     The cells in the interior of the yolk are the direct
descendants of the first segmentation masses.         They constitute the
hypoblast.
   The fate of these hypoblast cells is various ; some of them are
employed in the formation of the mesoblastic keel which        I am about
to describe, that is, in the formation of the splanchnic and somatic
mesoblast.     Another part gives rise to the hypoplastic lining of the
mesenteron, while a third part remains in the yolk after the
mesenteron is formed, and gives rise to mesoblast cells which are
employed in the formation of varions muscles and of the circulatory
system.
    With regard to the retention of the primitive connexion of the
cells of the ovum until this stage, nothing of the sort has,     I believe,
been described before except by Sedgwick in Peripatus.           The most
important part it seems to me is not the connexion of cell to cell but
 of layer to layer by means of processes of the cells.
   About the middle of the fourth day several of the hypoblast cells
approach the epiblast in the middle line of what will eventually be
the ventral surface of the embryo.       This is the first beginning of a
mesoblastic     keel  such     as Balfour has described for Agelena
labyrinthica.    When   a fair number  of these cells are assembled in the
middle line of the ventral surface a change takes place in the cells of
the epiblast just outside them.       They become more rounded, their
nuclei become round ; in fact they come to resemble the cells which        I
have described as assembling immediately below them.
    The epiblast cells in the middle ventral line after altering their
shape increase by division and take a considerable share in the formation
of the keel. The hypoblast cells below them also increase, and on the
fifth day the mesoblastic keel is complete.           Both epiblast and
 hypoblast have taken part in the formation of this keel.
    At the end of the sixth day the keel is still present, but the cells of
which it is composed are becoming elongate^ in the direction parallel
 to the surface.     At the same time they continue to multiply and
 spread themselves out so as to form two definite layers within the
epiblast.     These are the splanchnic      and somatic layers of the
 mesoblast.    The cells of the splanchnic and somatic mesoblast are
 connected.

    On the seventh and eighth days the keel gradually disappears, and
the layers of mesoblast spread ronnd a great part of the embryo,
rather more than half way round.              On the ventral surface the
epiblast cells assume a columnar form, thus giving rise to the ventral
plate.
    The mesoblast now becomes thicker on each side of the middle
ventral line. Both layers are concerned in this thickening, and at
these points the two layers become indistinguishable.           Outside the
thickenings, that is further away from the middle ventral line, the
two layers are closely applied to each other, and to the epiblast as
before.    The effect of these changes is that the greater part of the
mesoblast is now ariwnged in two parallel longitudinal bands along
the ventral surface of the embryo ; these bands being connected across
the middle line by a thin portion consisting of a single layer.
    The two longitudinal bands now begin to be constricted off into the
mesoblastic somites.       The latter are formed from before backwards,
and their position corresponds with that of the future segments of the
body.     The number of the somites is eight, corresponding with that
of the eight segments with which the embryo is finally hatched.         The
somites are at first solid, afterwards a cavity appears in them.
    Early on the ninth day the stomodamm is formed as an invagination
of the epiblast near one end of the ventral surface. Shortly after
the first formation of the stomodaenm, the proctodaeum appears as a
shallow somewhat wide invagination of the other end of the ventral
surface.
    The body-segments already established by the segmentation of the
mesoblast now become more apparent, each being marked by a deep
transverse furrow in the epiblast.          The hypoblast cells are still
present within the yolk, but are gradually becoming collected in the
median line, just below the mesoblastic bands.        The stomodaeum and
proctodaeum    become   more  deeply invaginated, extending a considerable
distance into the yolk, and at the same time the hypoblast cells
 begin to form the mesenteron, arranging themselves around a central
lumen.
    On the tenth day the ventral flexure is formed by a deepening of
the transverse furrow between the seventh and eighth segments.             It
 is, therefore, first formed nearer the anal end of the embryo.       As the
furrow deepens and the embryo increases in size,           the last segment
grows in length. At the same time the embryo curves round towards
the ventral surface.       The effect of this is that the end segment is
bent round against the head.           The eighth segment is considerably
 longer  than  the  others  except the  head, and the tissues there show a
 considerable difference.     Even as late as the twelfth day, when the
 nervous system is far developed in all other parts of the body, in the
eighth segment the tissues are imperfectly differentiated,        the nerve

cords nut showing any ganglia, bnt lying on the epiblast and not
quite separated from it. At a later period of development the anal
segment is constricted off from this segment, while from its anterior
part  the future segments formed in the course of development are
developed.
   Just before the appearance of the ventral flexure the embryo
develops a cuticular envelope over the whole surface of the body.
This is the so-called amnion of Newport. Just before the formation
of the ventral flexure the nervous system is formed.      The first traces
of this consist in a thickening of the epiblast on each side of the
middle line.    This is soon followed by the formation of a shallow
furrow between the thickened parts ; this longitudinal furrow
corresponds with that described by Metschnikoff in Strongylosoma.
The bilobed cerebral ganglia are formed first, and the nerve cords are
formed from before backwards, a pair of ganglia being present for
each segment except the last.      The posterior portion of the nerve
cords is completed at a considerably       later stage of development.
The nerve cords are widely separated, but are connected by a thin
median portion.     In later embryonic life they are closely approached
to one another, and almost form one cord.
   On the eleventh day the embryo has increased considerably in size.
The ventral flexure is complete, and the animal lies with the long
end segment folded closely against the rest of the body, the end of
the tail being against the stomodaaum. The nervous system is now
completely    separated    from the epiblast, and the epiblast has
assumed the adult form.      It now separates a second membrane like
that which is formed on the tenth day.
   The splanchnic layer of mesoblast covers the meseuteron, the
stomodaeum, and proctodaeum.
   Within the yolk, which is still present in great quantity in the body
cavity, there are present a number of hypoblast cells.     These, as have
already been mentioned, give rise to the circulatory system and to
various   muscles.    They may, therefore, be now considered as
mesoblastic cells which have been directly derived from the hypoblast.
   On the twelfth day the Malpighian tubes are formed as blind
outgrowths of the proctodaeum, the nervous system is further
developed, and the first rudiments of the appendages begin to appear.
Late on this day the animal is hatched with only the rudiments of its
appendages.    I propose to reserve a full description of this stage for a
future paper.

 III.  u  On Radiant Matter Spectroscopy : Note on the Spectra of
     Erbia." By William Crookes, F.R.S. Received Jan. 7, 1886.
    I have     recently succeeded in getting the earth erbia in a sufficiently
 pure state to allow me to examine its phosphorescent spectrum without
 the interference which might be produced by the presence of yttria,
 samaria, holmia, thulia, Y<* or ytterbia.             As in the case of yttria*
 the spectrum is best seen when erbic sulphate is heated to redness and
 submitted to the electric discharge in a high vacuum.                  The addition
 of calcic sulphate interferes with the purity of the spectrum.                 In this
 respect erbia differs from samaria, as the latter earth seems to require
 the presence of some other metal to develop its phosphorescent
 properties.
    The phosphorescent spectrum of erbia consists of four green bands,
of which the following measurements have been taken :—

yttrium or samarium          spectrum.       The nearest approach to a coinci
dence is between the first erbia green and the samarium green, but
when the two spectra are examined one over the other it is seen that
the samarium band is less refrangible than the erbium band.
    The first green of Ya occurs midway between the first and second
greens of erbia, and the second Ya green comes between the second
 and third erbia greens.

 by sun or electric light and examined in the spectroscope it gives a
 spectrum    of black lines and bands as sharp and distinct as the
 Fraunhofer lines.     Fig. 2 shows the erbia spectrum by reflection.
 It is strange that this most characteristic property has been recorded
 by   so few  observers.    Indeed, the only notice of it  I  have come
 across   is a passing remark of Professor Cleve's that " the light
 reflected by dry erbia shows absorption-bands."
    Fig. 3 shows the absorption spectrum given by a solution of pure
 erbic chloride.   It differs in some respects from the drawings mapped
 from older observations, as the absorption lines of holmia and thalia
 are absent.     The fine group of lines in the green of the reflection
 spectrum is also absent in the absorption spectrum.
     The spectrum of bright lines emitted when erbia is rendered
  incandescent in the blowpipe flame has been often observed, but the

of black lines sharply defined on a continuous spectrum.

    Fig. 5 shows the characteristic lines in the spark spectrum of
erbium, taken from a concentrated acid solution of erbic chloride,
 with a Leyden jar in a shunt circuit.
    I have thought it advisable to give these five spectra of erbium, as
they show how entirely different the phosphorescent spectrum is to
any other spectrum given by this element. .
IV. " On     the Clark Cell as a Standard of Electromotive Force."
       By  the Lord Rayleigh, M.A., D.C.L., Sec. R.S. Received
       January   7, 1886.
                                   (Abstract.)
   This paper, supplementary       to that  " On the Electrochemical Equi
valent of Silver, and on the Absolute Electromotive Force of Clark
Cells,"* gives the further history of the cells there spoken of, and
discusses the relative advantages of various modes of preparation.
The greatest errors arise from the liquid failing to be saturated with
,inc sulphate, in which case the electromotive force is too high. The
opposite error of swper-saturation is met with in certain cases,
especially when the cells have been heated during or after charging.
Experiments are detailed describing how cells originally supersa
turated have been corrected, and how in others the electromotive
force has been reduced by the occurrence of supersaturation conse
quent on heating.     If these errors be avoided, as may easily be done ;
if the mercury be pure (preferably distilled in vacuo), and if either
the paste be originally neutralised (with zinc carbonate), or a few
weeks be allowed to elapse (during which the solution is supposed to
neutralise itself), the electromotive force appears to be trustworthy
to y 6\)6 part.   This conclusion is founded upon the comparison of
a large number of cells prepared by the author and by other physicists,
including Dr. Alder Wright, Mr. M. Evans, Dr. Fleming, Professor
Forbes, and Mr. Threlfall.
   As regards temperature coefficient, no important variation has been
discovered in saturated cells, whether prepared by the author or by
others. In all cases we may take with abundant accuracy for ordinary
applications —
                     E=l-435{1- 0-00077(<-15°)},
 the temperature being reckoned in centigrade degrees.        For purposes
of great delicacy it is advisable to protect the standards from large
                        * " Phil. Trans.," vol. 175, 1884.

 fluctuations of temperature.        Under favourable circumstances two
 cells will retain their relative values to nroifff for weeks or months
 together.
    Unless carefully sealed up, the cells lose liquid by exudation and
 evaporation, and then the electromotive force gradually falls. Marine
 glue appears to afford a better protection than paraffine-wax, and
 there seems to be no reason why cells thus secured should not remain
 in good order for several years.
    In cells of the H-construction (§ 29 of former paper) the leg con
 taining the amalgam (but not the one containing pure mercury) is
 liable to burst, apparently in consequence of a tendency to alloy with
 the platinum. Protection with cement of the part of the platinum
next the glass has been tried, but no decisive judgment as to the
adequacy of this plan can as yet be given.
    Recent cells, intended for solid zincs, have been made of a simplified
 pattern — nothing more, in fact, than a small tube with a platinum
 wire sealed through its closed end. The zincs are not recast, and the
 paste is prepared from (unwashed) mercurous sulphate rubbed up in
a mortar with saturated solution of zinc sulphate and a little zinc
carbonate.     A stock of paste may be prepared and retained for use in
a bottle.
    Experiments are described tending to prove that the irregularities
observed during the first few weeks of the life of a cell prepared with
acid materials, have their origin principally at the mercury electrode.
    Cells prepared with dilute solutions have a lower temperature
coefficient   (about O00038), but would be more difficult to use as
standards whose value is to be inferred from the mode of preparation.
    Details are given of H-cells charged with amalgams of zinc and
mercury in both legs, without mercurous sulphate.             A very small
proportion of zinc is sufficient to produce the maximum effect. Pure
mercury, neither alloyed with zinc nor in contact with mercurons
sulphate, has an uncertain electromotive value.
    Since the comparison of cells does not absolutely exclude a small
general alteration of electromotive force with age, further determina
tions of the standard cell (No. 1) have been effected by means of the
silver voltameter.     The results —

    It has been known for many years past that in the islands of
St. Helena and Ascension observations of the three magnetic elements
made at different stations gave remarkably divergent results, caused
by some undefined local magnetic attraction.
    Thus in the observations at St. Helena,* carried out under the
auspices of the British Government in 1840—46, it was found that the
 observed inclination and intensity differed considerably at the two
stations of Longwood and Sister's Walk, 2^ miles apart, and these
again differed from those made on board ships in the anchorage.
    This question of local magnetic disturbance is one which has
engaged the attention of observers on continents and islands adjacent
to them, in making magnetic surveys, when sometimes largo areas
have been found affected, and in others but very small ones. In such
cases the normal values of the three magnetic elements have been
obtained either by calculation from observations made in supposed
undisturbed districts, or by graphic methods.
    Thus in discussing the results of the magnetic survey of Scotland,
made by the late Mr. Welsh in 1857-58,t Professor Balfour Stewart
obtained the values of the local disturbances in the islands of Skye
and Mull by calculating the normal lines of equal values of the
magnetic elements for the mainland of Scotland, and extending
beyond the adjacent islands on the west coast.

    As an instance of unusual local disturbance in that part of the
 British Islands, the Compass Hill in the island of Canna,* near Skye,
 may be mentioned.          Here the disturbance was sufficient to render a
 compass    useless,  and   every small movement of the observing instru
 ments gave different results.
    For Ascension and St. Helena, and some other islands situated far
 from a continent, normal values of the magnetic elements have been
obtained from observations at sea, and the object of this paper is to
 show how this may be done, and the resulting amount and nature of
 the disturbances in the islands visited.
    The following values of the three magnetic elements observed at
 eleven islands represent the data collected for this purpose.
    An inspection of them shows that they consist of a series of obser
vations made on land, and which when made at different stations on
the same island give divergent results caused by some local magnetic
disturbance.
    In order to obtain undisturbed or normal values, observations made
on board ships, in which the amount of magnetic disturbance is
known, have been adopted.
    These normal values obtained on board ship are from observations
made with       the ship's head placed on eight or sixteen azimuths
equally distributed round the horizon in the process called "swinging,"
all effects of the iron of the ship being eliminated by the methods set

    It is important to note that these swingings took place in the neigh
bourhood of the island to be magnetically examined, and some small
 corrections had to be applied for differences of geographical position
from the land stations.         An example is given below of the method of
deriving    the  normal    values  of the magnetic elements for a positiou ou

    The observations       have been divided into two sections — first, those
made on islands situated north of the magnetic equator, and in which
the local disturbances have been generally found to be due to an
excess of biuej magnetism above the normal ; secondly, those made on
islands situated south of the magnetic equator, in which the disturb
ances are generally caused by an excess of red magnetism.

line of the diagram, the red ends of the declination and dipping
needles being attracted towards this focus with a force varying
according to the place of observation.
    Thus in the case of the declination at all stations situated to the
north-east of the focus, the westerly declinations are seen to be in
excess, and those to the 'south-west in defect of the normal value.
    In the inclination and vertical force a great increase of value may
be seen      in passing from the seaward side of the islands towards the
area enclosed by the dotted line of the diagram.
    A portion of the disturbance just noticed may possibly be due to
the ferruginous nature of the soil at Bermuda;* bat this does not
detract from the evidence just adduced of the existence of a strong
 focus of blue magnetism about the position assigned to it in the
 diagram.
    In the eastern extremity of the group there are also evidences of
 local magnetic disturbance at the observing stations of Hen Island,
 Button Island, and Fort Cunningham.

    The above observations of declination, made near Funchal, on the
 south side of the island, differ considerably (with one exception) from
 the normal, 3° 44' being the greatest difference.
    There is also much disturbance in the inclination. In one position
                                                                  I
 visited by the officers of the "Challenger," and at foot above the
 ground, a value of 48° 46' was observed, and at the usual height of
 the observing stand — 3y feet — over the same spot, 56° 18'. At two
 other positions 20 yards apart, the inclination differed 40'.
    The greatest difference in the values of the total force is a decrease
of 0'71 below the normal.
    These results point to the importance of adopting an uniform height
 for the observing Btand if comparable results are to be obtained.

the principal disturbance occurs in the westerly declination, which is
nearly 3° in defect of the normal value.               This points to the presence

    At Honolulu      blue    magnetism is predominant at the observing
station, which is on the west side of the island, the easterly declina
tion being J° in excess of the normal.               The inclination and force are
slightly increased.
    A  marked difference is seen between the observed declinations                         at
Honolulu and Hilo.          At the first-named place the easterly declination
observed on the west coast is increased                 f °, whilst at the latter the
easterly   declination   observed     on  the   east   coast   is decreased
    The large increase in the observed inclination and force at Hilo
above the normal, coupled with the diminished declination, point to a
strong development of blue magnetism in that portion of the island
visited.
    This concludes our list of islands            in which, with the exception of
Madeira, blue magnetism appears to predominate.                        Madeira, however,
 requires  a  much    more   extended     series   of   observations       to be made on
 its shores before any conclusions can be drawn as to the prevalence of
either blue or red magnetism.

   At Longwood Magnetic Observatory                  the declination is apparently
undisturbed,      whilst in the Castle Gardens it differs 3^° from the
normal value.        The inclination at Longwood differs 2£° from the
normal, pointing to the presence of an excess of red magnetism in that
locality.    The total force is not much disturbed.
   At Sister's Walk the inclination at two stations, 50 yards apart,
differs if", one being in excess of the normal by 1^° nearly, the other
twenty minutes in defect ; the larger disturbance being due to red
magnetism.        The total force is increased as much as 0'2.
    The result of the inclination by Dupetit Thouars, which is 42'
below the value derived from Ross's observations, seems to indicate
that a lower value might be accepted as the normal.

   The observing station at this island was situated on the N.W. coast
near some cliffs extending to the eastward.                The westerly declination
is increased about lf° above the normal, but as the inclination is
slightly affected by blue magnetism, it is uncertain whether it is the
red magnetism in the adjacent cliffs to the eastward repelling the red
end of the compass needle, or the blue magnetism near it which causes
the increase of the declination.

   The "Challenger" was not swung in the neighbourhood of Ker
guelen Island, and the normal values have therefore been derived from
the results of single observations made at sea between the swinging,
at the Cape of Good Hope, and that in lat. 63° 30' S., long. 90° 47' E.
They are therefore less exact, but sufficiently so for the purpose of
showing that the disturbances      on the island proceed from red
magnetism.
  Thus, at Christmas Harbour, Accessible Bay, and Betsy Cove,
where there was high land to the westward of each observing station,
the westerly declination  about 1° less than the normal.
                                      is                  At Howe's

92                On Local Magnetic Disturbance in Islands.                [Jan. 28,
   The above observations,        like those at St. Helena and Ascension,
show the existence of an excess of red magnetism above the normal
from the increased values of the inclination and total force.
    The general results of the observations just discussed is to show
that in islands far from a continent and north of the magnetic
equator, the local disturbances of the three magnetic elements are
caused by an excess of blue magnetism above the normal values due to
the position of the islands on the earth considered as a magnet.
South of the magnetic equator red magnetism is in like manner pre
dominant.
    Considering, however, that the observations were made with the
instruments between 3 and 4 feet above the ground, the disturbances
are not large.
    As an instance of large disturbance the results obtained at the
bluff, Bluff      Harbour, in the South Island, New Zealand, may be
mentioned.        In 1857, during the land survey by the local government
officials, the following values of the declination        were observed.*
            On the summit of the bluff                              6" 54'  E.
            30 feet north of the same position                      9  36 W.
                 „    west            „                             5  04  E.
                 „    east            „                            46 44 E.
            Normal from     sea observations                       i6 20 E.
    On the summit of the bluff there was thus shown to                   be a  strong
focus of red magnetism.
    During the survey of the South Island by the officers of H.M.S.
" Acheron," it was found
                                 necessary to give up the use of compass-
bearings at this place, and adopt the plan of observing nothing but
true bearings.
    The evidences of local magnetic disturbance form a great difficulty
in estimating the values of the secular change in these islands for
past years.        For example, Madeira may be mentioned, where it has
been seen that a change in position of a few feet gave very different
results of the inclination, and even at the same position the height at
the observing instrument above the ground must be taken into con
 sideration   if  comparable results are to be obtained.
    Before concluding this paper,         I  desire to draw attention          to the
following remarks on this subject of local magnetic disturbance.
    Firstly, reasons have been given for believing " that terrestrial
magnetism is not produced in any important degree by magnetic
forces external to the earth.      "t

    In view of these reasons and the results obtained from the
 observations recorded in this paper,      I  draw the possible conclnsion :
 That the increase of magnetic force observed in the islands under
 discussion proceeds from portions of those islands which have been
 raised to the earth's surface from the magnetised part of the earth,
 forming the source of its magnetism.

III.   " On the Development of the Cranial Nerves of the Newt."
       By Alice Johnson, Demonstrator of Biology, Newnham
       College, Cambridge, and Lilian Sheldon, Bathurst Student,
       Newnham College, Cambridge. Communicated                   by Pro
       fessor M. Foster, Sec. R.S. Received January 14, 1886.
   The peripheral nervous system of the Newt does not begin to
develop until the medullary canal has become completely separate
from the external epiblast.      A neural ridge appears on the dorsal
surface   of the medullary canal, and, at regular intervals, paired lateral
prolongations of it grow out and form the spinal and cranial nerves.
The former grow down between the medullary canal and muscle-
plates, the original outgrowth, in each case, becoming the dorsal root,
while the ventral root is formed later.
   In the head, where there are no muscle-plates,         the nerves are
situated   nearer to the surface.   The 3rd, the 5th, the common rudi
ment of the 7th and 8th, the 9th, the 10th, and, probably, the olfac
tory nerves, all develop as outgrowths of the neural ridge.       We have
not traced the development of the 4th and 6th nerves.
   At first the cranial nerves are of necessity attached to the dorsal
surface of the brain, since they arise from the neural ridge.          The
attachment     next widens out, extending further down the side of the
brain. Later, the dorsal part of the attachment is lost, the ventral
part alone remaining as the permanent root. There is no secondaiy
attachment entirely distinct from the first, and no part of the nerve
is at any time situated dorsal to the root.     This description applies
specially to the 5th and 7th nerve-roots, but it is probably true for all
the cranial nerves in which the shifting of the roots takes place.
   As soon as the cranial nerves become apparent, a series of thicken
ings of the inner layer of the epiblast appears on each side of the
head. These thickenings, which are paired, are situated slightly
above the level of the notochord, and correspond respectively to the
5th, 7th, 9th, and probably also to the 10th nerves. They are destined
to give rise to the mucous canals of the head. The olfactory organ
and ear have similar relations to the 1st and 8th nerves, and may
possibly belong to the same morphological category as these sense-
organs ; but this point seems very doubtful.     The mucous canals are
nt first confined to the head, but afterwards are present in the trunk
also, and increase greatly in number.
   The nerves are directed outwards and downwards from the dorsal
surface of the brain, each towards the sensory epiblastic thickening
corresponding to it. After a short time, the two structures fuse
together indistinguishably, so that a mass of cells is formed at this
point, continuous, on the one hand, with the external epiblast, and, on

1886.]            On  the  Cranial Nerves of     the Newt.               95
the other,  with the nerve-root.     The nerve-elements    of this mass are
probably derived from the nerves, and the sense-elements from the
epiblast.   This description holds for the 5th, 7th, and 9th nerves. We
have not ascertained whether it is also true of the 1 Oth. The com
mon rudiment of the 7th aud 8th nerves fuses with the sensory
epiblast at two points — one behind the other. The posterior of these
gives rise to the ear, the anterior to the sense-organ of the 7th nerve.
Soon after the fusion has taken place, the common rudiment of the
two nerves divides into two complete trunks, one innervating the ear,
and the other the sense-organ of the 7th nerve.
   At the point where the 5th nerve is fused with the skin, the Gas-
serian ganglion is formed.        Later, it begins to separate from the
epiblast, retiring from the surface, but remaining still attached to it
by a cord of cells, which constitutes the ophthalmic branch of the 5th
nerve. At the same time, a main trunk grows out from the ganglion and
soon divides into two branches — the inferior and superior maxillary.
   The 7th and 9th nerves develop similarly to each other, but in a
somewhat different way from the 5th.        In each the main trunk passes
onwards from its point of      fusion  with  the epiblast towards the cor
responding visceral cleft and fuses again with the epiblast of its dorsal
wall, the 7th nerve, as usual, innervating the 1st cleft, and the 9th
nerve the 2nd cleft.    The clefts at this time are not perforated, but
represented merely by lateral outgrowths of the fore-gnt, which have
fused with the epiblast at the points of contact.      The ganglion which
has been formed on the upper part of the trunk in connexion with
the sensory epithelium next sinks inwards, remaining attached to the
epiblast by a nerve-branch, as in the case of the 5th nerve. The
lower part of the trunk becomes completely detached from its con
nexion with the epiblast, and gives off two branches, one behind, and
one in front of the visceral cleft.     Thus the first two clefts are each
provided with a post-branchial and a prse- branchial branch, derived
from the 7th and 9th nerves.
   We believe that all these branches of the cranial nerves are derived
from the original outgrowths from the brain, none of them being split
off from the external epiblast, as Mr. Beard has described in Elasmo-
branchs, and Mr. Spencer in Amphibia.           The fusion of some of the
nerves with the skin seems to be comparable with what is known to
occur in vertebrate embryos generally, in the nose and ear, where the
nerve grows out from the brain to fuse with the sensory epithelium,
and we take all such cases to be merely instances of the innervation
of sense-organs.   The innervation is generally completed very early
in the nose and ear, and, in the Newt, it appears to take place rather
earlier than usual in the mucous canals.         Our observations seem to
point distinctly to this conclusion rather than to the view that the
 nerves are, even partially, derived from the external epiblast.

    Changes produced by Magnetisation     in the Length  of Rods.   1 09
   On the Changes produced by Magnetisation in the Length of
      Rods of Iron, Steel, and Nickel." By Shelford Bidwell,
      M.A., LL.B.       Communicated        by Professor Frederick
      Guthrie, F.R.S. Received April 1. Read April 23, 1885.
   The earliest  systematic experiments     on the effects produced by
magnetisation   upon the length of iron and steel rods were those of
Joule, an account of which is published in the "Phil. Mag." of 1847.
The experiments were made with bars 36 inches long, which were
placed inside a solenoid 38 inches long; and the variations in the
length of the bars when currents of electricity were passed through
the solenoid were measured by means of a delicate micrometer, each
division of which indicated a change of yygVrs iuch.
   Using bars of iron and soft steel, he found that their length was
increased by magnetisation, the elongation varying up to a certain
point as the square of the intensity of the magnetisation, temporary or
permanent, of the bar, and he remarked that the elongation was, for
the same magnetisation, greater in proportion to the softness of the
metal.
   When the metal was hard steel it appeared that " the bar was
slightly increased in length every time that contact with the battery
was broken."     On passing the first current through the magnetising
coil the length was unaffected, but when the circuit was broken after
the passage of this current there occurred a small elongation
equivalent to a fifth of a micrometer division, and each succeeding
make and break of the current was accompanied by a further small
elongation.
    These experiments were made with currents of gradually increasing
strength ; Joule appears never to have tried what would be the effect
 of applying the same current twice in succession.      Had he done so
 there is reason to believe, as will appear hereafter, that effects of a
 somewhat different character would have been observed.        He attri
 buted the increase in length when the current was interrupted "to
 the state of tension in the hardened steel," adding that he " found
 that soft iron wire presented a similar phenomenon when tightly
 stretched."
    The phenomena were, however, not exactly identical in the two
 cases.   From the account which he proceeds to give of his experi
 ments with stretched wires, it appears that when the tension of the
 wire exceeded a certain limit, the effects produced by the current
 were exactly the opposite of those which occurred when the wire was
 unst retched ; magnetisation, instead of causing the wire to lengthen
 temporarily, caused it to shorten, while it resumed its original leugth

110         Mr. S. Bid well.         On the Changes produced by
when the magnetising force ceased to act. Using a soft iron wire a
quarter of an inch in diameter, Jonle found that when it was loaded
with a weight of 408 lbs. the effects were the same in direction (though
smaller in degree) as when the wire was unstretched ; its length
increased when it was magnetised, and diminished to the same extent
when it was demagnetised.   When, however, the load was increased
to 740 lbs. the effects were reversed, and magnetisation  produced
temporary     retraction.    After describing this experiment          Joule
expresses his belief that with a tension of about 600 lbs. (roughly
the mean of 408 and 740),
                               " the effect on the dimensions of the wire
would cease altogether         in the limits of the electric currents
employed," i.e., that currents which produced on his tangent galvano
meter deflections ranging from 0 to 58 degrees would neither increase
nor diminish the length of his quarter inch wire when stretched with
a weight of 600 lbs.       If he had actually made the experiment he
would perhaps have found that the length of the wire was increased
by a weak current, that a current of medium strength would have had
no effect whatever, and that one of his stronger currents would have
caused the wire to retract.
   Joule's experiments have many times been repeated, and his results
generally confirmed.      In particular Professor A. M. Mayer of the
United States, carried ont a series of very careful experiments with
apparatus of elaborate construction and great delicacy.*           The con
clusions at  which  he arrived    were  in  accord with those of Joule so far
as regards iron ; but in the case of steel there is apparently some
discrepancy.     Mayer found that (after the first magnetisation) the
steel rods with which he worked, whether soft or hard, were invariably
shortened when the circuit was made and lengthened when it was
broken, the same current being used for the first and for the
subsequent magnetisations.        This result           is,
                                                    however, not necessarily
inconsistent with Joule's, because the conditions of the experiment
were not the same, the second current which Joule applied being
stronger than the first, and the third stronger than the second.

Again, while in the case of Joule's soft. Bteel the movements were
in the same direction as those observed with iron (though smaller in
                   "            "
degree), Mayer's soft steel behaved in exactly the opposite manner,
the movements (after the first magnetisation)            being in the same
direction as those which occurred when harder steel was employed.
This difference may be accounted for, as Mayer himself suggests, by
                                   " soft steel " was harder than Joule's.

Possibly too there was       a  sufficient difference in the magnetising
forces employed in the two cases to affect the results of the experi
ments.    More will be said on this point further on. The effects
resulting from the first action of the magnetising               current are

altogether distinct. The permanent magnetisation so produced was
found by Mayer to impart a small permanent elongation to rods of
soft and blue-tempered steel, and a small permanent retraction when
the steel was tempered yellow. Mayer's paper also contains some
new facts relating to details of minor importance.
   In 1882 Professor Barrett published an account in " Nature,"
vol. xxvi, p. 585, of some experiments which he had made not only
on iron but also on bars of nickel and cobalt, with a view of
ascertaining the effect of magnetisation on their length ; cobalt, he
discovered, behaved like iron, but the elongations were smaller;
nickel, however, retracted under the influence of magnetisation, the
amount of its retraction being twice as great as the elongation of iron
under similar circumstances.
   The knowledge on the subject up to the present time may be
summarised as follows : —
    1 . Magnetisation causes in iron bars an elongation, the amount of
which varies up to a certain limit as the square of the magnetising
force.     When the " saturation point " is approached the elongation is
less than this law would require.      The effect is greater in proportion
to the softness of the metal.
   2. When a rod or wire of iron is stretched by a weight, the
elongating effect of magnetisation is diminished ; and if the ratio of
the weight to the section of the wire exceeds a certain limit, magne
ti*ation causes retraction instead of elongation.
   3. Soft steel behaves like iron, hut the elongation for a given
magnetising force is smaller (Joule). Hard steel is slightly elongated
both when the magnetising current is made and when it is interrupted,
provided that the strength of the successive currents is gradually
increased (Joule).     The first application of the magnetising force
causes elongation of a steel bar if it is tempered blue and retraction
if it is tempered yellow; subsequent applications of the same external
magnetising force cause temporary retraction whether the temper of
the steel be blue or yellow (Mayer).
   4. The length of a nickel bar is diminished by magnetisation,
the maximum retraction being twice as great as the maximum
elongation of iron (Barrett).
   In order that the results obtained by Joule and Mayer might be
comparable with those of my own experiments,             I  have made an
attempt to estimate the magnetising     forces  with which   they worked.
   In the first series of Joule's experiments — those in which he ob
served the elongation of iron and steel rods not under traction, he
used a coil of the following dimensions    : —

   Jonle also describes his tangent galvanometer, and gives the deflec
tion which the magnetising current produced in every case. The
                " consisted of a circle of thick copper wire 1 foot in
galvanometer
diameter, and a needle half an inch long furnished with an index."
The radius, therefore, was        = 15'2 cm., and the constant, G,
                                   6 inches
approximately 2./15'2=0-41.* The horizontal  component of the earth's
magnetic force was, at the date of Joule's paper, about 0'17 ; thus
the factor by which the tangents of the angles of deflection should
be multiplied to give the deflecting   currents in C.G.S. units is
0-17/0-41 =0-41.
  The greatest deflection recorded in Joule's experiments with iron
was 62° 48', the tangent of which is T95 ; the magnetising force was
therefore

=tan_12-824,     the corresponding
                                 magnetising force being 126.
   The greatest galvanometer deflection in the experiments with
stretched wires was 61° 25', the tangent of which is 1-835, the cor
responding current 0'75 C.G.S. units, and the magnetising force 114.
  Mayer used a coil 60 25 inches=153 cm. in length, the number of
turns being 1919.   The magnetising force at the centre of his coil
                            1919
was therefore about      4*--^— — C=157'5C.

    It is less easy to estimate the strength of his current, since he gives
no galvanometer readings, nor any details as to the electromotive
 force and resistance of his battery.           The resistance of his coil he
states to have been 0-75 ohm, and that of the rest of the circuit
 (exclusive of the battery) about 0-25 ohm, making 1 ohm in all. He
nsed a battery of twenty-five Bunsen cells, and, in his own words,
"the above interpolar resistance showed that the maximum effect of
magnetisation would be given by connecting the twenty-five cells five
in couple and five in series."         This implies that the resistance of the
battery as thus arranged would be not far from 1 ohm, which, unless
the cells were very small, is surprisingly high. Taking the electro
motive force of a Bunsen cell to be 1-9 volts, the electromotive force
of Mayer's battery would be 9'5 volts, and the current 9-5/2=4'75
amperes=0-475         C.G.S. unit.       The magnetising force would there
fore be about 157-5 x0-475=75 nearly.              But 1 ohm is probably too
high an estimate for the resistance of the battery.               Assuming the
resistance      of the battery, leading wires, and connexions to be
0*5 ohm       (which is the lowest reasonably probable estimate), the
current would be 7-6 amperes=0'76 C.G.S. unit, and the magnetising
force 157'5 x 0'76=118 units. In point of fact the force was pro
bably something more than 75 and less than 118.
    In my own experiments both the magnetising coil and the rods of
metal were much shorter than those used by Joule and Mayer.                 The
length    of  the coil is 11'5 cm.  ;  it contains  876  turns of wire l-22 mm.
in diameter, wound in twelve layers on a brass tube with boxwood
ends.     The internal diameter of the tube is 1*5 cm., that of the coil is
 19 cm., and its external diameter is 5'2 cm. The mean length
of the diagonals of the cylindrical layers of wire is 12 cm., and the
field at the centre due to a current through the coil is approximately
    876
4a-  j2  C=918 C when C is expressed in C.G.S. units, or 91-8C when
C denotes the current in amperes.               The strongest current which   I
have hitherto used was 3-27 amperes, and the greatest magnetising
force was 3-27 x 91-8= 300 units, Joule's maximum having been 126,
and Mayer's, on the most favourable estimate, not greater than 118.
   The apparatus for performing the experiment, which is of a very
simple nature, is shown in fig. 1.* A mahogany table, TT, supported
by three stout legs, the lower ends of which are let into a base board,
G, carries a lever arrangement for causing the elongating or retract
ing rod under examination to deflect a mirror, M, which turns about
its horizontal diameter upon knife edges. The lower end of the rod
rests in a conical recess formed in a brass plate which is attached to a
hinged board : the height of the plate can be adjusted by turning a
screw, S. The rod passes through the coil, and also through a hole

100 mm., so that a movement of one division shows              difference of    a
0'00000041 in the length, equal to about a two and a half millionth
part.
   For projecting the image of the wire upon the scale, a half-plate
photographic portrait lens of high quality was used. When the best

                Magnetisation in     the Length  of Metal Hods.            115
    In working with this     apparatus, three possible sources of error were
 soon revealed.      The first was due to the expansion of the rod in con
 sequence  of  the  heating   of the coil by the current. This effect could
 be distinguished from the elongation resulting from magnetisation, by
 the fact that the latter took place quite instantaneously, while the
 expansion due to heat was gradual ; hut it was likely to lead to un
 certainty in estimating the amount of permanent elongation accom
 panying the permanent or residual magnetism of the rod. This
 uncertainty could be reduced to a minimum by taking care to close
 the circuit only for a second or two when making an observation.
 The second possibility of error resulted from the gradual yielding of
 the magnetic rod, or, more probably, of some part of the base or
 frame of the apparatus, under the pressure, small though it was, of
 the brass lever.     This may to a great extent be obviated by adjusting
 the apparatus and leaving it for half an hour before making an ob
 servation ; but   I   am not quite sure that it ever entirely disappeared ,
 for even though the image of the wire remained perfectly steady upon
 the scale so long as the apparatus was quite undisturbed, it is possible
 that the shocks produced by magnetising and demagnetising the rod
 might cause a sudden slight upward movement of the image, thus
 making the permanent elongation of the rod appear to be somewhat
 less than it in fact was.     I  think, however, that the error, after the
 apparatus   has been    at rest  for a sufficient time, must be very small.
 In observing the purely temporary elongation resulting from so much
 of the magnetisation as is purely temporary, no uncertainty what
 ever need arise from this cause, for the experiment can easily be re
 peated as often as may be necessary to obtain uniform results ; but
an observation of the permanent extension cannot be repeated with
out dismantling the apparatus and demagnetising the rod, after which
its condition will probably not be exactly the same as before.
    Lastly, errors may arise from the electromagnetic               attraction
existing between      the coil and  the rod, which   tends to draw a  uniform
rod into such a position that the middle point of its axis shall coincide
with the centre of the coil. As at first constructed, the coil in my
apparatus was attached by means of screws to the under side of the
table, and the rod under examination passed freely through it, touching
nothing whatever except the brass plate at the bottom and the lever at
the top.    The length of the magnetic portion of the rod — that which
was the subject of the experiment — was in every case, as already
stated, exactly 10 cm., or l'fi cm. less than the length of the coil. But
the distance from the brass base plate to the lever was 21 cm., and in
order to increase the experimental rods to this length, pieces of thick
brass wire were screwed or soldered to their two ends ; thus the rods
when prepared for the experiment were of a compound form, con
sisting of iron, steel, or nickel in the middle, and brass at each end
                                                                   I 2

 116         Mr. S. Bidwell.     On  the Changes  produced by
 The relative lengths of the pieces of brass -were so adjusted that when
 the compound rod was fixed in position, the centre of the magnetic
 portion of it coincided as nearly as possible with the centre of the
 coil. This arrangement was, however, found not to be entirely satis
 factory. It was difficult to secure the required coincidence with
 perfect accuracy, and it was necessarily somewhat disturbed during
 the adjustment of the image of the wire upon the scale ; while, even
 supposing that the geometrical coincidence was perfect, it might well
 happen that owing to inequalities in the magnetic properties          or
 physical condition of the rod, the source of error might still exist.
 A simple experiment showed conclusively the immense importance of
 guarding against any trace of this interaction between the rod and
 the coil. A compound rod of iron and brass was prepared, such that
 when it was placed with one end uppermost the centre of the iron
 was somewhat below that of the coil, and when the other end was
 uppermost the centre of the iron was about 5 mm. above that
of the coil.     A current was passed through the coil when the
iron was in the first position and a certain elongation was
indicated.   The position of the rod was then reversed and the same
current passed. It was expected that the apparent elongation would
 be diminished, but in point of fact an actual retraction equivalent to
two or three scale divisions was indicated.    The sucking action of the
coil caused the lower end of the rod to press upon the base with
increased force ; the base yielded a few hundred thousandths of a
millimetre, and this was sufficient, in spite of the real elongation of
the rod, to cause the image of the wire upon the scale to move in the
direction of retraction.
   It appeared that the only method of avoiding with certainty the
misleading effects of this attraction between the coil and the rod
would be to attach the two together.       The pressure upon the base
would then depend simply upon the joint weights of the coil and the
rod, and would not be varied by any interaction between them.        The
coil was therefore detached from the table, and its ends were fitted
with corks through which the experimental rod was passed, care
being taken that it fitted tightly at both ends. The arrangement was
then exactly as shown in fig. 1, the coil being supported solely by
the rod ; and it was so used in all the experiments described in this
paper.
   Before giving an account of the new effects which I have obtained,,
it may be well to state how far the maximum elongations and retrac
tions of iron and nickel bars, as indicated by my apparatus, accord
with those published by previous experimenters.       This is done in the
subjoined table.

   These figures include the total elongation of the rods, i.e., that due
to the permanent as well as to temporary magnetisation.
   The magnitude of the effect undoubtedly varies considerably with
the quality of the iron employed      that used in my own experiments
                                                      ;
was ordinary commercial iron wire annealed by being heated red hot
and slowly cooled.     The permanent elongation was, in both cases,
rather more than one-third of the whole. For reasons already given,
it was much easier to measure with certainty the temporary than the
permanent effect.
    By using thinner rods and greater magnetising forces than those
previously employed,           have arrived at the curious and interesting
                                      I
 fact which       it the main purpose of this paper to describe.
                          is                                              If the
magnetisation be carried beyond a certain critical point, the conse
quent elongation, instead of remaining stationary at a maximum,
becomes diminished, the diminution increasing approximately with
the magnetising force.          If the force be sufficiently increased a point
is arrived at, varying according to the dimensions and quality of the
iron, where the original length of the rod                  totally unaffected is
by magnetisation.       And        the magnetisation be carried beyond this
                                           if
point,   the   original   length    of the rod will be reduced.         To take
a   concrete example         the maximum temporary elongation of my
                                      :
thinnest iron rod occurs when the external magnetising force               about                is

     ;
length, which remains exactly the same as when the rod                unmagne-         is
ti*ed   a force of about 300 causes the length of the rod
         ;                                                         to  diminish,
the amount of the retraction thus produced being about one-half that
of the maximum elongation.            Here had exhausted the capability of

               Magnetisation in  the Length  of Metal Rods.          119
    I made a systematic course of observations with three iron rods of
 different thicknesses prepared in the manner described above. All
 were of ordinary commercial iron annealed in the usual manner.
 Their respective diameters were 2'65, 3'65, and 6'25 mm., and
 the length of each was 100 mm.          The strength of the successive
 magnetising currents in amperes and the corresponding temporary
 elongations in scale divisions are given in Table II. The currents
 can be approximately expressed as magnetising forces by multiplying
 by 91'8, and the scale divisions can be reduced to ten-millionths of
the length of the rod by multiplying them by 4.
   The results are also shown graphically in the first three curves of
fig. 2, in which the abscissa* represent the magnetising    currents and
the ordinates the elongations.
                                   Fio. 2.
   The elongations are those due to temporary magnetisation only. In
order to avoid the uncertainty attached to the elongating effects
of permanent magnetism,     I always at the beginning of an experiment,
and before    making an observation, passed through the coil the
strongest current at my disposal, thus permanently magnetising the
rod to saturation.     There appear to be two kinds of residual mag
netism.    When   a  strong current has been passed through the coil,
the magnetism which remains after the current has ceased to flow is
for the most part of a sub-permanent nature.         If the rod is undis

120           Mr. S. Bid well.   On  the Changes  produced by
turbed,    the Bab-permanent   magnetism will remain without material
diminution for perhaps half an hour, but in a short time it rapidly
falls off. If, however, the rod is shaken, or even if it is removed
from the coil with the greatest care, the magnetism which          I have
called sub-permanent instantly disappears.     But, after the destruction
of the sub-permanent magnetism, there still remains a small quantity
of magnetism of a nature which may properly be called permanent,
since it persists for days, or perhaps indefinitely, unless violent
measures are resorted to for its removal.        I find, by experiments
which will be referred to hereafter, that when^m iron rod has
once been sub-permanently magnetised by a strong current, the
intensity of the sub-permanent magnetisation is absolutely unaffected
by the action of currents weaker, or not stronger, than the first. For
a limited time (say half an hour) currents of varying strength may be
passed through the coil, and the additional magnetism produced by
their action is of a purely temporary nature, disappearing completely
when the current ceases to flow, and leaving the sub-permanent
magnetism exactly where it was before.      The elongations referred to
in my tables and curves are due to purely temporary magnetisation.
    The strength of the magnetising current was varied by means of a
box of resistance coils, and was measured by a Helmholtz tangent
galvanometer with four separate coils, of Elliott's manufacture.     After
the first two or three preliminary experiments, no attempt was made
to read the galvanometer at the time when the observations of the
elongations were made : for, in order to do so, it was found necessary
to keep the circuit closed for a period which was sufficiently long to
cause the coil to become heated, and confusion was introduced owing
 to the heat expansion of the rod.   A note was made of the resistances
successively inserted, and the currents corresponding to the several
resistances were afterwards leisurely and carefully determined.          It
 was soon found that the action of the battery was so constant that
 several elongation experiments might be made on the assumption that
 the same currents accompanied the same resistances without any
 sensible error, except perhaps a slight one in the case of the strongest
 currents ; but the estimated currents were from time to time checked
 by reference to the galvanometer, and when any material variation
 was observed, a fresh series of galvanometer readings was made.
    An examination of the three iron curves discloses the following
 facts : — In every case the form of the curve for the first part of the
 ascent is sufficiently nearly parabolic in form to afford confirmation
 of Joule's law, that the elongation varies up to a certain point as the
 square of the magnetisation.    After passing the maximum, the curve
 assumes a form which is apparently intended to be a straight line ; at
 all events, no single observation deviates from the straight line by an
 amount equivalent to more than half a scale division.       If this is so,

                   Magnetisation in   the   Length   of Metal Rods.                121
the retraction after the maximum elongation increases with the
external magnetising force.
   No certain indication of an approach to a limit of retraction is ob
servable in the curves.  Stronger magnetising forces would of course
show one, and       I
                 hope to be able to repeat the experiments with greater
battery power.
   The maximum elongation is reached by the three rods with magne
tising currents which are the same in order of magnitude as the
diameters of the rods.
   Lastly, it appears from the curves that the amount of maximum
elongation is smaller when the diameter of the wire is greater.     The
successive maxima are 7, 6, and 4-25, and if an error of a quarter of
a scale division be allowed, these maxima will be found to be in
versely proportional to the square roots of the diameters of the re
spective wires.

   It seems to me difficult to account satisfactorily for this variation
of the maximum elongation.       It is of course easy to understand why
a greater external magnetising force should be required to produce a
given intensity of magnetisation in a thick rod than in a thin one.
But it is not at first sight at all evident why, when the same mag
netisation .is produced, the elongation should not be the same in both
cases.   Possibly my results may be due to a mere accident, such as a
difference in the qualities of the three specimens of iron ; but their
apparent regularity renders such an explanation somewhat improbable.
   It seemed extremely desirable that, if possible, a connexion should be
established between the point of maximum elongation and some defi
nite phase of the magnetisation of the rod. Much time and labour
were spent in endeavours to investigate the magnetisation by a method
of induction ; but probably owing to the fact that the galvanometer
used — one of Elliott's Thomson galvanometers, with the usual astatic
system of magnets and an aluminium damping vane — was unsuited
for the purpose, no results of any value were obtained.        I was more
successful in an attempt to measure by a deflection method the rela
tive values of the temporary moments which various magnetising
currents produced in the three rods.         The coil was placed in a
 horizontal position, and one of the rods inserted in the tube, where
it was supported axially by means of corks at the two ends. A re
flecting galvanometer was placed at a suitable distance from             as        it,
determined by preliminary    trials,  and the  height   and disposition of
 the galvanometer were so adjusted that its magnet was on        level with
                                                                        a

 122          Mr. S. Bidwell.    On  the Changes produced  by
 the axis of the coil, while the direction of the magnet bisected the
 axis of the coil at right angles.  The galvanometer and the coil were
 connected   in circuit with the box of resistance coils, the tangent
 galvanometer, and the battery, the connexions being so arranged that
 the electromagnetic actions of the magnetising coil and the galvano
 meter coil urged the galvanometer needle in opposite directions.   The
 iron rod being temporarily removed from the coil, the galvanometer,
 which had a resistance of 1400 ohms, was shunted with a few centi
 metres of German silver wire, and the length of the shunt was
 adjusted by trial until, when a strong current was passing, the action
 of the galvanometer coil upon the needle exactly balanced that of the
 magnetising coil and the connecting wires of the circuit, so that, on
 depressing the contact key, no movement of the needle occurred
 except (with the strongest currents) a slight momentary kick due to
 induction.
    The iron rod being replaced inside the coil, a strong current was
 caused to circulate round it for two or three seconds. The rod was
thus sub-permanently magnetised as in the former experiments.       The
 line of light was then brought to zero of the galvanometer scale by
 means of the controlling magnet.        Great care was taken in setting
 up the scale to place it accurately at right angles to the magnetising
coil, and in such a position that the perpendicular upon it from the
 middle of the galvanometer needle met it exactly at the zero point, a
specially made T-square being used for the purpose.       The magnetic
field in which the galvanometer needle hung was the resultant of
those due to the controlling magnet, the horizontal component of the
earth's force, and the sub-permanent magnetism of the experimental
rod.    No attempt was made to determine its strength.
    Currents of gradually increasing strength were successively passed
through the coil, and the deflections corresponding to the temporary
moments of the rod were noted. When the circuit was opened, the spot
of light returned in most cases accurately to zero, and the permanent
deviations from zero never exceeded two or three divisions, equal to
one-fortieth of an inch. The results are given in Table III, and shown
graphically in the curves in fig. 3. In each separate experiment the
galvanometer deflections are proportional to the temporary moments ;
but these deflections and the ordinates of the curves are purely arbi
trary, and as regards the absolute values of the moments, they give
no information, nor are the ordinates of one curve comparable with
those of another.
    The relative changes in the values of the temporary moments with
increasing magnetising forces are, however, clearly shown, and to
ascertain the nature of these was the sole object of the experiment.
The distance between the galvanometer magnet and the three rods
was respectively 25 cm., 36-5 cm., and 53 cm.

124               Mr. S. Bidwell.   On   the Changes   produced by
                                      Fig.   3.
   The points corresponding to the maximum elongation in the three
carves are marked with the letter E. At first sight they seem to
possess no particular distinguishing characteristic in common.       In
deed the only points in the curves which appear to be marked by any
special property are those which are called by Chryetal (" Enc. Brit.")
after Wiedemann, the " turning points." Up to these points the
temporary moments increase with the magnetising force, or even more
rapidly ; after the points are passed, the rate of increase in the tem
porary moments is less than that of the magnetising force. When the
curve does not begin to ascend in a straight line, the turning points
are found by drawing tangents from the origin : they are indicated in
the curves by the letter T,* but it is not easy to determine their posi
tions with perfect accuracy.
   Prom a careful examination of these curves it appears probable that
a simple relation does exist between the turning points and the points
of maximum elongation, the abscissae of the points of maximum elonga
tion being almost exactly equal to twice those of the turning points.
  * According to Rowland                                    p. 155), "the temporary
                              ("Phil. Mag.," 1873, vol.ii,

                increases                              This may be strictly true (up
to the turning point) for rods or rings having the diameter of those         used by
Rowland.    Thus the curve for my thickest iron rod ascends in a perfectly straight
line but
   ;        aslight convexity towards the axis of x may be suspected in the medium
one, and in the thinnest such convexityis quite evident. It  is even more marked in
the curve for a wire,  77 mm. in diameter, given in fig.

               Magnetisation in   the  Length    of Metal Rods.            125
    I have also made a great number of experiments with steel. The
results obtained appeared at first to be of the most inconsistent
character, and it was with difficulty that      I  finally succeeded in evolv
 ing  order out of  them.  The  fact  clearly is  that  the point of maximum
 elongation (when there is one) depends in a very remarkable manner
 upon the hardness or temper of the steel.          Like Joule, I  found that a
soft steel rod which had been neither annealed nor tempered behaved
 in very much the same manner as iron, though the effects were
 smaller. There was a point of maximum elongation which was well
 defined, but I was. -not able by any current at my command to produce
actual retraction. A rod which was made exceedingly hard by being
dropped into cold water when at a bright red heat, had no point of
maximum elongation within the limits of my magnetising currents,
 the temporary elongation continually increasing with increasing
 magnetisation, and giving no evidence of an approach to a limit.
 But when the same rod was let down to a yellow temper its behaviour
 was altogether different.     With a very small magnetising force it
showed signs of retraction, and the retraction increased with stronger
 magnetising currents, ultimately becoming very considerable.            A rod
tempered blue also retracted when magnetised, but the effect did not
begin to appear until the magnetising force was much greater than
was necessary when the temper was yellow, and after the rod had
been still further let down by heating, a measurable elongation
occurred before the magnetising force was sufficient to cause retrac
tion.
    Again, another piece of steel was hardened by raising it to a dull
red heat and dropping it into cold water.           It could easily be marked
with a file, and was certainly softer than the last-mentioned rod before
it was tempered, though it appeared to be harder than the same rod
in the yellow condition. The new hard rod was slightly elongated by
feeble magnetisation, and after passing a maximum retracted at about
the same rate as iron.
   All these various results, which at first sight appeared to be discon
nected and inharmonious, point to the following conclusion : — The
critical value of the magnetising force for a steel rod diminishes as the
hardness becomes greater up to a certain point corresponding to a
yellow temper, after which it increases, and, with very hard steel,
becomes very high. There is therefore a critical degree of hardness
for which the value of the critical magnetising force is a minimnm ;
in steel of a yellow temper the value of the critical magnetising force
is lower than in steel which is either softer or harder.
   Some careful experiments were made with the hard steel rod last
referred to. The results are contained in Table II, and the corre
sponding curve in fig. 2. As in the case of iron, the rod was first
permanently magnetised by a current equal to the strongest subse

 quently used.          The relations of the magnetising force and temporary
  moment appear in Table              III  and in the last curve of fig. 3. In this
  experiment the distance between the steel rod and the galvanometer
  magnet was 15 cm.
      In the light of these experiments                 I have endeavoured to find an
 explanation       of  the  anomalous       results obtained by Joule and by Mayer
  with hard steel. It will be remembered that Joule, using gradually
  increasing currents, found that (after the first current, which produced
 no effect whatever while it circulated, but was followed by a small
 elongation when it had ceased) his hard steel bar was slightly
 elongated both when the current was made and when it was broken,
 the length of the bar being thus continuously increased.                           Though   I
 have made many attempts, using steel rods in different conditions, to
 obtain Joule's results,          I have never succeeded in finding a rod which
 behaved in the manner described by him.                                I

 corresponding elongations.               Both are on an arbitrary scale : —

     It   clearly appears that the elongations due to permanent magne
 tisation and to permanent + temporary (i.e., total) magnetisation lie
 upon separate curves.             And, since the total curve is below the perma
 nent curve, it follows that the temporary magnetisation has a nega
tive or retracting effect. Taking ordinates equal to the differences
between those of the permanent and total curves,                         I  have plotted the
curve for temporary magnetisation,                      which, of course, lies on the
negative       side of   the   horizontal    axis,    and  starts from the point repre
senting a magnetic intensity of I'll.                       Following the analogy of
other experiments,           I  have continued the curve above the hori,ontal

 any elongation represented by the dotted portion would be too small
 to be measurable.
     The results of this experiment of Joule's are thus shown to be
 reconcilable with others, if we may make the assumption that in this
 particular specimen of steel the elongations due to temporary and
 permanent magnetisation followed different laws, and that while the
 critical point of the former occurred at an unusually early stage, that
 of the latter was not reached within the limits of the experiment.                 It
 may be indeed that this is always the case, though under ordinary
 circumstances       the difference is too small to lead to the anomalous
 result under discussion.             Having confined my attention almost
 entirely to the investigation of temporary effects, I have little experi
 mental evidence to bring forward bearing upon the point.*
     Mayer's results may be much more easily accounted for. The fact
 that his steel rods were invariably shortened by magnetisation (after
 the first magnetisation, the effect of which varied in different speci
 mens) clearly indicates that his magnetising                 force exceeded the
critical value, which was smaller for the steel bars than for the iron
 which he had previously used. He apparently never magnetised his
    • Were it not for the proverbial aecuraey of Joule's work, a simpler explanation
of the anomaly would have suggested itself. The lower of the two curves above
the horizontal axis represents the state of things while a current it passing, and the
fact that this curve does not coincide with the upper one might, perhaps, be
accounted for by the
                          " solenoidal suction" which would occur if the rod were not
quite symmetrically placed with respect to the coil, or even if it were not perfectly
homogeneous throughout.         Thus, the apparent elongations when the circuit was
broken would be really due to the cessation of the suction, whilo the elongations
indicated when the circuit was closed would be less than those which actually
occurred.     Each of the vertical divisions in the diagram represents only one
thirteen-millionth    part of the length of the rod : a very small variation in the
 pressure of  the  end  of the rod upon its support would, therefore, have a sensible
effect— (February 23, 1886.)

128            Mr. S. Bidwell.      On the Changes produced by
steel with currents of less than the maximum strength, and a smaller
magnetising force would perhaps have produced elongation, unless
indeed     the  permanent magnetisation        induced by the first current
equalled    or  exceeded   the critical value.    This was almost certainly
the case with his yellow- tempered steel, which was permanently
shortened hy the first magnetisation,        while all the other specimens
were    permanently     elongated.    These   considerations are consistent
with all the phenomena exhibited by Mayer's steel bars.
    In working with a rod of steel which had been neither annealed
nor hardened,     I obtained some very curious effects of which    I am not
at present prepared to offer a complete explanation.            I  therefore
describe the experiments exactly as they were performed, without
attempting to account for the results.
    Experiment 1. — A current of 2 amperes was passed through the
coil, whereupon       the rod elongated 3 scale divisions.          Without
breaking the circuit, the current was rednced by inserting resistance
to 0'6 ampere.      The rod underwent a further elongation of 3 divi
sions, making the total elongation equal to 6 divisions.       On breaking
the circuit the rod retracted 6 divisions, returning to its original
length ; but when the circuit was again closed, the resistance still
 being inserted and the current consequently 0-6 ampere, the resulting
elongation was only 3 divisions.
    It appears therefore that a strong magnetising force subsequently
 diminished causes a greater temporary elongation than the diminished
 force is capable of producing if applied in the first place.
    Experiment 2. — A current of 2 amperes being passed through the
 coil, an elongation of 3 scale divisions was produced.        The current
 was reduced to 0'26 ampere, when a further elongation of 1 division
 occurred.     On breaking the current the rod returned to its original
 length.     Once  more a current of 0-26 ampere was passed through the
 coil, but no movement whatever occurred.
    From this it appears that the temporary elongation of a steel rod
 when once produced may be maintained by a magnetising force which
 is itself too small to cause any perceptible elongation whatever.
    Something of the same kind, though in a smaller degree, was
 observed by Mayer in rods of iron.
    Both these experiments were repeated many times, the results
 being invariably of the same character, and there is no doubt what
 ever as to the reality of the effects described.
    On a small scale, I have repeated some of Joule's experiments with
 stretched wires, and found, as he did, that when a wire was loaded
 with a certain weight, the effect of magnetisation was not elongation
 but retraction.     No measurements, however, were attempted, my
apparatus not being well adapted for the purpose.
    It appeared, upon consideration, that the results of this class

              Magnetisation in      the  Length  of Metal Rods.              129
of experimeuts     would be brought into perfect harmony with those
already described, if it could be shown that the critical value of the
magnetising force was lowered when the rod was stretched.                 There
were reasons arising from the nature of my apparatus why I could
not attempt to prove this directly ; but an indirect method affords
strong evidence that this is the case.          By the method of deflection
already described, it could be easily ascertained whether the position
of the " turning point " was affected by stretching a wire. Now, in
every case which     I  have hitherto investigated, it was found that the
critical  value of  the   magnetising force was very approximately equal
to twice the magnetising force at the turning point.            If therefore it
should appear that the position of the turning point was affected by
stretching, the presumption would be strong that the critical value
would be altered to a corresponding extent.
   Four deflection experiments were therefore made.            In the first the
wire, which was of annealed iron 0'77 mm. in diameter, was suppoi-ted
in a horizontal position inside the coil by means of corks ; gradually
increasing currents were passed through the coil and the galvano
meter deflections noted as in former cases.              The wire was then
removed, and after being demagnetised was replaced inside the coil,
and a weight of 7 lbs. was attached to it by means of a cord passing
over a pulley. Once more the deflections accompanying increasing
currents were noted.
   The third and fourth experiments were similar to the first two,
except for the fact that the wire was magnetised to saturation before
any observations were made. The deflections recorded in the first
and second experiments are due therefore to the sum of the permanent

 130          Mr. S. Bidwell.       On the Changes produced by
 and temporary magnetisations, while those in the third and fourth
 were produced by the temporary magnetisation only. The results
 are given in Table V and in the subjoined curves (fig. 5). Both series
                                      Fio.  5.
are interesting    as affording an illustration of the law which has been
fully investigated by Sir William Thomson,* that the magnetisation
of a wire is at first increased and afterwards diminished by stretch
ing ; but the results of the second series only (in which the ordinates
represent the temporary moments) are comparable with those of the
former experiments.t
    Referring to the curve of temporaiy magnetisation, it will be seen
that the magnetising current at the turning point is reduced by
stretching with a weight of 7 lbs. from 0-051 to 0'030 : presumably,
therefore, the magnetising        current for the critical point is at the
same time reduced from about O102 to 0-060, and a current between
these limits would be accompanied by elongation when the wire was
unstretched, and by retraction when it was stretched.

   * "Phil. Trans.," 1876 and 1879.
   t It should be noticed that the ordinates are on a different scale in the two
diagrams, as may be seen by comparing the figures at the Bide. The distance between
the wire and the centre of the galvanometer magnet was 13 cm. in all the experi
ments.

               Magnetisation in     the  Length   of Metal Rods.               131
0'75  mm.      Brass wires     were    soldered    to the ends in the        usual
 manner.
   The   permanent magnetisation          induced by the strongest current
appeared    not to canse a permanent retraction of more than one scale
division.    The temporary retractions produced by increasing mag
netising forces are given in Table         II  and in fig. G. The retractions
                                      Fio.  6.
are of much greater      extent than the elongations of iron under similar
circumstances, and though tho curve affords evidence of an approach
to a limit, it is nevertheless clear that a considerable further retrac
tion would have occurred if the current had            been   increased    beyond
the power of my battery.
   I also made a deflection      experiment with the nickel, thinking it
might possibly be the case that it had no turning point., i.e., that the
ratio of the temporary moments to the magnetising forces decreased
ah initio.   It appeared, however, that the turning point was unusually
well marked, occurring with a current of 0'042 ampere.                The details
are given in Table     III and fig. 6. The experiment was repeated two
or three times with the same result, the nickel having been in each
case  previously magnetised with a strong current. The distance
between    the centre of the galvanometer needle and the nickel was
15 cm.
   The   behaviour of a stretched         nickel wire has,     I  believe, never
hitherto been    investigated.    I  therefore    made  tho  experiment with a
nickel wire 0"5 mm. in diameter, loaded with a weight equivalent to
about   2 lbs.    The result of magnetisation        was a very considerable
                                                                       k 2

 132            Mr. S. Bidwell.      On the Changes produced by
 retraction, but for reasons already referred to        I was  nnable to measure
the amount.
    I have   not for some weeks occupied myself with the investigation
of   tho  singular facts described in this paper without from time to
 time indulging in speculations as to their physical causes.                 It is,
 however, evident enough that the investigation is incomplete, and
 many more experiments, some of them requiring additional apparatus
of a special kind, remain to be tried.         I hope to return to the subject
on a future occasion, and in the meantime refrain from theorising as
to the causes of the phenomena.
                                    Summary.
    The experiments have not been sufficiently numerous to render
generalisation in all cases perfectly safe ; but, so far as they gq, they
indicate the following laws : — *
                                     I. Iron.
    1. The length of an iron rod is increased by magnetisation up to
a  certain critical value of the magnetising force, when a maximum
elongation is reached.
    2. If the critical value of the magnetising          force is exceeded, the
elongation is diminished, until, with a sufficiently powerful force, the
original length of the rod is unaffected, and if the magnetising force
is still further increased the rod undergoes retraction.
    3. Shortly after the critical point is passed, the elongation
diminishes in proportion as the magnetising force increases.                   Tho
greatest    actual  retraction   hitherto  observed    was   equal to  about  half
the greatest elongation ; but there was no indication of a limit, and
a stronger magnetising        force would have produced further retrac
tion.
    4. The value of the external magnetising force corresponding to
maximum elongation is nearly equal to twice its value at tho " turning
point."
    Definition.
                — The turning point in the magnetisation of an iron bar
is reached when the temporary moment begins to increase less rapidly
than the external magnetising force.
    5. The external magnetising        force corresponding to the point of
maximum elongation is greater for thick rods than for thin rods.
    6. The amount of the maximum elongation varies inversely as tho
 square root of the diameter of the rod.
    7. The turning point, and therefore presumably the point of maxi
mum elongation, occurs with a smaller magnetising force when the
rod is stretched than when it is unstretched.
        • The elongations and magnetisations referred
                                                      to are temporary only.

                Magnetisation in  the  Length   of Metal Rode.         133
                                  II.  Steel.
     The behaviour of steel varies greatly with the hardness and temper
 of the metal.                                I
                   More experiments than have hitherto made would be
 necessary to establish the general laws with certainty ; but my results
 are consistent   with the following conclusions : —
     1. In soft steel magnetisation produces elongation, which increases
 up to a certain value of the magnetising force, and afterwards
 diminishes. The maximum elongation is less than in the case of iron,
 and the rate of diminution after the maximum             is passed is also
 less.
    2. The critical value of the magnetising force for a steel bar
 diminishes with increasing hardness of the steel up to a certain point
 corresponding to a yellow temper, after which it again increases, and
 with very hard steel becomes very high.
    3.  In soft steel a strong magnetising force subsequently diminished
may cause     a greater temporary elongation than the diminished force
is  capable of producing if applied in the first place.
    4. A temporary elongation when once produced in soft steel may
be maintained      by a magnetising force which is itself too small      to
originate any perceptible elongation.
                                 III. Nickel.
    1.  Nickel continues to retract with magnetising forces far exceeding
those    which produce the maximum elongation of iron.        The greatest
retraction of nickel hitherto observed is more than three times as
great as the maximum elongation of iron, and the limit has not yet
been reached.
    2.  A nickel wire stretched by    a weight undergoes retraction when
magnetised.

     OBITUARY            NOTICES OF FELLOWS                DECEASED.
    Captain Sir Frederick J. O. Evans, R.N., K.C.B. There have
been few men perhaps who, launched into the active and engrossing
professional duties of the Naval Service, at a period of life when
their compeers in other callings had scarcely entered on their college
course, who have achieved so solid a reputation for scientific eminence
as the subject of this notice.
    The only son of Mr. John Evans, a Master in the Royal Navy,
Frederick Evans was born at Southsea, in March, 1815, and at the
age of thirteen entered the Navy on board His Majesty's ship
" Rose,"
             employed on the North American coast, and subsequently
joined the " Winchester," carrying the flag of Sir E. G. Colpoys on
the same station.
    In 1833 he was transferred to the surveying vessel " Thunder,"
employed in the West Indies, and under the auspices of her gifted
captain, Richard Owen, he found the opportunity of cultivating the
science of nautical astronomy, surveying, and other branches of
knowledge, and thus laid the foundation of his subsequent long,
useful, and distinguished career.           In 1836 he joined His Majesty's
       "
ship Caledonia," the flagship in the Mediterranean, and afterwards
  erved in various other vessels on that and the African stations.          He
soon gained for himself the reputation of a skilful and accomplished
navigator, and was rewarded by early promotion to the rank of
master.
    In   the year 1841      Mr. Evans was selected to accompany Captain
Francis     Price  Blackwood in command of an expedition, consisting of
Her Majesty's ships " Fly " and " Bramble," for the survey of the
eastern coast of Australia, and was attached to the former vessel as
master and senior surveyor.         For more than four years he took a very
leading    part   in  the  important but harassing service of exploring and
              —
surveying in a ship without the aid of steam — the intricate channels
leading from the Coral Sea through the Barrier Reefs, the passages             .
through Torres Strait, and the southern shores of New Guinea,
regions then almost entirely unknown to the navigator.             A narrative
of this remarkable voyage        was  published   in 1847 by J.  B. Jukes, the
naturalist to the Expedition.
    After a short period of surveying service on the coasts of England,
he was appointed to Her Majesty's ship
                                                " Acheron," fitting out under
 the late Admiral Stokes, for the survey of the coasts of the then
young colony of New Zealand.            On this service he was arduously
engaged      for a  period  of four years,  and seamen of all nations are in
                                                                      b

                                    ii
no small degree indebted to him for the excellence of the charts of
these coasts, which have been in constant tise to the present time.
   In these two important expeditions Mr. Evans gained for himself
the reputation of a scientific surveying officer, second to none in his
profession.   His great forte had always been extreme accuracy of
observation and fidelity in execution, two qualities perhaps in no pro
fession of more vital importance than in the calling of the nautical
surveyor.    Always painstaking and patient, sometimes thought to be
over-fastidious, yet he was never outstripped in the race by his more
ardent contemporaries, and the accuracy of his work was never
questioned ; during these two voyages he had paid considerable atten
tion to the science of terrestrial magnetism, and had made frequent
observations on the three elements, thus in a measure preparing him
self for the important duties which were destined to devolve on him
at a later period of his career.
   After his return to England, at the end of 1851, he was for a con
siderable time employed at the Hydrographical Department of the
Admiralty, in preparing the charts of New Zealand for publication,
and on other nautical duties connected with that survey.
   His abilities as a surveying officer had long been noticed by
the then chief of the department,         Sir Francis Beaufort, who
was never slow to recognise and reward real merit ; and it was on
his nomination that. at the commencement of the Russian war,
Mr. Evans was employed on reconnoitring service with the Baltic
Fleet ; for a year he was vigorously engaged on inshore service on
the Russian coasts, and was present at the operations against Bomar-
sund and among the Aland islands, for which his name was mentioned
in Gazetted Despatches ; with this service his active career afloat
ceased, after twenty-six years of constant employment, both in the
regular and surveying branches of the Navy, and surely no man was
more entitled than himself to look back with pride and satisfaction
on a career of uuremitting labour and enduring usefuluess for so long
a period.                             ,
   A new era was now about to commence in the construction of the
ships of the Royal Navy, and Captain Evans was destined for the next
thirty years to take a leading part in the development of a science
 upon which the safety of their navigation was mainly to depend.
   In 1855 he was appointed Chief of the Compass Department of the
Admiralty ; at this time our extensive Fleet was wholly of wood,
partly composed of steam and partly of sailing ships.    Our experience
of the effects of magnetism in the iron vessels which had been con
structed in the Mercantile Marine was extremely limited ; the science
of the subject, so far as it extended, was alone known to two or three
individuals in Europe, and even that science was extremely mistrusted
by all practical men, and further, numerous, and especially one

                                      ii I
awfully fatal shipwreck (that of tho " Royal Charter") had occurred
to iron merchant vessels, which were officially traced to compass
errors.
   The force of circumstances at the close of the Russian war, as
is well known, rapidly brought about the conviction that our war
ships must be iron, and not only this, bat that they must be armour-
plated, and thus almost suddenly a question presented itself to science
and practical knowledge, the difficulties of which have probably rarely
been surpassed, viz., how to overcome the intricacies of magnetism in
such ships. That the difficulty was surmounted is of course known,
though at what cost of close and laborious investigation, theoretical
and practical, for years, is known but to few.
   That it was successfully and triumphantly overcome is mainly due
to two individuals, viz., the late Mr. Archibald Smith, P.R.S., and tho
subject of this notice ; and their names will ever be associated with
the solution of a question the importance of which to a maritimo
nation cannot be over-estimated.
   It is unnecessary to enter here into the scientific merits of Archibald
 Smith, they are of world-wide renown ; suffice it for our purpose to
say, that he was a mathematician of the highest order, had long gone
into the question of terrestrial magnetism in connexion with compass
disturbance con amore, had cheerfully joined Captain Evans in all
his labours, and until his lamented death in 1872, was joint author
and fellow worker in all their investigations.
   The writer cannot here refrain from quoting words which have
already appeared in connexion with this subject, and which so well
express the connexion between the two men.*
   " The subject was one which called for the combination of practical
sagacity and experience, with refined scientific         method, and if
Archibald Smith was stronger on the one side, Captain Evans was
his master on the other ; nor was either of them without large powers,
even in the special department of their joint labours, in which he
owned the supremacy of his friend ; it was an undertaking which
called for the united efforts of just two such men as were fortunately
brought together to do it, and the result has been a triumph to
 England, and a blessing to the world, which will preserve the
memories of its authors as long as the ocean remains the highway
of Englishmen and the world."
   The first work which Captain Evans produced after his appointment
as Chief of the Compass Department,             was a chart of the world,
showing the curves of equal magnetic declination ; by which the
 navigator was enabled to obtain with approximate accuracy in any
 part of the ocean the deviation of his compass from the magnetic
 meridian ; this chart was published by the Admiralty in 1858.
                         * " Nature,"    January 14th.

                                    iv
  In 1859 he read a paper at the Royal United Service Institution,
on the magnetism of iron ships, showing all that had been done np to
that date in acquiring a knowledge of their magnetism and the treat
ment of their compasses.
  His next paper was   a  report to the Admiralty of the magnetic cha
racter of the various types of iron ships in the Navy, and of the
" Great Eastern " steamship. The results of this paper were to show
the best magnetic direction for building an iron ship, the best position
for placing her standard and other compasses, and the various sources
of error affecting a compass under the most favourable conditions.
This report was communicated to the Royal Society, and printed in
the Transactions for 1860.
   A joint paper on the proper length and arrangement of the needles
on a compass card, with exact information as to proper arrangement
of magnet and soft iron correctors with respect to    it,was communi
cated to the Royal Society in 1861.
   In 1862, the Admiralty published " The Manual for the Deviation
of the Compass in Iron Ships   ;"   this important work was the result
of the joint labours of Evans and Archibald Smith. It was imme
diately translated into the principal European languages, and became
the text-book of the maritime world.       On the introduction of new
types of armour-plated ships, new editions of the work became from
time to time necessary, and were published.
   In 1865 the joint authors produced another important paper on the
magnetic character of the armour-plated ships of the Navy up to that
date. The novelty of the form of ships thus discussed rendered the
results of more than usual interest, and proved among other things
with what degree of confidence compasses might be placed in positions
where armoured protection would be afforded; this paper was also
printed in the Transactions of the Royal Society.
   The practicability of determining the magnetic coefficients without
the labour of swinging, and the heeling error, without inclining the
ship, was also demonstrated, and has been practically adopted in the
Navy, with great saving of labour and expense.
   In 1865, on the retirement of Captain Becher from the Hydrographic
Department, Captain Evans succeeded him as Chief Assistant to the
Hydrographer, retaining the position of Chief of the Magnetic
Department.     From this time his practical duties in regard to compass
management devolved on his successor, though he never relaxed his
investigations, or wearied in his devotion to the science of terrestrial
magnetism, and in 1870, desiring to present the subject of compass
deviation in a less elaborate form than had been done in the former
publication, he brought out his " Elementary Manual," a work which
was very well received, and was also translated by the maritime
nations.

                                    V
    In the year 1874, a vacancy occurring for the post of Hydrographer
of the Admiralty, he was selected to fill it ; his habits of extreme
accuracy and method, and his ripe and .extended knowledge of the
numerous and varied subjects which came within the province of
that department to investigate and to deal with, rendered him pecu
liarly fitted to fulfil the duties of the position, which he continued
to perform with equal ability and conscientiousness till within a little
more than a year of his death ; the multifarious calls of his new
office, however, diverted him more and more from exclusive attention
to his favourite science, though he still found time to draw up and
read before the Royal Geographical Society in 1878, an able and
instructive lecture on the Magnetism of the Earth, showing the dis
tribution and direction of its magnetic force, and the changes in its
elements, as then known.
     Drawn together by the sympathies engendered by similar tastes and
purauits, he and the late Sir Edward Sabine had long been close
friends and coadjutors, and during the last years of the labours of
 that distinguished savant, Evans had rendered him assistance in com
 pleting his great work, " Contributions to Terrestrial Magnetism,"
contained in the fifteen numbers of the " Magnetic Survey of the
 Globe," for the epoch 1842-5.
     Science in this country has not always met with official encourage
 ment, or reward, whether in, or outside of the public service, though
 it is the nation which is chiefly the gainer by it ; and it was late in
 life before the valuable services rendered by Captain Evans to his
 own and other countries received any kind of recognition, though
 honorary rewards were proffered by foreign Governments.       The expla
 nation is perhaps, that the remedy for a serious difficulty was dis
 covered before its existence had generally made itself felt, and that
 in the Naval profession it has been always a maxim that impossi
 bilities arise only to be overcome in the ordinary course of dnty.
     In order to show, however, that these services were appreciated by
 the department with which he was immediately associated, the writer
 of this notice is induced to give an extract from a statement which
 nearly seventeen years ago it became his duty to place before the
 authorities in regard to them : —
                    " When he found himself in the responsible position
 of head of the Compass Department, at a time when the complete
 revolution in shipbuilding raised the serious question whether it was
 possible so to deal with the magnetic influence of the iron which
  entered so largely into the construction and fittings of a modern
  ship as to retain the efficiency of the compass, he readily entered
  upon a task involving years of close and laborious investigation,
  experimental and theoretical, of the intricacies of an iron ship's mag
  netism ; nor did he ever shrink from the responsibility of acting on

                                       VI
his acquired    knowledge, and promptly recommending and carrying
out improvements of system consequent on the change of circum
stances, viz., an iron fleet superseding a wooden one. The compass
system for the secure navigation of the Fleet nnder its remarkable
changes, has grown entirely under his own hands, and has been
marked by the following conditions : —
   " 1st. Entire success  ;   for to the present time not a single ship of
the Fleet has been lost or hazarded by default traceable to her com
passes.
   " 2nd. The principles involved are
                                              accepted by the navies of
Europe and America.
   " 3rd. The scientific value of his labours has in this
                                                                country been
recognised by his election into the fellowship of the Royal Society.
   "4th. The labours, whether experimental, or for purposes of inves
tigation, by seeking the aid of men of science outside the naval pro
fession, have cost the country nothing.
   " 5th. Officers have been instructed by him, and works on the
whole subject written and published, so that the knowledge has been
diffused, and the results cannot be lost.
   "Bnt in addition to the security of the fleet and the establishment
of the foundation of correct principles, he can claim the advantage
that has accrued to the State of having by the system pursued,
economised the great expenses that must have been incurred, had no
system based on pure science existed :          I allude to the time and
enormous labour involved in swinging and heeling ships ; this for all
ordinary cases has long been dispensed with, and the swinging alone
is confined to times and circumstances,      when  it is chiefly necessary to
give confidence to the officers of the ship.
   " There is another point on which these sound principles operate :
they effectually bar the door to individuals who come with quasi
inventions, sometimes backed by officers of rank, well meaning but
necessarily ignorant of the subject, professing to relieve all the
troubles of compass management on board ship, and to leap over at a
bound the labour of years of investigation, and all past experience !
The Admiralty is the special target at which these inventors aim,
and the Government cannot be ignorant of a recent case where a very
large and well supported demand on their credulity, and the public
purse to follow, was defeated by the wise and persistent course of
action adopted by Captain Evans ; these examples, more or less in
their attempts on the national purse and on his responsibilities, have
abounded during his tenure of office and mine, sometimes         I fear to the
                                                         I
no small engenderment of ill will and jealousy, but am sure not to the
diminution of the general respect for his character and recognition
of his abilities."   .  .   .
   Captain Evans sat for many years on the Council of the Royal

                                  Vlj
Society, and was more than once a Vice-President.        lie was also a
Fellow of the Royal     Astronomical  and Geographical Societies ; he
served for many years as a member of the Meteorological Committee
of the Royal Society, and on the change in the constitution of that
body he became a member of its Council.
   In recognition of his public services the Companionship of the
Bath was conferred on him in the year 1873, and in 1881 he was
advanced to the Commandership of the same order on the recommen
dation of the Earl of Northbrook, the First Lord of the Admiralty,
under whom he had served during the last five years of his career.
   Sir Frederick Evans' last public service after his retirement from
the Admiralty in June, 1884, was as the British delegate to the
International Congress at Washington, convened for the establish
ment of a. prime meridian, when that of Greenwich was adopted as
the starting point from which longitude should in future be universally
computed.
   He died on the 20th of December,   1885.

                                   II.  Steel.
      The behaviour of steel varies greatly with the hardness and temper
  of the metal.                                I
                   More experiments than have hitherto made wonld be
  necessary to establish the general laws with certainty ; bat my results
  are consistent  with the following conclusions : —
     1. In soft steel magnetisation produces elongation, which increases
  up to a certain value of the magnetising force, and afterwards
 diminishes. The maximum elongation is less than in the case of iron,
 And the rate of diminution after the maximum is passed is also
 less.
     2. The critical value of the magnetising force for a steel bar
 diminishes with increasing hardness of the steel up to a certain point
 corresponding to a yellow temper, after which it again increases, and
 with very hard steel becomes very high.
     3. In soft steel a strong magnetising force subsequently diminished
 may cause a greater temporary elongation than the diminished force
is capable of producing if applied in the first place.
    4. A temporary elongation when once produced in soft steel may
be maintained by a magnetising           force which is itself too small to
originate any perceptible elongation.                                    ,
                                  III.  Nichel.
    1.  Nickel continues to retract with magnetising forces far exceeding
those    which produce the maximum elongation of iron. The greatest
retraction of nickel hitherto observed is more than three times as
great as the maximum elongation of iron, and the limit has not yet
been reached.
    2.  A nickel wire   stretched by a weight undergoes retraction when
magnetised.

    The following Papers were read : —
I. "On Intravascular Clotting." By L. C. Woolpridge, M.B.,
       D.Sc., Demonstrator of Physiology in Guy's Hospital (from
       the Brown Institution).             Communicated        by Professor
       Burdon Sanderson, F.R.S. Received January 21, 188(3.
    Notwithstanding all the work that has been done on the subject of
the coagulation of the blood, the definite results which have been:
obtained as to intravascular clotting are extremely scanty.
    I think most physiologists will agree with me in the statement, that
no method is known by which one can, at will, produce a complete
fibrinous coagulation in the vessels of a living animal.         I have found
such a method, and one which appears to be infallible in its action.
    I have succeeded in obtaining from the testis and thymus gland of
the calf, a substance presenting the characters of a proteid, the injec
tion of which in sufficient quantity into the veins of au animal, will
cause instant death, owing to widespread intravascular clotting.
    In its preparation I proceed in the following manner : — The organ
having been finely minced, is mixed with a large qnantity of distilled
water and allowed to stand for some hours.                The liquid is then
strained off and subjected       to  the action  of  a centrifugal machine so
long as any deposit is separated from it. The clear liquid is then
 made strongly acid with acetic acid, whereupon a bulky precipitate
 appears, which is collected by the centrifugal machine, and well
 washed with water acidified with acetic acid.
     If this precipitate is dissolved in alkaline salt solution and injected
 into the circulation, it produces intravascular clotting. If the quantity
 injected is considerable (1 to 2 grams), it causes instant death in a
 dog of moderate size with complete thrombosis of the vena porta and
 its branches.      Clots are also found in the right side of the heart and
 in the pulmonary artery.        In a rabbit I found that the injection of
 1 gram caused death before the injection was completed.            Here there
 was thrombosis      of the portal vein, iliac and renal veins, and of the
 vena cava and aorta, and clots in both sides of the heart.
     When death occurs, the blood which flows from a cut artery fails

  1886.]     Larva of Smerinthus ocellatus and its Food-plants.                  135
 to coagulate, and when the quantity injected is insufficient to kill, the
 blood (drawn off after injection) may remain uncoagulated for some
 days.    In either case coagulation of shed blood may be induced by
 the addition to it of the liquid which has been injected.            It therefore
 appears that the agent which brings about coagulation, intra venas,
 must disappear in the act of coagulation.                The shed blood contains
 only a minute trace of fibrin ferment.
    The acetic acid precipitate is soluble* in 0-5 per cent. HC1 solution.
 On digesting this solution at 37", after the addition of pepsine, a part
 of it is converted into peptone, but a precipitate appears in the pro
 cess which is permanent.              When the digestive prodncts (peptone
 and precipitate), having been rendered alkaline, are injected into the
 circulation, no effect is produced.f              There is neither intravascular
 coagulation, nor is the blood deprived of its power of coagulation ;
 but if fresh acetic acid precipitate be added to the liquid, both effects
 follow injection. Consequently, the failure of effect when the pro
 ducts of digestion are injected alone, is not due to presence of pepsine
or peptone.        I have ascertained that the acetic acid precipitate does,
 not cause coagulation of dilute magnesium sulphate plasma, which
coagulates readily on the addition of fibrin ferment.                 The agent,
therefore, in producing intravascular coagulation cannot be identified
with that body.

fully compared. I also described the colours of captured larvae of the
same species, and mentioned the trees upon which they had been found.
I was extremely anxious to continue the investigation in the following
year (1885) in -order chiefly to throw further light upon the two
fallowing points : —
    (1.) By means of experiments and observations I had been enabled
to show that the colour of the larva was in most cases affected by the
food-plant, but there remained a certain number of exceptions which
had to be accounted for.      I suggested that these might be explained
by supposing that the tendencies towards certain colours which were
 produced by particular food-plants in one generation became inde
pendent larval tendencies in the next, which might modify or over-
c me the usual effects of the food-plants ; and that such transmitted
influences augmented as the number of generations upon one food-
plant (or others producing similar effects) increased.       I   was desirous
of testing this theory by breeding     from moths  of  which   the history in
the larval state was accurately known.
    (2.) In my last paper I also pointed out that there was considerable
evidence for believing that the influence of the food upon the larval
colour is not a comparatively simple phytophagic influence, but one
which is exceedingly complex, being brought about by the colour of
part of the leaf (the part which the larva resembles), acting as a
stimulus to some larval sensory surface (presumably the ocelii) and so
through the nervous system regulating the amounts and kinds of the
vegetal pigments absorbed and made use of, and that of the larval
pigments deposited.
    I wished to test this theory by feeding the larvae under such con
ditions that they could only be affected by the colour from one side
of the leaves of their food-plant, and it seemed that the best way of
achieving this object was by sewing the leaves together.          In tho sub
sequent experiments the edges of the leaves were at first pared with
the scissors to make them correspond, but it was afterwards found
better to double each single leaf longitudinal and sew together the
 opposite margins which were thus brought into contact.            The inten
 tion of the experiment      was to compare the larvae which had been
 exposed to the colour of the under sides of the leaves only, with those
 which had been exposed to the upper sides only, and with those which
 had been fed upon the normal leaves. If the larval colours varied
 according to these three sets of conditions, it would be quite clear
 that the larvae were only influenced by the colour of the leaf-surface,
 because    the leaf-substance eaten (from the edge through its whole
 thickness)   must  have been identical in all three cases.     I also wished
 to vary the experiment by feeding some larvae upon leaves which had

the under surface, and to test whether the ocelli formed the impres
sionable part of the larvae by investigating the effect upon colour of
covering these organs with some innocuous opaque pigment.
     I also wished to further investigate the effect of certain food-plants,
about which the evidence was conflicting, and to carefully watch for
instances of individual variation among the larvae from the same batch
 of eggs and fed upon the same food, to look out for any indications
 which would throw light upon, the red-spotted varieties, and also to
 further enquire into the periods during which the larvae are most
 susceptible to the influence of the food- plant.
     As far as these questions could be. answered by work in the field, I
 was very successful, for the larvae were even more abundant than in

 immense amount of labour bestowed upon them.                     In the first place
 the moths emerged in an unfortunate order— a great many males, and
 later a great many females*             Then of those which emerged together,
 there was great difficulty in obtaining such a system of pairing as I
 was desirous of instituting, the results being that I could get no larva)
 with a strong hereditary tendency towards the yellowish variety ; and
 these I was most anxious to obtain, because all ray bred larvae in
 1884 tended very strongly in the opposite direction.                   The eggs I
 obtained in nearly all cases resulted from, pairing the moths which
 came from these bred larvae (1884).               Although disappointed in the
 pairing     of  the moths,    it  seemed    likely  that the experiments would
 yield sufficiently convincing results from the very comprehensive
 scale on which they were conducted, for in July, 1885, I had many
 hundreds of yonng larvae belonging to five different families.                After
 the great labour of bringing this large number through the most
 delicate period of their lives, and just before the results appeared, the
  larvae began to die off in hundreds, so that only seventy-five lived to
  an age at which trustworthy observations could be made.                 I can only
  suggest that this altogether exceptional mortality may have been due
  to the excessive heat and dryness which prevailed at the time.                I do
  not think that it can have been           due   to the fact  that both  parents of
  the majority of the 1885 larva resulted from larvae belonging to tho
   same batch in 1884, because such interbreeding among moths does
   not produce injurious effects, at any rate until after it has been con
   tinued for many generations.             Besides, in one instance, the larvae
   were the offspring of parents which came from quite different
   localities, and these did not succeed any better than the others.             But

   2. Experiments     upon the Larvce of Smerinthns ocellatns during 1885.
     The following experiments           are arranged in five different series,
 belonging      respectively    to five   different batches of eggs.         There is
 complete uncertainty as to the male parent (if any) in Series II, and
 consequently there is some doubt thrown over the male parent in
  Series   III,  because in these cases        (alone) the same female laid two
 batches of eggs.        The canse of the uncertainty is explained at the
 beginning of Series         II.   The series are arranged in a succession
 which corresponds to an advance in the (presumably) hereditary ten
 dency from the whitish towards the yellowish variety.                   And so also
 in each series the different sets of experiments are arranged in an
 order which corresponds to a similar advance in the tendencies known
 to be produced by the food-plants, i.e., beginning with apple and
 ending with Salix rubra.
     But the order is merely provisional in the case of less definite
 tendencies, or of plants which are little known as food-plants.                   It
 must also be remembered that the difference between the hereditary
tendencies of the various series is very small, because of the failure
 (except in one case in which very few larvae lived) to obtain any eggs
from moths which came from yellowish larvae.
                                        Series   I.
     Eggs were laid in June, 1885, by a female moth bred from a larva
which had been fed during 1884, for the whole period of larval life
upon ordinary apple, and which was a typically whitish-green variety
(mentioned in "Proc. Roy. Soc.," No. 237, 1885, p. 300).                    The eggs
were fertilised by a male moth bred from a larva which had been fed
upon crab for the whole of its life, and was a similar whitish variety
(also mentioned on p. 300).             Hence the inherited tendencies must
have been strongly towards the whitest variety of this larva.

    Ont of a large number of       larvae which hatched at the beginning of
July,   1885,  a very   small  proportion lived until they were old enough
to be of use in the present investigation. A careful examination of
the survivors was made on August 12th, with the following results: —
    1.  Pyrus Mains (var. acerba). — Five larvae (including one which was
found after escaping, and which almost certainly belonged to this lot)
                     J
were hatched on oly '2nd, and now four were well in the last stage and
one was changing its last skin. All five were extreme whitish varieties.
 Eventually all these larvae died, but their colour was unchanged, and
they were sufficiently advanced to warrant the conclusion that no
 further alteration would have taken place.
    2. Populus tremula, fyc. — Ono larva, hatched July 2nd, was now
(August 12th) changing its skin for the last time and seemed to be a
 .whitish variety. By August 20th it was well in the last stage and an
 intermediate variety, and without further change on August 27th,
 when it was nearly full-fed (ceasing to feed in a day or two). After
 the first fortnight the larva was fed upon a somewhat similar species
                      I
 of poplar, which have not yet been able to name with certainty.
     3. Salix   babijlonica. — One larva (hatched July 3rd) had now
 entered upon the last stage, and seemed to be well on the yellowish
 side of an intermediate variety.          This description especially applied
 to the back, but there was a blueness about the ventral surface and
 lower part of the sides which is never seen in a true yellowish variety.
 On August 20th the larva was still on the yellowish side of inter
 mediate, but not to such an extent as that seen in larvae of Series III,
 which had been fed upon the same plant.              Later, the larva became
 less yellow,   so that    by August     27th  it was distinctly intermediate,
 and remained without further change until September 3rd, when it
 ceased feeding.
     4. Salix amygdalina, July 4tth — 13th, S. triandra, July 13th — 14th,
 and S. rubra, July 14th, onwards. — One larva (hatched July 4th — 5th)
  was changing its last skin and apparently whitish. Another larva
 had died at the beginning of the last stage, and was also whitish.
  The former was dead by August 20th, so that no results were ob
 tained from these larvae, except the fact that the tendencies of the
  food-plants (towards producing the yellowish varieties) had evi
  dently been largely counteracted in these larvae.         This larva is after
  wards described as if fed upon S. rubra, for the leaves were selected
  so as to be similar to those of this tree in their effects.
     The effects of hereditary influence are certainly seen in the larvae of
  this series. The parent larvae were extreme white varieties, and
  belonged to a group which evidently inherited a very strong tendency
  in this direction, as was shown by the comparatively slight effect that
  followed the use of foods which most powerfully tend to produce
  yellow varieties.      It is certain that more dependence can bo placed

 140       Mr. E. B. Poulton.      Colour-relation   between the   [Feb.  4,
upon this proof of a larval tendency, than by trusting to the maximum
results obtained by the use of food-plants which tend to produce white
varieties ; because the power of the latter is so great as to afford no
 means of discriminating between larvae with different tendencies except
when the latter are very exceptionally strong in the direction of yellow.
 (For the proof of the strong tendencies of the parent larvae, and an
account of the effects of varions foods upon them, se, " Proc. Roy. Soc,"
as above quoted, pp. 298— 300.)     The larval tendencies in this case were
even stronger than in the parents, having been augmented by inheri
tance from the latter.     Crab, which has no power in checking the
tendency towards white (I cannot yet believe that it causes white itself)
produced the most extreme white varieties in these larvae as in their
parents (No. 1).      But S. rubra (with other similar foods unavoidably
used during absence from home) evidently produced less effect than in
the case of the parents (No. 4), and the same is trae of Salix babylonica
 (No. 3) if we assume that this plant acts in the same manner as
S. rubra. No conclusions can be drawn from the effects of Populus
tremula, &c. (No. 2), because this is,    I  believe, the only instance yet
recorded of the larva feeding upon the food-plant in question.
                                  Series II.
    Eggs were laid by a female moth bred from a larva which had been
 fed during 1884 for the whole of its life upon Salix viminalis, and
 which became an intermediate variety with some tendency towards
the whitish side.      (The larva was one of those mentioned on p. 300
 of the paper already quoted.)      In the case of this moth it seemed
 likely that no fertile eggs would be laid, for coitus did not take place
 when I placed a male in the same box with it. After this I put
 several males in the box, but I did not witness any act of coitus,
 although I watched the moths constantly, and the act lasts for several
 hours in all the cases which have come under my notice.             In the
 meanwhile the moth kept laying eggs which         I put  in a box by them
 selves and carefully labelled.      The great majority of these eggs
 shrivelled up, but to my astonishment a few gave rise to larvae which
 are considered under these series. Subsequently to the laying of these
 mostly infertile eggs I succeeded in artificially inducing coitus, with
 the result that a large number of fertile eggs were laid, which were kept
separate and are considered under the next series.       Inasmuch as many
 males were present in the box with the female, it would be obviously
impossible to maintain that the larvae of this series were partheno-
genetically developed, but I may state in favour of such a view that
in all other cases the coitus lasted long enough for me to witness it,
and that nearly all the eggs behaved like those which were laid by
other female moths without coitus.         I may add that I always care
fully separated the eggs which were laid before and after coitus, and

also that whon     several males weTe      together  in the  same box with a
female,   the former were     distinguished from one another         by small
notches in the wings.
   The inherited tendency was probably towards the intermediate
variety (arguing from the female parent only), because the parent
larva was almost intermediate after feeding on S. viminalis for its
whole life, although the group of larvae to which it belonged tended
strongly towards white.
   The larvae were examined on August 12th, with the following
results : —
   1. Salix viminalis. — Six larvae (hatched July 10th) of which four
were nearly full grown, and very similar, being good whitish varieties,
though not so strong as those produced by apple. The two others
are younger but apparently similar.          By August 20th the four larger
ones had all ceased feeding without any change of colour.             The two
smaller larvae died.
   2. Salix Smithiana.—Tvro larvae were well in the last stage and
were greener than those just described — perhaps intermediate varie-
tias.   By August 16th one of these was decidedly intermediate, while
on August 20th it was well on the yellowish side of intermediate and
very nearly full grown. It ceased feeding without further change on
Angust 27th. The other larva died soon after August 12th. These
larvae were fed for a considerable time upon the upper twigs (bearing
large leaves) of the doubtful species of Salix mentioned in the note on
p. 301 of the paper quoted above. Such leaves were indistinguishable
from those of S. Smithiana.
   These results are certainly perplexing, for the larvae upon S, vimu
nalis (No. 1) were whiter than the parent larva which was fed upon
the same plant (althongh the former probably represents the real
tendency of the food-plant), while the one upon S. Smithiana (No. 2)
was rather yellower than those which are generally produced by this
plant, althongh the data are insufficient.       On the other hand, there is
nothing at all startling or violently opposed to the conclusions of
the other series in the above results, which in one case are those
normal to the food-plant, and in the other differ but slightly from the
normal result. It must also be remembered that there is complete
uncertainty as to the male parent (if any) of these larvae.
                                   Series III.
   The eggs which produced the        larvae  of this series were laid by the
female moth described at the beginning of Series II. It was bred
from a larva which had been fed upon Salix viminalis, and which
became an intermediate        variety with some tendency towards the
whitish side. After laying the eggs which produced the larvae of the
last series, coitus was artificially induced with a male moth, bred from

a larva   which had been fed for its whole life upon ordinary apple
 (mentioned at p. 300 of the paper quoted above), and which was a
typical whitish variety. Hence the inherited tendencies were probably
towards the white variety, somewhat modified in the direction of
 intermediate.    Very many fertile eggs were laid after coitns, in June,
 1885, and were hatched about July 10th, and although a large number
died, a considerable mass of evidence was forthcoming from the
fairly numerous larva? which survived, and which were divided into
nineteen sets of experiments.    The results of the examination of these
larvae on various dates are given below : —
    1. Ordinary Apple. — On August 12th two larvse (hatched July 12
i— 16) were examined, and were in the fourth stage and very white,
with a peculiar transparent appearance, which seems to be often
caused by this food-plant.      On August 20th they were both dead,
but there could be no doubt of the tendency of the food-plant in this
case.
    2. Ordinary Apple. — On August 12th four larvse (hatched July 10th)
were examined : three were in the last stage and one in the fourth ;
all were very white.    On August 20th all were dead except one, which
died on August 27th.        There was no doubt about the extreme
tendency   of  the food ; but apple seemed extraordinarily fatal in its
effects during this last summer.
    3. Ordinary Apple (the leaves sewn so as to expose the under sides
only). — One larva (hatched July 10th) was examined August 12th,
when it was at the end of the fourth stage and very white.            On
August 20th it had entered the last stage, and was unchanged in
colour.   On August 27th it was dead. There could be no doubt about
the strong tendency of the food, but the nnsewn apple leaves pro
duced such a maximum effect that there was no room left for the
sewn ones to do more.
    4. Ordinary Apple (the leaves sewn so as to expose the upper sides
only). — Three larvae (hatched July 10th) were examined August 12th,
when they were young in the fourth stage and very white.              By
August 20th they were all dead, and so immature that it is impossible
to draw any certain conclusions.    It must also be noted that in the
case of such broad leaves as apple, there is a constant tendency for
the larvae to expose considerable areas of the under surface by
nibbling away part of one Bide of the leaf.
    5. Grab (Pyrus Malus, var. acerha). — Four larvae (hatched July
16th) were examined August 12th, when they were very small and
apparently tending strongly towards the white variety. On August 16th
one had died, and the others were only in the third stage.             On
August 20th they were still quite small and very white, and on
August 27th they were all dead, except one which died soon after.
 As far as the observations went the larvae were typically white, but

 they were very small.     Nevertheless it is improbable that there would
 have been any change from this strongly marked tendency.
     6. Salix viminalis. — One larva (hatched July 11th) was well in
 the last stage when it was examined on August 16th ; it was a
 whitish variety with tendencies towards intermediate.       The larva was
 further examined on August 20th and 27th, and on the last date was
 slightly on the white side of intermediate.     This is the last note upon
 the larva, which mnst have been full fed by this time.
     7. Salix viminalis. — Five larvae (hatched July 10th) were examined
 on August 20th, when one had ceased feeding a few days before,
 three were nearly full fed, while one was small.     All were slightly on
 the white side of intermediate.      The larvae were again examined on
 August 27th, when only two were still feeding, but were practically
 mature, and were very slightly on the white side of intermediate.      The
 small one had died. The results are final as regards the other four larvae.
     8. Salix viminalis (the leaves sewn so as to expose the under sides
 only). — One larva (hatched July 10th) was examined on August 12th,
when it was in the fourth stage, and very white.             It was again
 examined on August 27th, when it had been fed for about a week on
 the ordinary unsewn leaves of S. viminalis. It was well in the fourth
stage and strongly white. The larva died shortly afterwards, but it is
 probable that the colour would not have changed.
    9. Salix alba. — Two larvae (hatched July 14 and 15) were examined
on August 12th, when one was in the fourth stage and the other was
well in the last stage. They were intermediate varieties, or perhaps
rather on the yellowish side. On August 16th the younger one was
dead without further change, and the older larva was examined on
August 16th, 20th, and 27th, remaining on the yellowish side of inter
mediate until its death on the last of the above-mentioned dates.
    10. Salix Smithiana. — On August 12th four larvae              (hatched
July 10th) in the last stage were examined, and were found to be
on the white side of intermediate.      By August 20th three were dead,
and the remaining larva was examined then and on the 27th. On
the last date the larva was well in the last stage and slightly on the
white side of intermediate, this being the last note taken, and certainly
representing the final effect of the food. These larvae were fed for a
considerable time upon the upper twigs (bearing large leaves) of the
doubtful species of Salix mentioned in the note on p. 301 of the
paper quoted above.       Such leaves were indistinguishable from those
of S. Smithiana.
    11. Salix cinerea. — Two larvsa (hatched July 10th) were examined
August 16th, when one was well in the last stage and one in the
third. The former was intermediate, the latter too young for any
certain results.    On August 20th the younger larva was dead, the
older one being still intermediate, while upon August 27th it was

    12. Salix cinerea. — Three larv» (hatched July 11th) were tolerably
full fed when they were examined on August 16th. One was on the
white side and one on the yellow side of intermediate, while the third
was a yellowish variety (although not strongly yellowish).          It was
                                                   —
extremely interesting to note that the latter the only undoubtedly
yellowish larva yet obtained in my breeding experiments in 1884 and
1885 — possessed traces of the red spots that occur commonly on the
yellowish varieties of 8. ocellatus.         On the first five abdominal
segments there was a little local darkening of the green borders to
the oblique stripes occupying the position of the upper row of red
 spots, and in the centre of each dark spot the,e was an extremely
 faiut tinge of red. There was also a very slight tendency towards
 the suffusion of the ground colour round the spiracles with a tinge
 of red. On August 20th the larvae were as they have been described
 (except that the whitish intermediate larva was now intermediate),
 and were practically full fed.     The yellowest one was a bright yellow
 variety (although there was but little yellow on the under surface, so
 that the larva was not one of the strongest varieties). On August 22nd
 the yellow variety and the intermediate larva had ceased feeding,
 while the yellowish intermediate larva became adult about August 25th.
  There was no further change in the colour of any of the larvae.
      13. Salix cinerea. — Three larva (hatched Jnly 12th) were well in
  the last stage when they were examined on August 16th.           One was
  on the white side of intermediate, and two intermediate or slightly on
  the yellowish side.     On Angust 20th and 27th the larvae were again
  examined and had progressed in the direction of the yellowish variety,
  so that on the latter date — when two had ceased feeding, and the
  other, though still feeding, was mature — they were all on the yellowish
  side of intermediate, although only slightly so in one case.
      14. Populus nigra. — Five larvae (hatched July 10th) were examined
  on August 12th, when four were in the last stage and one smaller.
  They were all whitish, but looked as though they were progressing in
  the direction of intermediate.     On August 16th only two remained
   alive, one being well in the last stage and a whitish intermediate
   variety, while the other was whitish, being much smaller and not
   thriving.    On Angust 27th the large larva was the only one alive and
   was advanced in the last stage, and a distinct intermediate variety
   without any tendency in either direction.       This represents the final
   result, as the larva subsequently died without further change.
       15. Salix triandra. — Eleven larvae (hatched Jnly 9 — 12th) — of
   which three were small, but eight were advanced in the last stage —
   were examined on August 12th, and were all intermediate varieties,
   as different as possible from those from the same batch of eggs which

1886.]       Larva of Smerinthus ocellatue and its Food-plants.          145
were fed upon apple. On August 16th two of the eight large larvae
were quite clearly, though slightly, on the yellowish side of inter
mediate.       On August 18th four ceased feeding, and on August 23rd
three more without change of colour.              The other larva and three
small    ones died.
     16.  Salix triandra (without     the whitish hloom upon the under side
of    the leaves). — The bloom     was for the first part of the time rubbed
off with the moistened       fingers, but afterwards a tree was found near
the Oxford University parks, of which all the leaves were without
the bloom, and the larvae were fed upon this food for the later part of
their lives. The following results afford a very interesting comparison
with those given above, following the use of the ordinary leaves of
 S. triandra which presumably tend less towards the yellowish variety
 of larva than those supplied in the present instance.
     Ten larvae (hatched July 13 —-14th) were variously advanced in the
 last stage on August 18th, and on comparing them with those (see
 above) fed upon ordinary S. triandra (most of which were rather
 older), it appeared that the former would be considerably yellower
 when they had reached an equal age. There were also other younger
 larvae upon the same leaves, of which the tendency could be better
 estimated at a later date. On August 23rd one had ceased to feed,
 and was distinctly on the yellowish side of intermediate.         On August
 27th the small ones had died without any results, while four of the
 older ones were full fed, and the others dead (although old enough to
 indicate what their colour would have been). The results were very
  uniform, all being on the yellowish side of intermediate, while only u
  small proportion of those fed upon ordinary S. triandra were at all
 beyond the intermediate form.
      17. Salix babylonica. — Fourlarvae (hatched July 10 — Llth) were well
 in the last stage on August 12th when they were examined. They had
  been fed on S. triandra for twenty- four hours (July 23rd — 24th)
 because     I  was travelling and could not get the proper food.         On
  August    12th   they were   all well   on the yellow side of intermediate:
  they were again examined on August 20th and 27th, when two ceased
  feeding, one was practically mature, and one had died. The colour
  remained the same in all cases.
      When examining these larvae at an earlier date (August 3rd), when
  they were more numerous,          I  noticed one which was in the fourth
  stage, and which possessed the upper row of rust-coloured spots which
  are often fonnd on the yellow varieties of these larvae. The spots were
  present on the second thoracic segment (very faintly), and upon the
  first five and the seventh abdominal segment. To my great surprise
  I observed that the larva was distinctly whitish, and as I was most
  anxious to prove that such varities can bear the spots I changed its
  fuod from S. babylonica to apple (August 3rd). The next day the

146        Mr. E. B. Poulton.        Colour-relation  between   the   [Feb. 4,
larva  ceased feeding before its last ecdyais, and it died on August 20th
when advanced in the last stage, and an intermediate variety. Thus
it is quite certain that the spots can appear on other than yellowish
varieties.
   18.  Salix rubra. — Three larva (hatched July 10th) were well in
the last stage on August 12th, when they were examined.             Like those
upon S. babylonica they      had   been  fed  for one  day upon    S. triandraj
One was decidedly on the yellow side of intermediate, one less
markedly so, and one was intermediate.             On August 20th the two
former were decidedly on the yellowish side, and        I  have a note to the
effect that  I was sure that they were yellower than the larvae fed upon
this tree last year (1884), and of which an account is given in the
paper already alluded to. At this time the two yellower larvae ceased
feeding, while the third was still intermediate, and it ceased feeding
about August 25th without further change.
   19. S. rubra. — One larva (hatched July 10th) which had been fed
for one day as above described upon S. triandra was examined on
August 16th, when it was in the last stage and apparently on the
yellowish side of intermediate.       On August 20th it was advanced in
the last stage and unchanged in colour, and on August 27th it was
about full fed and slightly on the yellowish side of intermediate, and
there is no doubt that this result was final, for the larva could not
have undergone further change when it was so mature, this being the
last note  1  have about it.
   Reviewing these    sets of experiments and comparing       them with tho1.e
of Series   I and II, we find upon the whole considerable evidence for
the existence of a hereditary force which influences the larval colour
in this species.
    Ordinary apple (Nos.   1  and 2) produces a maximum effect, as might
be expected from previous experiment and observation.                 It would
probably do so even if there existed a strong hereditary tendency
towards yellow, and in this case the transmitted influence deviated
but little from the direction of the typical white variety (as indicated
by the life histories of the present larvae).       There is no doubt that a
similar effect would have been produced in the other two series if the
larvae fed upon this food-plant had lived long enough to enable me to
take reliable observations.       (As this was not the case, such experi
ments were not alluded to in either series.)            Since ordinary apple
produced maximum        effect, it  was practically certain that the same
result would follow the use of leaves which were sewn so as to show
the white under sides only (No. 3). No. 4, in which the leaves of
apple were sewn so as to show the upper sides only, did not terminate
as  I should have expected, as far as     I could judge of the effects in the
 immature larvae.    The process of sewing and paring causes injury to
 the leaves, so that the larvae did not thrive upon them (being less

1886.]      iMrva of Sinerinthus ocellatus and its Food-plants.               147
healthy than they -were upon tho unsewn leaves, although they were
far from healthy upon the latter during the past year). Nevertheless,
I hope to succeed in the rearing the larvae upon such leaves in a more
                              I
favourable season, and believe that some deviation from the extreme
white variety will result (this conclusion being warranted by the results
of other experiments described in the pfesent paper). Nos. 1 —4 were
not represented in the other two series.
    Crab (No. 5) produced white varieties, as far as could be ascertained,
acting as it did on the present larvae and in Series           I (No. 1). It was
quite  as  fatal  in  its  effects  as ordinary apple, and the larvae seem to
grow more slowly when fed upon it than upon any other plant, as was
also noticed in the case of the parent larvae.           Considering the extreme
effects following the use of this food in the other cases, it could hardly
be expected that there would be any appreciable difference in the
larvae of this series.
    Salix viminalis (Nos. 6 and 7) produced exactly the same effects as
in the parent larvae, while the larvae of Series II (No 1) fed upon the
same plant were fairly strong white varieties.             This is a very strange
contrast considering the parentage of the two series, but tho un»
certainty of the male parent in Series            II  prevents much importance
from being attached to it.
   The effect of S. viminalis, sewn so as to show the under sides of
the leaves (No. 8), affords a most interesting comparison with the
results of Nos. 6 and 7, for the former produced a strong white
variety (that is up to the time of its death). Here is a distinct proof
of the effect of the colour of one leaf -surface as apart from the leaf-
sabstance eaten by the larva.
    Salix alba (No. 9) cannot be compared with any previous experience
of my own.        I  expected it to act like         viminalis, but the larva was
rather yellower than those which had fed upon the latter plant. The
leaves of 8. alba vary much in whiteness, the young leaves being far
more downy and white than the older ones, so that a different effect
is probably produced by the two kinds. There is independent evidence
(Mr. Boscher's, which will be alluded to presently) that this food-
plant produces white larvae.
    Salix Smithiana (No. 10) produced a larva which when mature was
on the whitish side of intermediate.               This is probably the normal
result of the food which in this case coincided with the hereditary
influence.     In Series    II  (No. 2), however, the larvae fed upon the same
food-plant were rather yellower ; hence the effects of S. Smithiana
and S. viminalis in the two series were the exact converse of each
other — a very perplexing result.               At the same time, as already
pointed   out,   there   was  nothing   at all  unusual in the results of any of
the individual sets of experiments.              (See also the notes upon the
parentage    of   the  larvae  of  these two   series.)

  148       Mr. E. B. Poulton.         Colour-relation   between the     [Feb.  4,
    Salix cinerea (Nos. 11, 12, and 13) produced very interesting results,
 varying from a good yellow variety to intermediate, nearly all being
 upon the yellowish side of the latter. Thus, there is a distinct, though
 slight, advance upon the effect of this food on the parents in the
 direction of yellow.
    The results obtained from the three larvae of No. 12 are extremely
 interesting, showing that individual variation may sometimes play an
 important part in the colour produced, although the whole of the
 results of all observations and experiments conducted up to the present
 time certainly prove that such a factor is generally insignificant, and
 rarely causes any effects that can be detected. By individual varia
 tion I mean the development of a different colour than that which
 would be produced by the food-plant acting upon a larval tendency
 which is uniform for nearly all the larvae from each batch of ova, the
 latter tendency being probably explicable as the inherited results of
 previous food-plants for many generations.            In other words, 1 mean
 breaches in the uniformity, however caused, of the larval tendency,
 and a study of this and the previous paper upon the same subject,
 will show that such irregularities are comparatively rare, and especially
 so when the food-plant     itself is known to   possess a   strong influence in
 the direction of either extreme of coloration.
    Populus nigra (No. 14). — The results of this food-plant, inter
mediate as far as the evidence went, cannot be compared with any
 other experience, for this is, I believe, the only instance of the larvae
 having been known to eat this food-plant.          From the green glabrous
 undersides of the leaves     I should have anticipated a tendency towards
yellow, which was only partially verified.
                                  I
    Salix triandra (No. 15). — was especially anxious to gain abundant
 evidence as to the effect of this food-plant, because I believed that its
tendency was towards yellow.               Mr. Boscher described numerous
instances    of  typical  white  larv»    having  besn found on it.       I have,
however, since ascertained that Mr. Boscher was mistaken in his
identification, and that the trees upon which he found the whitish
larvae were Salix alba, and such a result from the latter food-plant is
       I
what should have anticipated.                                  I
                                          At the same time, should wish to
point out     that   the identification   of the various species of Salix is
immensely difficult, and that        I  have only been saved from' hopeless
confusion by the skilled assistance of Mr. G. C. Druce, who has most
kindly helped me, and, when necessary, has obtained other opinions,
throughout this investigation.         During the past year (1885)        I have
proved by observation in the field (as will        be seen) that   the effect of
S. triandra is to produce yellowish varieties, and the same thing is
proved by these experiments, considering the hereditary influences.
1 have therefore verified the prediction       upon which I ventured in my
last paper     (already quoted, p. 306), although       at the time when the

 1886.   j   Larva of Smerinthus ocellatus and its Food-plants.             149
 paper was written, nearly all the evidence seemed to point the other
 way. The larvae of this set were intermediate, inclining in some cases
 to the yellowish side.       Hence the effects are the same as those pro
 duced by leaves which are known to cause the yellowish varieties as a
 rule. These results can be compared with no previous experience, as
 the larva has never been bred upon this tree (as far as I am aware),
 and   I   can find no instance recorded of its being found in the field
 upon this food-plant, except the instances which occurred in 1885 (to
 be described).       These agree with the breeding experiments, as does
 the resnlt of an experiment given in my last paper (quoted above,
 p. 3U.3), in which S. triandra modified the colour of a whitish larva
found upon ,S. ferruginca.
    Salix triandra (No. 16, without the whitish bloom on the under
sides of tho leaves). — These results compare in a very interesting
manner with those of the last set, the influence in the direction of
yellow being more strongly marked than in the case of the usual
leaves of this plant.         The numerous larvae of these two sets were
repeatedly placed side by side and compared in the most careful
manner, and there could be no doubt that there was a considerable
difference in the predominance of yellow, while the larvae had been
subject to exactly the same conditions, except in the one point men
tioned above.
    Salix babylonica (No. 17). — The larvae were all well on the yellowish
side of intermediate (except the one which was put upon another food
when quite young), and this result compares favourably with that of
the larvae of Series I upon the same plaut (No. 3), where with the
greater hereditary influence towards white the larva became an inter
mediate variety.        In this case also the larvae of the two series were
examined       side by side, so that there was no doubt about the difference.
This result also compares favourably with the            larvae captured  upon
this food-plant during       1884.
    Salix rubra (Nos.      18 and    19).
                                          — These results also compare well
with No. 4 of Series 1.         As far as it was possible to judge from the
immature       condition of the larvae in the latter set, the effect was not so
yellow as in Series III. The effect produced in the present case was
stronger than in the larvae from the same set as the parents, which
were     fed upon S. rubra.        This was to be expected, because the
tendency of the latter was very strongly towards the white variety,
while in the present instance it was somewhat modified.

  by a male moth bred from a larva which had been fed for its whole
  life upon Salix rubra (mentioned at p. 300), and which became a
  yellowish intermediate variety.   The tendencies were thus presumably
  towards intermediate, or slightly on the yellowish side. A large
  number of eggs were laid, and nearly all of them hatched successfully,
  yielding apparently healthy young larvae, but the most extraordinary
  mortality prevailed, so that no single larva arrived at maturity, or
  indeed at an age which would render any conclusions possible (except
  in the case of very marked colours which were not manifested).     This
  is all the more to be regretted because I had reserved by far the
  greater part of this lot of larvae for some experiments which would
  have conclusively decided some of the points in this difficult problem.
  A few larvae were fed upon some of the same food-plants as in the other
 instances, in order to gain further evidence as to their effect. Thus
 larvoe were fed upon Salix cinerea (in this case it would have been
 interesting to ascertain the effect of the food upon two generations of
 larva), although the female parent only had been so fed upon S. cinerea)
 and upon S. Smithiana (the leaves sewn together so as to expose the
 under sides only). A few of the larvaB were blinded before they had
 seen the food-plant, by carefully painting over the ocelli with lamp
 black, a lens being used to make certain that all of the ocelli were
 covered.    This was a task of considerable delicacy and difficulty in
 the small and restless larva, but when once accomplished the larvae
 did not seem any the worse, and behaved in every way as the others
 which were not blinded.     As the lamp-black only formed an opaque
film over the transparent cuticular covering of the ocelli, and as the
former is thrown off" at ecdysis, the pigment had to be renewed at the
beginning of each fresh stage, and the greatest care was necessary to
prevent the larva? from changing their skins at unexpected times,
and thus having the opportunity of seeing the food-plant.          Hence
any larva which had ceased feeding before ecdysis was isolated and
only put back upon the food after it had changed its skin and the
pigment had been renewed.         Larvae treated in this way were fed
upon the two food-plants which tend most strongly in opposite
directions —ordinary apple and Salix rubra, and at the same time
large numbers of un blinded larvae from the same batch of eggs were
fed upon the same plants.     Had the larvae lived there must have been
conclusive   evidence as to one  obvious theory of the origin of afferent
impulses which determine the selection and the use of certain
proportions of the mixed vegetal pigments, and the deposition of
certain amounts and kinds of true larval pigments — the theory that
such impulses are caused by the colour of one or both sides of the leaf
acting as a stimulus by means of the ocelli.       I am indebted to Pro
fessor G. J. Romanes for the suggestion that experiments should be
made upon blinded larvaB, while Professor E. Ray Lankester advised

 me to use some harmless pigment                      instead of silver nitrate.       The
 lamp-black mixed in the usual way with Mc. Guilp. acted in every way
 satisfactorily, drying very quickly and being perfectly innocuous, and
 completely opaque.         The possibility of future success was shown by
 these experiments, for the death of the larvae was certainly not due to
 the conditions under which they were placed, as was shown by
 comparing them with the normal larvae.
    Further experiments were tried upon tho larva from this batch of
 eggs, to ascertain if possible the exact periods of larval life which are
 most     sensitive   to the influence of the food-plant, as gauged by the
 persistence of effects after the change to another food-plant which
 tends in an opposite direction.             Most of the larvae were used in this
 series of experiments.         A large number (forty or fifty) were fed upon
 ordinary apple, and about an equal number upon Salix rubra. At
 the end of the first stage a certain number (six) were shifted from
 apple to S. rubra, and an equal number from S. rubra to apple, and
 so with each succeeding stage. Thus if the larvae had lived there would
 have been the following groups when they were full fed : —
       1.  Fed upon ordinary apple during       stage 1, and 5. rubra, stages 2-5.
       2.           „      „          „        stages 1-2,        „       „ 3-5.

       o.        „                ,,       ,,  1-5.
   I   think there is no doubt that             a careful     comparison of these ten
groups (which         would   in all cases    have     been  kept separate as soon as
their food was changed) would have very                      completely answered the
question of which the solution was sought                      in this series of expe
riments.       I   have given an account of these experiments —although
they yielded no results owing to the unfortunate                         and altogether
exceptional season       —  because it is likely that future work on these
lines will be successful in throwing some light on this difficult subject,
and because it is to be hoped that others may be induced to assist
in these investigations.

above, as the larva in the last stage without the brownish-red spots.
The larva had been fed upon apple from August 10th — 18th, without
causing any change of colour (see pp. 302 and 303).          Thus the
hereditary tendencies should be towards a rather strong yellowish
variety, if they are due to a compromise between the tendencies of
the two sexes.    A large number of eggs were laid in June, 1885,
which hatched at the beginning of July, but there was great mortality
among the larvae in all stages, but especially when they were very
young.     A careful examination of the few surviving larvie was made
on August 12th, all the others having died before the period at which
it was possible to make any trustworthy observations of their colour.
   1. Salix viminalis (upper side). — One larva (hatched    July 2nd)
had been fed upon the leaves of S. viminalis, folded and sewn so that
only the upper side was exposed.   The larva died August 10th in the
lost stage, after failing for some time ; it was a very green inter
mediate variety, and although it had very little yellow about it, the
contrast with larva fed in a normal way upon the leaves of this
food-plant was most interesting (although the different parentage
must be taken into account).
  2.  Salix cinerea. — Two adult larv» (hatched July 2nd) had been
fed upon this plant for their whole life.  One was decidedly but not
strongly on the yellowish side of intermediate ; the other strictly
intermediate.     By August 20th both had ceased feeding without
further change.
   3. Populus nigra. — Two larvse (July 3rd) had not thriven at all.
One was in the fourth and one in the third stage ; the former evi
dently tending towards the whitish variety, but they were too young
for any certain conclusions, and by August 20th both were dead,
without any further results.
   The review and comparison of these results      is,
                                                   on the whole, dis
appointing.
   Salix viminalis, upper side only (No. 1). — The result of this expe
riment was very interesting.    The larva was frequently placed side
by side with others upon ordinary S. viminalis, and the difference
was extremely marked.    I    do not think that too much weight must
be attached to hereditary influence in producing this effect, because
the other sets of experiments in this series do not prove the influence
to be as strong as  I   should have expected from the colour of the
parent larva).
  Salix   cinerea  (No. 2). — The effects compare unfavourably with
those produced by this food-plant upon the larvae of Series     III
                                                                  (Nos.
11, 12, 13), for the latter were rather more strongly influenced in the

  1886.]     Larva of Smerinthus ocellatus and its Food-plants.                153
 direction of yellow, while the hereditary tendency was presumably
 weaker.       At the same time the effect was more marked than in the
 set of  larvae  to which the parents belonged ; and there was nothing at
 all unusual in the results themselves.
    Pcrpulus nigra (No. 8). — There is little to be said about this result.
 The larvae were too young to warrant any conclusion, but they wero
 whitish when they died.          At the same time the larvae of Series         III
 (No. 14), which were fed upon this food-plant were also whitish
 when young, while those that lived progressed in the direction of
 yellow ; so that the most mature was an intermediate variety at the
 time of its death. It is probable that the larvae of Series V may have
 also changed in the same direction if they had lived.
    It is noteworthy that the strong hereditary influence in the direc
 tion of yellow, which we should suppose existed in Series V (because
 of the colour of the parent larvae), depends chiefly upon the male
 parent ; and how far this element asserts itself in opposition to the
 other sex is quite unknown in this class of experiment.                Indeed, a
 large number of data of this kind might be valuable in gauging the
 relative strengths of the sexes in this form of heredity, but the
 present data are far too limited to be regarded as a serious contri
 bution to this aspect of the subject.
             3. The General Results      of the Breeding Experiments.
    It is now necessary to consider how far the questions suggested at
 the beginning of this paper have received answers from the experi
 ments which have been detailed above.
    (1.) With regard to the first question, it is,          I think, certain that
the larval tendencies towards certain colours are transmitted, as was
proved by the fact that the parent larvae had very strong tendencies
towards the whitish variety, while in the next generation only a
single yellowish form appeared out of seventy-five larvae.                 On the
other    hand,   there  was   conclusive    evidence   of the  modified  tendency
towards white in the offspring following the change wrought in the
parents by food-plants with strong tendencies.             Thus, although food-
plants such as 8. rubra (tending strongly towards yellow) did not
produce yellow varieties, yet the larvae were, as a rule, yellower than
in the case of the parents.            There was no difference between the
parents     and   offspring   in  the   results of food-plants which tended
strongly towards white,        these  being strong enough to overcome any
ordinary hereditary tendencies.           The results obtained by comparing
the different   series  together  are  less   conclusive, but it is unfortunate
that a really satisfactory number of larvae was only obtained in one
case (Series III), the others being insufficient to afford any very con
vincing comparison.          The comparison between Series I and          III was
certainly,   as far  as  it went, in  favour    of a stronger tendency    towards

154          Mr. E. B. Poulton.         Colour-relation letween     the  [Feb. 4,
white in the former series, such       as we should expect from the parentage.
 Series   II  is the one about which there is so much obscurity, but its
results were rather irregular when compared together and with those
of the other series. In Series V we should expect a greater pre
dominance of the yellowish tendency, if the male parent is of equal
importance with the female in this respect, but the data were very
insufficient.
    But it must be clearly understood that the question is really settled,
because of the wonderfully uniform results of the comparison between
parents and offspring as a whole, in which comparison we are dealing
 with strong and definite tendencies        ; while in the   case of the offspring
we are considering           delicate differences between such tendencies,
which are obviously much more difficult to detect and need far larger
data for their accurate determination.
    (2.) As to the second question,         I think it may be said that con
clusive experimental        proof   has  been  afforded of the theory brought
                                   —
forward in my last paper that the colour of the leaf, and not its
substance when eaten, is the agent which influences the larval
colours.      It seems to me that this is proved by the breeding experi
ments in Series       III, in which the larvae from the same batch of eggs
were   whitish    intermediate and white after being respectively fed upon
S. viminalis and upon leaves of the same plant sewn so that only the
under sides were visible (Nos. 6, 7, and 8).
    On the other hand an intermediate variety was produced by feeding
a larva from another batch of eggs upon similar leaves sewn so as
to expose the upper sides.            (Series V, No. 1.) The same thing is
proved by a comparison of two sets of larvae from the same batch
of eggs, fed respectively upon S. triandra and upon the leaves of the
same plant from the under sides of which the whitish bloom had been
removed.
    Concerning the food-plants, about which the evidence was con
flicting, the experiments have in some cases helped to clear up the
difficulties.    The greatest of these difficulties concerned S. viminalis
and S. triandra, but in the latter case there really was no confliction
of evidence, as Mr. Boscher's white larvaB were found upon the very
similar but much whiter S. alba. As to S. viminalis, the difficulty
does not at first sight appear to be cleared up by the breeding experi
ments, but       I  will defer its consideration until after detailing my
experience with captured larvae, for what            I believe to be the correct
solution presented itself to me from the results of this part of the
investigation.       The experiments upon crab produced exactly the same
results as in 1884 : this will hIso be considered later.             With regard
to other food-plants, the view I previously expressed that S. Smithiana
tends to produce whitish intermediate               varieties, is on the whole
supported,      and    so  also  in the  case  of  S. babylonica, which as I

 1886.]    Larva of Smerinthus ocellatus and its Food-plants.             155
suggested, is similar in its effects to S. rubra.      The effects of various
plants hitherto untried have also been observed as a result of the
experiments and work in the field.
    As to the occurrence of individual variation in larvae from the same
batch of eggs and fed upon the same food-plants, it is now quite
certain that such variation may take place, but any considerable
divergence    is very exceptional.
    Thus in the twenty-three larvae bred in 1884, there was practi
cally no individual variation, while in 1885 there were only eight
instances out of seventy-five larvae, and in none of these instances
did the variation amount to more than a remove of one place from that
which contained the largest number of larvae, and which therefore
represented the normal result of the food-plant for each particular
experiment.       In such a calculation the differences between the
larval colours are arranged in five classes, i.e., white, whitish inter
mediate, intermediate,       yellowish intermediate, and yellow.          The
difference between any two of these is very small, and hence it is
seen how entirely insignificant was the amount of individual varia
tion even in the few cases in which it occurred.        In one instance only
was there a variation on both sides of the normal result, i.e., in
 Series  III,  Nos.   11, 12, 13, where    seven larvae fed upon S. cinerea
 became intermediate       in one case, yellowish intermediate in five
cases, and yellow in one case.          Here there is a difference of two
 places between    the extremes,   but one  larva only varied in each direc
tion, while five remained normal.         Thus, although this is by far the
most striking instance of individual variation met with in about a
hundred bred larvae in 1884 — 1885, it is by no means extreme, and
cannot alone explain such excessive variations as have been met
with in the field out of about an equal number of instances.          I refer
especially to the instance recorded in my last paper (p. 302), in which
a bright yellowish variety was found upon apple, the divergence from
the normal result being as wide as possible (five places). Another
almost equally striking instance was met with this year (as will be
recorded) upon 8. cinerea in the field, one larva being whitish inter
mediate and four others yellowish.         Here the divergence amounts to
four places, and compares in an interesting way with the lesser
divergence in the larger number of larvae bred upon the same plant.
A divergence equal to that upon S. cinerea was recorded in my last
paper (p. 301) upon S. ferruginea, one larva being yellowish and three
whitish intermediate.       It is possible or even likely that considerable
divergence is occasionally       caused by individual variation, but that
thij is not the only or indeed the chief explanation of the few in
stances of extreme divergence recorded, is proved by the fact that
such variation only occurs when the probabilities are greatly in
favour of correspondingly different hereditary tendencies, and that

 156        Mr.  E. B. Poulton.      Colour-relation between the    [Feb. 4,
 a much     greater uniformity prevails when the larvae are bred from
 the same batch of eggs. The former argument is enforced by the
 fact that the captured divergent larvae are sometimes of different
 age (and therefore probably of different parentage) from the normal
 larvffi upon the same tree.       It must be clearly understood that in
                                                       I
 speaking of these extreme divergences in the field, am not alluding to
 such instances as Mr. Boscher's eighteen yellow larvss upon S. viminalis,
 or my own instances of yellow larvae upon crab.        I believe that these
 are to be interpreted in another way which will be explained later.
 There are altogether three factors which determine by their relative
 predominance the colour of these larvee: (1) the tendency produced
 by the food-plant ; (2) the hereditary larval tendency ; (3) individual
 variation.    (It does not signify for the present purpose whether the
 third factor is a definite and independent tendency, or merely a vari
 able disturbance of a normal equilibrium between the first and second
 factors, or an irregular recurrence to the influences of earlier genera
 tions.)    Of these three factors the third has been shown to be com
 paratively unimportant, while many extreme exceptions are explicable
 by the second.     But I shall show later that the first factor may also
 produce variable results in the case of the same food-plant, and it is
 to such a cause that we must refer the interpretation of the conflicting
 testimony concerning the effects of S. viminalis, Ac.      At the outset it
 would be unlikely that the other two factors could have produced the
 exceptions (upon 8. viminalis, &c.), because of their number and
 uniformity upon certain varieties of the food-plant. (See Mr. Meklola's
 account of Mr. Boscher's captures, pages 241 and 306 of the English
 translation of Weismann's" Studies in the Theory of Descent," Part II.)
 I was very interested to find that two of the bred larva possessed the
 red spots.    In my last paper  I   pointed out (p. 309) that the occur
 rence of the spots upon the yellowish variety only was an "argument
 against the conclusion that these effects are in any way due to the
food-plants." It was, therefore, very satisfactory to find a spotted
larva which did not advance beyond the intermediate variety, and
which at an earlier stage was even whiter. (Series III, No. 17.) The
other instance was in accordance with the observation (which was
universal until the above recorded instance appeared)             that the
spots arc always found upon yellow varieties, for out of about a
hundred bred larvae in 1884 and 1885, there was only one yellow
variety, and this, with one exception, was the only red spotted larva.
But if the spots were always necessarily connected with one variety,
this would not prove that there could be no larval colour modifica
tions, depending on the colour of the food-plant (in fact nothing can
do away with this conclusion now that it has so firm a basis of experi
mental proof). There are many reasons for thinking that the ancestral
form of the larva was yellow, brightly spotted, and ornamented

     188b\]     Larva of Smerintlms ocellatus and its Food-plants.          157
     in other ways which are suggested in the larval ontogeny.             (See
     "Proc. Ent.'Soc. London," 1885, Part II, August, pp. 290—296.)
     The newly hatched larvae are always brightly yellowish even when fed
    upon apple. The particular form of protection now gained by the
    larva, by a resemblance to the foliage of its food-plant, has involved
    the laying aside of this ornamentation,         but some of its features
     occasionally appear (by reversion),    and when  this is the case they are
     associated in nearly all cases with the ancestral ground-colour.      It is
     possible  that  the  differences of   ground-colour which   are  now    de
    pendent on the food-plant arose independently, and persisted for a
    long time as ordinary cases of dimorphism or polymorphism,              and
    that their relation to the colour of the food-plant was determined by
    natural selection at a much later date. But although the differences
    may have commenced in this way, they did not probably reach any
    thing like their present condition until they came to depend on the
    food-plant, for without such a relation the colours would often render
    the larva conspicuous instead of protecting it.
       4. Observations in the Field upon Larvae of S. ocellatus during 1885.
        The larva were very abundant last year and the results were more
    uniform than in lfc84. An account of all the captured linee is given
    below.
        August 2nd. — Upon Salix rubra in some fields by the River Cher-
    well, near Oxford, seven nearly full-grown larvae and one small in
    the fourth    stage, which was a bright yellowish variety.          Of the
    former number four were bright yellowish varieties, and three were
    well on the yellow side of intermediate, almost good yellow varieties.
    Also upon 6'. cinerea in the same locality, one nearly adult larva
    which was a good yellow variety. Also upon a small tree of S. baby-
   lonica in a garden at Oxford (the same tree upon which seven larvae
   were found in 1884; see "Proc. Roy. Soc.," No. 237, 1885, pp. 301
   and 302), one nearly full-grown larva decidedly on the yellow side of
• an intermediate
                       variety but not strongly yellowish.
                    —
       August 3rd. Upon S. viminalis on the River Cherwell, near Ox
   ford, three larvae in the last stage (upon the same tree) of which one
   was nearly adult and rather yellowish, but not more than an inter
   mediate variety ; while the other two were much less advanced in the
   last stage, and were whitish varieties.
       August 4/A. — Upon S. rubra by the Cherwell (as above, August 2),
   two nearly adult bright yellowish larvae.
       August 9th. — Upon 8. rubra by the Cherwell (as above), one nearly
  adult bright yellowish larva.          Also upon S. cinerea in the same
  locality, two almost full-fed larvae which were good yellow varieties.
  Also upon S. linearis in the University Parks, one larva which was
   oerhaps slightly on the yellow side of an intermediate variety.

    August 16th. — Upon    S. rubra by the Cherwell (as above), one nearly
  adult bright yellowish larva.        Also upon S. cinerea in the same
 locality two  nearly  adult  larvae  (on the name bush), of which one was
 slightly on the whitish side of an intermediate variety, while the
 other was a rather bright yellowish variety.        Also upon S. triandra
 in the same locality one almost full-fed bright yellowish larva.
    August 23rd. — Upon S. Smithiana at Binsey upon the Isis, near
 Oxford, one nearly adult larva on the whitish side of an intermediate
 variety.   Also upon S. triandra in the same locality, one nearly adult
 bright yellowish variety.        Also upon S. triandra upon the Isis at
 Medley Weir near Oxford, one bright yellowish larva which had just
 entered the last stage.
    August 2bth. — Upon S. rubra (Cherwell) three small larvfe towards
 the end of the third stage, all strongly yellowish varieties, but differ
 ing somewhat in intensity.
    August 30th. — Upon S. triandra close to the bridge at Ferry
 Hincksey, near Oxford, one nearly adult larva which was a good
yellowish variety, but rather whitish on the back. Also upon ordinary
 apple in a garden at Oxford one very white variety at the end of the
fourth stage (changing its skin).
    September 11th and 12th. — Upon a variety of S. alba with small
 narrow- leaves, having smooth greenish under sides ; in a dry part of
the bed of the river at Visp, Switzerland, two full-fed strong yellow
varieties (although not the strongest because of the want of a distinct
yellow tinge to the under surface). Both had the very sharply marked
and distinct white stripes which are often found on larvae with this tint
of ground-colour.     Also September 12th, near the stream which flows
through Brigue, Switzerland, three larvae upon different species of
sallow.    Upon a variety of S. alba very similar to the above ( ? S.
vitellina), an adult intermediate        variety rather strongly tending
towards the yellowish form upon its dorsal surface, and having very
distinct white stripes, such as were possessed by the larvae from Visp.
Upon S. incana, a yellow variety of the larva, looking as though it.
would have been very yellow if it had been in a healthy condition.
But the larva, which was well in the last stage, was much stunted and
in very bad health, having been attacked probably by some parasite,
and pierced in twenty-eight places.          Also upon S. alba (the leaves
much like the common English form), a larva which was advanced in
the last stage, and an exceedingly white variety — the palest I have
ever seen.    There was a little yellow on the under side, but it was
not at all the tint of the yellowish varieties, and indicated no transition
in that direction. The larva did not seem to be very healthy.             It
possessed in common with all very strong white varieties a distinct
trace of the subdorsal line for its whole length, and there was a trace
of the darkening for a border to a " ninth stripe " upon the third

  188fi.]    Larva of Smerinthus ocellatus and its Food-plants.            159
  thoracic segment in front of and parallel with the more distinct and
          "                "
  larger    eighth stripe    upon the first abdominal segment.
                     5. Experiments    upon captured Larvce.
     Being engaged in the extensive           breeding experiments already
  described,  I did not attempt much with the captured larvae, especially
 as nearly all of the latter were full-grown when found.        The strongly
 yellowish larva in the fourth stage, found August 2nd on Salix rubra,
  was put upon apple on August 3rd, when it was 24 mm. long.                On
 August 27th it was 51 mm. long, and was much affected by the
 change of food, being an intermediate variety, or perhaps slightly on
 the yellowish side of intermediate.         It was interesting to note that
 the change of colour affected the shagreen dots, which became white,
 having been formerly yellow       as in all strongly yellowish varieties.
   6. Conclusions arrived at by the Consideration of the captured Larvce :
                  The Reconciliation of conflicting Evidence.
     The colours of the captured larva were wonderfnlly uniform for
 their respective food-plants. Salix rubra produced a large number
 of yellow larvae, and others which were but little removed from
 yellow. The larva upon S. babylonica resembled these latter.               8.
 triandra also produced yellow larvae, and so with S. cinerea (with one
 exception). There was but little confliction in the results of S. vimi-
 nalis, and S. Smithiana produced a normal larva, and the colours of
 the Swiss larvae (with the exception of that upon S. incana) might
 hare been almost exactly anticipated by investigating the colour of
 the under sides of the leaves. Thus there are fewer exceptions than in
 the larvae captured in 1884, and yet among them was one instance
 which suggested to me the explanation of those conflicting results
 which have been the chief obstacle to the complete acceptance of my
theory of the colour-relation between food-plant and larva ;          I mean
especially   the immense     difference  between   Mr. Boscher's experience
(quoted by Mr. Meldola as above referred to) and my own with regard
to S. viminalis.      The larva which suggested the interpretation was
the yellowish     intermediate     variety found August 9th upon Salix
 linearis. I had much wished to find a larva upon this foreign species
of Salix, of which there are many fine specimens in the Oxford
University Parks ; for I had noticed for over a year that the under
sides of the leaves were more densely covered with down and whiter
than any species of Salix I had ever seen, and even more so than
npple.    The upper sides of the leaves were dark-green and glossy, and
the leaves were narrow, pointed, and very small, and extended at right
angles to the twigs.      The leaves resembled those of S. viminalis, only
they   were  much   smaller  and whiter underneath.      I thought that such
a tree must produce the most extreme white varieties, and I was

 160       Mr. E. B. Poulton.        Co low- relation between the   [Feb. 4,
greatly   astonished     at the colour of the single larva found upon it.
                                   I
Thinking over sneh a result, remembered that the one bright yellow
variety which I had found upon 8. viminalis (on August 11, 1884;
see p. 301 of the above-mentioned         paper) was upon a variety of the
latter plant with very small leaves, while the white larvae were found
upon    the large-leaved variety which is the common one at Oxford.
Shortly afterwards, through the kindness of Mr. Boscher and Mr.
William White, I had the opportunity of looking at some twigs of
the trees upon which the eighteen spotted yellow larvae were found
 (see p. 304 of the former paper, &c.).       The trees were the small-leaved
variety, and Mr. Boscher states that all the yellow larvae were found
upon such food-plants.         Then again   I remembered that in the case
of the very bright yellow variety found upon crab (var. acerba) on
August 14th, 1884 (see former paper p. 301), the latter tree had very
small leaves.      Finally, Salix incana at Brigue possessed leaves which
were very white and downy underneath, but they were very small,
and the larva found upon the tree was yellow.
    All this convergent evidence suggested the following explana
tion.    The   larvae   are only affected by that part of the environment
which is so close to them as to be almost or quite in contact ;
the tint of mature life is (as far as it is caused by the colour of
the food-plant) a resultant of the conflicting tints which have
formed part of the immediate environment of the larva through
out its life, and the ultimate predominance of one larval tint is due
to the relative proportion of the whole larval life during which that
tint predominated in the environment.               This conclusion is also
supported     by the breeding experiments and the experiments upon
captured larvae.        Such being the case, the ultimate whiteness of a
mature larva is largely due to the considerable proportion of its
earlier life which is spent upon the white under sides of the leaves.
(The young       larvae  invariably take up this position.) During this
period white is the only colour in its immediate environment, except
when it is actually engaged in eating, and so may perhaps be affected
to some extent by the colour of the upper sides. But when the larva
reaches a certaiu size and weight, it must in nearly all cases quit this
position and retire to the stem, because the leaf is not strong enough
to bear it without being dragged into an unnatural position, cr
because it is too small to form a background for the larval body.
Therefore the time at which it retires must chiefly depend upon the
size and strength of the leaves.           Having once quitted the small
leaves the larva does not again rest upon them, because they can be
entirely   eaten from the stem, whereas the large leaves cannot be
reached without venturing upon them, and therefore in the latter case,
the chances are in favour of the larva being left upon a partially
eaten large leaf during many of the periods of rest, even at an

1886.]     Larva of Smerinthus ocellatus and its Food-plants.           1(51
advanced    stage. When the larva is smaller and eats much les3 it
remains on the same leaf for many days. But directly the larva rests
on the stem the tints of its immediate environment alter, for they
are then due to the colours of both sides of the leaves and of the stem
itself. The relative predominance of the colours of the two sides of the
leaves depends upon the position of the larva and the arrangement of
the leaves.    But the position of the larva is uniform (except when it
is wandering to a fresh twig), the head being always directed towards
the apex of the stem. Hence in the case of food-plants whose large
leaves regularly droop over from the vertical twigs, or are curved in
the usual way with the concavity downwards, the tints of the under
side still predominate after the larva has retired to the stem, and they
will still form almost the only effective colour as was the case in
earlier periods.      When, however, the leaves hang irregularly or
 spread out horizontally from horizontal twigs, the colours of the two
 sides may be equally important, or may depend (in the latter case)
 upon the side of twig on which the larva rests.
    This explanation of course will apply but little to leaves of which
 the upper and under surfaces are approximately similar in colour,
 and accordingly there is very little conflicting testimony from such
 food-plants (Salix rubra, S. babylonica, S. triandra), and such as there
 is, is mainly explicable by variations in the other two factors which
 go to influence larval colour. But even in these plants there is some
 difference between the colours of the two sides which would have an
 effect upon the larvae, as was proved by the experiment in which the
 bloom was rubbed off in the case of S. triandra.       But in the case of
 leaves with strongly white under sides such an explanation accounts for
 all the conflicting evidence met with in the field (due to this factor and
 recognised by the uniformity cf results from trees with leaves of a
 particular size and arrangement). Thus when I expressed the opinion
 that Salix viminalis produces white larvae       I  was thinking of our
 common long-leaved variety. The leaves of this variety often grow
  6 inches long near Oxford, and quite three-quarters          of an inch
 wide.    Such leaves would retain a larva until the end of the fourth
  stage, and often far into the last stage.        Furthermore the long
 leaves droop over very regularly from the higher vertical twigs upon
  which the larvae are generally found, and so present their under
 sides to the stem and to a larva resting upon it. On the other hand,
 the leaves of the other variety are much smaller (from memory I
 should say that they are often about an inch and a- half long and three-
 eighths of an inch wide), and often hang in irregular wisps from the
 more vertical twigs, or droop vertically from the more horizontal
  branches.    Thus such a variety of leaf would retain the larva for a
  comparatively short time, and after its retirement to the stem the
  colour of the immediate environment would be as largely due to the

  1 62     Mr. E. B. Poultcm.       Colour-relation   between   the  [Feb. 4,
 upper as the under side. Hence the effect of the narrow and small-
 leaved S. viminalis in producing yellow larvae, and the exceedingly
 white-leaved   (under sides) Salix linearis in producing a yellowish
 intermediate   larva.     The influence of S. cinerea (in the direction
 of yellow) is probably in a great measure due to the same facte,
 for its small leaves are often downy underneath, and are always
 much whiter than those of 8. rubra, &c.            The much stronger in
 fluence of S. Smithiana towards white is probably due to its much
 larger but very similar leaves.          It is likely that some of the
 irregular results referred to other factors may be explained in this
 way.    Thus it was very obvious that the leaves of S. ferruginea (?),
 upon which very differently coloured larvae were found (p. 301
 of the former paper), varied very much in size, those on the lower
 branches looking like rather narrow leaves of S. cinerea, the upper
 ones being exactly like those of S. Smithiana ; but in such an isolated
 case it is not possible to determine certainly which of the factors
 caused the exception, or whether it was due to a combination of
 causes.   I think it is unlikely that any great difference could be
cansed by a slight variation of habit in larvre, i.e., in the period at
which different individuals would retire to the stem from leaves of the
 same size.   It is probable that the habit is very uniform, and always
leads the larvae to remain on the leaves as long as the size and
strength of the latter will permit them to do so. In Salix alba the
question is complicated by the fact that after the larva retires (early
in this case) to the stem, the whiteness of the environment will
partially depend upon nearness to the apices of the twigs, for the
upper sides of the young leaves are white as well as the under sides.
The exceedingly strong influence of apple is readily explicable by the
considerations advanced above ; for the leaves are large, broad, and
strong, and will take the weight of a larva advanced in the last stage
without bending.         The single larva found upon apple in 1885
 (August 30th) was resting before changing its skin for the last time
on tho under side of the leaf, and I have often before found the large
larvae in the same position.   After the larva retires to the stem the apple
leaves form broad curved white surfaces, which everywhere environ
the (presumably)      sentient part of its body, which is always directed
during rest towards the apex of the twig. Upon all the varieties of
food-plant, and especially upon apple, the larva tends to rests upon
the young and vigorous twigs which stand out from the trees and
bear fewer larger leaves at wider intervals, and with more regular
arrangement than those upon the older wood below.             Thus the larva
gets   the  maximum     effect from  the  under  sides of the  leaves after it
has retired to the stem. This explanation also helps towards clearing
up the difficulty about the irregular effect of crab.          Although the
under sides of the leaves are smooth and green, they are generally of a

  1886.]   Larva of Smerinthus ocellatus and its Food-plants.        163
                      I
 whitish-green, and think that a white larva is better protected when
 resting on the nnder side of the leaf than a yellow larva would be,
 although this is often true in the case of trees which are known to
 produce yellow larvae.    Again the leaves are large as a rnle, and so
 the larvae are advanced when they rest on the stem, and even then the
 arrangement of the leaves and the position of the larva cause the under
 side to contribute most colour to the immediate environment.     I have
 already mentioned that the bright yellow, red-spotted larva captured
 in 1884 upon crab, var. acerba, was upon a tree with exceedingly
 small leaves. Furthermore, in this variety the leaves are extremely
 variable in size upon different parts of the tree. But although the
 conditions mentioned above may have conduced towards the fact that
 my bred larvae fed upon this plant became so white, I cannot but
 think that snch a result was largely due to their strong hereditary
tendency towards this colour, for the crab cannot compare with
ordinary apple in the whiteness of the under sides of the leaves, nor
is it in this respect equal to Salix viminalis, Smithiana, or even
cinerea.    I think that this food-plant more than any other requires
farther experimental work with larvae of all varieties of hereditary
tendency, but it is very unfortunate that the larvae do not seem to
thrive upon the plant, at any rate in confinement.
    Another great difficulty is,   I think, completely explained by the
above-mentioned     consideration.    I  mean the fact that bred larvae
tending strongly towards white, became intermediate in 1884 and in
many cases in 1885 when fed upon the large-leaved variety of Salix
viminalis (for I have always fed my larvae upon this variety).        In
order to obtain the best leaves I have to walk to the Cherwell and
take a boat ; and as this is not always convenient, I bring home and
give to the larvae a great quantity. The leaves being very long and
crowded in the glass cylinders in which the larvae are kept, their
natural arrangement is entirely altered, so that the upper sides are
presented to the larvae to a much greater extent than happens on the
tree.    The result is to affect the environment of the larvae upon the
leaves as well as those upon the stem, for in the former case the
upper sides of other leaves must be often crowded close up to the
nnder side of the one upon which a larva is resting.       Furthermore,
the leaves do not last so long without withering as upon the trees in
the open air, and therefore the larvae are frequently compelled to
wander on to fresh leaves, and in so doing they must be affected
by the colour of the upper as well as the under sides. In the future
it would be well to breed some larvae in large cases which would hold
the twigs without overcrowding, and would permit the leaves to fall
naturally. In the case of apple the arrangement of the leaves has
not been disturbed in the cylinders, because I can get the twigs in
my garden, and because the leaves are of a more manageable shape.

 164        Mr. E. B. Poulton.       Colour-relation  between the    [Feb. 4,
 It  is possible that the same causes have helped to produce yellower
 results than are normal in the breeding experiments with Salix alba
 and 8. Smithiana, for these leaves have been somewhat disturbed,
 although not nearly so much as in the case of S. viminalis.         I do not
 doubt the validity of this explanation for the latter plant, and the
 results of experiments are thus satisfactorily interpreted which have
 been sources of difficulty and uncertainty since the summer of 1884.
 This explanation also clears up what I felt to be a great difficulty in
 my former paper when I wrote the words (page 314)
                                                             " it is
                                                                     only the
 part of the environment imitated which produces any effect, e.g., the
 under sides of the leaves in the case of S. ocellatus, and yet the
 environment,     of course, includes both surfaces."   I have shown above
 that the effective part of the environment — the immediate environ
 ment — does not in many cases include both surfaces, but either
 entirely or chiefly the under surface, i.e., that which is ipso facto
 imitated, and when it does include the other surface for a sufficiently
 long period, a different effect is produced (in the case of leaves with
 differently coloured sides). It is therefore obvious that when we speak
of the tendency of a plant to produce a certain colour, we mean a
tendency from the size and arrangement of the leaves to encournge a
larval position in which the effective colour of the environment is
only contributed by one leaf surface, or, on the other hand, a tendency
to change the larval position into one in which both surfaces may
become equally effective, or, again, into one in which either of them
may predominate.           In this explanation of what is meant by the
tendency     of  a  plant,  I am, of course, especially referring to those
with leaves having white under sides ; but it will probably apply to
some extent in nearly all cases, for there is always some difference
between the two sides of the leaves.
    There is one other comparison between the captured and bred
larvae   which is a source of difficulty.         The exceedingly uniform
results upon Salix rubra in the field (I have found altogether twenty-
two larvoe, of which eighteen were yellow, three yellowish interme
diate, and one intermediate) render it more than probable that the
plant has possessed an influence sufficiently powerful to reverse a
larval tendency in the direction of white (for it is very unlikely that
in all the eighteen instances of a maximum result the larva happened
to tend in the same direction as the food- plant) ; and yet in the
breeding experiments, out of nine larvae eight were yellowish interme
diate and one intermediate ; and thus in no case has the food-plant
completely overcome a strong tendency (1884) or a somewhat modified
tendency (1885) towards white.
    I have  thought that part of this difference (also observable in the
cases of S. babijlonica and S. triandra) may be due to the fact that the
tops of the glass cylinders in which the larvae are bred, are covered

   1886.]    Larva of Smerin thus ocellatus and its Food-plants.            165
   with white muslin, which probably,         therefore, produces some slight
   effect on the     larvae.   Again    the larvae in the field are probably
  affected   by the amount of light,          and especially direct sunlight,
   which   must brighten the colours          of their -environment.     I have
  commonly found them on S. rubra (as in the other trees) upon
  the higher younger branches standing out from the trees, and espe
  cially during the past summer upon twigs that have been allowed
  to grow out from the tops of hedgerow sallows ; and I have also
  noticed that they are better protected in these strong lights because
  of the brightness of their own colour than in the shadows of the
  lower and more crowded leaves. The bred larvae have never been
  so freely exposed to light, and although the small leaves of the food-
  plant do not become much disarranged (probably hardly any effect
  would be produced if they were), yet the crowding certainly helps to
 shade the leaves and to diminish the brightness of their colours.
  (During the past summer I have kept the larvae under a north
  window to protect them as far as possible from the excessive heat.)
  It is very probable that some of the difference is to be explained in
  this way, but most of it is no doubt due to the hereditary tendencies
 of my bred larvae, which were always towards white, while this ten
 dency is probably less common than the other by the banks of streams
  (see former paper, p. 310).          It will be very interesting in future
 experiments to breed the larvae under yellow and under white glass.
 Next year    I  hope to be able to make such experiments.
                  7.   The Whole of the Evidence Summarised.
     I have  arranged all the results hitherto obtained in a table which is
 printed below. The only important omission is the hereditary tendency
 of the bred larvae, and this would have rendered the table too compli
 cated, for there were four different series in 1885.         It will, however,
 be remembered       that all the larvae bred in 1881 tended strongly towards
 white, while nearly all of them in 1885 possessed the same tendency in a
 slightly modified form. All the nnmbers without reference marks refer
to my own observations or experiments conducted at Oxford; while
special marks call attention to the work of other observers, or to my
own work in other localities. The 204 instances given below comprise
all the cases in which the colour of the larva and the name of the
food-plant have been noted, either in breeding or in field observations.
     Only in the case of the white varieties captured upon ordinary
apple have I ventured to allude to the larvae under the vague term
" very common," because such has been my experience and that of
other observers, although no list of instances has been kept, and
therefore no number can be quoted.            Had I left the space blank it
would have conveyed an entirely wrong impression of a very general

nature and     amount  of the evidence for the conclusion that the
larva of Smerinthus ocellatus maintains a colour- relation with the
food-plant upon which it was hatched, adjustable within the limits of
a single life, and that the predominant colour of the food-plant
itself is the stimulus which calls up a corresponding larval colour.
This may seem to be a long paper to prove the existence of such a
relation for a single species, but it must be remembered that in
accepting the conclusion now arrived at, we are admitting the exist-
once of an entirely new resource in the various schemes of larval
protection by resemblance to the environment, and one which stands
on a very different level from all the others ; in these the gradual
working of natural selection has finally produced a resemblance —
either general or special — to something which is common to all the
food-plants of the larva, or to some one or more of them, the larva
being less protected upon the remainder ; but in this case the same
gradual process has finally given the larva a power which is (rela
tively) immediate in its action, a power which enables the organism
itself to answer with corresponding colours the differences which
obtain between its various food-plants. And the action differs no
less from the superficially similar cases of much more rapid changes
in the colour of other organisms (amphibia, fish, Ac.) corresponding
to the changing colours of their environment, for in such organisms
the external colours act as a stimulus which, through a nervous circle,
modifies the condition of existing pigments ; while in the larva it
is the amounts and kinds of vegetal pigments made nse of and
larval pigments deposited that are affected. The influence, in fact,
makes itself felt by affecting the absorption      and production of
pigments rather than their modification when formed ; and such a
method of gaining protection is, as far as we yet know, unique in the
animal kingdom. And snch a power is not confined to the species in
which its existence has been to some extent completely proved.
There are already proofs that many others can maintain a similar
colour-relation (see my former paper, and the references given by
Mr. Meldola in his translation to Weismann's " Studies in the Theory
of Descent," Part II), and    I  am sure that careful observation will
reveal many slight and protective differences among larvae of the
same species when found upon differently-coloured food-plants, and
will prove that this power is not at all uncommon among the great

 1886.]       On the Polarisation   of Light   hy Iceland Spar.       173
 body of lepidopterous larvae which adopt the methods of protective
resemblance.      Furthermore, it is very probable, as suggested by
Professor Meldola, that the colour of the environment will prove to
act as one of the determining causes of the larval colours ultimately
assumed by the individuals of dimorphic species (which are generally
green and brown in lepidopterous larvae).        To show in what a light
this colour-relation appears to Dr. August Weismann (whose essay
upon "The Markings of Caterpillars" first induced me to work at
these organisms),     I quote the following sentences from a letter I
received from him after sending him my paper in the " Entomological
 Society's Transactions," Part I, April, 1884, in which this subject is
alluded to : —
    " Dagegen verstehe ich nicht ganz, wie sie sich den ' phytophagic
                                      '
character    of the ground-colour        entstanden    denken.   Ich habe
augenblicklich mein Buch nicht zur Hand u. kann deshalb die Note
 von Meldola nicht nachsehen, erinnere mich auch derselben nicht.
 Sie scheinen zu glauben, dass die Nahrung der Raupe bis zu einem
gewissen Grad ihre Farbe direkt hervorrufe. Ich ware sehr begierig,
 einen Beweis dafiir kenneu zu lernen.        Ich kann mir nicht denken,
 wie dies moglich sein, solle jedoch weiche ich den Thatsachen ! Ich bin
begierig, zu erfahren, ob Sie solche inzwischen gefundon haben."
    I venture to hope that the facts spoken of by Professor Weismann
are now satisfactorily demonstrated, not as proving the former theory
to which he alludes, that the food itself causes the change of colour
after it has been eaten by the larva, but as proving the existence of
the more subtle form of influence described in the present and in my
last paper.    At the same time I must express my sense of the great
extent to which I am indebted to Professor Meldola, to whom we owe
the former theory, for without the most suggestive editorial notes to
bis translation of Weismann's work, and the experiments undertaken
by Mr. Boscher at his request, it is most improbable that the present
investigation would ever have been begun.

       Surface of a Crystal of Iceland Spar." By Sir John
       CoNrOY, Bart., M.A., of Keble College, Oxford. Communi
       cated by Professor G. G. Stokes, P.R.S.                  Received
       January 27, 1886.
                                 (Plats  2.)
   In   the year 1819  Sir David Brewster communicated       to the Royal
Society ("Phil. Trans.," 1819, p. 145) an account of some experiments
he had made on the polarisation of light by reflection from the surface

174               Sir J. Conroy.    On the Polarisation  of     [Feb. 4,
of double refracting substances, and showed that Malus' statement
with regard to Iceland spar was incorrect.
    Malus said that Iceland spar behaves towards the light it reflects
like a common transparent body, and that its polarising angle is about
56° 30', and that whatever be the angle comprehended between the
plane of incidence and the principal section of the crystal, the ray
reflected by the first surface is always polarised in the same manner
("Theorie de la Donble Refraction," pp. 240, 241).
    Some years later Seebeck (" Pogg. Ann.," vol. xxi, p. 290 ; vol. xxii,
p. 196 ; vol. xxxviii, p. 276 ; voL xl, p. 462) made a number of very
accurate observations on the same subject, and in 1835 and 1837
Neumann published in " Pogg. Ann.," vol. xl, 497, and vol. xlii, p. 1,
an account of further experiments that he had made on the reflection
of light by Iceland spar.
    He begins his second paper by a brief summary of the results
obtained by Brewster and Seebeck.       " Brewster found that the
                                                                    angle
of complete polarisation for calcspar depends on the position of the
reflecting surface relatively to the axis, and upon the position of its
 principal section to the plane of reflection ; he also found that
 when the reflecting surface is covered with a liquid, the plane of
 polarisation of the completely polarised ray does not coincide with the
 plane of reflection, but makes a smaller, or greater, angle with this ;
 when a cleavage-face of calcspar is covered with oil of cassia this
 deviation may amount to 90°.       The knowledge of these phenomena
 has only been further advanced in recent times.      Dr. Seebeck has so
 followed out, by means of most accurate determinations, the influence
 of optically uniaxial crystals upon complete polarisation, that the
 angle of incidence at which this occurs can be determined as accu
 rately beforehand as it can by Brewster's law in the case of uncrystal-
 lised bodies.   Seebeck also discovered that the deviation of the plane
 of polarisation from the plane of reflection, which Brewster had
 observed, also occurs when the ray of light falls directly from air on
 to the surface of the crystal."
     Seebeok's observations having been mainly directed to the deter
 mination of the angle of polarisation, Neumann's object was to deter
 mine the azimuth of the plane of polarisation of the reflected light.
 They both assumed, contrary to Fresnel's hypothesis, that the density
 of the ether in the two media was the same and the elasticity different.
 and therefore that the plane of vibration coincided with the plane of
  polarisation, and starting with this assumption succeeded in showing
 that, the observed and calculated results were in close accordance.
     Seebeck and Neumann only repeated a portion of Brewster's experi
  ments, and no one except Sir David Brewster appears to have made
  any determinations of the angles and azimuths of polarisation when
  the spar was in contact with media other than air.

 1886.]         Light by Reflection from Iceland Spar.               175
    Professor Stokes very kindly called my attention to these experi
 ments of Sir David Brewster, and pointed out that as they had never
 been published in detail, and had not been repeated by anyone else,
 it was desirable that farther observations should be made on this
 subject. The experiments, the results of which I have the honour of
 submitting to the Royal Society, were undertaken at Professor Stokes'
 suggestion, and in carrying them out   I  had the benefit of his advice.
    The apparatus used was essentially the same as that employed by
 Seebeck ; the divided circle of the goniometer was, however, horizontal,
 and not vertical, as in Seebeck's instrument, and the arrangement for
 keeping the reflected ray constantly in the axis of the observing tube,
 whilst the angle of incidence was varied, differed from that employed
by him ; the axes of the stage and of the observing tube were fitted
 with toothed wheels which geared into a double pinion, the diameters
of the wheels being such that the angular velocity of the observing
tube was double that of the stage.
    The goniometer had a vertical stage in addition to the ordinary
horizontal one, which could be moved nearer to and further from
the axis of the instrument, and this stage had four adjusting screws, so
that the front surface could be placed parallel to the axis of rotation.
    A brass plate was clamped to this stage; a short brass tube carrying
an annular toothed wheel at one end, and a divided collar at the other,
fitted into an aperture at the lower end of this plate, and could be
rotated in the plane of the plate by turning a milled head fixed at the
end of a rod, which carried a bevel pinion working into the annular
wheel.
    A brass tube with a collar at one end could be fastened to the
annular wheel by four screws passing through holes in the collar, the
back of the collar and the inner surface of the wheel being portions of
a spherical surface.
    The crystal whose reflective power was to be examined was fixed in
the inner tube, which whs then adjusted by means of the four screws
so that the surface of the crystal was in the plane of rotation, and
then, by altering the position of the vertical stage, the piane of rota
tion brought vertically over the axis of the goniometer.
    The crystal was cemented into the tube with plaster of Paris ; a
little lard was rubbed on the edges of the face which was to be exposed,
and it was placed on a plate of glass with this surface downwards,
and the brass tube, the collar of which had also been greased, placed
round     it,
            and centred by means of a marked card placed under the
glass,  and  plaster of Paris poured in. In one of the earlier experi
ments the crystal was found after a certain number of observations
had been made to have become loose, owing to the plaster having
shrunk away from the tube three holes about mm. in diameter were
                            ;                   2
therefore drilled in the sides of the tube, and no further difficulty was

176                Sir J. Conroy.    On  the Polarisation of     [Feb.  4,
experienced from this cause, as the little projections of plaster which
filled these holes effectually prevented any movement.
    In order to adjust the reflecting surface, a diaphragm with a small
hole in  it was fitted into the eye end of the observing tube, and a lamp
with a flat wick so placed that its image was seen by reflection from
the surface of the crystal, two of the adjusting screws of the tube
being in the horizontal plane (i.e., the plane of incidence).         The
tube was then turned through an angle of 180°, and the reflected
image brought back half way into the centre of the field by altering
the two screws of the tube which were in the plane of incidence, and
the remainder of the distance by means of the screws of the stage,
which, as well as the observing tube, remained clamped to the
horizontal circle whilst this adjustment was being made.
    The tube was then turned back to its original position, and the
adjustment repeated if necessary ; the tube was then turned through
90°, and the second pair of screws altered till the reflected image
remained in the centre of the field whilst the crystal was rotated.
The adjustment was then examined by means of a simple form of
diagonal eye-piece placed in the collimator tube of the goniometer,
consisting of a brass tube with a diaphragm at either end, with a
small aperture in each, and also in the side of the tube ; inside the
tube, and opposite the aperture in the side, a piece of microscopical
cover-glass was fixed at an angle of 45° with the axis of the tube ; the
lamp was placed opposite the aperture in the side of the tube, and
the vertical stage rotated until the light of the lamp reflected from
the thin glass was reflected back by the crystal along the axis of the
eye-piece to the observer ; the tube holding the crystal was then
rotated, and if the spot oE light remained visible whilst the tube made
a complete rotation, the adjustment was considered to have been
correctly made, and the position of the stage was then read on the
horizontal circle of the goniometer, and this measurement taken as
that of perpendicular incidence.
    Several such readings were made, and then the position of the tube
and lamp altered, and several more readings made, and the mean of
these, which usually were close together, taken as the zero for the
angle of incidence.
    Two complete series of observations were made with cleavage-
faces of Iceland spar in air, water, and tetrachloride of carbon, the
water and tetrachloride of carbon being contained by a nearly cylin
drical thin glass vessel (a chemical beaker), which stood on the hori
zontal stage of the goniometer, the tetrachloride being prevented from
evaporating by a layer of water floating on its surface.
    When the reflection took place in air, a paraffin lamp, with a flat
 bnrner placed edgeways (i.e., radially to the goniometer) was used as
the source of light ; when the crystal was in water or tetrachloride

                  Light hy Reflection from Iceland Spar.             177
of carbon, its reflecting power was so much diminished that a moro
intense source of light was necessary, and a magic lantern (a
" sciopticon
               ") was used, a black card with a slit 3-5 mm. wide
being placed in the slide-bolder, and focussed on the surface of the
crystal, care being taken in both cases that the direction of the inci
dent light should coincide as nearly as possible with the axis of the
collimator tube.
    The measurements were made by altering the angle of incidence
and the azimuth of the observing Nicol until the light was reduced to
a minimum, the position of the crystal remaining fixed.
    In order to obtain anything like accurate results with observations
of this kind it is necessary to make a large number of determinations
and take their mean: it was obvious that there were two ways in
which any given number of observations might be grouped, either by
making a good many separate determinations for a few positions of
the crystal, or by making a few observations at a number of different
azimuths ; the latter alternative being the one adopted, two readings
 were made at seventy-two different azimuths of the crystal.
    In the first series the observations started from one of the edges
of the crystal, the tube containing it being turned through 10J after
 each pair of readings ; after thirty-six pairs of readings the crystal
 was turned through 6° 20', and then thirty-six more double readings
 made at intervals of 10q from each other.
    In the second series the observations started from the principal
section, and were also made at intervals of 10° ; the crystal was turned
 through 5° after thirty-six observations had been made, and then
thirty -six more were made, also at intervals of 10°.
    It was thought that by working in this way the results would be
 more independent of each other, and therefore more trustworthy
 than if the readings had been made continuously round the whole
 circle.   The position of the ciystal was determined by placing a
 square on the horizontal stage of the goniometer, and rotating the
 tube carrying the crystal until the edge of the crystal appeared to
 coincide with the vertical edge of the squire, and noting the reading
 of the divided ring attached to the tube ; several such readings were
 made, and the tube and crystal turned through 180° and several more
 observations made, and the mean of these taken as the position in
 which one of the sides of the crystal was vertical (i.e., perpendicular
 to the plane of incidence) ; the position of the principal section could
 then be readily determined as it bisects the obtuse angle, and there
 fore, that angle being one of 101° 55', or nearly 102°, forms an angle
 of about 51° with the adjacent edges.
     The position of the crystal in which the principal section was in
  the plane of incidence and the obtuse summit nearest tbe observer
  was considered the zero position; when the principal section was in

    It   had been intended to make similar measurements with artificial
surfaces cut perpendicular and parallel to the axis of the crystal, and
three pieces of Iceland spar cut respectively parallel to a natural face,

from the natural substance, but that an artificial surface polished
 with chalk behaves very nearly, if not exactly, like a natural one.
     Seebeck's measurements were all made with the crystal in air, and
as the changes in the azimuth of the plane of polarisation, and in
 the value of the polarising angle, for different azimuths of the crystal,
 when such is the case are small, it seemed desirable before making
any measurements with the artificial surfaces cut perpendicular and
 parallel to the axis, to make some determinations with an artificial
surface parallel to a natural face of the crystal when the crystal was
 immersed in water ; this was accordingly done.
    Contrary to the orders that had been given, the edges of the plate
 were cut away by the optician who polished it, and it was therefore
impossible to determine the position of the principal section in the
same manner as that previously employed with the other crystals.
The results were therefore plotted, the divisions of the ring carrying
the crystal being taken as abscissae and the azimuths of the plane of
polarisation of the reflected light as ordinates.                         It was assumed that
the curve for the artificial face would be similar to that for the natural
face, and the points at which the curve cut the x axis were taken
as indicating the position of the principal section, and the azimuths
of the crystal thus determined.                   Table    VIII    gives the results : —

   These results differ considerably from those obtained previously
with a natural face in water (Tables II, IV, and VI), and it therefore
did not appear worth while to make any further experiments with
artificial surfaces, as it seemed certain that the results would be
untrustworthy.
   The difference between the results obtained with this artificial
surface and with a natural surface of the crystal is too great to be
explained by supposing that the artificial surface was not cut absolutely
parallel to the direction of the cleavage, and must therefore be attri
buted to some change produced by the polishing, possibly due to the
                                       "
pressure employed (conf. Seebeck,        Pogg. Ann.," vol. xx, 1830, 27).
   The values of the azimuths and angles of polarisation given in
Tables    I, II, III, IV, V, VI, VII, and VIII, were plotted on sectional
paper   ;  the azimuths of the principal section of the crystal being taken
as abscissae, and the azimuths of the Nicol, and the angles of polarisa
tion — 40°, as the ordinates for the two sets of curves.
   In order to draw the smooth curves,        a piece of plate-glass, rather
smaller than the drawing paper, was mounted in a soft-wood frame,
so that one surface of the glass was flush with the wood, the sectional
paper upon which the observations had been plotted was fixed to the
wood with drawing pins, and a sheet of ordinary drawing paper
placed over it, and fastened in the same manner. This glass drawing
board was then placed in front of a lamp, and smooth curves drawn
by eye in the ordinary manner.
   Professor Stokes pointed out to me that the experimental results
which had been obtained were well suited for reduction by means of
the harmonic analysis, and not only explained the method but himself
reduced the first set of observations made with a cleavage-face in
water.       All the observations were accordingly reduced by this
method ; the determinations        made at azimuths 1°, 11°, Ac, and at
 7° 20', 17° 20', Ac, in the one series, and at 0°, 10°, Ac., and at,
5°, 15°, Ac, in the second series, being kept separate.
    Owing to the fact that the principal section of the crystal is a
plane of symmetry, the periodic series for the development of the
azimuths of the planes of polarisation can contain sines only, and
that for the polarising angles cosines only, including the constant
term ; therefore the coefficients of the cosines in the former case, and
of the sines in the latter, were not calculated, except with the obser
vations made with the artificial surface ; it seemed possible that the
process of polishing might occasion some want of symmetry, and
that therefore it was desirable to calculate the values of the co
efficients for both sines and cosines.
    The observations in one set only having started at zero azimuth, in
the other three there was a small correction to be made in th<*
coefficients for the error thus produced; this was done by multiplying

the coefficients by the secants of 1°, 2°, 3°, 4°, for the orders 1, 2, 3,
and 4, in the first set; by the secants of 2° 40', 5° 20', 8°, and 10° 40'
in the second, and by the secants of 5°, 10°, 15°, and 20° in the
fourth set. This correction only exceeded 1' in sixteen cases, and
attained its maximum valae in the second series of observations made
in carbon tetrachloride, where in the case of the coefficients of sin 20,
sin SO, and cos 20 it amounted to 9' and 8' respectively. •

   Brewster, in his paper in the " Phil. Trans." for 1819, p. 158, says,
" in any given surface when      and A" are the maximum and minimum
                                                A
polarising angles,  viz., in the azimuths of 0° and 90°, the polarising
angle A' at any intermediate aximuth «, may be found by the formula
A'=A       +   sin°«(A"-A)."
  This expression      the same as that given by the harmonic reduc
                               is
tion of the observations set forth in the preceding pages, if we
assume that the smaller terms are due to errors of observation, as in
that case the expression for the polarising angle in air (B) becomes
58°    17'-1° 15'cos20.

    Calling the coefficient of cos 20 x, and the minimum value of the
 polarising angle A, this is (A+x) — a! cos 20, which is identical with
 Brewster's expression, since A" — A is the same as 2x.
    Brewster states that for a rhomboidal surface of calcareous spar
 A"— A 138', whereas the harmonic reduction gives the value as 150',
 which perhaps, considering the) nature of the determinations, is as
 close an agreement as could be well expected.
    Brewster's formula also appears to hold good for the case of Ice
 land spar in water, as the harmonic series for the value of the polar
 ising angle (D) may be taken as 52° 02'— 3° 14'cos20. But with the
 spar in tetrachloride of carbon the agreement no longer holds, as the
 coefficient of cos 40 becomes too large to be neglected, being 1° 12'.
 The determinations made in this strongly refracting liquid were less
 satisfactory than the others, as is shown by the figures in Tables                        III
and VII, but there is hardly sufficient ground for assuming that the
 value of the coefficient of cos 40 is merely due to errors of observation.
    The experiments of which an account had been given confirm the
accuracy of Brewster's observations made with a surface of Iceland
spar in contact with media other than air, and show moreover that,
as Seebeck pointed out, the change in the value of the azimuth of the
 plane of polarisation of the reflected light also occurs, though to 'a
 far less extent, when the crystal is in air, and further, as the refractive
 index of the medium increases, the change in both these values is
greatly augmented.
    The harmonic analysis affords a means of expressing, approximately
at least, both these changes as functions of the azimuth of the principal
section of the crystal, and further shows that when the crystal is
 in air or water, Brewster's formula for the angle of polarisation
expresses the facts of the case.
    The constant term in the expression for the azimuth of the plane of
polarisation of the reflected light being due partly to errors of
aobservation and partly to the index error of the Nicol, and, for the
reason stated by Professor Stokes in the note he has done me the
honour of appending to this paper, the coefficients of the cosines of
odd multiples of 0 in the expressions for the angles of polarisation
being probably due to inaccuracies in the determination, it seems best
to omit these terms (which at any rate are extremely small), so that
we obtain as the final result the following approximate expressions in
the several cases.

    In conclusion must express my thanks to Professor Stokes for his
advice and assistance, and for all the trouble he has taken with
reference to the determinations of which an account is given in this
paper.
                       Note by Professor Stokes, P.R.S.
    On inspecting these numbers we may remark : —
    1. The coefficients of sin 40 in the expressions for the azimuths are
in all cases so small that they can hardly be said to emerge from
errors    of observation.      Since, however, there is no reason to suppose
that such       a term    does   not exist, the coefficients may as well be
retained, as being somewhat more probable than zero would be.
    2. Brewster found that the polarising angles were the same for any
two azimuths differing by 180°, and MacCullagh afterwards deduced
 this result from theoretical       considerations.        If we assume this law a*
 exact, the harmonic         expression  for   the   polarising angle will contain
 no terms involving cosines of odd multiples of 0. Now with one
doubtful exception the coefficients in the above expressions are
insensibly small.          The single exception, where a coefficient has at
 first sight the appearance of being real though small, is that of the
 term involving cos 30 for the observations in tetrachloride of carbon.
 The observations with this liquid were the most uncertain, probably
 from the feebleness of reflection arising from its high refractive index.
 If the differences of the polarising angles for azimuths of the principal
 plane differing by 180° be examined, it will be seen that a coefficient
 amounting in the mean to only 0° 27', and subject to a mean error
 from set to set of 17', can have little claim to be regarded as real.

It   seems best therefore   in this, as well as other cases, to omit the
terms involving cosines of odd multiples of 0.
    3. As regards the observations with the artificial surface in water,
the coefficients of the cosines in the expression for the azimuths and
of the sines in the expression for the polarising angles are insensibly
small, indicating no introduction of asymmetry with respect to the
principal plane arising from the process of polishing. The coefficients
of the cosines of odd multiples of 0 in the second expression are also
insensible.     The constant term in the first expression, representing
(on    the assumption of symmetry with respect to the principal plane)
the index error of the circle carrying the Nicol, agrees almost exactly
with those obtained for the cleavage surfaces in air and water.
    It would seem best then to omit those terms which we have reason
to think are really nil, and which the observations show to be at any
 rate extremely small, and to exhibit the final result accordingly.

    Lubrication, or the action of oils and other viscous fluids to
 diminish friction and wear between solid surfaces, does not appear to
 have hitherto formed a subject for theoretical treatment.          Such
 treatment may have been prevented by the obscurity of the physical
actions involved, which belong to a class as yet but little known,
namely, the boundary or surface actions of flnids ; but the absence of
such treatment has also been owing to the want of any general laws
revealed by experiment.
    The subject is of such fundamental importance in practical
 mechanics, and the opportunities of observation so frequent, that it

192                        Prof. 0. Reynolds.                  [Feb. 11,
may well be a matter of surprise that any general laws should have
for so long escaped detection.
   Besides the general experience obtained, the friction of lubricated
surfaces has been the subject of much experimental investigation by
able and careful experimenters ; but although in many cases empirical
laws have been propounded, these fail for the most part to agree with
each other and with the more general experience.
   The most recent investigation is that of Mr. Tower, undertaken at
the instance of the Institute of Mechanical Engineers.   Mr. Tower's
first report was published in November, 1883, and his second in 1884
 (t: Proc. Inst. Mechanical Engineers").
    In these reports Mr. Tower, making no attempt to formulate, states
the results of experiments apparently conducted with extreme care,
and under very various and well-chosen circumstances.     Those of the
results which were obtained under  the ordinary conditions of lubrica
tion so far agree with the results of previous investigators as to show
a  want of any regularity.       But one of the causes of this want of
 regularity, viz., irregularity in the supply of lubricant, appears to
have occurred to Mr. Tower early in his investigation, and led him to
include amongst his experiments the unusual circumstance of surfaces
completely immersed in an oil-bath.         This was very fortunate, for
not only do the results so obtained show a great degree of regularity,
but while making these experiments he was accidentally led to
observe a phenomenon which, taken with the results of his experi
ments, amounts to a crucial proof that in these experiments with the
oil-bath the surfaces were completely and continuously separated by a
film of oil; this film being maintained by the motion of the
journal, although the pressure of the oil at the crown of the bearing
was shown by actual measurement to be as much as 625 lbs. per
square inch above the pressure in the oil-bath.
   These results with the oil-bath are very important, notwithstanding
that the condition  is   not common in practice.     They show that with
perfect lubrication a definite law of the variation of the friction with
the pressure and the velocity holds for a particular journal and brass.
This Btrongly implies that the irregularity previously found was due
to imperfect lubrication.     Mr. Tower has brought this out. Substi
tuting  for the  bath  an oily pad of tow pressed against the free part
of the journal, and making    it    so slightly greasy that
                                                          it   was barely
perceptible   to  the touch,  he  again  found  considerable regularity in
the results.    These were, however, very different from those with
the bath. Then with intermediate lubrication he obtained intermediate
results, of which he says " Indeed, the results, generally speaking,
                          :
were so uncertain and irregular that they may be summed up in a
few words.     The friction depends on the quantity and uniform dis
tribution of the oil, and may be anything between the oil-bath results

 and seizing, according to the perfection or imperfection of the
 lubrication."
    On reading Mr. Tower's first report, it occurred to the author that
 in the case of the oil-bath the film of oil might be sufficiently thick
 for the unknown boundary actions to disappear, in which case the
 results would be deducible from the equations of hydrodynamics.
    Mr. Tower appears to have considered this, for he remarks that,
 according to the theory of fluid friction the resistance would be as
 the square of the velocity, whereas in his results it does not increase
according to this law.
    Considering how very general the law of resistance as the square of
 the speed is with fluids, there is nothing remarkable in it being
assumed to hold in such a case.            But the study of the behaviour of
fluid in very narrow channels, and particularly the recent determina
tion by the author of the critical velocity at which the law changes
from that of the square of the velocity to that of the simple ratio,
shows that with such highly viscous flnids as oils, such small spaces
as those existing between the journal and its bearing, and such limited
velocities as that of the surface of the journal, the resistance would
vary, cmteris paribus, as the velocity. And further, the thickness of
the oil film would not be uniform, and might be affected by the
velocity, and as the resistance wonld vary, coeteris paribus, inversely
as the thickness of the film, the velocity might exert in this way a
secondary influence on the resistance ; and further still, the resistance
 would depend on the viscosity (commonly called the body) of the oil,
 and this depends on the temperature.                But as Mr. Tower had been
careful to make all his experiments in the same series with something
 at a temperatnre of 90° F. (he does not state precisely what), it did
 not at first appear that there could be any considerable temperature
effect in his results.
    The application of bydrodynamieal equations for viscous fluids to
 circumstances similar to those of a journal and a brass in an oil-bath,
in so far as they are known, at once led to an equation* between the
 variation of pressure over the surface and the velocity, which appeared
to explain the existence of the film of oil at high pressure.
    This equation was mentioned in a paper read before Section A
at the British Association, at Montreal, 1884.              It also appears from' a
paragraph in the Presidential Address (p. 14, Brit. Assoc. Rep., 1884)

to be approximately integrated by considering certain quantities
small, and the theoretical results thus definitely compared with the
experimental.
    The result of this comparison was to show that with a particular
journal and brass the mean thickness of the film would be sensibly
constant for all but extreme values of load divided by the viscosity,
and hence if the coefficient of viscosity were constant the resistance
would increase approximately as the speed.
    As this was not in accordance with Mr. Tower's experiments, in
 which the resistance increased at a much slower rate, it appeared that
either the boundary actions became sensible, or that there must be a
rise in the temperature of the oil which had escaped the thermometer
used to measure the temperature of the journal.
    That there would be some excess of temperature in the oil film on
which all the work of overcoming friction is spent is certain, and
after carefully considering the means of escape of this heat, it appeared
probable that there would be a difference of several degrees between
the oil-bath and the film of oil.
    This increase of temperature would be attended with a diminution
of viscosity, so that as the resistance and temperature increased with
the velocity there would be a diminution of viscosity, which would
cause the increase of the resistance with the velocity to be less than
the simple ratio.
    In order to obtain a quantitative estimate of these secondary effects,
it was necessary to know the exact relation between the viscosity of
the oil and the temperature.            For this purpose an experimental deter
mination was made of the viscosity of olive oil at different tempera
tures as compared with the known viscosity of water.                       From the

for the viscosity of olive oil at all temperatures               between 60° and
 120°   F*
    Besides    the effect on p, the temperature might, owing to the diffe
rent expansion of brass and iron, produce a sensible effect on the
small difference a in the radii of the brass and journal, i.e., on the
mean thickness of the film, E was taken for the coefficient of this
effect, and since, owing to the elasticity of the material, the radius
would probably alter slightly with the load, m was taken as a
coefficient for this effect, whence a is given by an equationt in terms
of oq, its value with no load and a temperature zero.
    Substituting these values in the equations, the values of the pres
sure and friction deduced from the equations are functions of the
temperature, which may be then assumed, so as to bring the calcu
lated results into accord with the experimental.
    There was, however, another method of arriving, if not at the
actual temperatures, at a law connecting them with the frictions,
 loads, and velocities.      For the rise in temperature was caused by the
work spent in overcoming friction, while the heat thus generated had
to be carried or conducted away from the oil film.                Consideration of
this work and the means of escape gave another equation between the
rise of temperature, the friction, and velocity.         J
    The values of the constants in this equation can only be roughly
surmised from these experiments,              without determining them by
substituting the experimental values of /, U, and T, as previously
determined, but it was then found that the experiments with the
lower loads gave remarkably consistent values for A, B, E, m,
and a0, which was also treated as arbitrary.                In proceeding to the
higher    loads    for which    the  values  of   c were   greater, the agreement
between the calculated and experimental results was not so close, and
the divergence increased as c increased.                On careful examination,
however, it appeared that this discordance would be removed if the
experimental frictions were all reduced 20 per cent.                  This implied
that 20 per cent. of the actual friction arose from sources which did
not affect the pressure of the film of oil ; such a source would be the
friction of the ends of the brass against flanges on the shaft commonly

 used to keep the brass    in its place, or by any irregularity in the longi-
 tndinal section of the journal or brass. Although no direct reference
 is made to such flanges in Mr. Tower's reports, it is such a common
 custom to neck the shaft to form the journal that there is great
 probability of the flanges being used. A coefficient n has therefore
 been introduced into the theory, which includes both the effect of
necking and of irregularity in longitudinal section.           Giving n the
value 1*25, the calculated results came into accordance with all
Mr. Tower's results for olive oil, the difference being such as might
 well be attributed to experimental inaccuracy, and this both as regards
the frictions measured with one brass, No. 1, and the distribution of
the pressure round the journal with another, No. 2.
    Not only  does   the theory thus afford an explanation of the very
novel phenomena of the pressure in the oil film, but it also shows,
what does not appear in the experiments, how the various circum
stances    under which the experiments          have been  made affect the
results.
    Two circumstances in particular which are brought out as principal
circumstances by the theory seem to have hitherto entirely escaped
notice, even that of Mr. Tower.
    One of these is a, the difference in the radii of the journal and of
the brass or bearing.       It is well known that the fitting between the
journal   and  its bearing produces a great effect on the carrying power
of the journal, but this fitting is supposed to be rather a matter of
smoothness of surface than a degree of difference in radii.               The
radius of the bearing must always be as much larger than that          of  the
journal as is necessary to secure an easy fit, but more than this does
not seem to have been suggested.
    It now appears from this theory that if viscosity were constant the
friction would be inversely proportional to the difference in the radii
of the bealing and journal, and this although the arc of contact is less
than the semi-circumference ; and taking temperature into account
it appears from the comparison of the theoretical frictions with the
experiment on brass No. 1, that the difference in the radii at 70° F.
was
                             a=O-0O077 (inch),

brass No. 2,
                             a=0-00084 (inch),
or the difference was    9  per cent. greater in the case of brass No. 2.
    These two brasses were probably both bedded to the journal in the
same way, and had neither been subjected to any great amount of
wear, so that there is nothing surprising in their being so nearly tho
    VOl. Xl.                                                         P

  same   fit.   It would     be extremely   interesting to find how far under
  continuous running prolonged            wear tends to preserve this fit.
  Mr. Tower's experiments afford only slight indication of this. It
  does appear, however, that the brass expanded with an increase of
  temperature, and that its radius increases as the load increases in a
  very definite manner.
     Another circumstance         brought out by this theory, and remarked
  on both by Lord Rayleigh and the author at Montreal, but not before
  suspected is, that the point of nearest approach of the journal to the
  brass is not by any means in the line of load, and what is still
  more contrary to common supposition, it is on the off* side of this
  line.
     This point H moves as the ratio of load to velocity increases ;
  when this ratio is zero, the point H coincides with 0, then as the
  load increases it moves away to the left, till it reaches a maximum
  distance                             —      The load is still small, smaller
              J9— 0o, being nearly       ^.
  than   anything in Mr. Tower's experiments, even with the highest
 velocities.      For further increase of load, H returns towards 0, or
  \ir— 0o   increases    with the largest loads and smallest velocities to
 which the theory has been applied ; this angle is about 40°. With
 a fairly loaded journal well lubricated it would thus seem that the
 point of nearest approach of brass to journal, i.e., the centre of wear,
 would be about the middle of the off side of the brass.
     This circumstance, the reason of which is rendered perfectly clear by
 the conditions of equilibrium, at once explains a singular phenomenon,
 incidentally pointed out by Mr. Tower, viz., that the journal having
 been run in one direction for some time, and carrying its load without
 heating, on being reversed began to heat again, and this after
 many repetitions always heating on reversal, although eventually
 this tendency nearly disappeared. Mr. Tower's suggested explanation
 appears to the author as too hypothetical to be satisfactory, even in
 default of any other ; and particularly as this is an effect which would
necessarily follow in accordance with the theory, so long as there is
 wear.    For the centre of wear, being on the off side of the line of loads,
 this wear will tend to preserve or diminish the radius of the brass
 on the of side, and enlarge it on the on side, a change which will, if
anything, improve the condition for producing oil pressure while
running in this direction, but which will damage the condition on
which the production of pressure in the film depends when the journal
is reversed and the late off sido becomes the new on side.                That with
a well-worn surface there should be sufficient wear to produce this

result, with such slight amounts of using as those in Mr. Tower's
experiments before reversal, seems doubtful, but supposing the brass
Dew, and the surface more or less unequal, the wear for some time
 would be considerable, even after the initial tendency to heat had
disappeared.       Hence it is not surprising that the effect should have
eventually     seemed  to disappear.
    The circumstances which determine the greatest load which a bear
 ing will carry with complete lubrication, i.e., with the oil film con
 tinuous between brass and journal throughout the entire arc, are defi
 nitely shown in the theory, so long as the brass has a circular section.
    As the ratio of the load to velocity increases    JI or c increases, and
 the point H approaches 0, when c reaches the value 0-5, which makes
 GH = a(l— c)=0'5a, the pressure of the oil in the film is every
 where greater than at A and B, the pressure in the bath, but for a
 further increase in the load the pressure falls near A on the off side,
 the fall will cause the pressure to become less than that of the atmo
 sphere, or if sufficient to become absolutely negative, until discon
 tinuity or rupture of the oil film occurs.       The film will then only
extend between brass and journal over a portion of the whole arc,
 and a smaller portion as the load -ncreases or velocity diminishes, i.e.,
as c increases.      Thus since the amount of negative pressure which
 the oil will bear depends on circumstances which are uncertain, the
 limit of the safe load for complete lubrication is that which causes
 the least separating distance to be half the difference in radii of the
 brass and journal.
    The rupture of the oil does not take place at the point of nearest
approach, but on the q^side of this, and will only extend up to a point
P2 definitely shown in this theory, which is at the same distance on the
off side of H as Pi is on the cm side.   Hence after this rupture the brass
may still be in equilibrium, entirely separated from the journal, and
the question as to whether it will carry a greater load without descend
ing on to the journal will depend on the relative values of        —t and on
                                                                   R'
the smalluess of the velocity.       The condition then becomes the same
us that for imperfect lubrication, and except in the case of a being
very small, theory shows that the ultimate limit to the load will be the
same with the oil-bath and        with partial lubrication   as  Mr. Tower
found it to be.
    This much may be inferred without effecting the integrations for
imperfect lubrications; could these be effected, the theory would be as
applicable to partial lubrication as it has been to complete lubrication,
i.e., a sufficient supply of oil. And as it is, sufficient may be seen to
show that with any supply of oil, however insufficient for complete
lubrication, the brass will still be completely separated from the
journal, although the supporting film of oil will not touch the brass

except over a limited area, and it is shown by general reasoning that
in the one extreme, when the oil is very limited, the friction increases
directly as the load, and is independent of the velocity, while in the
other, where the oil is abundant, the circumstances are those of the
oil-bath.
    The effect of the limited length of bearings, and the escape of the
 oil at the ends, is also apparent in the equations.
    Although in the main the present investigation has been directed
 to the circumstances of Mr. Tower's experiments, namely, a cylin
drical journal revolving in a cylindrical brass, the main object ha*
 been to establish a general and complete theory based on the hydro-
 dynamical equations for viscous fluids.       Hence it has been thought
necessary   to proceed   from  the  general equations, and to deduce the
equations of lubrication in a general form, from which the particular
form for application has been obtained.       It has been found necessary
also to consider somewhat generally the characters of fluid friction
and viscosity.
   The property of viscosity has been discussed in Section        II of the
paper, which section also contains the account of the experimental
investigation as to the viscosity of olive oil.        The general theory
deduced from the hydrodynamical equations for viscous fluids with
methods of application, including two cases besides the cylindrical
journal in which the equations become completely integrable, viz.,
two plane surfaces of elliptical shape approaching,         and one plane
sliding   over  another    not quite parallel plane   surface, is given in
Sections   IV, V, VI,   and  VII.
   The physical considerations of the effect of the heat generated are
discussed in Section VIII.
   As there are some circumstances which cannot be taken into account
in the definite reasoning, particularly as regards incomplete lubrica
tion, besides which, as the definite reasoning tends to obscure the
more immediate purpose of the investigation, a preliminary discussion
of the problem presented by lubrication, illustrated by aid of graphic
methods, has been introduced as Section III.
   Finally, the definite application to Mr. Tower's experiments is given
in Section IX, which concludes as follows : —
    The experiments to which the theory has been definitely applied
may be taken to include all Mr. Tower's experiments with the 4-inch
journal and oil-bath, in which the number of revolutions per minute
was between 100 and 450, and the nominal loads in pounds per square
inch between 100 and 415. The other experiments with the oil-bath
were with loads from 415 till the journal seized at 520, 573, or 625,
and a set of experiments with brass No. 2 at 20 revolutions per
minute.     All these experiments were under extreme conditions, for
which by the theory c was so great as to render lubrication incom

   plete, and preclude the application of      the theory  without further
   integrations.
      The theory has, therefore, been tested by experiments throughout
   the extreme range of circumstances to which the particular integra
   tions undertaken are applicable, and the results, which in many cases
   check one another, are consistent throughout.
      The agreement of the experimental results with the particular
  equations obtained on the assumption that the brass as well as
   the journal are truly circular, must be attributed to the same
  causes as the great regularity presented by the experimental results
   themselves.
      Fundamental amongst these causes is, as Mr. Tower has pointed
  out, the perfect supply of lubricant obtained with the oil-bath.      But
  nearly as important must have been the truth with which the brasses
  were first fitted to the journal, the smalluess of the subsequent wear
  and the variety of the conditions as to magnitude of load, speed, and
  direction of motion.
      That a brass in continuous use should preserve a circular section
  with a constant radius requires either that there should be no wear at
  all, or that the wear at any point P should be proportional to
  sin (90°-POH).
      Experience shows that there is wear in ordinary practice, and even
  in Mr. Tower's experiments, there seems to have been some wear. In
 these experiments, however, there is every reason to suppose that the
  wear would have been approximately proportional to c sin (<f)Q—&)-=
  csin (90°— POH), because this represents the approach of the brass
  to the journal within the mean distance a, for all points except those
 at which it is negative, at these there would be either no wear at all or
 a slight positive wear.    So long, then, as the journal ran in one direc
 tion only, the wear would tend to preserve the radius and trne circular
 form of that portion of the arc from A to F (fig. I, note *), altering
 the radius at F, and enlarging it from F to B.      On reversal, however,
 A and F change sides, and hence alternate motion in both directions
 would preserve the radius constant all over the brass.
      The experience emphasised by Mr. Tower, that the journal, after
 running for some time in one direction, would not run at first in the
other, strongly bears out this conclusion.       Hence it follows that had
 the journal been continuously run in one direction, the condition of
 lubrication, as shown by the distribution of oil pressure round the
journal, would have been modified, the pressure falling between 0 and
 B on the on side of the journal, a conclusion which is borne out by the
fact that in the experiments with brass No. 2, which was run for some
time continuously in one direction, the pressure measured on the on
side is somewhat below that calculated on the assumption of circular
form, although the agreement is close for the other four points.

202                  On the Theory   of Lubrication.          [Feb. 11,
    When the surfaces are completely separated by oil it is difficult to
see what can cause wear.      But there is generally metallic contact at
starting, and hence abrasions, which will introduce metallic particles
into the oil (blacken it), these particles will be more or less carried
round and round with the journal, causing wear and increasing the
number of metallic particles and the viscosity of the oil.     Thus the
rate of wear would depend on the metallic particles in the oil, the
values ofc,     and the velocity of the journal, and hence would render
             a
the greatest velocity of the joun.a-1 at which the maximum load with
a large value of c could be carried, small ; a conclusion which seems
to be confirmed by Mr. Tower's experiments with brass No. 2 at
twenty revolutions a minute.
    In cases such as engine bearings the wear causes the radius of cur
vature of the brass continually to increase, and hence a and c must
continually increase with wear. But, in order to apply the theory to-
such cases, the change in the direction of the load (or the velocity of
approach of the surfaces) would have to be taken into account.
    That the circumstances of Mr. Tower's experiments are not those of
ordinary practice, and hence that the particular equations deduced in
order to apply the theory definitely to these experiments do not
apply to ordinary cases, does not show that the general theory as given
in the general equation could not be applied to ordinary cases were
the conditions sufficiently known.
    These experiments of Mr. Tower have afforded the means of
verifying the theory for a particular case, and hence have so far
 established its truth as applicable to all cases for which the integra
 tions can be effected.

 lubricant, the principal circumstances on which lubrication depends,,
 although not the same in other cases, will still be the principal cir
 cumstances, and indicate the conditions to be fulfilled in order to
 secure good lubrication.
     The verification of the equations for viscous fluids under such
 extreme circumstances affords a severe test of the truth and com
 pleteness of the assumptions on which these equations are founded -r
 and the result of the whole research is to point to a conclusion
 (important to natural philosophy) that not only in cases of intentional
 lubrication, but wherever hard surfaces under pressure slide over each
 other without abrasion, they are separated by a film of some foreign
 matter, whether perceptible or not; and that the question as to

whether the action can be continuous or not turns on whether the
motion tends to preserve the foreign matter between the surfaces at
the points of pressure, as in the almost if not quite unique case of
the revolving journal, or tends to remove              it,

   The fact that a little grease will enable any surfaces to slide for        a
time has tended doubtless to obscure the action of the revolving
journal to maintain the oil between the surfaces at the point of
pressure, and yet, although only now understood,          this action that
                                                              it   is

with intermittent pressure and separation of the surfaces to draw the

   The glands examined were the submaxillary and parotid of the
dog and cat, and in all of these we have determined that the process
of secretion  is accompanied by definite electrical changes   as, how   ;
ever, the submaxillary gland both in the dog and cat has been more
thoroughly examined than^the parotid, the present communication               is
confined almost entirely to the former.
   The chorda tympani and sympathetic nerves were exposed in the
usual manner, divided, and the peripheral ends arranged for stimula
tion, a canula being placed in Wharton's duct. The submaxillary
gland having been exposed was led off in the following manner.
One non-polarisable    electrode   was placed on the superficial or
cutaneous aspect of the gland, and the second electrode so arranged
in the wound as to touch the deep surface of the gland as close to the
hilus as possible without pressing on the duct.
   A Thomson galvanometer of high resistance was used.

    Bog. — The cutaneous surface of the gland is in the great majority
of cases negative to the hilus, both when examined as above de
 scribed and also when      the gland is removed     from the animal aud
led off.
    In four  experiments amongst twenty-four, the outer surface of the
gland was positive.       In two cases the outer surface was at first
positive, but subsequently became negative, and in one case it was at
first negative but subsequently became positive.
    The electromotive force of the current of rest varies very much
both in different cases and in the same case at different times ;
thus in the former case it may vary from              volt to -g^o volt, but
owing to a variety of structures (muscles, &c.) being unavoidably
injured in the preparation, not much stress can be laid on this point.
     Cat. — Out of twenty experiments on the submaxillary gland, in
fifteen the surface of the gland was positive to the hilus, in three the
surface of the gland was negative, in one the surface was at first
negative and subsequently became positive, and in one the surface
was at first positive and subsequently became negative to the hilus.
    Hence, although a corresponding amount of injury is inflicted on the
tissues in the case of the cat as in the dog, yet on the whole the
resting current is opposite in its sign in the two cases.
                             Excitatory  Changes.
    Dog.    Chorda Tympani. — On throwing an induction current into
the chorda tympani, a very well-marked deflection of the galvano
meter is always observed of a sign indicating that the outer surface
of the gland becomes negative to the hilus. Although in different
dogs the amount of this deflection varies, yet never have we failed to
obtain it.
    Frequently this variation is not the sole one observed, its course
being interrupted by a second deflection showing the outer surface of
the gland to become positive.        This second variation, however, is by
no means always observed, and more especially it is not seen if the
first or main phase is very large, being then indicated only by a
 slight temporary arrest in the deflection caused by the first phase.
 The latent period of the variation is short, being about 0"37", as
measured by the capillary electrometer.            The deflection quickly
 reaches a maximum and begins to diminish before the cessation of the
excitation, returning quickly towards zero, but as a rule leaving a
slight after-effect.
    Atropine, in doses of 5 — 10 mgrins., abolishes the main phase of the
 chorda variation in from 2 — 3 minutes from its injection into the
 pleura.    In those cases in which this phase only had been observed.

 1886.]      Secretion   in   the   Salivary Glands of   the   Dog and Cat.   205
frequently after such a dose of atropine the second phase (i.e., outer
surface of gland positive to hilus) is seen on excitation of the chorda,
although previously not detected, owing to the magnitude and
rapidity of the deflection caused by the first or main phase.
   This second phase is more refractory towards atropine than the
main phase, although ultimately abolished by it in large doses.
   Excitation of Sympathetic causes well-marked changes of potential in
the gland structures which are very different to those produced on
excitation of the chorda ; the latter havo a very short latent period, are
readily abolished by atropine, and are of such a sign as to cause the
outer surface of the gland to become negative, occasionally followed by
the onter surface becoming positive.
   Excitation of the sympathetic, however, produces after a very long
latent period an electrical effect very refractory as regards the action
of atropine on it, and of such a sign that the outer surface of the
gland becomes positive to the hilus.
   Further, the course of the variation is very slow, and its amplitude
is much less than that of the chorda variation.     Thus in one case on
excitation of the sympathetic a deflection of 62 was obtained, the
chorda giving a deflection of 140 with £ shunt.
   Atropine in small doses has apparently no effect on the sympathetic
variation, but in large doses, 40 — 100 mgrms., it is not without effect,
at first producing great lengthening of the latent period, and then
steadily diminishing the amplitude of the variation, although after
even 100 mgrms. a slight variation, i.e., 10 — 15 divisions, is still per
ceptible.
   Cat.   Chorda tympani. — In the cat, excitation of the chorda causes
an electrical variation of such a sign that the outer surface of the
gland becomes negative to the hilus, but whereas in the dog, a second
phase was on the whole not observed in the majority of cases, in the
cat a second phase is usually present, and very frequently is greater
in amount than the first phase.    Further, in a few cases, the first
phase (i.e., outer surface of gland negative) was very small indeed,
i.e., less than 20 divisions, and in one case it was absent, the chorda
giving a pure second phase. These varieties observed in the varia
tions are largely dependent on the nature of the accompanying
secretion.
   In these cases in which the first phase was large, the secretion was
very watery, and if the secretion obtained was viscid the electrical
variation consisted of a small first phase and a large second phase.
   Atropine in doses of 2 — 20 mgrms. abolishes the first phase of the
chorda variation, leaving the second phase, as in the dog, and this
second phase requires a larger dose to abolish      i.e., 20 — 40 mgrms.
                                                         it,
   Excitation of the sympathetic in the cat produces an electrical
effect resembling more the chorda >effect of the cat than the sympa

thetic effect of the dog. Thus the usual effect is a deflection similar
to the chorda effect of the cat, i.e., diphasic, hut with this difference,
that the first phase is usually larger than the second phase, and not as
in chorda excitation, the second larger than the first. This variation
is obtained if the accompanying secretion be watery in character, but
if,   as occasionally            be viscid, then the second phase
                          happens,   it                                     is
larger, and the first phase smaller in amount.
   Atropine in small doses abolishes the first phase, and in doses          of
10—40 mgrms. the second phase, thus showing very great difference
                                                         a
between its action on the sympathetic variation in the cat and dog
respectively.
   Thus to sum up our results —      :
   In the submaxillary of the dog excitation of the chorda produces a
copious slightly viscid secretion, and the electrical effect consists of a
large first phase, the second phase being small, and although not
always observed      probably always present.
                     is
   In the cat a similar excitation produces a copious viscid secretion,
and the electrical effect    diphasic, the second phase being usually
                               is
the larger.
   In the dog, excitation of the sympathetic produces a scanty viscid
secretion, and the electrical effect consists of pure second phase.
                                                     a
  In the cat, excitation of the sympathetic produces a very copious

the first phase being usually the larger.
  In the parotid the results obtained are similar to those in the sub
maxillary.

abolished by atropine.     Excitation of the sympathetic causes the
surface of the gland to become positive to the hilus, and the variation
is    not readily abolished by atropine.

      Rayleigh, M.A., D.C.L., F.R.S. Received February 3,
      1886.
   In the course of an investigation into the nature of carbon filaments,
such as are ordinarily used in the construction of incandescent lamps,
my attention was arrested by certain variations in the amount of
light emitted from filaments which were, to the best of my belief, of
similar nature and composition, but which, when tested under pre
cisely similar conditions, gave the most anomalous results.         I wa*
also struck with changes which occurred to a greater or less degree in
 the light yielded by certain lamps when re-tested subsequent to a
shock of over-incandescence, or long continued hard running at a high
temperature ; the light yielded after this occurrence (indeed the light
yielded by any lamps that had been much used)            I  found to be
invariably lessened both in quantity and brightness, and to require a
considerable increase in the energy supplied to it to produce from
the same filament the light it originally gave.    After seeking vainly
to account for these irregularities from structural differences in
the carbon filaments themselves, and after testing and re-testing many
carbons made in a variety of ways, both by myself and others, it
occurred to me that the composition or structure of the carbon itself,
of which the filaments were made, might have really little to do with
the discrepancies and changes I had noticed.
                    I
   All the carbons had tried gave in turn the most irregular results,
and although some of these were porous, and some dense and com
pact, the light emitted from any one of them per unit of surface for
each unit of electrical energy supplied to it was very varied and
uncertain, and did not appear to follow any condition of the porosity
or denseness of the filament itself.
   All the carbons in turn gave the same light per unit of surface

when raised to the same       incandescence,   but the energy required to
produce this light, or raise the filament to this incandescence, varied
sometimes in a remarkable way.          At times a filament was found
which, with 2 watts or volt amperes passing through it, would yield
the light of the standard candle.      And again, with other filaments it
sometimes occurred that no less than 5 volt amperes were required to
produce this light.
    On collating a number of these observations, and comparing the
filaments themselves with their various testings, I noticed, I thought,
some difference in the outward appearance of those filaments which
had tested well and those that had required any large amount of
energy to give a satisfactory light, and, following up this idea, I soon
became convinced that it was to this surface appearance or condition
that the whole question of economical light giving or otherwise might
be traced.    All the filaments, it appeared, whose surfaces were of a
dull black required the larger amounts of energy to yield the usual
unit of light, while from those filaments with even moderately bright
surfaces the light of the standard candle could be obtained for an
expenditure of energy surprisingly less. To ascertain with greater
certainty if this idea were correct,    I  prepared a number of carbons
made from a vegetable fibre which, though yielding a somewhat
porous carbon, was strong and uniform in texture.
    Having selected two filaments as like each other as the eye could
determine, and having ascertained by careful measurement that they
were both of exactly the same length and diameter, and therefore of
equal surface, I subjected each carbon in turn to the action of an
electrical current in a hydrocarbon atmosphere, so regulating the
current as to maintain the carbon filament at a white heat in the
vapour until a sufficient deposit of carbon upon its surface was
obtained.
    To provide for the deposit of carbon upon the one filament being as
dull a black as possible,   I used for the depositing medium an atmo
sphere of ordinary coal-gas drawn from a domestic burner.           A large
glass jar was filled with this, and a constant    current of  the  cold  gas
kept circulating through it during the deposit, and the resulting
surface was all that could be desired.       It had all the appearance of
being coated with lampblack, but the coating was quite permanent,
and did not brush off, or even soil the fingers in handling.
    On the other of these two filaments      I now deposited carbon of a
bright silvery appearance in marked contrast with the dull black of
that just described, and this deposit    I found  I could readily effect by
using   as the depositing  atmosphere the very hot vapour of almost any
hydrocarbon having a high boiling point, though from the porous
nature of the carbons    I was using I did not get the surface as brilliant
as  I subsequently  obtained   it from smoother carbons.

 1886.]                Radiation   of Light and Heat.
    This filament was then mounted         on platinum electrodes, as the
other had been, enclosed      in a  similar glass globe, and exhausted of
air, the vacuum being carried to about the -nn>Ws °f an atmosphere.
    The remeasurement of these carbon filaments subsequent to the
reduction of the carbon on their surfaces, showed no perceptible
increase in their diameter, the deposit of carbon which had been
added being in all likelihood less than the ten thousandth of an inch
in thickness, and the surface areas of each filament still remained
practically equal in all respects.
    Having now two carbon filaments with which a comparative test
might be made, and in which the conditions were in all respects
identical, except in that of surface condition or polish, the one being
like soot and the other like silver, I passed a series of known electrical
currents through each in turn, registering the light produced against
a standard candle burning 120 grains per hour in a good photometer
provided with a sliding screen.
    In Table No. I, Carbon A, are shown the testings of the blackened
filament, and in Table II, Carbon B, those of the filament which was
made bright.      In diagram No. 1 may be seen the plotting of these
results and their relative curves. The dotted curve marked Carbon A
shows the testings of the black filament, and the curve marked with a
plain hard white line. Carbon B, gives the testings of the filament
which was bright. The horizontal divisions in the diagram give the
 watts or volt amperes of energy passing through the filament, and
 the perpendiculars mark the corresponding candle powers.             From
 these tests it may be noticed that with two carbon filaments identical
 in all respects but in that of surface polish or brightness, the
 blackened filament required no less than 100 watts to keep its surface
 at an incandescence yielding 20 candles, whilst the filament with the
 bright surface was kept at the same incandescence, and gave an equal
 light with 74 watts only, also that each filament when consuming an
 energy of 4 watts per candle, that which was blackened required no
 less than 113 watts of energy to effect this (besides having its surface
 incandescence strained to yield 28 candles), while the bright filament
 with 71 watts only effected the same economy, viz., 4 watts only per
                                                      J
 candle, and had to give from its surface only 17 candles.
    These results satisfied me that the condition of the carbon surface
 was wholly the cause of the large differences shown by these curves,
 and  I determined therefore to carry out a more extended series of
 tests with carbons about which      I knew nothing.
    For this purpose, therefore,       I procured two carbons of foreign
 manufacture, but by whom made I did not know.               The following
 were   their chief characteristics.      The carbons were very nearly
 square   in  section,  and  appeared    before  carbonising to have been
 sliced from some homogeneous material like parchment paper.

210             Mr. M. Evans.     Observations on the      [Feb. 18,
 They were both,   I found from careful measurements, of precisely
 the same dimensions and surface area, and each presented the same
 dull dead black surface ; the carbon itself appeared exceedingly
 dense and hard. Testing these filaments as I procured them, I placed
 them in bulbs and exhausted as before.

   Tables III and VI give the photometric tests of these carbons as  I
procured them, and diagrams 2 and 3 show the plotting of these
tests.  I have marked these filaments C and D, the black dotted line
in diagram 2 being the curve for filament C, and the black dotted line
in diagram 3 that for filament D.
   In these two curves the extreme uniformity with which these car
bons tested is worthy of notice, the one giving nineteen and a half
candles and the other twenty for the eighty watts supplied to each,

which     not only well inside any error of observation, but is in great
measure a sufficient proof of the extreme equality of the areas of
their radiating surfaces.

   1 now dismounted these filaments and subjected them to incande
scence in the hot hydrocarbon vapour as before with carbon B.
The result was highly satisfactory, as they both took a surface ranch
brighter than carbon B had done. Again remounting them and
exhausting, they 'were placed in the photometer as before. The results
are given in Tables IV and VII, and the curves from these tables are
shown by the bright hard lines CC and DD, diagrams 2 and 3.
These curves appear fully to bear out the assumption arrived at in
the former tests, Tables       I and II, and the improvement in light
radiation per unit of energy is especially marked in the case of fila
ment C, where it may be noticed that at 2 watts of energy per candle
of light the same filament in its black condition was strained to yield
ing sixty candles nearly, while in its polished state it had only to yield
thirty-seven, and still be as economical in its electrical energy as
before.    The same filament at 3 watts per candle, when black, had to
give off 31 candles, equal to 270 candles per square inch of its sur
face, while in its polished state it required to give only 18 candles to
equal 3 watts per candle, and its surface was strained only to the
extent of 155 candles per square inch. It is certain, therefore, that
its lasting power with its surface bright would be many times greater
at the foregoing expenditure of energy than in its black condition.
   As the filaments were still unbroken and appeared capable of yet
                 I
another test, resolved to attempt the reblackening of them, and to
ascertain if possible if the test-curve under these conditions would
again revert to its former position, but I had now to reblacken over
the bright surface which could not be removed.          The filaments were
again successfully     dismounted,    and  with    some difficulty again re-
blackened over their former polished surfaces.
   They were now tested, as is shown in Tables V and VIII, and the
corresponding curves are given in diagrams 2 and 3, marked CCC,
DDD. The recession of the curves was in both cases nearly com
plete, any    difference   being  fully accounted for by the incomplete
reblackening of the carbon surface.
   In carrying out these experiments I much regret not having made
the necessary arrangements for simultaneously testing both the heat
and light emitted from each filament in its blackened and bright
condition.   I have little doubt the loss of efficiency when black was due
to the energy supplied being radiated in large quantities as heat
waves from the blackened surfaces, which these surfaces when bright
would not permit.        This radiation of heat, however, which had not
been converted into light by emission from a bright surface was abun
dantly manifested in the handling of the lamps. The incandescent
globe containing the bright filament could at all times be readily held
in the hand even when giving its maximum of light, while the heat
radiated from the filament when its surface was blackened was most

of economy in working and light-giving should have resulted, and this
would have      been     the more interesting as ordinarily it is just the
other way ; as soon as by overheating or long use the polished sur
faces of our best lamps are injured, so surely is there an increased
waste of energy, and hence the extreme difficulty of preserving
lamps made for use as standards for any long period.
   From these results it appears probable that the attainment of
economical high E.M.F. lamps of ordinary sizes may be very diffi
cult, as what would be a high E.M.F. lamp with a black surface
would     be a low      E.M.F. lamp were this black surface made bright;
the energy required being less, both the E.M.F. and current would
have to fall.      The desire, therefore, for high E.M.F. lamps should be
met not by a supply of black wasteful filaments, but more properly by
economical lamps of greatly increased size and candle power, or by
lamps of a smaller candle power run two or more in series.

 II. "On     a Thermopile      and   Galvanometer combined."           By
       Professor George Forbes, M.A. Communicated by Lord
       Rayleigh, M.A., D.C.L., Sec. R.S. Received February 4,
       1886.
    The author has lately made use of a special form of thermopile and
 galvanometer    combined, which is very sensitive for the measurement
 of radiation. The apparatus is especially suitable for use as a line-
 thermopile.
    The first experiments were made with two half tubes, one of anti
 mony the other of bismuth, soldered together so as to make a short
 tube about 2 cm. external diameter, the walls being 2 mm. thick, and
 the length of tube about 2 or 2£ cm.       The sides of the tube where
 the junctions of the metals occur were then filed flat, so as to present
 a thin wall to receive the radiations and to enable it to rise in tempe
 rature more rapidly, and also more uniformly throughout the thick
 ness of this wall. This tube was lamp-blacked.      A Thomson's mirror
 and magnets (by J. White, of Glasgow), in its usual brass cell, but
 with an insulated coating, was then inserted in the tube, and the
 whole apparatus mounted inside a brass cube with a brass cone at one
side to throw the radiations upon one junction, and with a circular
hole facing the mirror. This apparatus when properly adjusted with
a lamp and scale was found to be very sensitive.         It had been the
intention of the author to use a telescope in place of a lamp, but the
radiations of the lamp were found to give rise to no inconvenience.
    Let us compare the probable sensitiveness of this instrument, say,
with a line-thermopile of the ordinary construction of 20 pairs,
forming a line of the same length as the tube, the double length of a
pair of antimony and bismuth in the line-thermopile being equal to
the circumference of the tube. Let E be the E.M.F. of one junction,
and let R be the resistance of one pair in the line- thermopile, and let
R' be the resistance of the galvanometer used with the line-thermopile.
The total resistance of the line-thermopile is 20R, and that of the
tubnlar one is j^, and the currents    in the line and tubular thermo
piles respectively   are           and         If the galvanometer   were
                         20K+H           xv
specially constructed to match the line-thermopile,    R  would  be ma-do
equal to 20R, and the current would be     -,
                                           E  or one-fortieth of the cur-
                                            2
rent in the tubnlar thermopile and galvanometer combined.         Thus it
would require forty turns of wire in the low-resistance galvanometer,
if these coils occupied the same space as the meial of the tubular

218                      Prof. G. Forbes.      On a             [Feb. 18,
thermopile,    to equal  the sensitiveness    of the latter, and a larger
number if     it occupied  a  greater   space.   On the whole, it seems
probable   that by specially designing a galvanometer to match the
line-thermopile the arrangement would be about as sensitive as the
new instrument in the form hitherto described, but the simplicity and
cheapuess of construction of the latter commends it.
   The next apparatus was made according to the following instruc
tions : —
   Take a wedge whose distance from the apex to the base is about
6 cm., the base of the triangular section of the wedge being about
3 cm., and the width of the wedge 6 cm.            The wedge is half of
antimony and half of bismuth, the division being made by the
medial plane perpendicular to the three rectangular faces of the
wedge cut off the apex of the wedge by a plane parallel to the base
of the wedge, and exposing a surface of 1^ cm. width.          This is the
surface which receives the radiations, and it is lamp-blacked.      A hole
about 1 cm. diameter is now drilled (or it is better to file it out before
the two metals are soldered together) through the two sides of the
wedge, so as to leave only a thin wall along the junction of the
metals at the surface which receives the radiations.       A Thomson cell
with suspended mirror and magnet is inserted in this hole and the
instrument is complete, and ready to be placed inside the brass box
with cone already described.
   The resistance of this cell is very low and its sensitiveness thereby
increased.    Moreover this type has a great advantage in the fact that
the mass of metal acts as a damper upon the vibrations of the magnet,
and so we have a dead-beat instrument.
   The diameter of the cone to receive radiations at its mouth was
5 cm.    A candle at a distance of 30 cm. from the mouth of the cone
gave a deflection of 52 divisions, a reading being easily made correct
to one division. A duplex lamp burning paraffin oil at a distance of
1^  metres gave a deflection of 60 divisions.
   The author takes this opportunity to describe a method of carrying
the delicate Thomson cells without danger of breaking the silk fibre
suspension.     The cell consists externally of a brass tube. A horse
shoe magnet is obtained with the distance between its legs small
compared with the diameter of the above-mentioned tube.          The tube
is placed so as to rest on the inner edges of the legs of the magnet,
with the mirror over the poles of the magnet, the mirror magnets
having their poles over poles of opposite name of the horse-shoe
magnet, and with the silk fibre next to the magnet.           The mutual
magnetic attraction takes the tension off the silk fibre and holds the
mirror fixed in position, and the fibre cannot be broken by a blow
given to the apparatus.

I. " On a Comparison          between Apparent Inequalities of Short
      Period    in Sun-spot Areas and in Diurnal Declination-ranges
      at Toronto and at Prague. By BALFOUR STEWART, M.A.,
      LL.D., F.R.S., and William Lant Carpenter, B.A., B.Sc.
      Received February 17. Read February 25, 1886.
    1. In  a  report  to the Solar Physics Committee (" Proc. Roy. Soc,"
vol.   37, p. 290, 1884) we discussed the relations between certain
apparent Inequalities of short periods in sun-spot areas on the one
hand and diurnal temperature-ranges at Toronto and at Kew of cor
responding periods on the other.
    In the present communication we proceed to discuss the connexion
between the same solar Inequalities and the diurnal declination-ranges
at Toronto and at Prague.
    For the Toronto declination-ranges     we are indebted to the kindness
of the Science and Art Department, South Kensington, and of Mr.
Carpmael, Director of the Toronto Observatory, through whom we
have received daily values (excluding Sundays) of the diurnal range of
magnetic declination at Toronto extending from 1856 to 1879 inclu
sive, and thus forming a series of 24 years.
    Each number is the difference in scale-divisions of the declinometer
between the greatest eastern and the greatest western deflection of
the declination magnet on each day, as observed at the hours 6 a.m.,
8 a.m., 2 p.m., 4 p.m., 10 p.m., and midnight of Toronto mean time, one
scale-division of the instrument being equal to 0'"72 nearly. It is
probable that such differences represent very nearly the true diurnal
range.
    Disturbances    appear to be violent at Toronto, and we have rejected

 1886.]     Sun-spot Areas and Diurnal Declination-ranges.             221
 a few of the most disturbed observations, embracing those which
 denote ranges above forty scale-divisions,    or 28'-8. Although this
rejection has been made, it must not be supposed that the remainder
are entirely undisturbed,     but only that they are freed from the
excessive influence of the most violent disturbances.
   We have extracted the Prague ranges from the published records of
that Observatory, and we have not fonnd it necessary to exclude dis
turbances except in one or two very marked cases.            The Prague
ranges   are derived  from  observations  made  at 6 a.m., 10 a.m., 2 p.m.,
and 10 p.m., hours which are common to the whole series, and there
is reason to believe that the ranges thus deduced are not greatly
different from those which would have been obtained from an hourly
Beries of observations.
   2. The declination-ranges of the present paper have been reduced
exactly in the same manner as the temperature-ranges of our previous
report (" Proc. Roy. Soc.," May 1, 1884, vol. 37, p. 290). It is there
fore unnecessary to discuss the method of reduction, this having been
already done at considerable length.
   We proceed consequently at once to consider —
                 Results of Comparison   armnd 24 Days.
   3. Comparison as to Duration of Period. — This is given in the fol
lowing table, in which the sun-spot and Toronto temperature columns
are transcribed  from our former paper for the purpose of comparison.
The sums in these columns are those of 36 years. The Prague decli
nation columns exhibit likewise sums of 36 years, while the Toronto
declination columns exhibit sums of 24 years. As in our last paper,
to save space we have divided each individual sum by 100 ; that is to
say, we have dismissed the two right hand figures.
   We have inclosed in brackets the positions of all sufficiently well-
defined maximum Inequalities of sun-spots, of Toronto temperature-
ranges, and of Prague declination-ranges.         But inasmuch as the
Toronto declination-ranges only extend over 24 years, we have
merely exhibited the numbers without brackets, believing these to be
of inferior accuracy.
   Before the table is examined it may be well for the reader to be
reminded that the sun-spot areas extend from 1832 to 1867 inclusive,
thus embracing 36 years ; that the Toronto temperature and the
Prague declination-ranges    extend from 1844 to 1879 inclusive, thus
embracing 36 years ; while the Toronto declination-ranges extend
from 1856 to 1879 inclusive, thus embracing 24 years. It thus
appears that the Toronto temperature and the Prague declination-
ranges are for the same 36 years, 24 of which they have in common
with the sun-spot series. On the other hand, the Toronto declination

  1886.J     Sun-spot Areas and Diurnal Declination-ranges.                223
  series of 24 years has its 24 years in common with the Prague series,
  but only 12 years in common with the sun-spot series.
     Confining our comparisons in period to sun-spots, Toronto tempera
  ture, and Prague declination-ranges,    it will be seen that on the whole
  the positions of maximum apparent Inequality for sun-spots are near
  those for Toronto temperature and Prague declination.            It may be
  desirable here to repeat the remark which we made in our previous
  communication,    that while this likeness cannot be considered as
  conclusively proving a connexion, it is nevertheless the sort of
  similarity which might be expected to exist between phenomena
  physically connected, but which contain so many apparent Inequali
 ties, and these so near together, that our series of observations is not
 sufficiently extensive to enable us to eliminate their influence upon
 each other, or to allow us to ascertain their true positions.
    We may likewise remark that in our opinion there is not a greater
 correspondence between sun-spots and declination -ranges than be
 tween sun-spots and temperature-ranges.
    4. Comparison in Phase. — For this purpose we have treated the
 Toronto declination and the Prague declination Inequalities exactly
 in the way in which we treated the temperature-range Inequalities of
 our previous paper, so that the Inequalities of the following table
 (Table II) are quite comparable with those of our previous paper ;
 they are indeed virtually the same Inequalities. The only difference
 is that we have in Table II set for calculation in each case from the
 corresponding sun-spot minimum, which seems to be the most con
 venient starting point when comparing together Inequalities such as
 those of this table, which as a rule have only one prominent maximum
 in their period. It thus appears that here the settings have been
 arranged by strictly celestial considerations.    If, therefore, there is no
 connexion between these terrestrial and solar Inequalities, the declina
tion-range maxima should be distributed impartially up and down the
 table without any other than chance grouping together.                 Their
 behaviour is, however, very different from this — the maxima being
 comparatively closely grouped together about a position a couple of
 days after the corresponding sun-spot maximum.
    5. Constancy of Type in the various Inequalities. — There is a very
considerable constancy of type in the declination Inequalities which,
as already stated, have only one prominent maximum.             Nevertheless,
as will be seen both from Table        II  and from the diagram which
accompanies this paper, there is a tendency to duplicity of phase in
the terrestrial that is entirely wanting in the solar Inequalities.

    6. Comparison   as   to  Duration of Period. — This is exhibited in
Table III, which is precisely analogous to Table I. The same
                                                                    remarks,
too, are applicable to both tables, and it will be observed
                                                                   that here,
as in the former table, the positions of maximum Inequality

spots, are, on the whole, near those
                                             for Toronto temperature and
Prague declination.       Nor is there, in our opinion, a greater corre
                                                               than between
spondence between sun-spots and declination-ranges
sun-spots and temperature- ranges.
    7. Comparison in Phase.
                              — This comparison is exhibited in Table IV,
which is precisely analogous to Table VI of our previous communica
                                                                 — 52, which
tion, except that here we have introduced the Inequality
 we had omitted from Table VI, because the Toronto Inequality
 was not sufficiently near the type.      It will be noticed from Table IV,
 that at least as far  as regards the  Toronto declination, the constancy
 of phase is not so evident as   for the  Inequalities around 24 days. It
 will likewise be remarked, that while the chief Toronto decliuation
 maximum, like that for Inequalities around 24 days, follows a little
 after the sun-spot maximum, the chief Prague declination maximum
 decidedly precedes the other two.       It thus appears that the similarity
 in time of maximum between          the    two declination stations which
 holds for Inequalities around 24 days (Table II) does not hold for
 Inequalities around 26 days.
     Broadly speaking, in both cases there are appearances of duplicity
 of phase, but in the case of Toronto the same maximum has remained
 the predominant one in both tables, while in the case of Prague the
 predominant maximum for the 24-day Inequalities has become the
  subsidiary maximum for those around 26 days.
     8. In attempted explanation of this we would in the first place
  desire to repeat the remark we made in our previous communication,
  namely, that there are two possible kinds of periodicity with regard
  to sun-spots, and that it is not necessary to regard the Inequali
  ties around 24 days and those around               26 days as perfectly
  similar phenomena.        Again, as regards the evidence we gave
  in a footnote to that communication, tending to show that the
  Inequalities around 26 days might denote the synodic periods with
  respect to the earth of those around 24 days, this evidence is,
   we find, borne out by the declination results.      We prefer, however,
  to wait until we have accumulated more information before we venture
  to discuss this important subject.     Meanwhile we shall content our
  selves with remarking that the similarity between the two stations,
   Toronto and Pi'ague, for the one set of magnetic Inequalities, and
  their dissimilarity for the other, is at first sight in favour of the
   theory of a physical difference of some sort between the two.           We

228              Prof. B. Stewart and Mr. W. L. Carpenter.        [Feb. 25,
have used the words at first sight, because, apart altogether from the
comparatively small number of the Inequalities discussed, there is a
strictly terrestrial consideration which we must not lose sight of.
    It is well known to all magneticians that we have not as yet arrived
at any wholly satisfactory method of separating between the disturbed
and the undisturbed magnetic observations, and the results now exhi
bited have unquestionably been deduced from observations which
include a good many disturbances.           Now under these circumstances
the effects of disturbances would only disappear from our results on
the hypothesis that such effects have no reference whatever to the
periodicities of which we have been treating — that they are, in fact,
non-periodic — so that they will        become eliminated in a sufficiently
extensive series of observations.        But we have much reason to sup
pose that this is not the case, for the observations of Professor Loomis
and of Mr. John Allan Broun would seem to indicate that short-
period Inequalities of sun-spots occasion terrestrial magnetic dis
 turbances, which follow closely on the celestial phenomena, so that a
 maximum of sun-spots is quickly followed by a maximum of dis
 turbance.        Now in the preceding tables we have discussed some of
 the most prominent solar Inequalities in connexion with their mag
 netic effects, and doubtless the result we have obtained is a composite
 one, its components       being an Inequality of solar diurnal declination-
 range (nndisturbed), and an Inequality of disturbance declination-
 range.      We may add that Toronto is a station where the disturbance
 is great, and also that the sun-spot Inequalities around 26 days are
 greater than those around 24 days.
                      Attempted Elimination of Disturbances.
     9.  All   these considerations point to the necessity of eliminating as
 much as possible the effect of disturbances before we venture to
  discuss our results.      We have attempted to do this in the following
 manner      : —
     First of all, we would remind the reader that the Inequalities
  around     24 and 26 days that we have been dealing with are most
  probably not all the Inequalities around these periods, but only the
  larger specimens of them.
     We remarked in our previous communication that observations
  founded on sun-spots might present the same variety of period, when
  treated as we have treated them, which they presented when
  treated in another way by Carrington, who found that the spots in one
  solar latitude had a different period of rotation from those in another.
  If there be any truth in this remark, we might expect that the few
  solar Inequalities which we have exhibited are only the most promi
  nent members of a comparatively large series, packed, it may be, so

   1886.]      Sun-spot Areas and Diurnal Declination-ranges.           229
   closely together that we cannot disentangle them completely by our
   limited series of observations.    Now it is probable that magnetic dis-
  turbances would limit themselves in great measure to the especially
   large solar Inequalities, so that if we could find some method of
   treating not merely the larger but all the Inequalities, we might
  probably rid ourselves to a considerable extent of the influence of
   disturbance.    But by our method we have the means of doing this.
  We possess for each element, for each period altogether over 100 series,
   representing    Inequalities extending from —52 to +52 of our
  notation.
       Furthermore, we have the same series of 24 years common to Toronto
  declination, Kew temperature, and Prague declination, and it is with
  this common series that we have made a comparison as follows. The
  Kew temperature Inequalities have virtnally only one maximum and
  one minimum, and we have selected all those in which it is possible to
  ascertain accurately the position of the maximum, that is to say, all
  those which are according to type.      Now let the Toronto and Prague
  declination Inequalities be set in all cases so as to start from the
  maximum of the corresponding Kew temperature Inequality, using of
  course for this purpose not the whole 36 years of Prague observa
  tions, but only 24 of these. We are thus comparing 24 years of
 simultaneous declination records at Toronto and at Prague, the setting
 being in each case from the maximum of the corresponding Kew tem
 perature record for the same 24 years.
      In this comparison all the Inequalities, great and small, may be
 imagined as made use of, and the influence of disturbance eliminated
 at least to a great extent.
      10. The results of this process are exhibited in the following table,
 and they may be at once compared with those given in Tables        II and
 IV. For the purpose of this comparison we have transferred the
 starting points of the modified Inequalities to the solar minimum, so
 as to make them comparable with those of the previous tables.         We
 can easily make the change from the knowledge derived from our
 previous paper that the Kew temperature maximum is about 2 day*
 before the solar maximum.
      The Toronto declination Inequality for 24 days is not greatly
altered by the modified process.
     In the Prague declination Inequality for 24 days the modification
produced causes the two maxima to be more clearly separated from
one another.
     In  both of these Inequalities as modified, the great maximum is not
long after the solar maximum.
     If  we turn next to the Inequalities around 26 days, we find that for
Toronto the subsidiary maximum of Table IV becomes when modified
the predominant one, and the prominent maximum of Table IV the

    Thus the result has been to do away with that want of similarity
 between the Toronto and Prague 26-day Inequalities which appeared
 in Table IV, and to substitute two series in which the predominant
 maximum of the one is near in position to that of the other, and the
 subsidiary maximum of the one near in position to that of the other.
    Nevertheless, the predominant maxima of the 24-day Inequalities
 agree most nearly in position with the subsidiary maxima of the
 26-day Inequalities. In fine, the Inequalities around 26 days are dif
 ferent from those around 24 days in much the same way for both
 stations.
    11.  It  appears to ns that these results are in favour of there being
 some physical difference between the Inequalities around 24 days and
 those around 26 days, or at least we may use this as a working hypo
 thesis.    Professor Stokes has suggested that an outbreak of solar

 1886.]       Sun-spot Areas and Diurnal Declination-ranges.            231
activity would probably alter the quality as well as the quantity of
 the solar rays, so as to bring in a greater proportion of those which
are absorbed in the upper regions of the atmosphere. We might pro
bably thus expect a set of terrestrial actions following promptly after
the solar outbreak. This is similar to what we have more especially in
the magnetic Inequalities around 24 days.
    On the other hand, if the Inequalities around 26 days are due to the
earth's being placed in a favourable position for receiving the solar
influence, we shall have a state of things physically different from that
which we imagine to characterise the Inequalities around 24 days, and
in our ignorance of the exact way in which the sun influences the
magnetism of the earth, we cannot assert that the Inequality pro
duced in the one case will be necessarily the same as that produced in
the other.
                    Apparent Progress of Magnetic Weather.
   12.   In orderto prevent ambiguity, it is desirable to define what we
mean by the apparent progress of magnetic weather.        If a particular
state of declination diurnal range — a maximum for instance — be
found to occur at Prague four days after it occurs at Toronto, and if
there is reason to believe that this difference in time depends upon the
distance between the stations, we should characterise the phenomenon
by terming it an apparent progress of magnetic weather from west to
east.  But this phrase must not be regarded as implying any theoreti
cal explanation of the observed fact, or as asserting that it is an actual
progress of matter in the direction from west to east which gives rise
to the phenomenon.
   It   is obvious that   if
                        such a progression exists it will be most readily
seen in the undisturbed observations, for it is one of the characteris
tics of a disturbance to occur simultaneously or nearly so at stations
far apart, while it is another characteristic to exalt the daily range.
Hence if disturbances       possess periodicity, the maxima        of their
periods  might  be  expected   to  occur  simultaneously   or nearly so at
stations far apart. Magnetical weather           is, however, something
different from disturbances, and denotes, as we have used the term, a
particular state or value of undisturbed diurnal magnetic range, just
as a particular state or value of diurnal temperature-range may be said
to denote a particular kind of meteorological weather. Again, in cer
tain preliminary investigations evidence has been given by one of us
tending to show that there       possibly a progress of magnetic weather
                                    is is
from west to east. But         clear that in making
                               it                      a comparison of this
nature not only must we get rid of disturbances as much as possible,
but we must likewise limit our comparison to Inequalities of the same
type or nearly so. Now both of these conditions are possessed by the
series of Table V, for in the first place we may imagine that they are
                                                               e   2

nearly freed from disturbance, and in the next place the two series are
very much alike in type.
    13. In order to compare the Inequalities of Table V we may con
sider the Pragne series as stationary and the Toronto as movable, and
take the algebraic addition of the two series in various relative posi
tions.     For instance, Toronto pulled backwards one or two divisions
(days)     to the left; both together; Toronto pushed forward 1, 2, 3,
4, 5, &c.,    divisions to the right. The algebraic sum of the two will
give the greatest range when the corresponding phases of the two
Inequalities are most nearly together.

     For the 24-day Inequalities the position of maximum area is some
 what undecided, the numbers bracketed being practically the same.
 On the whole we may consider that the middle point of this region,,
 which denotes " Toronto 4 to the right," expresses the nearest coin
 cidence in phase.
     For the 26-day Inequalities the maximum is when Toronto is
 pushed three divisions to the right. We may therefore state that a*
 far as this comparison is concerned, a given phase occurs at Toronto-
 three or four days before it occurs at Prague. In this preliminary in
 vestigation no account has been taken of the difference in longitude
 between the two stations as affecting the strict simultaneity of the
 diurnal ranges.
        Comparison between Temperature-ranges and Declination-ranges.
     14.   The Toronto temperature-ranges and the Prague declination-
  ranges are for the same series of 36 years, and if we compare
 together the corresponding Inequalities of these ranges as given in
  Tables     I  and III, we obtain the following result by taking the
 sums    :—

    We may conclude from this comparison that, as treated by our
method,       the   declination-ranges     and temperature-ranges            exhibit
Inequalities pretty much         of  the same magnitude.        There   is a  slight
excess of the declination over the temperature for the 26-day In
 equalities,   but these, being larger, may possibly be influenced by the
 results of disturbance to a greater extent than those around 24 days.
 Disturbance would doubtless increase the range.
    Again, while both kinds of Inequalities are very much of the same
 size, the results of this and of our previous paper lead us to conclude
 that the one set of Inequalities does not exhibit a closer correspondence
 with sun-spots than the other, so that as far as our experience goes
 there is no reason for saying that for short-period solar Inequalities
  the terrestrial result is more marked in magnetism than in me
  teorology.
     15.  It is perhaps worth while to exhibit the connexion between the
  temperature-range and the declination-range Inequalities in the fol
  lowing manner (p. 234).
     We have already (Art. 9) mentioned how the Kew temperature-
  ranges were used by us for setting the Inequalities whose mean result
  is given in Table V. Now if there be no perceptible physical relation
  between     temperature-range       and declination-range,     the declination-
  range Inequalities set by this method should have their corresponding
  phases distributed at random impartially up and down the paper. In
  Table    VII    we have exhibited the individual series representing
  Prague declination-ranges around 26 days that have been set by this
  method, only in order to save space we have grouped them into threes
  (with due regard to phase). It will, wo think, be seen from this
  table that, with comparatively few exceptions, minus numbers are
  grouped together in the upper part of the table, and plus numbers in
  the lower.
     The result is thus, in our opinion, in favour of that hypothesis
  which asserts a physical relationship between the two Inequalities.

    Among the samarskite        earths which concentrate towards the
middle of the fractionations there is one (or a group) which presents
in the radiant matter tube a well marked phosphorescent spectrum

   The measurements of the bands and lines are given below : —

Marignac    I  have been enabled to compare a specimen of Ta of his
own preparation with the earth described above. The two earths
agree in their chemical characteristics, and their phosphorescent
spectra are practically identical.
   No name has yet been given to this earth, as M. de Marignac appears
to be in some donbt whether it is not identical with J. Lawrence
Smith's earth mosandra.*          A specimen of mosandra prepared by
J. Lawrence Smith, and sent me by M. de Marignac, gave a phospho
rescent spectrum showing that it was compound, and that yttria was
one of its constituents.

   One of the anthors of this paper has already communicated to the
Physical Society of London (" Phil. Mag.," 1885) a method by which
a patch of monochromatic light could be thrown on a screen.            This
formed the starting point of the present investigation, which was to
ascertain whether it was practicable to compare with each other the
intensity of lights of different colours.
   The authors describe various plans they adopted to effect this
purpose, and finally found that by placing a rod in front of the patch
of monochromatic light, and of a candle by casting another shadow, the
intensities of the two lights could be compared by what they term an
oscillation method.     It is known that on each side of the yellow of
the spectrum the      luminosity more or less rapidly decreases.        By
placing a candle at such a distance from the screen that the luminosity
of the two shadows appears as approximately equal, it is easy to oscil
late the card carrying the slit through which the monochromatic rays
of the spectrum pass. (The slit is in the focus of the lens which helps
to form the spectrum.)      The shadow of the rod cast by the candle can
thus be made to appear alternately " too light " or " too dark " in com
parison with the shadow of the rod cast by the parts of the spectrum
falling on the screen. By a rapid oscillation the position of equality

 of the two shadows can he distinguished with great exactness. The
 authors describe their method of fixing the position of the rays employed
 and the source of light with which the spectrum is formed. They also
 enter into details as to the comparison light, the receiving screen,
 and the comparative value of the light as seen by them respectively.
 The curve of the intensity of the arc light spectrum, as seen by their
 eyes, which they call the normal curve, is then described.            The
 question as to the effect of an alteration of the colour of the com
 parison light is then discussed, as is the effect of the brightness of the
 spectrum.
    The next point touched upon is as to the value of mixed light as
compared with its components.          It is found that the following law
holds good, viz. : that " the sum of the intensities of two or more colours
is equal to the intensity of the same rays when mixed."         This law is
applied to Hering's theory of colour.
    The authors next state that with the majority of people the curve
of luminosity of the spectrum is identical with the normal curve, but
that in some cases slight differences may be observed, of which one
example is given. Such slight deficiency does not constitute colour
blindness, since the want of appreciation of any colour is but very
partial. They next describe observations made by four colour-blind
persons, and show that there is a remarkable divergence in their
curves from the normal.         The deficiency curves are shown, from
which it appears that two of the observers are totally blind to red,
whilst the other two are partially so. They then show that such
observers would not give a true value for any light which is not of
identically the same colour as the comparison light they might
 employ.    It also appears that the intensity of illumination felt by
a colour-blind is really less than that perceived by a normal-eyed
person.
   Two examples of the normal curve for sunlight are then given, one
taken on a day in July by the method of separating close lines by
means of varying illumination, and the other in November, by the
method adopted by the authors.          Their results are compared with
Vierordt's curve, obtained by extinguishing colour with white light.
   In order to ascertain the effect of the turbidity of a medium through
which light passes (for instance sunlight), the authors compared the
intensity of the spectrum after passing through clear water and turbid
water, and found that the absorption agreed with Lord Kayleigh's
theoretical deductions that I'=I0«_fa*-*, where I' is the intensity after
passing through a turbid medium, I0 the intensity after passing
through clear water, x the thickness of the turbid layer, k a constant
independent of X, X being the wave length.
   The authors conclude their paper with a discussion of the intensity
of incandescence of carbon electrically heated.

    An abstract of a paper on this subject has been already published,*
but the paper itself was withdrawn for the purpose of revision.              The
fresh experiments which have been for this purpose instituted during
the last year were made with improved apparatus, and the coefficient
of viscosity of air redetermined, with a view of enabling the author
to make more accurate correction for the effect of the resistance of the
air.t These more recent experiments on the loss of energy of a
torsionally vibrating wire, besides confirming the results of the older
ones, as far as the latter have been published, have furnished, more or
less in addition, the following facts relating to the internal molecular
friction of metals: —
    The proportionate diminution of amplitude is independent of the
amplitude, provided the deformations produced do not exceed a certain
limit. This limit varies with the nature of the metal, and is for
nickel very low.
    The logarithmic decrement of amplitude increases with the length
of the vibration-period, but in a less proportion than the latter, and
in a diminishing ratio.        The amount of increase of the logarithmic
decrement, attending on a given increase through a given range of
the vibration-period, varies with the nature of the metal, and with
those metals which possess comparatively               small internal friction
becomes     almost insensible.        It follows as a consequence that the

Society, January 14, 1886.

1886.]        Stress and     Strain on    the  Properties of Matter.         241
internal friction of metala differs from the viscosity of fluids, for in
cases of damping by the latter the logarithmic decrement is inversely
as the length of the vibration-period.
    Permanent molecular strain resulting from loading not carried to
a sufficient extent to produce sensible permanent extension, diminishes
the internal friction, and increases the torsional elasticity.
    Considerable     permanent      longitudinal extension and permanent
torsion produce     increase   of  internal    friction and diminution of tor
sional elasticity.     The effect of torsion is much greater than that of
extension,   and   the  increase of internal friction is much greater than
the decrease of torsional elasticity. As a consequence wire-drawing,
where we have permanent extension and torsion combined, sometimes
increases enormously the internal friction ; in fact in the case of six
different metals, it was found that by careful annealing the internal
friction was decreased from one-half to one-thirtieth of the original
amount of friction of the metals in the hard-drawn condition. Almost
equally remarkable is the effect of rapid fluctuations of temperature,
even through ranges of only one or two degrees centigrade, in in
creasing the internal friction.
   The internal friction of a metal wire, whether in the hard-drawn
or annealed condition, is temporarily decreased, and the torsional
elasticity is temporarily increased by loading not carried beyond a
certain limit, beyond this limit both the friction and the elasticity
become independent of the load.
   The " fatigue of elasticity," discovered by Sir William Thomson
in metal wires when vibrating torsionally, is not felt, provided the
deformations produced do not exceed a certain limit, depending upon
the nature of the metal. The above-mentioned limit is extraordi
narily low for nickel, so low, indeed, that it is difficult to avoid
" elastic fatigue " with this metal. This last consideration, and others
founded on the results of experiments on the effects of stress on the
physical properties of nickel, tend to show that the molecules of this
metal are comparatively easily rotated about their axes.
   The author agrees with Prof. G. Wiedemann, that the loss of
energy due to internal friction in a torsionally vibrating wire is mainly
due to the to-and-fro rotation of the molecules about their axes ; any
cause, therefore, which increases the molecular rotatory elasticity
diminishes the internal friction, and conversely.            The author has, by
various   means,   succeeded    in   bringing     down  the internal friction to-
such an extent that, in the case of one wire, it would have required
npwards of 15,000 vibrations to diminish the amplitude to one-half
of its initial value, provided the vibrations had been executed in
vacuo.
   The molecules of       a metal     tend   to   creep  into such positions  as
will ensure a maximum molecular rotatory elasticity, and they can be

   Rest after suspension, aided by oscillations at intervals, diminishes
 the internal friction of a wire which has been recently suspended, or
which after a long suspension has been subjected to considerable
molecular agitation by either mechanical or thermal agency.
   On the contrary, when a maximum molecular rotatory elasticity
has been reached, molecular agitation, if carried beyond a certain
limit, diminishes the elasticity ; hence the results of " fatigue of elas
ticity ;" and hence —
   Mechanical shocks and rapid fluctuations of temperature beyond
certain limits may considerably increase the internal friction, and,
though to a much less extent, diminish the torsional elasticity.
   The logarithmic decrement is independent of both the length and
diameter of the wire.

    This is the fundamental theorem of the paper ; it is shown that if
the power of a straight line and a circle be defined as the perpen
dicular from the centre of the circle on the straight line, and the
power of two straight lines as the cosine of the angle between them :
then the theorem is true if any of the circles of either system be
replaced by points, straight lines, or the line at infinity.
    Several special systems of circles are then discussed, the most
remarkable perhaps being the case when the circles (1, 2, 3, 4) being

circles connected with three circles ; a formula is given for the radius
of a circle which passes through three of the points of intersection of
three given circles ; the eight circles which can be drawn to touch

circle    however, defined as tan cos <u and of two great circles as

  Consequently the results obtained previously are extended                                         with
but slight modification.
     In Part     III the   method of           Part I    is    applied to spheres   ;   it   is   proved
at once that the powers                 of any systems of spheres must satisfy the

    This paper comprises a revised version of one submitted to the
  Royal Society in 1881, under the title " Effects of Stress on the
  Thermoelectric Quality of Metals, Part I,"* along with much new
  matter.   It deals principally with the cyclic changes of thermoelectric
 quality  which   an iron wire undergoes when exposed to cyclic variations
 of stress (described in the abstract of the former paper), and with
 the relations of these changes of thermoelectric quality to the changes
 of magnetism which also occur as an effect of stress. Stress was
 applied by exposing the wire to longitudinal pull by means of loads.
 The changes both of thermoelectric quality and of magnetism exhibit
 that tendency to lag behind the changes of stress to which in a
 previous paperf the author gave the name hysteresis, and the effects
 are sufficiently similar in regard to the two qualities to suggest that
 the changes of thermoelectric          quality occur as secondary effects of
changes    of  magnetism.       To  examine    whether this is the case, simul
 taneous measurements of the magnetic and thermoelectric effects of
 stress in an iron wire were made, and also independent observations of
the thermoelectric effects of magnetisation, without change of stress.
A comparison of these made it clear that stress causes change in
thermoelectric quality of iron directly, and not as a secondary effect
of magnetisation.       If the wire be completely demagnetised to begin
with, and kept clear of all magnetisation during the application and
removal of stress, the presence of hysteresis is not less marked than
before. Experiments are given to show how the thermoelectric effects
of stress are modified by the existence of more or less magnetisation
in the wire   ; and conversely,     how the thermoelectric effects of mag
netism are modified by the existence of more or less constant .stress.
The influence of vibration in destroying the effects of hysteresis is
investigated, and also the result of exposing the wire to the process of
demagnetising by repeated rapid reversals of a continuously dimi
nishing magnetising force, and it is shown that this process acts in
the same     way as vibration in destroying the effects of hysteresis.
Residual effects of hysteresis are studied, as, for example, the diffe
rence which presents itself when a wire is magnetised after having

  been loaded strongly and then unloaded down to a certain constant
 state of stress, and, on the other hand, when the same state of stress
 has been produced by simply increasing the load ; and it is shown that
 these residual effects are wiped out by vibration or by demagnetising
 by reversals.     With regard to the effect of stress on thermoelectric
 quality,  it is shown that if  a somewhat   soft wire be more and more
 strongly magnetised, these effects become' more and more similar to
 those which are found when the wire is hard drawn, but not magnet
 ised.    A few experiments were made with wires of silver, copper,
 lead,   magnesium, and German silver, but in none of these was
 hysteresis of thermoelectric quality with regard to load discovered.
    Special attention is directed to a peculiar feature in the curves by
 means of which the experimental results are exhibited.            In curves
showing the relation of thermoelectric electromotive force to load, it
 is shown that any reversal from loading to unloading, or vice versa,
causes an inflection in the curve, the first effect of the new process
being to continue the kind of change that was going on before.          That
this is not due to any mechanical disturbance which the loading or
 unloading produces, is shown by the fact that it occurs in an equally
marked way after the molecules have been brought to a condition of
stable equilibrium by vibrating the wire before beginning to load or
unload.     It is suggested that the effects of hysteresis, described in the
paper, have a possible relation to the properties which Professor
Osborne Reynolds has recently shown to be possessed by granular
media.
    The experiments described in the paper are closely connected with
those which were communicated in January, 1885, under the title
"
   Experimental Researches in Magnetism," and are now being pub
lished by the Society.     They were conducted in the Physical Labora
tory of the University of Tokio, in 1881-3, partly with the help of
one   of the author's Japanese students, Mr. P. S. Sakai. The results
are given graphically, and are for the most part reduced to absolute
measure.

I. " The Relationship      of the Activity of Vesuvius to Certain
     Meteorological    and  Astronomical Phenomena." By Dr. H. J.
     Johnston-Lavis. Communicated by Professor Judd, F.R.S.
     Received February 26, 1886.
                                (Abstract).
   The determination of the relations, if any such exist, between
volcanic activity and certain astronomical or meteorological pheno
mena, cannot fail to throw mnch light upon the vexed question of the
solid or liquid condition of the earth's interior. M. Perrey, as the
result of his careful catalogue of earthquake phenomena, believed
himself to have proved that these could be shown to have certain
maxima and minima, which correspond with positions of the moon
in relation to the earth and sun ; there are many considerations which
point to the conclusion that great and sudden changes in barometric
pressure may be followed by outbursts of volcanic violence; and,
finally, if the eruptions of volcanoes, as many geologists believe, are
due to water percolating from the surface to a heated magma, rain
fall must have no inconsiderable influence in determining the periods
of their occurrence.
   The author of the paper has made use of the opportunity of a
residence in the neighbourhood of Vesuvius, to chronicle, according
to a scale devised by himself, the varying quantities of vapour emitted
from the crater during its usual quiet and continued (Strombolian)
stage of eruption ; the period of every new outflow of lava, or of any
increase in the flow of lava was also noted.         These observations
having been carried on daily for a period of one year and nine months
— from October, 1883, to June, 1885 — were recorded in tabular form
side by side with the moon's quadratures and position in her orbit ;
with these are also arranged the daily records of the height of the

barometer,    and the amount of rainfall supplied to the author by
Professor Brioschi of the Capodimonte Observatory.
    From the discussion of these tables, it is concluded by the author
that there is a striking relationship between the curves which mark
sudden changes in atmospheric pressure and those which indicate
distinct variations in the volcanic activity. As regards the relation
of changes in volcanic activity with the lunar positions, the author
speaks with greater doubt, the period over which the observations
have extended being insufficient to justify definite conclusions ; but
he believes that his observations point to distinct tidal influences as
affecting the liquid magma beneath the volcano.
II. " On     an Apparatus for connecting and disconnecting              a
       Receiver under Exhaustion by a Mercurial Pump." By
       J. T. BOTTOMLEY, M.A., F.R.S.E. Communicated by Sir
        William Thomson, F.R.S. Received March 1, 1886.
    In experimental work with vacua, and especially with the high
vacua given by the Sprengel pump, a connecting tap has often been
much wished for which would enable the experimenter to remove
a piece of apparatus from the pump for examination or preliminary
experiment, and afterwards to reapply it to the pump without dis
 charging the vacuum.       So far as I am aware nothing satisfactory has
 hitherto been suggested. The ground glass stopcocks now made by
 some of the German and English glass workers are undoubtedly very
 highly finished ; but sooner or later, even with the best of them, the
air begins to work its way round the grinding marks, in spite of lubri
 cants, and, worse than this, when the apparatus under exhaustion
 has been removed from the pump and gauges, there is no way of
 knowing whether or not the air is leaking in round the interstices of
the ground glass stopcock.
     To meet this difficulty,  I  have recently constructed a mercurial
vacuum tap, which is certainly impervious to air, and which will, I
think, be found to work easily and conveniently.       In constructing it
 I  have taken advantage of a tap described by Mr. C. H. Gimingham
(" Proc. Roy. Soc.," No. 176, 1876), by means of which a piece of appa
ratus may be disconnected from the pump without discharging the
vacuum of the pump ; and thus by means of the complete tap, which
 I  proceed to describe, the apparatus under experiment can be separated
from the pump and replaced without either the pump or the appa
ratus being discharged.
     The tap consists of three parts. AB is a tube containing a glass
 float, of which the upper end is conical, and ground very carefuily at

 M the apparatus which is to be exhausted would be blown on. At C
 there is an ordinary cup and stopper, ground to a very perfect fit,

and the   joint at C is made perfectly air-tight in the usual way by
pouring mercury into the cup. At the lower extremity of the part
CD is a stopper closed at the bottom, but with a fine hole drilled at p ;
and in the tube of the cup EE there is a fine groove cut, which reaches
half way up the ground part of the tube and stopper top; but above
p there is a sufficient length of grinding to make a perfect joint.*
When the hole p is turned round to meet the groove, there is com
munication through and through the tap, that is to say, from the

 pump below F to the apparatus attached to M ; but when the opening
p is turned away from the groove the pump is cut off.
    Suppose now that above p there is a vacuum, and that p is turned
 round so as to cut off the pump.        Let the stopper at C be cautiously
 raised.   Mercury flows from the cup C, and in the first place fills
  up the  space below, and fresh mercury must be supplied to the cup
 and the supply kept up. The whole of the lower part of the space
 being filled, the mercury rises in the tube CB, lifts the glass float, and
 closes the opening aa with great pressure.        To hold up the stopper at
  C during the flowing in of the mercury requires considerable force
 with an opening at C of an ordinary size ; but as soon as the whole
 space from aa down to the bottom of D has been, filled, the part of
 this force which is due to air pressure vanishes, and the stopper may
 be separated from C safely.        The mercury in the tube AB does not
 drop ont, as the orifice at e is very small ; and thus there is nothing
 to prevent the apparatus under exhaustion being handled in any way
 that may be desired.
    When the apparatus is to       be reconnected with the pump, it is only
 necessary   to replace  the  stopper in the cup C, and turn the hole p
 round to meet its groove. The mercury in the tube AB then drops
 into the pump. The float falls into its lowest position, and everything
 is once more as it was before the removal of the apparatus from the
 pump.
 III.  " Comparative Effects of different parts of the Spectrum on
       Silver Salts." By Captain W. de W. Abney, R.E., F.B.S.
       Received March 2, 1886.
    In 1881 I communicated to the Royal Society (" Proc. Roy. Soc.,"
vol. 33) the results of a research 1 had made on the comparative
effects of different parts of the spectrum on the haloid salts of silver,
and 1 pointed out that a mixture of iodide and chloride, and iodide
and bromide of silver gave rise to a very curious photographic
spectrum, a minimum of action taking place at G, the point where the
iodide is mostly affected, two maxima consequently occurring. 1
also gave some theoretical reasons why this should be. About a year
afterwards Herr Schumann, of Leipzic, called in question this result,
as applied to bromo-iodide of silver, when the two salts were formed
simultaneously, i.e., when mixtures in water of soluble bromides and
iodides were precipitated        together   by silver nitrate.   He subse
quently found that a mixture of the two salts after separate precipi
tation did give rise to a double maximum.         Now my own experiments
showed that in either case such double maxima existed, but perhaps

252                Captain W. de W. Abney.           Effects     of        [Mar. 18,
they were more marked when the salts were precipitated separately.
The only method at that time available to distinguish the maxima
was by the appearance of a negative photograph of the spectrum
impressed upon      it,
                    and hence there was a liability to be deceived,
sinco densities in deposit which are nearly alike are apt to be over
looked.
 I  utilised my method ("Phil. Mag.," 1885) of obtaining patches of
monochromatic     light from the spectrum, in examining afresh dif
ferent salts of silver as regards sensitiveness to different rays.   The
experiments    were conducted in the following manner —-A sensi-      :
tometer, designed by Mr. Spurge, was brought into use              Photo   ("
graphic Journal,"        1882, vol.vi). This consists of a series of small
chambers, about           cm. square in section, and    cm. deep.
                    1                                   2           Below
these   chambers    is    a sheet of brass, punctured as shown in the
figure, each such puncture        corresponding    with the square chamber.
Numbers are also punctured in the brass triangle, to correspond to
the order of intensity in which the light   admitted to each chamber.
                                              is
Below this brass plate can be placed a sensitive plate to be tested.
The tops of the chambers are also closed by a brass plate, in which
holes of different diameters are punctured.   The area of each hole is
V2 that of the next, and the total number of chambers       30.   It       is
will be thus seen that the difference in light from an equally illu
minated surface admitted to the first and last holes   immense.

   To obtain a surface equally illuminated two sheets of finely ground
glass were used, one placed about one-eighth of an inch from the holes,
and the other about a centimetre        away from the first.          It   was found

1886.]      Different Parts   of   the Spectrum   on Silver Salts.          253
that when the outside ground glass was illuminated by a candle about
3 feet away, the light shading every part of the bottom of each
chamber was for all practical purposes uniform.      A patch of mono
chromatic solar light from one part of the spectrum was then thrown
on the ground glass, and an exposure of 30 seconds given to a plate
in contact with the brass punctured plate at the bottom of the cham
bers.   Another portion of the spectrum was next thrown on a fresh
sensitive surface, and a similar operation carried out, and so on till
the whole of the range of the spectrum had been utilised.      In each
set of experiments it is scarcely needful to remark the same batch of
plates was employed.    All the plates were developed together for the
same length of time, and the number of the chamber noted where no
photographic action was visible. Thus if No. 8 showed a trace of
photographic action, and No. 9 showed none, No. 9 was taken as a
measure.     All    these numbers were then tabulated, and the admitted
light calculated.
  Another series of      experiments  were then conducted precisely as
before, the length of    exposure being varied, and the numbers observed
were again tabulated      and compared with the first set. A third series
was then taken, and       a mean of the results taken.    The plates were
next fixed and the numbers read, and the light again calculated, with
the result that the mean corresponded with the first mean.         As a
final check, each set of plates were printed on uniformly sensitised
paper, and the gradations obtained by the method described in my
Treatise on Photography (Longmans).         The results obtained were
almost identical with the first means. Various salts of silver and
combinations of salts were tried, but      I
                                          need only give one, which is
that which has been disputed.    The figure gives a graphic description
of the results obtained.   This series of plates was prepared with a
mixture of 6 per cent. of iodide, and 94 per cent. of bromide of silver,
and the two were precipitated together.      It was somewhat difficult
in a photograph of the spectrum, containing but little iodide, to be
sure of this dip at G, owing to the occurrence of Frannbofer lines.
The method adopted brings the dip clearly into view. It might be
thought that the strong band of lines near G produced         but such
                                                                 it,
is  not the case, as pure bromide of silver without any admixture of
iodide did not show it, and the one maximum of sensitiveness                 it
had lay nearer G.
   In the mixed salt which was experimented upon we thus still get
two maxima, though the percentage of iodide and bromide              but
                                                                       is
small.    The same line of argument which was applied in the paper           I
have already referred to as to the cause of this dip near G, still
therefore   applies.

   The following are the general conclusions to which this inquiry has
led :—
   1. The law of gaseous mixtures, as enunciated by Dalton, is largely
deviated from in the case of mixtures of nitrogen and carbonic acid
at high pressures, and is probably only strictly true when applied to
mixtures of gases in the so-called perfect state.
   2. The critical point of temperature is lowered by admixture with
a permanent gas.
   3. When carbonic acid gas and nitrogen diffuse into each other at
high pressures, the volume of the mixture is increased.
   4. In a mixture of liquid carbonic acid and nitrogen at temperatures
not greatly below the critical point, the liquid surface loses its curva-
ture, and is effaced by the application of pressure alone, while at
lower temperatures the nitrogen is absorbed in the ordinary way, and
the curvature of the liquid surface is preserved so long as any portion
of the gas is visible.

       Communicated by W. S. Savory, F.R.S. Received March 8,
       1886.
    The paper is based upon 55 dissections, 32 foetal and 23 adult.
    The posterior thoracic is formed by the 5th, 6th, and usually the 7th.
 The 5th supplies the first two digitations, the 6th the next two, the
 6th and 7th the lower five, or if there is no 7th, the 5th may supply
 three, and join the 6th for the remainder.
    The suprascapular is given off from the 5th, with or without a
minute fibre from the 6th.
    The anterior thoranics are formed usually by the 6th, the 7th, the
 8th, and the 9th.    The 6th and 7th form the external, supplying the
 upper part of the peotoralis major, the 7th gives the communicating
 branch which supplies the middle, and the union of this with the
internal from the 8th and 9th, supplies the lower part of the muscle.
The minor is supplied by the 7th, 8th, and 9th.
    The coraco brachialis is supplied by the 7th.
    The rest of the musculo cutaneous is formed by the 5th and 6 th.
Both nerves enter the biceps and brachialis anticus.        The cutaneous
 branch is mostly from the 6th, slightly also from the 5th.
    The median is formed by the 6th, 7th, 8th, and 9th.
    The 6th supplies the pronator teres, flexor carpi radialis, superficial
thenar muscles, and radial finger, or fingers.
    The 7th supplies the flexor sublimis, occasionally the anterior
interosseous, the palmar cutaneous, and the finger next the 6th.
    The 8th supplies the flexor sublimis, the anterior interosseous, and
the fingers inside the 7th.
    The 9th supplies the anterior interosseous, and usually ends there.
    The ulnar is formed by the 8th and 9th ; the muscles in the forearm
are supplied by both, those in the hand by the 8th.      The 9th supplies
the cutaneous branches in front, the 8th the dorsal branch.

   The internal and lesser internal cutaneous are usually supplied by the
9th, the former occasionally by the 8th as well.
   The posterior branches : —
   The subscapularis is supplied by branches from the 5th and 6th
only ; the teres major by the 6th, often with a twig from the 7th ; the
latissimus dorsi by the 7th, often with a twig from the 8th.
   The circumflex is formed by the 5th and 6th. The latter is not
traced to the teres minor.      Both go to the deltoid.       The cutaneous
branch is formed by the 5th alone, or by both.
   The musculospiral is formed by the 6th, 7th, and 8th ; sometimes
the 5th, and rarely the 9th, send branches to it.
   The triceps is supplied by the 7th and 8th. The long head usually
by the 8th, the inner head by the 7th and 8th, and the outer by the
7th. The 6th sometimes runs to the outer head.
   The internal cutaneous branch comes from the 8th. The short
external cutaneous springs from the 6th, the long varies round the
7th. The brachialis anticus, supinator longus, and supinator brevis
are supplied by the 6th.
   The extensor carpi radialis longor and brevior are supplied by the
6th or 7th, usually the latter.
    The radial is supplied by the 6th alone, or by the 6th and 7tb.
    The posterior interosseous is usually from the 7th alone, sometimes
with aid from the 8th.
    The nerves, both sensory and motor, are shown to obey the follow
ing law : —
    I. Any given fibre may alter its position relative to the vertebral
         column, but will maintain its position relative to other fibres.
    An exceptional   case is detailed in exemplifying this law.
    The muscles are classed in a table, according to their motor nerve
 supply.
    The system of the motor supply appears to be not according
 to use, but according to position, morphological not functional, arid
 obeys the following law, composed of three rules : —
    II. A. Of   two muscles, or of two parts of a muscle, that which is nearer
              the head  end  of the body tends to be supplied by the higher,
              that which is nearer the tail end by the lower nerve.
        B. Of two muscles, that which is nearer the long axis of the body
              tends to be supplied by the higher, that which is nearer the
             periphery by the lower nerve.
        C. Of two muscles, that which is nearer the surface tends to be sup
              plied by the higher, that which is further from it by the lower
              nerve.
     These rules are applied in detail.

    The system of the sensory supply is examined in detail.               It is shown
to follow a law composed of two rules : —
   III.    A. Of    two spots   on the skin, that which       is nearer the  preaxial
                 border tends to be supplied by the higher nerve.
           B. Of   two spots  in the preaxial area,    the lower tends to be supplied
                  by the lower nerve,    and of two spots in the postaxial area,
                 the lower tends to be supplied by the higher nerve.
     It  is shown that this is the case with all membranes stretched into
 a sheath by something pushing out into them, and the epiblastic layer
 of the epidermis is compared to such a membrane, pushed into a tubal
 sheath by the developing mesoblast.
     A note is added showing that other observers have reached similar
 results by other methods, and notably that Forgue has formulated
 laws for the motor nerves of the monkey, identical with those laid
 down in the present paper.

       Guthrie, F.R.S.            Received March 10, 1886.
     In a paper communicated to the Royal Society about a year ago,*
 I   discussed the results of certain experiments made by Joule in rela
 tion to " the Effects of Magnetism upon the dimensions of Iron and
 Steel     Bars."t
     It   is well known that the length of an iron rod is in general slightly
 increased by magnetisation.           Joule enunciated the law that the elonga
 tion is proportional         in  a  given bar to the square of the magnetic
 intensity, and that it ceases to increase after the iron is fully saturated.        J
 My own experiments, made with a greater range of magnetising forces
 and with thinner rods than those used by Joule, show that if the
  magnetising current is gradually increased after the so-called satura
  tion point of the iron has been reached, the elongation, instead of
  remaining at        a maximum,     is diminished,     until when the current has
  attained a certain strength, the original length of the rod is unaltered,
  and if this strength be exceeded, actual retraction is produced.
      Joule also found that when the experiment was performed upon an
  iron wire stretched by a weight, the magnetic extension was in all

cases diminished,      and    if the weight were considerable, magnetisation
 caused retraction instead of elongation.              From these facts he appears
 to have formed the conclusion that, under a certain critical tension,
 (differing for different specimens of iron, but independent of the
 magnetising force) magnetisation would produce no effect whatever
 upon the dimensions of the wire. In one of his experiments * a cer
tain iron wire loaded with a w.eight of 408 lbs. was found to be
 slightly elongated when magnetised ; the weight was then increased
to 740 lbs. with the result that magnetisation was accompanied by a
 slight retraction. In both cases the magnetising currents varied over
 a considerable range, and the smaller ones were without any visible
                                                                                  "
effect.    Commenting upon these results, Joule conjectured that with
a tension     of about 600 lbs. [which number              I suppose is selected as
being roughly the mean of 408 and 740] the effect on the dimensions
of the wire would cease altogether in the limits of the electric currents
employed in the above experiments. "f
    In reference to this surmise
" If he had actually made the
                                        JI   ventured the following remark: —
                                           experiment, he would perhaps have
found that the length of the wire was increased by a weak current,
that   a current of medium strength would have had no effect whatever,
and that one of his stronger currents would have caused the wire to
retract."     I  had, in fact, reason to believe that the effect of tension
was to diminish the          "critical magnetising        force" (which produces
maximum elongation)           so  that the retraction which is found to occur
in all iron rods when a sufficient magnetising force is employed, is
observed with smaller magnetising currents when the rod is stretched
than when it is free,§ but want of suitable apparatus prevented me
from submitting this idea to the test of direct experiment.
    I have lately modified the instrument, which is described in my
former paper, in such a manner that it can be used for observing the
effects of magnetisation          upon rods and wires under traction.               The
working part of       it  is shown in diagrammatic section             in the  annexed
figure.     The coil CC contains 876 turns of copper wire, l-22 mm. in
diameter, wound in 12 layers on a brass tube with boxwood ends.                       To
the lower end A of the tube is fitted a brass plug or stopper, having

   § My belief was principally founded upon the fact that while the critical mag
netising force appeared in all the cases which 1 had examined to be about twice that

itself occurred at an earlier stage when the wire was stretched than when it was
unstretched.

actuates a short arm   E attached to the back of a small circular mirror
M   ; the mirror is capable of turning abont its horizontal diameter
upon knife-edges, resting upon brass planes not shown in the figure.
By means of a lantern illuminated by a lime-light, the image of a
horizontal wire is, after reflection from a mirror, projected upon a
distant vertical scale ; a very slight deflection of the mirror causes a
considerable movement of the image. The dimensions are as follows : —
The distance SD = 10 mm., SE = 170 mm., ME = 7 mm. ; the dis
tance from the mirror to the scale = 6400 mm., each scale division
 = 0-64 mru., and the length of the experimental rod between the
clamps = 100 mm. The movement of the focussed image through one
scale division therefore indicates a difference of about one five-
millionth part* in the length of the rod. The mirror is very ac
curately worked, and is silvered upon its outer surface ; the lens used
for the projection is a compound achromatic of high quality, and it is
easy to read with accuracy to a half or even a quarter of a scale
 division.
   The magnetising coil is 11*5 cm. long between the boxwood
ends ; its external diameter is 5'2 cm. and internal diameter 1*9 cm.
A current of C amperes produces at its centre a field of about 92 C
units.
   It will be seen from the above description that the wire under
 examination sustains the whole weight of the magnetising coil as well
as that of the lever R.      In order to ascertain the amount of the
tension thus produced, the brass rod P was suspended from a hook
beneath one pan of a large balance, and it was found that in order to
maintain the lever R in a horizontal position it was necessary to
place weights amounting to slightly more than 3 lbs. in the other
scale pan.    In all experiments with this apparatus, therefore, the
iron wire is stretched by a minimum initial load of 3 lbs. For some
reasons this is a disadvantage, and the arrangement in question was
not adopted until many experiments had made it evident that by no
other method was it possible to avoid with certainty the source of
error introduced by the electromagnetic action commonly known as
solenoidal suction between the coil and the wire.        When the coil is
fixed independently    of the  wire,   the  smallest  trace of this action
produces upon the lever an effect which is enormously exaggerated in
the deflection of the image upon the scale. The wire may be placed
as accurately as it is possible to do so by measurement, with its
middle point in the centre of the coil ; but a change in the stretching
weight will at once displace it to a small but material extent; and
even if the geometrical coincidence were perfect, a slight want of
uniformity in the physical qualities of the wire would still render
the objectionable action possible.     Under ordinary circumstances the

  disturbance thus introduced would of course be altogether insensible ;
  but in making measurements in which a hundred-thousandth of a
  millimetre is a considerable quantity, it is far from negligible, as indeed
  was sufficiently proved by the inconsistency of the results obtained
  in some of my earlier experiments when the wire was free and the
  coil attached to the table T.* After the coil had been suspended
  upon the wire all such inconsistency at once disappeared, for no inter
  action between the two could then produce any external effect.
      Since the apparatus was not calculated to bear any very heavy
  weight it was necessary to use wires of small sectional area. Thin
  wires moreover possess an advantage in becoming more strongly
  magnetised by a given current than thick wires of the same length.
     The results of a series of experiments are presented in a synoptical
  form in the subjoined Table. Four specimens of iron were used.
  The first was a wire of commercial iron, 1*2 mm. in diameter, which
  had been softened by heating in a gas flame ; the second was a strip
 of annealed charcoal iron, 5'5 mm. wide and 0-55 mm. thick, its
 sectional area being about 3 mm.; the third was a piece of hard
 unaunealed wire, 2'6 mm. in diameter; and the last was a wire of
 very pure soft iron, 3'25 mm. in diameter, which had been carefully
 annealed.      These were successively fixed in the apparatus, and
 loaded with weights varying from 3 lbs. — that of the coil and lever
 alone — to a total of 14 lbs. While under the influence of each load,
 four observations were made in the case of each wire : (1) A deter
 mination was attempted of the smallest magnetising current which
 sensibly affected the length of the wire in the direction of elongation
 or retraction. (2) The current producing maximum elongation (if
 any), and the extent of such maximum elongation were found.
 (3) A determination was made of the critical current which was
 without effect upon the original length of the wire, i.e., the current
 of such strength that a weaker one would cause elongation and a
 stronger one retraction.         (4) The retraction produced by a fixed
 current of 1'6 ampere was measured.
     The first operation, that of finding the smallest current which pro
 duced a sensible deflection, was not easy to perform satisfactorily.
 Small differences in the disposition of the lever and mirror might
    • The same source of error troubled me much in the experiments described in
my former paper until   I adopted a similar method of avoiding it. The apparatus
used by Joule was far larger, more massive, and presumably less delicate than mine.
In the instrument employed in his stretching experiments the lever alone without
any additional weight produced a tension in the wire of 80 lbs. Errors arising
from solenoidal suction would therefore be less sensible, but it is difficult to believe
that some of his results were not affected by them, especially in the case of the
experiment (No. 8) on hard steel described at p. 245 of the Reprint, which     I believe
no one has succeeded in repeating.

well canse variations in the readiness with which the arrangement
would respond to a movement equivalent to less than one-tenth of a
scale division. Nevertheless it is clear in spite of one or two dis
crepancies that a greater magnetising force is necessary to cause a
sensible elongation when the load is great than when it is small.         In
one case, that of the thin wire under a load of 14 lbs., there was no
evidence of any elongation.      It is probable, judging by analogy, that
a maximum elongation,       too small, however, for the instrument to
detect, would occur with a current of about 0-12 ampere.           Whether
any load, however great, would render the preliminary elongation of
the wire too small to be measured by an ideally perfect instrument is
uncertain.
   The second determination could be made with far greater accuracy.
Hut the load had the effect of flattening the apex of the elongation
curve in such a manner that the actual maximum was not so sharply
denned as in the case of free rods.
   The third determination, that of the magnetising current under the
influence of which the original length of the wire was unaltered, was
susceptible of great accuracy, and was the most important for the
purpose of the present investigation.
   The measurement of the amount of retraction caused by a given
strong current was also perfectly easy and certain.
   The figures recorded in the table disclose the following facts : —
   1. The effects produced by magnetisation upon the length of an
iron wire stretched by a weight, are in general of the same character
as those which have been shown in my former paper to occur in the
case of a free iron rod.   Under the influence of a gradually increasing
magnetising force such a wire is at first elongated (unless the load
be veiy great), then it returns to its original length, and finally it
contracts.
   2.  The maximum       elongation diminishes     as  the  load   increases
according to a law which seems to vary with different qualities of
iron. If the ratio of the weight to the sectional area of the wire
exceeds a certain limit, the maximum      elongation  (if any) is   so small
that the instrument fails to detect it.
    3. The retraction dne to a given magnetising force is greater with
heavy than with light loads.
   4. Both maximum elongation and neutrality (i.e., absence of both
elongation and retraction) occur with smaller magnetising currents
when the load is heavy than when it is light ; retraction, therefore,
begins at an earlier stage.      Thus the anticipation expressed in my
former paper is justified.
    5. The effects both of elongation and of retraction are, as might be
expected, greater for thin than for thick wires, and for soft than for
bard iron.

                             Addition, April 3rd, 1886.
    It would     be   difficult for anyone who has not actually seen the
apparatus above described to appreciate its extreme delicacy, and the
accuracy with which it is capable of measuring such minute quan
tities as would commonly be regarded as infinitesimal.* It has been
suggested to me that greater value would be attached to the expe
rimental results contained in the present and former papers if the
manner in which they were arrived at were described in greater
detail, and a few of the actual scale readings given in full.
    In the case of the twelve series of observations to which the table
given in this paper relates, my method of proceeding was as follows : —
 The iron wire having been placed in position and loaded with a
weight, a short time was allowed for the apparatus to attain a nearly
steady temperature.              The reflected image of the indicating wire
 (which     I will  call  the     index) was then, by means of the fine screw
adjustment, brought upon the upper half of the scale, the zero point
of which was in the middle, and the index, which, owing to small
variations of temperaturet, was rarely absolutely at rest, was watched
until its upper edge nearly coincided with one of the scale divisions.
The number of this division was noted and recorded from my dicta
tion, and at the instant when exact coincidence occurred, a contact
key was depressed, which caused a current of 1'6 ampere to pass
through the coil.          The number of the scale division nearest to which
the index was deflected was again noted and recorded as before ; and
if the point which the index reached happened to be exactly midway
between two divisions, the reading was recorded to half a scale divi
sion.      When the deflections were small, the readings were taken to
the nearest half scale division ; but this, though easy enough, was in
general considered to be a needless refinement.
    The next course was to find by a tentative method the strengths of
the three currents which respectively produced — (1) the first sensible
elongation;       (2) the maximum elongation; (3) neither elongation
nor retraction ; and in order to do this, the resistance in the circnit
was varied by means of a large set of coils, and a succession of currents
of different      strengths (perhaps from twenty to fifty in number, or
sometimes even more) were caused to pass through the apparatus.                        J
   * The instrument    was exhibited in action at the Soiree of the Royal Society,  May,
1885.
   t  Taking the coefficient    of expansion of iron to be 0'00O0122 per degree C, the
heat elongation    due to a  rise  of temperature of one degree would produce a deflec
tion of sixty-one scale divisions ; but in addition to the iron there was a somewhat
greater length of brass, and if this shared in the heat expansion, a total deflection of
more than 150 scale divisions per degree would be produced.
   J  It is of course understood that the circuit was actually closed by the key only

These currents        having been determined, the final step was to repeat
the first observation of the retraction produced by the fired current
of 1"6 ampere, and thus to check the accuracy of the experiment.

   The efficiency of the apparatus is due partly to the perfection of the
optical arrangements and partly to the fact that in the moving parts
unnecessary lightness has not been acquired at the expense of sufficient
massiveness and rigidity.

   The sphincter muscles of the anus of Crocodilia are differentiations
of the postpelvic portion of the system of the m. rectus abdominis
rather than of the true caudal muscles.
   The copulatory muscles of the Carinatae are derived from the m.
sphincter ani solely, whilst in the Ratitre they are also differentiations
of muscles which are still attached to the pelvis, and are, therefore,
skeleto-genital.
   The mammalian       sphincter ani does not take a share in the muscle
supply of the copulatory organ, and thus exhibits a difference from
Birds and Lizards.
   Distinctly copulatory muscles in the Mammalia are derived from
skeletal and from non-striped muscles.        In this respect the Mammalia
agree with Crocodilia and Chelonia.

   Lizards and snakes together represent a special type.
   Hatteria comes nearest the Amphibia, or the embryonic condition of
Sauropsida ; bears, however, resemblance to the Lizards.
   Chelonia represent a type somewhat intermediate between that of
the RatitaB and Crocodilia and that of the Monotremata, at the same
time bearing slight resemblance to that of the Sauria.

    Then the anal sacs or cloacal bladders of the Chelonia are critically
 discussed with reference to experiments on their being able to take in
water.
    Then follows a discussion of the peritoneal canals.
    The cloacal and copulatory organs of the Chelonia lead with com
 paratively slight modifications to the Monotremata, from which again
a continuity of stages up to the highest Placentalia can be traced.
    The whole cloaca of the Amniota consists originally, either per
manently or in the embryo only, of three successive chambers which
may be distinguished as follows : —
       I. The Proctodaeum (termed thus by Professor Lankester).        It
             is the outermost anal chamber of epiblastic origin.    With
            its derivatives : (1) Bursa Fabricii in birds ; (2) various
             hedonic glands     in most Amniota ; (3) the copulatory
             organs,  the  at least partly epiblastic nature of which is
             indicated by the frequently developed horny armament of
             the glans, by the various sebaceous glands, and as shown in
            this paper by its development.
     II.  The Urodaeum, from ovpov and Saiov. Hypoblastic. This is
            the middle chamber or primitive cloaca, into which open
            the urinogenital ducts, and through which pass the faeces.
            With its differentiations : (1) urinary bladder, ventral ;
             (2) anal sacs in Tortoises, dorsal.
   III.   The Coprodaeum, from 4coV/k>s and Saiov. This is the innermost
            cloacal chamber.
    The Urodaeum is the oldest portion of the whole cloaca, then
follows the Proctodaeum, and, lastly, the Coprodaeum has secondarily
assumed cloacal functions.
   The various modifications of these three chambers, their function,
and the gradual separation of faeces, urine, and genital products have
been discussed in the third chapter, and are summarily explained in
a table.

         Received March 11, 1886.
    In my recent address to the Chemical Section                 of  the  British
 Association     at Aberdeen,     I have   specially  called   attention   to the
"            " of
   affinity        negative elements — chlorine, oxygen, sulphur, &c. — for
negative elements ; and I have sought to show that the formation of
so-called molecular compounds is largely, if not entirely, an outcome
of this peculiarity of negative elements.            I have also ventured to
            " that in
suggest                electrolysing solutions, the friction arising from the
attraction of the ions for each other is perhaps diminished, not by
the mere mechanical interposition of the neutral molecules of the
solvent — in the manner suggested by P. Kohlrausch — but by the
actual attraction exercised by these molecules upon the negative ion
in virtue of the affinities of the negative radicles."          In this passage
I but vaguely hinted at a modification of the current theory of
electrolysis which had occurred to me ; as further consideration of
the question, especially of Ostwald's electrochemical               studies, has
strengthened my views, I am led to think that it may be justifiable
to submit them for discussion.
    It is usual to divide bodies into three classes according to the mode
in which they are acted on by an electromotive force : metals forming
one class, electrolytes a second, and dielectrics a third.           In making
this division, perhaps the fact is not sufficiently borne in mind that
some compounds — silver chloride, for example — are per se electrolytes,
while others — such as hydrogen chloride and water — are individually
dielectrics, but behave as electrolytes when conjoined.                  On this
account, it appears to me desirable to distinguish between —
    (a) Metals.
    (b) Simple electrolytes
                                —compounds, like silver chloride, which in
the pure state are electrolytes.
    (c) Pseudo-dielectrics
                              — compounds like water, hydrogen chloride
and     sulphuric acid, which behave as dielectrics when pure, but as
electrolytes when mixed with other members of their own cluss.
Conducting mixtures of members of this class may conveniently be
termed composite electrolytes.

                                  Simple Electrolytes.
     It  is undoubtedly     a fact that only a limited number of binary
  compounds     are   simple electrolytes ; and it is especially noteworthy
  that, with the single doubtful exception of liqueBed ammonia, no
  hydrogen compound — whether binary or of more complex com
  position — can be classed with the simple electrolytes. Indeed, all the
  simple electrolytes with which we are acquainted are either compounds
  such as the metallic chlorides, or metallic salts — nitrates, sulphates, &c.
  Including metallic chlorides and their congeners and the corre
 sponding oxides and hydroxides among salts — regarding water as an
  acid, in fact — and denying the title of salts — -hydrogen salts — to the
 acids, Hittorf's proposition (" Wied. Ann.," 1878, 4, p. 374): " Electro
                    "
  lyte sind Salze       may be safely upheld.        But only some of the binary
  metallic salts are electrolytes : beryllium chloride, for example, belongs
  to the class of "pseudo-dielectrics" (Nilson and Petterson, "Wied.
 Ann.," 1878, 4, p. 565; Hnmpidge, " Phil. Trans.," 1883, p. 604) ; and
 in the case of those elements which readily form two classes of salts —
  so-called ous or proto-s&\ts and ic or per-salts, the ous compounds alone
  appear to be electrolytes.
     It is highly remarkable that whereas fused silver chloride is easily
  decomposed on passage of a current of low electromotive                       force,
                             "
  hydrogen chloride is a pseudo-dielectric" which forms when coupled
  with the " pseudo-dielectric " water a readily conducting " composite
  electrolyte ;" while mercuric chloride conducts with great difficulty —
  possibly not at all when pure — not only in the fused state, but even
  when conpled with water. No explanation of these facts seems to be
  afforded by thermochemical data.*
     The consideration of these and other similar cases,                 I think, can

    Only three of the chlorides in this list are simple electrolytes. As much more
heat is developed in the formation of two of these three — stannous and lead
chlorides — than in the case of any of the others, it would appear probable <i priori
that these would be the most stable ; obviously, therefore, the study of the heats of
formation throws no light on differences in electrical behaviour such as are manifest
between hydrogen, mercuric and stannic chlorides, on the one hand, and silver,
stannous and lead chlorides on the other.

but lead to one conclusion : that electrolysability is conditioned both
by the nature of the elements in the compound and its molecular
structure.    I have put forward the hypothesis in my address—" that
among metallic compounds, only those are electrolytes which contain
more than a single atom of metal in their molecules."             The mere
presence of two or more associated atoms of metal in the molecule,
however, probably does not constitute a compound an electrolyte ;
and although the hypothesis may be applicable to the majority of
simple electrolytes, it certainly does not appear to include all the
facts, and it does not serve to explain why certain salts are electro
lytes while others are not.
   The remarkable difference in the electrical behaviour of two com
pounds of the same element, such as stannous chloride, in which the
ratio of tin to chlorine atoms is as 1 to 2, and stannic chloride, in
which Sn    : CI =  1  :  4— the one being a Bimple electrolyte ; the other
a pseudo-dielectric,     if indeed it be not a dielectric — would appear
almost to justify the conclusion that in the case of per-salts such as
stannic chloride the metal is, as   it were, enveloped in a non-conducting-
sheath of the negative radicle.       But whether this be so or not, if—as
appears to be the case — all simple electrolytes are metallic compounds,
and if only proto-salts are electrolytes, may it not be that electric
conduction in simple electrolytes is of the nature of ordinary metallic
conduction, differing from it only in the circumstance that the com
pound is decomposed as a consequence of the passage of the current ?
   This would lead to the conception of an electrolyte as being a
metallic compound of such elements, and so constituted, that electric
conduction may take place through its mass in a manner similar to
that in which it takes place through a mass of metal : in fact through
the agency of its metallic atoms.       On this view, it is essential that
the metallic atoms in the molecules comprising a mass of an electro
lyte should be in proximity — as they probably are in proto-salts, but
not in many per-salts.         The conductivity of two-metal alloys is in
many   cases  much    less   than that of either of the contained metals :
for example, the conductivity of the alloy SnCu4 is about Jth that
of tin and 'about ^th that of copper.         The specific conductivity of
metals may, therefore, be much reduced by association with one
another ; and this being the case, it appears probable that the specific
conductivity of a metal would be Btill more reduced by association
with a non-metal, and that if the metal were one of low specific
conductivity, it might thus practically become altogether deprived of
 conducting power : perhaps the " exceptional" beha-viour of mercuric
and beryllium chlorides is to be explained by considerations such as
these.
    To discuss such questions at all satisfactorily, however, we require
 to know much more of the electrical behaviour of pure fused salts ;

1886.]         Conduction and Molecular Composition,       fye.         271
it  is surprising   how little accurate   knowledge    we possess   on this
subject.
                           Composite Electrolytes.
   I  assume  it to be admitted that neither water nor liquid hydrogen
chloride, for example, is an electrolyte, although an aqueous solution
of hydrogen chloride conducts freely and is electrolysed by an
electromotive force of but little more than a volt.
   The theory put forward by Clausius in 1857 in explanation of
electrolysis is well stated in Clerk Maxwell's
                                                     " Elementary Treatise
on Electricity" (p. 104), in the following words: —
   " According to the theory of molecular motion, every molecule of
the fluid is moving in an exceedingly irregular manner, being driven
first one way and then another by the impacts of other molecules
which are also in a state of agitation.            The encounters of the
molecules take place with various degrees of violence, and it is
probable that even at low temperatures some of the encounters are so
violent that one or both of the compound molecules are split up into
their constituents.    Each of these constituent molecules then knocks
about among the rest till it meets with another molecule of the
opposite kind, and unites with it to form a new molecule of the com
pound.     In  every compound, therefore, a certain proportion of the
molecules at any instant are broken up into their constituent atoms.
Now, Clausius supposes that it is on the constituent molecules in
their intervals of freedom that the electromotive force acts, deflecting
them slightly from the paths they wonld otherwise have followed and
causing the positive constituents to travel, on the whole, more in the
positive than in the negative direction and the negative constituents
more in the negative direction than in the positive.            The electro
motive force, therefore, does not produce the disruptions and reunions
of the molecules, but finding these disruptions and reunions already
going on, it influences the motions of the constituents during their
intervals of freedom.     The higher the temperature, the greater the
molecular agitation, and the more numerous are the free constituents :
hence the conductivity of electrolytes increases as the temperature
rises."
   This theory has been widely accepted by physicists ; but it appears
to me that, on careful consideration of the evidence, and especially of
recent exact observations on conditions of chemical change, it must
be admitted, as     I have elsewhere contended (B. A. Address), that
proof is altogether wanting of the existence of a condition such as is
postulated by Clausius.     Moreover, it has been shown by Hittorf that
cuprons and silver sulphides, and by F. Kohlrausch that silver iodide,
all undergo electrolysis in the solid state ; the partisans of the dis
sociation hypothesis would,    I  presume, scarcely contend that it is

272                 Prof. H. E. Armstrong.            Electrolytic         [Mar. 25,
easily applicable to such cases as these. It also does not appear to
afford any explanation of the abrupt change in conductivity which
occurs in solid silver iodide and sulphide as the temperature is raised
(see p. 280) ; nor of the peculiar variation in conductivity on diluting
sulphuric acid with water (see p. 282).
   Again,    I venture to think that the conductivity of a mixture of
compounds      which     themselves have little or no conducting power is
accounted for in but an unsatisfactory and insufficient manner by the
hypothesis put forward by P. Kohlrausch (" Pogg. Ann.," 1876, 159,
p. 233) ; there appears to be far too great a difference in the behaviour of
the pure compounds, water and liquid hydrogen chloride, for example,
and of a mixture — no decomposition apparently of either compound
being effected by any electromotive force short of that which produces
disruptive discharge, although the mixture of the two will not with
stand an electromotive force of little more than a volt.                  Influenced
by these considerations,       I  am led to conclude that there is no satis
factory evidence that the constituents of the electrolyte are either
free prior to the action of the electromotive force, or are primarily
set free by the effect produced by the electromotive force upon either
member separately of the composite electrolyte ; but that an additional
influence comes into play, viz., that of the one member of the com
posite electrolyte upon the other while both are under the influence
of the electromotive force. This influence,               I imagine, is exerted by
the negative radicle of the one member of the composite electrolyte
upon     the negative radicle of the other member.                   Assuming, for
example, that in a solution of hydrogen              chloride in water the oxygen
atom of the water molecule is straining at the chlorine atom of the
hydrogen chloride molecule, if when subjected to the influence of an
electromotive force the molecules are caused to flow past each other
— the phenomena of electric endosmose may                be held to afford evidence
that in composite electrolytes the molecules are thus set in motion
—it   is conceivable that this influence, superadded to that of the elec
tromotive force upon the electrolyte, may bring about the disruption
of the molecule and conduction : in short, that a state may be induced
such as Clausius considers is the state prior to the action of the elec
tromotive force.
   A large amount of most valuable information on the connexion of
dilution and electrical conduction in aqueous solutions has been
recently published by Arrhenius, Bouty, F. Kohlrausch and Ostwald.
In his most recent paper, Ostwald (" Journal fur praktische Chemie,"
1885, 32, p. 300) has given the results of his determinations of the

 acids : it appears to   me  that many — indeed all — of his observations afford
 most distinct evidence in favour of the view I have expressed above.
 The general result of his investigation is that the molecular conduc
 tivity increases with dilution : in other words, that the dissolved sub
 stance exercises a greater specific effect, finally attaining a maximum ;
 it then diminishes, but he believes this to be due to impurities in the
 water, especially to neutralisation of the acid by traces of ammonium
 carbonate.     The maximum, he appears to think, would be the same
 for all acids if the dilution could only be pushed far enough : in the
 case of monobasic acids it is about 90 (arbitrary units) ; it is twice
 this in the case of dibasic, thrice in the case of tribasic, and so on.
    I will quote first his results in the case of solutions of hydrogen
 chloride, bromide, iodide, fluoride and silicon fluoride.

    Tt  will  be observed       that hydrogen       chloride,    bromide     and iodide
practically behave alike ; the numbers for the chloride are, however,
slightly lower than those for the bromide and iodide, and the maxi
mum is not reached quite so soon in the case of the chloride.                    Hydro
gen fluoride      is   altogether    different :   its  molecular      conductivity    is
exceedingly low to begin with, and is considerably                    below   the maxi
mum     even  when     i>=4096.     But    I would    call   special   attention  to the
numbers for hydrogen silicon fluoride, which               is  commonly regarded as
a dibasic acid : at first, as Ostwald says, it behaves as a monobasic
acid of moderate strength — iodic acid, for example ; but the maxi
mum for monobasic acids being exceeded, the molecular conductivity
increases more and more rapidly, ultimately exceeding the treble
value, 270. It must be supposed that it undergoes decomposition in
accordance     with the equation —
                                                SiO, + 6HF.

274               Prof. H. E. Armstrong.        Electrolytic      [Mar. 25,
The noteworthy point is the large excess of water required to initiate
this change: when v—lQ the solution contains less than 1 per cent.
HjSiFe, and at this point, according to Ostwald, decomposition,
probably begins, but that it is far from complete even when a very
much larger excess is present is evident from the fact that the
maximum when v = 32,768 is 282 and not above 400.
    Now it is well known that hydrogen chloride, bromide and iodide
are, practically speaking, perfect gases under ordinary circumstances :
in other words, masses of these gases would mainly consist of mole
cules such as are represented by the formula HC1, HBr and HI.             It
has been proved, however, by Mallet that hydrogen fluoride at tem
peratures near to its boiling point mainly consists of molecules of the
formula H2F2. In the aqueous solution the molecules would be
brought more closely together, and therefore it is probable that, even
 in the case of hydrogen chloride, bromide and iodide, a certain pro
 portion of more complex molecules would result; the relatively high
 boiling point of hydrogen fluoride (19'4°) renders it probable that in
 the liquid state this compound would at least partially consist of
 molecules more complex even than is represented by the formula
 H2F2.     On the hypothesis put forward in this paper, the influence
 exorcised by the one member of the composite electrolyte upon the
 other member during electrolysis is at all events mainly exercised by
 their respective negative radicles, and the extent of the influence
 thus mutually exerted by these radicles would depend on the extent to
 which they are still possessed of "residual affinity." If the hydrogen
 chloride, bromide and iodide are present chiefly as simple molecules,
  they should exert, ab initio, almost the full effect which they are
  capable of exerting ; and the chief effect of dilution being to decom
  pose the more complex molecules, conductivity should increase to but
  a slight extent if the extent to which simplification can take place be
  but small. On the other hand, if owing to the formation of molecular
  aggregates the residual affinity be more or less exhausted, the initial
  conductivity will be low, and it will increase on dilution only in pro
  portion as these aggregates become broken up.
     It appears to me that the behaviour of the four hydrides under
  discussion is absolutely in accordance with these requirements of the
  hypothesis.     Even the difference between hydrogen chloride and
  hydrogen   bromide  and iodide is not without its bearing.    The determi
  nations of the density of chlorine at    various temperatures by Ludwig,
  and of the density of bromine by Jahn (" Monatshef te fur Chemie,"
   1882, p. 176), have shown that   it is necessary to raise the temperature
  considerably higher above the boiling point in order to reduce the
   density to the theoretical value in the case of chlorine than in the
   case of bromine : in other words, there is a greater tendency in
   chlorine to form aggregates more complex than those of the formula

   1886.]             Conduction    and Molecular Composition,            fyc.          275
   Clt than there       is  in bromine to form aggregates more complex than
  those of the formula Br2.                It is, therefore, not unlikely that the
  chlorine in HC1 has more " residual affinity
                                                                " than the
                                                                                 bromine in
  HBr,* and if so the aqueous solution of the former would have a lower
  initial conductivity than one of equivalent strength of hydrogen
  bromide, and the maximum would be obtained only on greater dilu
  tion ; which is precisely the case.
      The evidence afforded by the oxy-acids derived from the halogens
  appears to me to be equally striking.                   The following are Ostwald's

altogether peculiar — being that of a polybasic acid, it may be added.
Ostwald regards it as most surprising — " in hohem Grade befremdlich

— that periodic acid should be much weaker than iodic acid, and that
the latter should be considerably inferior to iodhydric acid.                            To my
mind, their behaviour is absolutely what might be expected of these
acids. Although the molecules in liquid nitric, chloric and perchloric
acids are probably not of the simple composition represented by the
formulae HN03, HC103, and HC104 respectively, the chemical be
haviour of these acids does not indicate any great difference between
them ; owing, however, to the accumulation of oxygen atoms, per
chloric acid may be expected to exercise a somewhat greater influence
than chloric acid, as it actually does.                         Chemists are agreed that
bromine has less affinity for oxygen                     than     chlorine ; hence it may be
inferred that the oxygen in bromic acid would have greater residnal
affinity than the oxygen in chloric acid, and that, therefore, bromic
acid would form complex aggregates more readily than chloric acid,
and consequently have less influence in electrolysis than chloric acid.
This is true in a much greater degree of iodic, and still more of
periodic acid :* it is well known that the former not only yields salts
of the type M'I03, but also acid salts such as KHI,Os; and that
periodic acid forms a series of very complex salts.
    The acids of phosphorus form another interesting series: —

    It will be observed that sulphuric and selenic acids are nearly alike
 in behaviour, the latter being somewhat more active in concentrated
*olutions ; it is noteworthy that of all the polybasic acids studied by
 Ostwald, these are the only two containing a single negative radicle
 (SO4,SeO4) which exhibit a conductivity in excess of that which cha
 racterises the monobasic acids.t
    The numbers obtained for sulphurous and selenious acids are
deserving of study.           Sulphur dioxide is far from being a perfect gas
under ordinary conditions ; in the liquid state it is probably rich in
   * Ostwald   appears to bo of the opinion that if the dilution could be carried far
                                     ,
enough, a maximum conductivity = -90 would eventually be attained in the case of
every n-basic acid. It appears to me that neither do his numbers warrant this — and
those here under discussion are an especially good illustration — nor is it likely to be
the case on my hypothesis.
   t Ostwald infers from the great increase in molocular conductivity that the
manner in which the acid is electrolysed varies with the strength of the solution ;
he supposes that in more concentrated solutions sulphuric acid is resolved into H and
HS04) and that both atoms of hydrogen are split off only as the solution becomes
more diluted.     This appears to me to bo altogether improbable.

aggregates of S02 molecules, and these may be to a large extent con
served in concentrated aqueous solutions. Bnt the main explanation
of the variation in conductivity on dilation must be looked for,                 I
think, in the peculiar relation which sulphur dioxide manifests to
water ; it is more than probable that the initial interaction involves
the formation of a hydrate, (S02)r(OH2)y, and that from this on dilu
tion is formed sulphurous acid, SO(OH)2, and perhaps also " snlphonic
acid," H-S03H. Taking into account the properties of selenious oxide,
Ostwald's results appear to me in this case again to lead to but the
one conclusion,   that conductivity increases in consequence of the
specific influence of the fundamental molecule of the compound
making itself more and more felt as by dilution it becomes more
and more disentangled from its fellows.
  The behaviour of solutions of neutral metallic salts on dilution is
very   similar to that of acids ; abundant proof of this is afforded
especially by F. Kohlrausch's refined measurements, of which an
account has recently been published ("Wied. Ann.," 1886,26, p. 162).
I venture to think that a similar explanation to that above given for
oxides will apply to salts ; and also that the low molecular con
ductivities of salts as compared with corresponding acids may be
regarded as confirmatory of my hypothesis.            I
                                                    think we must admit
that the metals generally have less affinity than hydrogen for negative
radicles ; if this be granted, we have at once an explanation of the
fact that metallic salts are mostly fixed solids, few of which are more
than moderately soluble in water while many are very difficultly
soluble or insoluble, whereas the corresponding         acids are mostly
volatile and  readily soluble  in water,  if not miscible with it in all
proportions.   The affinity of the negative radicles being less exhausted
by union with metals than with hydrogen, the fundamental molecules
of salts are more prone to unite together to form complex aggregates.
   Arrhenius, who has studied the electrical behaviour of solutions
of a number of salts,* attributes the change observed in molecular
conductivity on dilution — as I have done — to molecular changes ; but
his deductions are all based on the acceptance of the Williamson-
 Clausius hypothesis of dissociation.
   My hypothesis would also account for the increase in conductivity

 in composite electrolytes with rise of temperature.            It is true that as
temperature rises the influence which individual molecules exert upon
each other would be lessened ; but on the other hand, the complex
aggregates would become more and more completely resolved into
their fundamental molecules, the velocity of molecular motion would
increase, and the tendency of the constituent atoms to remain united
 would be lessened. From this point of view the determination of the
coefficient of change of conductivity with temperature in the case of
substances whose molecular conductivity increases considerably on
 dilution in comparison with allied compounds which exhibit only a
 slight variation in molecular conductivity on dilution affords an
 interesting subject for investigation.            P. Kohlrausch has already
pointed out ("Pogg. Ann.," 1875, 154, p. 236) that in the case of all
 neutral salts, " der Einfluss der Temperatur auf das Leitnngs-

    In  cases where the influence of the one member of the composite

molecular    simplification, and that,     in consequence, conductivity will
diminish with rise of temperature         ; a mixture of alcohol and ether
would appear to furnish an example of this kind ; according to
Pfeiffer's recent observations (" Wied. Ann.," 1886, 26, p. 226), such a
mixture behaves as a metallic conductor of very high resistance.
    The increase in conductivity of graphite and gas-retort carbon on
heating, and the effect of light on the conductivity of (? impure)
selenium and some other snbstances (Shelford Bidwell, " Phys. Soc.
 Proa,"   7, p. 129,    256), appear to me to be also explicable on the
assumption     that in all these     cases we are dealing with composite
electrolytes.
    If any further proof be needed of an intimate connexion between
molecular composition and electrolytic conduction, it is most con
clusively afforded,    I  think, by the observations of W. Kohlransch on
chloride, bromide and iodide of silver (" Wied. Ann.," 1882, 17,
 p. 642), which are exhibited in the accompanying        curves. In the fused
state, these   compounds are better conductors than the most

is the best conductor at ordinary temperatures.      On reference to the
curves, it will be seen that the resistance of both silver chloride and
bromide suddenly increases when the change from the fused to the
solid state sets in ; but that no such change takes place in the case of
the iodide.    Silver iodide fuses at 527° according to Rodwell, but at
about 540° according to Kohlrausch ; its electrical resistance increases
only gradually after it has become solid, and remains almost a linear
function of the temperature during an interval of 400°, until suddenly
at near 1.50° it increases enormously, this change taking place at the
moment when according to Rodwell (" Phil. Trans.," 1882, p. 1133)
it passes from the transparent, plastic, amorphous solid to the opaque,
brittle, crystalline state, the volume increasing considerably as shown
by the annexed curve.      Kohlrausch has proved most conclusively that
the solid iodide may undergo     electrolysis.  It would seem that almost
immediately after solidification in the case of silver chloride and
bromide practically the whole mass consists of complex aggregates so
 constituted   as to be exceedingly bad conductors, but that such aggre
 gates are  formed  much less readily by silver iodide.
                             Metallic Conduction.
    I do not propose in any way to discuss metallic conduction, but
 merely to call attention to some of the analogies between it and
 electrolytic conduction.
    It is conceivable, and it would appear probable from the fairly
 regular manner in which the electrical resistance of most pure metals

282               Prof. H. E. Armstrong.        Electrolytic       [Mar. 25,
decreases as the temperature falls, the coefficients of change being
practically very nearly the same in all cases, that the increase in
resistance as temperature rises is mainly due to the increase in mole
cular inter-distances.     As a rule, resistance increases on the passage of
a metal   from the solid to the liquid state, but there are noteworthy
exceptions from which it would appear probable that even in pure
metals conductivity to some extent depends on molecular composition :
thus the conductivity of bismnth increases at the moment of fusion
from 0'43 to 0-73 of that of mercury at 21°, and that of antimony
from 0 59 to 084 (L. de la Rive, " Compt. rend.," 1863, 57, p. 691) ;
it is well known that bismuth contracts considerably on fusion, and
this is probably also the case with antimony.           Again, according to
Bouty   and   Cailletet (ibid., 1885, 100,  p. 1188), the resistance of mer
cury decreases at the point of solidification in the ratio 4'08 : 1 ; this
is a remarkable increase in conductivity, and it is difficult to believe
that it is wholly due to mere contraction of volume.
   That the behaviour of alloys is worthy of far more attention than
it has hitherto received appears most clearly from the few data at
disposal.                                                I
             As being the most instructive instance, append the curve

given by Professor Lodge as representing the specific conductivities of
the copper-tin alloys (" Phys. Soc. Proc.," 1879-80, 3, p. 158). He
examined five alloys, containing respectively 80-8, 38-2, 31*7, 12'6,
and 9' 7 per cent. by weight of tin, which were prepared by Professor
Chandler Roberts; the dotted curve represents the results obtained
by Matthiessen, who did not examine any alloy between those con
taining 16-4 and 85-l volume per cent. of copper. The comparison of
Professor Lodge's curve with that given by F. Kohlrausch for mix
tures of sulphuric acid and water — which I also append — appears to
me to be in the highest degree suggestive.    In the case of the latter,
it will be observed that, starting from S03 on the one side and H20 on
the other, minima occur at points on the curve corresponding to com
pounds    of the formula          HjS04 and H2S04'H20        ;   it   is,   however, well
known that such compounds are unobtainable at ordinary tempera
tures, and    highly probable that if the pure compounds could be

water.*  The point of maximum conductivity does not correspond
to any known hydrate, but as       have elsewhere remarked
                                              I                                     it   is
almost coincident with that of maximum heat evolution on mixing

                                              it   is
at which the maximum chemical change occurs.        On reference to the

  pronounced minimum is reached, corresponding to the pronounced
  maximum attained on addition of a moderate amount of water to
 sulphuric acid, and at a point moreover corresponding to a definite
 compound, SnCu4 ; a further slight addition of tin develops another
  minimum less pronounced than the first, but also corresponding to a
  definite compound, SnCus ; the curve then falls slightly and exhibit*
  a third minimum, its course being analogous to that of the sulphuric
 acid and water curve near to sulphuric acid.                     If one or the other
 curve be inverted, the general similarity in form is especially striking.
  It is obviously important that alloys intermediate between those
 studied should be examined ; a comparison of Lodge's with Matthies-
 sen's curve         shows how much may be missed ; this remark applies to
 alloys generally.           Whatever may be the explanation,* it appears to
 me to be clear than in alloys as in composite electrolytes the con
 stituent members of the system influence each other, and thns
 mutually contribute to the final result.                The marked diminution in
 the conductivity of copper produced by very small quantities of
 oxygen, of phosphorus or of the metalloid arsenic is well known.
 It would appear probable that this is in some way due to the occur
 rence of an electrolytic change, which at least in part is opposed in
 direction to that taking place in the pure metal during conduction. t

     Notwithstanding           the fierce   controversy which has been waged
 between the advocates             of the doctrine of fixed valency and the
 advocates of the doctrine of varying valency, our views on the
 subject are still in an unfortunate degree unsatisfactory and
 indefinite.       Even those — and they probably form a lar^e majority —
 who regard valency as a variable, dependent both upon the nature of
 the    associated       radicles and the conditions — especially as to tem
 perature    —  under which these are placed, often hesitate to attribute a
 valency sufficiently high to account for every case of combination ; in
 fact both parties agree in distinguishing " atomic " from " molecu
 lar"    compounds, and differ only as to where the line shall be drawn.
    *  It is very remarkable that not only do the heat conductivity and the induction
 balance curves for the tin-copper alloys correspond (Chandlor Eoberts, " Phys. Soc.
 Proc.," 3, p. 156) , but that the curves given by Thurston as representing the strength
of these alloys (" Materials of Engineering," Part      III, p. 412) also exhibit a marked
similarity to the electrical conductivity curves.

    t The change produced in gold by a very small quantity of lead is most astonish
ing : its conductivity is reduced almost to that of lead and it becomes as brittle as
glass.    It is difficult to understand this change unless it be that opportunity is given
for the gold itself to assume a different molecular state, owing to continuity becoming
disturbed. The effect produced appears to be strictly comparable with that observed
on lowering the temperature of silver iodide from above about 150', and in the
passage of liquid water at 0° into ioe.

     It   is difficult to over-estimate the importance of the theory of
 valency : its application has led to an enormous extension of our
 knowledge of carbon compounds especially, and it has furnished us
 with a simple and consistent system of classifying the mighty host of
 these bodies ; but on the other hand, it may be questioned whether it
 has not led us away from the search into the nature of chemical
 change, and even if the introduction of the terms saturated and
 unsaturated has not had a directly pernicious effect. The almost
 universal disregard of molecular composition as an important factor in
 chemical change in the case of solids and liquids, and the popular
 tendency to overlook the fact that our formulae of such bodies are
 purely empirical expressions, has undoubtedly exercised a prejudicial
influence.
    No known compounds            are saturated — if any were, such would be
incapable,     I imagine, of directly taking part in any interaction, and in
 their case decomposition would necessarily be a precedent change.
 The paraffins are apparently of all bodies the most inert and the most
 nearly saturated, and next to them comes hydrogen — the unsaturated
 character of which is displayed in interactions such as occur at
 atmospheric temperatures between it and platinum and palladium, and
 when it displaces silver from silver nitrate or certain of the platinum
 metals from their salts.        One of the most striking instances perhaps
of popular error in this respect is water, which is always regarded as
 a saturated compound, although its entire behaviour and especially its
physical properties characterise the molecule HjO, I think, as that of an
eminently unsaturated compound :           I  fail to see how otherwise we are
to explain the high surface tension and high specific heat of liquid
water, its high heat of vaporisation, and its imperfectly gaseous beha
viour up to temperatures considerably above its boiling point, let alone
its great solvent power and its tendency to form hydrates with a mul
titude of compounds — especially oxygenated compounds, be it added.
    The theory was brought most prominently under the notice of
chemists by Helmholtz in the last Faraday lecture that electricity,
like matter, is as it were atomic, and that each unit of affinity or
valency in our compounds is associated with an equivalent of elec
tricity — positive or negative ; that the atoms cling to their electric
charges and that these charges cling to each other.                      Thus barely
stated, this theory does not appear to take into account the fact that
the fundamental molecules even of so-called atomic compounds are
never saturated, but more or less readily unite with other molecules to
form molecular compounds — molecular aggregates ; and unless the
application of the theory to explain the existence of such compounds
can be made clear, chemists must,              I  think, decline to accept it.*

 There is, however, a most significant passage in Helmholtz' paper, in
 which it is pointed out that (in a Daniell's cell) the phenomena are
 the same as if equivalents of positive and negative electricity were
 attracted by different atoms, and perhaps also by the different values
 of affinity belonging to the same atom, with different force : are we to
 seek   for an explanation in this direction ? The impression which the
 facts   make upon the mind of the chemist certainly is, 1, that no
two different atoms have equivalent affinities ; and, 2, that affinity is a
 variable depending on the nature of the associated elements : but
owing to the recognised complexity of nearly all cases of chemical
change, it is difficult to draw any very definite conclusion on this point.
    If, however, the nature and properties of so-called molecular
compounds generally be considered, and if an attempt be made to
 form any conception of their constitution, one striking fact is
noticeable, viz., that the metals in them apparently retain the
properties which they exhibited in the parent atomic compounds.
 Every one knows the marked difference in properties of ferrous as
contrasted       with ferric salts : they differ not only in chemical
behaviour,      but   also in their physical properties, and are readily
distinguishable by their colour.              The properties of the ferrous
molecular compounds, however, are those of the simple                         ferrous
compounds : ferrous potassium chloride, for example, Fe2CL/Cl2K2, is
a green salt much like ferrous sulphate.            Facts such as these have led
 me to suggest that in such cases the formation of the molecular
 compound is due to the attraction of the negative element of the one
 " atomic "
              compound by the negative element of the other, the metal
having no influence except that the amount of affinity of which the
negative element is possessed depends on the nature of the metal with
which it is associated. It would in fact appear that hydrogen and the
metals generally may be regarded as the analogues of the CH2„+,
and C„H2,_7 hydrocarbon radicles, and that their compounds with
negative elements may be likened to unsaturated hydrocarbons                   of the
form CH,,+i-CH-CH2. We know that whenever such a compound
enters into combination, the C„H2„+i radicle takes no part in the
change, combination of whatever kind being effected by means of the
unsaturated radicle CH>CH2 with which it is associated.                     I do not
molecular charges — he uses the expression molecular in the sense that the chemist
uses the term atomic — may serve as a method by which we may remember a good
many facts about electrolysis.    It is extremely improbable that when we come to
understand the true nature of electrolysis we shall retain in any form the theory of
molecular charges, for then we shall have obtained a secure basis on which to form a
true theory of electric currents, and so become independent of these provisional
theories." And later (p. 315) : " While electrolysis fully establishes the close rela
tionship between electrical phenomena and those of chemical combination, the fact
that every chemical compound is not an electrolyte shows that chemical combination
is a process of a higher order of complexity than any purely electrical phenomenon."

mean     to contend that the metals are fully neutralised in their
compounds, but merely that as a rule they behave as though they were
*aturated just as do the CnH2B_7 radicles derived from the benzenes.
There can be little doubt that an absolute distinction must be drawn
between hydrogen and the metals on the one hand, and the non-
metals on the other.            Regarding the facts in the light of our
knowledge of carbon compounds, it is difficult to resist the conclusion
that the differences observed are due to differences in structure of the
stuffs of which the elements as we know them are composed, the
which differences condition perhaps a different distribution of the
electric charge or its equivalent, in the case of each element.
    In the earlier part of this paper I have ascribed the influence which
the one set of molecules of the composite electrolyte exercise upon the
other during electrolysis to the existence of " residual affinity."                 I
believe this view also to apply to the explanation of the occurrence of
chemical change. To quote the words of Arrhenius, " L'activite
electrolytique se confonde avec l'activite chimique." Several pregnant
examples of this have already been given by Ostwald (" J. pr. Chem.,"
1884, 30, p. 93).
    The investigation of the nature of chemical change has assumed an
altogether different aspect since the publication of Mr. H. B. Dixon's
inquiry into the conditions of chemical change in gases (" Phil Trans.,"
1884, p. 617 ; see also " Chem. Soc. Trans.," 1886, p. 94). Mr. Dixon
has clearly proved that it is impossible to explode a mixture of carbonic
oxide and oxygen, and that the change 2CO + 02 = 2C03 is effected
when sparks are passed across the tube containing the gaseous mixture
only in the path of the discharge.          If  traces of water be present explo
sion takes place, the velocity of propagation of the explosive wave
increasing with the amount of water up to a certain maximum.
These results completely dispose of the popular explanation of such
changes, viz., that the molecules in the path of the discharge undergo
dissociation, that the dissimilar atoms thus liberated then combine
together, and that as the heat developed in their union causes the
dissociation of yet other molecules, change gradually extends through
out the mass.* Mr. Dixon's experiments have not only shown that
the propagation of change is dependent on the presence of a third
body, but that this third body must bear a certain relation to those
with which it is associated ; C02, CS2, C2N2, CCI4, S02, and N20 were
found by him to have no action, and only water — or bodies which
formed water under the conditions of the experiment — were found
capable of determining the explosion.              There is an obvious difference
   •  I am not to be understood to imply that dissociation does not take placo in the
path of the discharge ; on the contrary, for all the facts appear to me to indicate
that conduction and electrolysis are inseparable phenomena in gases as in liquids."

in constitution between water and the bodies found incapable of
determining explosion : the former being a compound of a positive
with a negative element, the latter being all compounds of two nega
tive elements ; and if it be permissible to generalise from this single
instance, it may hence be stated, that in order that interaction shall
take place in cases such as that under consideration, it is not only-
necessary that the elements of the
                                                 " catalyst " shall be divisible*
between the interacting substances — the elements of C03 are obviously
as divisible between CO and 02 as are those of H,0 — but that the
catalyst shall consist of a positive and a negative and not of two
negative radicles.       On this view, it is possible to understand that
water itself may act as the catalyst in determining the formation of
water at high temperatures from hydrogen and oxygen. f
    In the case discussed (the oxidation of carbon monoxide), inter
action takes place at a very higb temperature, and therefore — since
high temperature may be regarded as the equivalent of high electro
motive force — under conditions under which the catalyst water is
probably a simple electrolyte.             The behaviour of sulphur dioxide
in presence of oxygen and water is instructive as being a case of an
analogous interaction occurring at a low temperature.                 From a most
carefully conducted series of experiments by Mr. Dixon (" Journ. of
 Gas Lighting," 1881, 37, p. 704), it appears that not only does snlphur
dioxide not undergo change in contact with dry oxygen, but that it
even resists oxidation if water vapour be present and at a temperature
of 100° ; as is well known, however, oxidation takes place — but only
slowly — when an aqueous solution of sulphur dioxide is in contact
 with oxygen.       In this case, in the gaseous mixture the water appa
rently is not under such conditions that it can act as a simple electro
lyte, or even form a composite electrolyte, and action only takes place
 when the conditions become such that a composite electrolyte can be
formed    ;  Ostwald's observations      may be held to prove,      I imagine, that
 a very imperfect composite electrolyte            results on dissolving sulphur
 dioxide in water, and in accordance with this is the fact that the
 aqueous solution is but slowly oxidised.|
    * Mr. Dixon's experiments appear to prove that during the interaction of carbonic
 oxide and oxygen in presence of water an actual division of the elements of the water
 molecules takes place between the carbonic oxide and oxygen molecules, and hence
 that the water does not exercise a mere contact action.
    t When this question first came under discussion at the Chemical Society,
 I said that I looked forward to the time when probably it would be found that a
 mixture of pure hydrogen and oxygen was inexplosive, like one of pure carbonic
 oxide and oxygen.     I was then still under the influence of current opinion and
 regarded water as a saturated compound, and had not yet realised the important
 function of " residual affinity" in such changes.
    X The behaviour here described     of sulphur dioxide appears to me to furnish
 another argument adverse to the dissociation hypothesis, as oxidation takes place
 under the conditions least favourable to the occurrence of dissociation.

  If a clear distinction can be drawn — as          I
                                            suppose it can — between
simple and composite electrolytes, the presence of a member of the
latter class will probably be found to be essential to the occurrence of
many interactions taking place at moderate temperatures ; thus the
oxidation of iron, which is generally supposed to take place only in
moist air, is doubtless dependent, not merely on the presence of water,
 but of impure water — of water rendered conducting by association
 with foreign matters ; similarly it may be expected that zinc will be
found to have no action on water even when associated with a less
 positive metal, and it would doubtless have no action on sulphuric
 acid, if such a compound were obtainable in a pure state; but a
 mixture of sulphuric acid and water readily dissolves             it,
                                                                 as the two
 together  form  a composite electrolyte   of  comparatively low  resistance.
    It can scarcely be doubted that when our elements or compounds
 are resolved into their ultimate atoms, these atoms are capable of
 directly uniting, and that no catalyst    is then required.   But this be
                                                                         if
 the case, and if, as I   suppose, the atoms rarely saturate each other,
 the direct union of compounds should also be possible in cases in
 which there     isconsiderable residual affinity such union would not
                                                        ;
 involve a separation from each other of the constituent elements of
 one or both of the interacting bodies such as takes place in the
 changes previously considered.        Union of two molecules having
 taken place the elements of the interacting bodies having thus been
             ;
 brought into intimate association     : it     very probable that in many
                                               is
 cases intramolecular change will then supervene, resulting sometimes
 in mere atomic redistribution, at other times in the resolution of the
 complex molecule into simpler molecules.          am inclined to think that
                                                    I
 the majority of so-called double decompositions are thus brought
about.
   The union of sulphuric anhydride with water to form sulphuric
acid, and of sulphuric acid with water to form hydrates, are doubtless
cases of this kind.     The formation of the hydrate S03'OH2 must be
supposed    to  be  immediately    followed by the occurrence of atomic
redistribution   if we accept the current view that sulphuric acid            isa
hydroxide of the formula SOs(OH)2 whether after the formation of
                                           ;
the hydrate H2S04*OH2 has taken place atomic redistribution in like
manner supervenes      is a moot point     ; the large amount of heat de
veloped by the interaction     of   water  and   sulphuric acid is, however,
specially noteworthy.
   Sodium hydroxide     isuniversally regarded as the analogue of water            :
is its action on sulphuric acid analogous to that of water         ?   Icertainly
am   inclined  to  hold that   is,
                              it    and  that in  the first instance   an aggre
gate, NaHOS04H2, results, owing to the attraction of the oxygen of
the hydroxide by the oxygenated radicle of the acid         :   atomic redistri
bution thereupon takes place, and either the molecule            isresolved into

290            Conduction and Molecular Composition,       S.c.  [Mar. 25,
two others, water and sodium hydrogen sulphate, or a new compound
is formed,    which is easily resolvable into these latter.     Moreover,  I
am inclined to attribute this change and the consequent displacement
of the hydrogen       in the acid by the sodium, not to the fact that
sodium has a greater affinity than hydrogen has for S04, but to the
tendency of hydrogen to displace the sodium in sodium hydroxide and
to form water.      I  do not contend that in such a case as that quoted
direct interaction will take place between the substances as we know
them in the solid state ; these may consist of comparatively          inert
complex aggregates which require to be resolved into simpler molecules
either by dissolution or by application of heat. In other words, the
presence of water may be necessary, not because it is essential to have
an electrolyte present, but because the occurrence of both molecular
interaction and electrolytic conduction depends on identical molecular
and intermolecular conditions.       The chemical interaction takes place
entirely independently of the water molecules, and these latter serve
only to separate and keep apart the fundamental molecules of which
the interacting bodies are composed.
    No final decision for or against the view here put forward can well
be arrived at except by the study of the behaviour of gaseous bodies
such as ammonia and hydrogen chloride, for example ; if proof can be
given that these compounds are capable of directly uniting without the
intervention of any third body, a most important step will have been
made.
    Other cases deserving of study are the conversion of nitric oxide
 into nitric peroxide, oxidation by means of ozone, and the action of
metals such as sodium on water.       As the formation of nitric peroxide
involves the prior separation of oxygen-atoms from oxygen-atoms,
and not merely the combination of two molecules,      it is not improbable
that interaction between nitric oxide and oxygen      molecules will only
take place in the presence of a catalyst. But it is   to be borne in mind
that both nitric oxide and ozone are bodies which     are capable of inter
acting with molecules of their own kind, and that      considerable heat is
thereby developed ; and it is conceivable that such bodies being pos
sessed of high residual affinity may directly enter into combination
with others which have but little residual affinity.        As regards the
action   of  sodium   on  water, the  difference in behaviour   with dilute
 sulphuric acid between moderately pure zinc and very nearly pure
zinc is  so marked that the vigorous action between sodium and water
cannot be held to prove much, as no special care is ever taken to pre
pare sodium pure ; the question whether tho affinity of the oxygen in
water for sodium is sufficient to cause their direct association and
consequent interaction is an interesting one for experimental inquiry,
although it would be very difficult to make the experiment properly.
    One other application of the theory dwelt on in this paper remains

to be mentioned. It is now well established that on exploding gaseous
mixtures within a closed chamber, the maximum theoretical tempera
ture is never reached ; and this has hitherto always been explained
as dne to the occurrence of dissociation whereby the change is re
tarded. If in a mixture, say, of carbonic oxide, oxygen and water
gases, the three kinds of molecules act together in the manner I have
supposed, it is probable that the extent to which they mutually
influence each other would vary with the temperature, and that it
would tend to diminish above a certain temperature ; if such were
the case, change would be retarded in the manner in which it appenrs
to be in explosions within closed chambers.       Dissociation undoubtedly
does take place in many cases, but there is now a considerable amount
of evidence on record to show that the bounding surfaces exercise a
most important influence ; this is usually not sufficiently taken into
account.

   In the equilibrium theory of the tideH, as worked out by Newton
and Bernouilli, it is assumed that the figure of the ocean is at eacn
instant one of equilibrium.
   But Sir William Thomson has pointed out that, when portions of
the globe are occupied by land, the law of rise and fall of water given
in the usual solution cannot be satisfied by a constant volume of
water.*

This equilibrium law would still hold good when the ocean is
interrupted by continents, if water were appropriately supplied to or
exhausted from the sea as the earth rotates.
    Since when water is supplied or exhausted the height of water will
rise or fall everywhere to the same extent, it follows that the rise and
fall of tide, according to the revised equilibrium theory, must be
given by —

where a is a constant all over the earth for each position of the moon
relatively to the earth, but varies for different positions.
    Let Q  be the   fraction of the earth's surface which is occupied by
sea ; let A. be the latitude and I the longitude of any point ; and let
ds stand for cos \d\dl, an element of solid angle.           Then we have —
                                   4ttQ
integrated    all over the oceanic area.
    The quantity of water which must be subtracted from the sea, so as to
depress the sea level everywhere by aa, is 4?rasa<2 ; and the quantity

water must be constant, continuity demands that —

 integrated all over the ocean.
    On substituting this value of a in (2) we shall obtain the law of
rise and fall.
    Now if X, I be the latitude and W. longitude of the place of
observation; h the Greenwich westward hour-angle of the moon at
 the time and place of observation ; and S the moon's declination, it is
 well known that —

The first term of (6) gives the semi-diurnal tide, the second the
diurnal, and the third the tide of long period.
   The meaning of the result        clear.   The latitude and longitude

definite parallel of latitude which has reference to the tide of long

    From inspection we see that at the point Xj,    the semi-diurnal tide             Z2
is evanescent, and that at the point X2, + 90° there        doubled tide, Z2                      is

   Many or all of these points may fall on continents, so that the
evanescence or doubling may only apply to the algebraical expres
sions, which are, unlike the sea, continuous over the whole globe.
But now let us consider more precisely what the points are.
   It is obvious that the latitude and longitude       and    being
derived from expressions for co82X2Cos2Z2 and cos2X2 sin 272, really
                                                                                          \               1%,
correspond with four points whose latitudes and longitudes are —
                                —                    Z>   +180°        —
                    ^2>   i            h >     ^2>                 ;       X^,   Z2+180°.
  Thus there are four points of evanescent semi-diurnal tide, situated
on a single great circle or meridian, in equal latitudes N. and S., and
antipodal two and two.     Corresponding to these four, there are four
points of doubled semi-diurnal tide, whose latitudes and longitudes
are —
          X,,   k    +   90°;   -\,      l.2   +90°;       X9,   Z2   +270°;      X2,   J,   +270",
and these also are on   single great circle or meridian, at right angles
                                a
to the former great circle, and are in the same latitudes N. and S. as
are the places of evanescence, and are antipodal two and two.
   Passing now to the case of the diurnal tide we see that X1,                                                    llt

   Thus there are four points of evanescent diurnal tide, situated on a
single great circle or meridian, two of them are in one quadrant in
complemental latitudes, and antipodal to them are the two others.
Corresponding to these four there are four points of doubled diurnal
tide lying in the same great circle or meridian, and situated similarly
with regard to the S. pole as are the points of evanescence with regard
to the N. pole their latitudes and longitudes are —

tinents diminish towards vanishing, the four points of evanescent
and the four points of doubled semi-diurnal tide close in to the pole,

doubling coalesce on the equator, and a fourth pair coalesce at the
antipodes of the third pair ; lastly, in the case of the tides of long
period the circles of evanescent tide tend to coalesce with the circles
of doubled tide, in latitudes 35° 16' N. and S.
  We are now in a position to state the results of Thomson's corrected
theory by comparison with Bernouilli's theory.
   Consider the semi-diurnal tide on an ocean-covered globe, then at
the four points on a single meridian great circle which correspond to
the points of evanescence on the partially covered globe, the tide has
the same height ; aud at any point on the partially covered globe the
semi-diurnal tide is the excess (interpreted algebraically) of the tide
at the corresponding point on the ocean-covered globe above that at
the four points.
   A similar statement holds good for the diurnal and tides of long
period.
   By laborious quadratures Mr. Turner has evaluated in Part     the                  II
five definite integrals on which the corrections to the equilibrium
theory, as applied to the earth, depend.
   The values found show that the points of evanescent semi-diurnal
tide are only distant about 9° from the N. and S. poles; and that of
the four points of evanescent diurnal tide two are close to the equator,
one close to the N. pole, and the other close to the S. pole ; lastly,
that the latitudes of evanescent tide of long period are 34° N. and S.,
and are thus but little affected by the land.
   Thus in all cases the points of evanescence are situated near the
places where the tides vanish when there is no land.         It follows,
therefore, that the correction to the equilibrium theory for land is of
no importance.
                                                                           G. H. D.

   It will be seen that it is only rarely necessary to depart from the
forms of equation +\-=l+x and the two original forms X= const. 1=
const, to represent the coast line with considerable accuracy.            There
are still left one or two outlying portions, of which mention will be
made later.

portion of land indicated by the shaded portion of the diagram, E, Q
being the equator :
the equations to its boundaries       being written at the side of each.

   We may thus simply travel round the boundary omitting the
places where X= constant: being careful to go round all the pieces of
land in the same direction.    If we suppose Z=« to be the meridian of
Greenwich, and the land to be in the northern hemisphere, the
direction indicated above     the wrong one for obtaining the value of
                                  is

quantities of very much greater magnitude, as becomes obvious on
proceeding to the numerical calculation; and thus a comparatively
small change in one of the large compensating quantities, due to large
tracts of land in different portions of the globe, affects the integrals
   a considerable extent.
  In this connexion     was led to investigate the effect of counting
                         I
various small islands and promontories as sea, or small bays and
straits    land. For instance, a portion of sea in the neighbour

hood of Behring's Straits        included as land, and
                                        is                corresponding        a
correction must be applied to the integrals.         This correction                                    I
have estimated as follows — The area of the sea

each degree   of  latitude  and   longitude and counting the squares
covered by sea, fractions of a square to one decimal place being in
cluded, though the tenths have been neglected in the concluded sum.
This area has then been multiplied by the value of (say) coss\cos2Z

seen that part of the Kamschatkan Peninsula is excluded from the
coast line, and part of the Sea of Okhotsk is included; but these
will produce nearly equal effects on the integrals in opposite direc

     The estimation of corrections due to these supplementary portions
  has been checked in two cases by a detailed extension of the method
  of square blocks of land used previously for evaluation of the whole
  integrals ; that is to say, two of these portions were separately
  divided into square degrees (instead of squares whose sides were
  each ten degrees), and the integral evaluated in a similar manner to
  that previously described.            The agreement of the values so calcu
  lated with those obtained by the above method of estimation was
  sufficiently exact to justify a certain confidence in the close agreement
  of the finally corrected values of the integrals with their theoretically
  perfect values.

      In  a scientific    survey   by the Department of Mines, New South
  Wales, of Lord Howe's Island, fossil remains were obtained which
  were transmitted to the British Museum of Natural History, and were
  confided to the author for determination and description.
      These fossils, referable to the extinct family of horned Saurians
  described in former volumes of the " Philosophical Transactions "*
  under the generic name Megalania, form the subject of the present
  paper.     They represent species smaller in size than Megalania prisca,

platyceps.    Portions of a cranium and mandible are referred to a
Meiolania minor. Both species, as in Megalania, are edentulous with
modifications of the mouth indicative of a horny beak, as in the
Chelonian order.       The cranial and vertebral characters are, however,
sauroid.    Horn-cores in three pairs are present but shorter relatively,
especially the first and third pairs, than in Megalania prisca.          The
indication of   a seventh   more advanced  and   medial horn  is feeble, and
the author remarks that in the small existing lizard (Moloch) this
horn has not an osseous support.       The tail of Meiolania is long and
stiff ; the vertebrae being encased by an osseous sheath, developing, as
in Megalania, tuberous processes in two pairs, corresponding with the
 vertebrae within : such defensive parts are less developed, relatively,
than in Megalania prisca.
    The locality of these singular remains is an insular tract not
exceeding 6 miles by 1 mile in extent ; situated mid-way between
Sydney and Norfolk Island, in lat. 31° 31' S., long. 159° 9' E.
The island is formed of three raised basaltic masses connected by
low-lying grounds of blown coral-sand formation, consisting of
rounded grains and fragments of corals and shells.        In the parts of
this formation converted into rock were found the petrified remains
which are the subject of the present paper.         It is accompanied by
drawings of the most instructive fossils : these form the subjects of
five plates illustrative of the text.
III.   " On the Luni-Solar Variations of Magnetic Declination and
     Hori,ontal Force at Bombay, and of Declination at Trevan-
     drum."     By Charles Chambers, F.R.S., Superintendent of
     the Colaba Observatory, Bombay.              Received March 24,
      1886.
                                 (Abstract.)
   The materials described in this paper are twenty-five years of
declination observations, and twenty-six and a half years of horizontal
force observations, taken at the Colaba Observatory, Bombay, and
some results of ten years declination observations          taken at the
Trevandrum Observatory.          A  consideration   of the lunar diurnal
variations derived from these observations for different seasons and
phases of the moon, leads the author to form the hypothesis that
these variations are, properly speaking, combinations of solar diurnal
variations that run through a cycle of change in a lunation. The
characteristics   of the variations that give rise to the hypothesis are
(1)  that  generally  the great movements occur in them, as in the mean
solar   diurnal  variations  for full lunations, in the solar day hours,
whilst the night hours are relatively quiescent ; and (2) that they

have generally the same character and range at intervals of half a
lunation, and opposite characters at intervals of a quarter of a luna
tion. An expression for the variation at any age of the moon that
would satisfy these characteristics would take the form
                   /,.,(&) cos                sin
                               2^<) +/„(*)        2(^t),
where h is the hour of the solar day, P the mean period of a lunation,
and t the age of the moon, and/c.2(/i), ft.3(h) are solar diurnal varia
tions that are constant for the same season of the year. It was found
that although such a formula embraced the bulk of the phenomena,
there remained minor characteristics of a systematic kind that found
expression only in the extra terms of the formula when extended as
follows : —
MW coS(^t)+M(h)sin(^tyfc.3(k)              cos
                                               2(2p^)+/,.sWsin    2^)
   Not only   does the hypothesis hold good in the different seasons of
the year   and  with respect both to the declination and horizontal force
at Bombay, but the variations of the two elements are related to each
other in a definite manner; in the winter season the variations of decli
nation at one age of the moon are similar to those of the horizontal
force at an age of the moon one-eighth of a lunation greater ; and
conversely, in the summer and autumn the variations of horizontal
force take precedence of those of the declination by one-eighth of a
lunation. So far as the means of testing it are available, the hypo
thesis holds also in respect of magnetic variations at Trevandrum.
Each term of the formula is symbolical of a definite physical concep
tion, viz., that an otherwise constant variation swells and contracts
with a wave-like motion, as the age of the moon increases, between
the limits —f(h) and +f(h).       The existence of luni-solar variations
of the kind described is, so far as the author is aware, brought to
light for the first time, by the long series of observations taken at
Bombay, and their capability of expression in a compact form which
has a definite physical significance cannot, the author thinks, fail to
be helpful towards the discovery of the physical conditions that lie
behind them.

   It has therefore occurred to me, that if the magnified image of a
photograph projected on          a screen by the optical        lantern could be made
stereoscopic,        a   still greater resemblance          to the original might be

   Two optical lanterns are placed side by side, as for dissolving views.
Two transparencies, photographed in the same manner, as            intended   if
for an ordinary stereoscope,   are  placed one   in  each lantern, and pro

cut that they will obstruct the view through the right and the left
eye-holes alternately.
  Finally the connexion between the three disks has to be so arranged
that the time of obscuring the view of the observers' right eyes or
left   eyes shall coincide     with the time when the light
                                                        shut off from    is
the right or left lens of the lanterns respectively.
   It obvious that by this arrangement the left eyes can only see the
       is

 picture projected from the left hand lantern, and the right eyes can
 only see that from the right hand lantern.
     The rotation of the disks must be of such a rate, that the alternate
 flashes of the right and left pictures on the corresponding eyes follow
 in such rapid succession that the impression made by one flash does
 not diminish sensibly before the next flash on the same eye is received.
 The number of flashes for each eye which is required to produce an
 apparently -continuous view, withont any flickering effect, is from
 thirty to forty per second. As the disks are so cut as to produce two
 flashes for the right eyes, and two for the left in one revolution, they
 must consequently be kept rotating at a rate of from fifteen to twenty
 revolutions per second.
    The rotation of the disks is effected by a driving-wheel and band,
 worked by a crank handle at the back of the apparatus.
    The perspective effect obtained by the above arrangement is very
 perfect, the image of each object standing out in solid relief.
    Considering that by this arrangement the two eyes never see at the
 same time, and that each eye views its picture after the other, it is
 interesting to find that the persistence of vision so completely bridges
 over the alternate interruptions to which it is subjected as to produce
 the effect of a continuous view.
    An unavoidable effect resulting from this arrangement is, that by
 the rotation of the disks one half of the light produced by each
 lantern is always cut off; the higher, therefore, the illuminating
 power used the better is the result.
    This defect is, however,    I  consider, counterbalanced   by several
advantages which this form of stereoscope possesses.          Firstly, the
pictures   can be enlarged to such  an  extent as to appear equal,  or even
larger than the original objects from which they were taken ; and
secondly, the eyes, in looking at the pictures, are not in any way
subjected to strain by lenses, prisms, or reflectors, or by the difficulty
which some persons experience in getting the two pictures to super
pose.    For each eye views its corresponding picture in exactly the
same position it would see it in if it were looking at the original,
since the two pictures are practically in the same place, which is not
the case in any other form of stereoscope.
    Although with the apparatus as here described only two persons
can see the pictures at the same time, it would not be very difficult to
construct it so as to be available for a greater number.    The side disks
above described only serve to control one pair of eye-holes each, bnt
by making them a little larger they would serve for two pairs each,
thus accommodating four observers.         By increasing the number of
disks, the number of observers might be increased proportionately.

                                  (Abstract.)
   1.  As to the relation of the corpuscular elements of the blood to
coagulation.     The plasma itself contains all the elements necessary
for coagulation.
   The white blood corpuscles probably aid coagulation to a certain
extent, but their influence is entirely secondary.
   The really important factor in initiating coagulation is a substance
dissolved in the plasma, discovered by the author, and called by him
A-fibrinogen. Lymph cells differ from white blood corpuscles ; they
are very active in inducing coagulation.
    2. As to the chemical processes of coagulation, the author considers
there are three coagulable bodies present in the plasma.            These he
names A-, B-, and C-fibrinogen.*           They are closely allied to one
another, and are not separated by a sharp line from one another.
    C-fibrinogen is identical with the body which has hitherto been
known as fibrinogen, but it is only present in minimal quantities in
blood plasma ; it is coagulable with fibrin ferment.         The bulk of the
coagulable matter of the plasma is B-fibrinogen;             it clots on the
addition    of lecithin ; it does  not clot with fibrin ferment ; it clots
with leucocytes from lymph glands.
    A-fibrinogen is separable from the plasma by cooling ; it separates
as minute, regular, rounded granules ; it is not coagulable by fibrin
ferment.
    A- and B-fibrinogen are compounds         of proteid and lecithin.    The
                          * These names are prorisional.

1886.]               On the Coagulation      of  the  Blood.           321
essential point in the coagulation of the blood is a loss of lecithin on
the part of A-fibrinogen, and a gain of lecithin on the part of
B-fibrinogen. A-fibrinogen loses some of its lecithin to B-fibrinogen,
and the result is that in the place of the two fibrinogens we have
fibrin. Previous authors have all regarded coagulation as essentially
a fermentative process.
   The author regards the fibrin ferment as purely subsidiary, and
considers that coagulation is nearly allied to crystallisation.
   3. In the fluid of lymph glands from which all the cellular elements
have been removed, another form of fibrinogen exists closely allied to
and probably the precursor of the A-fibrinogen of the blood. It
differs from the latter in causing intravascular clotting,* whereas
A-fibrinogen only causes under normal conditions clotting in shed
blood.
   It is a proteid-lecithin compound, and its action can be shown to
depend on the lecithin it contains.        It has a wide distribution apart
from lymph glands.
   In the fluid of serous cavities of certain animals, the only coagulable
body present is C-fibrinogen, and since the blood of these animals
contains both A- and B-fibrinogen, the vascular wall either only
allows C-fibrinogen to pass, or changes A- and B-fibrinogen into
C-fibrinogen in their passage through.

                Notes upon an Alcyonarian (Clavularia viridis).
    In one of my earliest walks upon the coral reefs of Talisse,               I came
across a spot where Tubipores and Cornularias were more abundant
than elsewhere.         Quantities of the little crowds of brownish-green
or pure brown polypes of these Alcyonarians, with occasionally a
crowd of the emerald-green polypes of a small species of Tnbipora,
were to be seen on every side. As              I was wading along through the
water on this spot, my stick accidentally struck against a mass of
what     I  thought was Tubipora ; but when the polypes had retracted                 I
saw to my surprise that, instead of the usual bright red skeleton,
there was a skeleton of a dirty green colour, the tubes of which were
joined, not by platforms, but by tubes. Taking with me a large speci-

       [Note by Professor M. N. Moseley. The Alcyonarian described here by
Mr. Hickson is apparently identical with a specimen in the British Museum,
collected by Mr. A. R. Wallace in the Aru Islands, and labelled Clavularia viridis.
The existence of transverse communicating canals in Clavularia, extending between
the vertical tubes at successive heights above the stolon tubes, as in Syringopora, is
apparently a new fact, and one of great interest. The genus Clavularia has received
considerable attention from modern naturalists.          Or. v. Koch has described the
 anatomy of Clavularia prolifera, and A. Kowalevsky and A. F. Marion the larval
 phases of Clavularia petricola ; but these forms, together with most others included
 in the genus, appear to have the vertical tubeB united only at the level of the stolon,
 as is the case, according to Mr. Hickson, in the young state of the form he describes*
 Possibly his form will require to be placed in a separate genus.      The existence of
 rudimentary ampulla; in the ccenosteum of Millepora has been described by
 Mr. Quelch, of the British Museum, but the actual gonads of the Milleporidee have
 hitherto remained undiscovered.       The notes have been written by Mr. Hickson
 where he is of course unable to refer to scientific literature.]

1886.]       Zoological Observations made in North      Celebes.       323
men of it in sea-water,   Iexamined it carefully at my house, and the
next morning    I procured some more, and treated it in various ways
for microscopic examination.
   There are one or two features in the anatomy of this Alcyonarian
which throw a good deal of light not only upon the zoological position
of Tnhipora but also that of the extinct Syringopora.
   At present I have only found this form on the inside of the reef
growing upon old and dead coral masses ; in its neighbourhood are
numerous specimens of Tubipora, some of them with unusually large
tubes, two or three species of Cornularia, a few Madreporas, and one
or two Astraeids. It clings to the rocks by a stolon of tubes, which
run in various directions and follow all the unevennesses of the sup
porting rock. It is very easy, however, to pull it away bodily, without
injuring the stolon.
   The polype tubes spring perpendicularly from the stolon, and rise
to a height of 2 or 3 inches.    I   have not found any tubes longer than
that at present, in fact the average is rather below that. It may be,
however, as is the case with Tubipora, that the masses grow much
larger and the tubes much longer in more favourable localities.
The tubes are united together, not by platforms, as in Tubipora,
but by simple tubes, as in Syringopora (fig. 1), and from these con
necting tubes new polype tubes spring. Each polype tube is marked
by eight grooves, corresponding with the eight mesenteries, and these
grooves, instead of running straight from the stolon to the mouth,
turn to the left, and run up the tubes spirally, plainly showing that
in the course of the growth of the polype from the stolon or connect
ing tube it is twisted from left to right. Examining a portion of the
dried skeleton,     Ifound that it is not purely calcareous, as is the
skeleton   of  Tubipora, but consists of a few long spicules imbedded
in a coriaceous substance, which is unaffected by strong hydrochloric
acid.    I should not like to say for certain of what chemical nature
this substance   is,but from its microscopic appearance  I     should expect
elastin.   The  tubes  are  not perforated  as in Tubipora,  and
                                                              I    cannot at
present discover any organic connexion between the mesoderm outside
the tube and the mesoderm inside the tube.
   The polypes very closely resemble the polypes of Tubipora. They
are of a rich brown colour, and contract but slowly when irritated.
The tentacles have the usual Alcyonarian character, and are richly
armed with nematocysts.
   At this season of the year this Alcyonarian does not seem to breed
at all, as after examining a great many polypes     I     have found none
sexually  mature.    The   young  colonies, which  are to be  found in abun
dance on the reefs, closely resemble a species of Cornularia, which       is
found here in abundance, consisting simply of branched stolons, from
which the young polypes spring.

 Small portion of the skeleton ( x 2) as it appears when dry, showing the longitu
   dinal grooves which correspond with the mesenteries (,gg), the connecting tubes
   (tt), and a young polype springing from a connecting tube (p).
   Histologically it does not seem to differ in any important particular
from Tubipora, but       I  hope in a later and fuller paper to be able to
give    the results of a  further and better investigation.
    The importance and interest of this genus is two-fold. In the first
place the structure of the stolon, the mode of connexion of the polype
tubes, and the fact that its skeleton is imperforate, show that it is
closely allied to the extinct genus Syringopora, which it resembles in
all these particulars.      Notwithstanding the mass of evidence which

1886.]       Zoological Observations made in North              Celebes.       325
has been brought by Moseley, Zittel, and others, to prove that this
latter genus is Alcyonarian, there are still some authors who main
tain that it is Zoantharian.         The peculiar structure of the present
form goes far to prove that the former opinion is right, and the latter
wrong.
    In the second place the resemblance of the young colonies of this
form to the genus Cornularia, and the resemblance of the adult
colonies and polypes to those of Tubipora, justify the conclusion I
arrived at in a former paper, that Tubipora should be united with
the Cornularidffi into a group, the Stolonifera ; this genus is, in fact,
the connecting link between these genera which was formerly missing,
unless we assumed that Syringopora was undoubtedly Alcyonarian.
    I hope in a future paper to be able to give some further particulars
of the anatomy of this form, perhaps also some account of the early
stages of its development, and some account of my researches upon
 the other Stoloniferous Alcyonaria, which are present here in abun
dance.
                     Note on Tubipora and on MUlepora.
    I have got the early stages of the development of Tubipora.                It is
regularly   holoblastic,  and  I  think  the   gastrula  is  formed    by invagina
tion. Finding, however, that it is very difficult to keep the embryos
alive in this hot and dusty weather,         I  must wait until it becomes a
little cooler in December before       I can get any very satisfactory results
on this latter point.
    The generative products of Millepora are formed in little capsules
 in the walls of the canals, and       I  have found both male and female
capsules in the same canals.         The embryos,      I believe from the evidence
of   one preparation     only, reach    a   certain   stage    of development in
chitinous capsules     in   the canals,    and  they  are   then    discharged into
the water by the mouths of the gastrozooids.

       D.Sc. Received April 3, 1886.
   Omitting the indnctive effects of the current in the armature itself,
all the properties of a dynamo machine are most conveniently deduced
from a statement of the relation between the magnetic field and the
magnetising force required to produce that field.           This relation
given, it is easy to deduce what the result will be in all employments
of the machine, also the result of varying the winding of the machine
in armature or magnets.           The magnetic field may be expressed
algebraically   as  a function of the magnetising force, or more conve
niently by a curve (" Proceedings of the Institution of Mechanical
Engineers," April, 1879, p. 246). Amongst the empirical formula
which have been proposed to express the electromotive force of
dynamo machines in terms of the currents around the magnets, we
may mention that known as Frohlich's, where        E =   — ——    , E being
                                                          1 + 6c
the electromotive    force of the machine at a given speed, c the exciting
current, and a and     b constants.  For some machines this hyperbola is
said to express observed results fairly accurately.    In our experience
it does not sufficiently approximate to a straight line in the part of
the curve near the origin, and gives too high results for large
values of c.
    One purpose of the present investigation is to give an approximately
complete construction of the characteristic curve of a dynamo of given
form from the ordinary laws of electromagnetism and the known
properties    of iron. Let n be the number of convolutions on the
magnets,    c the current round the magnets, li the mean length of the
lines of force in the iron of the armature, A, the area of section of
iron in the armature, Zj the distance from iron of armature to iron of
pole pieces, A2 the area of the magnetic field in which the wires move
corrected for its extension round the edge of the pole pieces, Zj the
total length of the magnet cores, A3 the area of the magnet cores, Jt
the mean length of lines of force in the yoke connecting the magnet
limbs in machines of the type on which we have principally experi
mented, Ai the area of section of the yoke, Z5 the mean length of the
lines of force in each pole piece, As the mean area of section of pole
piece,   I the total induction through the armature, when no current
passes in the armature, and vl the total induction in the magnet
cores ; and finally let the relation between the magnetic force (*)

If the relation between            given in the form of a curve, this
                             a and a be

                                a
for the characteristic. Taking the curve of magnetisation determined
by one of us for wrought iron, and constructing a characteristic in
this way, we have obtained a theoretical curve which agrees over                 a
long range with the actual results of observation on a dynamo
machine more closely than any empirical formula with which we are
acquainted.
  To determine v,    wire was taken once round the middle of one
                     a
magnet and connected to a ballistic galvanometer,    known current
                                                                 a
was then either suddenly passed round the magnets or short circuited,

tion was made with the same current, the galvanometer being con

                                              I was roughly ascertained
in a similar manner.
   The currents in the fixed coils round the magnets are not the only
magnetising forces applied in a dynamo machine.        The currents in
the moving coils of the armature have also their effect upon the
resultant field.   In well-constructed machines the effect of the latter
is reduced to a minimum, but       can be by no means neglected.

introduces a second independent variable, viz.,      the current in the

armature. The effect of the current in the armature depends upon
the lead given to the brushes.     Denote this by    which we may also

   If I=F(4nmc) be the characteristic curve when no current passes
through the armature, then

is not difficult to deduce a geometrical construction for the character

equation may be thus expressed in words, if X be such that the coils at
commutation embrace the whole or nearly the whole induction.          The
effect of the current in the armature upon the difference of potential
between the brushes of any machine, is the same as that of an
addition to the resistance of the armature proportional to the lead of
the brushes, and to the ratio of the waste field to the total field,
combined with that of taking the main current      —    times round the

magnets in a direction opposite to the current c. Many consequences
can be deduced, of which we may notice the following : — In a series
wound dynamo C is equal to c, and if c be increased beyond a certain
point,  I must attain a maximum and then diminish; this has been
frequently observed.     We now see that it depends upon the existence
of a waste field. Secondly, let the coils of the magnets be entirely
disconnected, and let X be the negative : if the armature be short
circuited through a small resistance and be run at a sufficient speed,
a large current may be produced in the armature.       This latter deduc
tion we have verified by direct experiment.
   The efficiency of the type of dynamo machine upon which the
experiments before indicated have been made, has been accurately
determined by the device of coupling two similar machines, both
mechanically and electrically, so that one should act as a generator of
electricity, driving the other electrically, whilst the latter acted
as a motor driving the former mechanically; the loss of power
required to keep the whole combination in movement being determined
by direct dynamometric measurement, and the power passing electri
cally from the one machine to the other being measured by ordinary

  L " On an Effect Produced by the Passage of an Electric
      Discharge through Pure Nitrogen."            By J. J. Thomson,

      of Experimental Physics in the University of Sydney.
      Received April 13, 1886.
   In  the course of some experiments which we have been engaged
with for some time past, on the temporary increase in the volume of
a rarefied gas which takes place when an electric discharge passes
through it (De la Rue and Midler, " Phil. Trans.," 1880), we found
that the passage of the spark always produced permanent as well as
 temporary effects when the gas was nitrogen and when the pressure
 was less than that due to 20 mm. of mercury.          The experiments
described below were undertaken to clear up this point, and from
 them we have drawn the following conclusions : —
   1. That when a succession of electric sparks of the proper kind is
sent through a sealed discharge-tube      containing nitrogen at a low
pressure (less  than  20 mm.  of mercury),  a permanent diminution in

330                Profs.  J. J.  Thomson and R. Threlfall.             [May 6,
the volume       of the nitrogen takes place, which reaches a maximum,
after which the passage of sparks of the same kind produces no
permanent effect upon the volume.
    2. That for nitrogen at a pressure of 8 mm. of mercury, which i*
the pressure at which we have usually worked, the permanent diminu
tion in volume is from 8 to 12 per cent. of the original volume, while
at a pressure of 16 mm. of mercury the diminution is not more than
from 2 to 3 per cent. ; thus, though there are twice as many molecules
in the tube the effect is not so big.
    3. The diminution in volume takes a considerable time to reach its
maximum value ; in our experiments, where the discharge-tubes are
1 cm. in diameter       and 25 cm. long, and the sparks were produced by
an induction coil giving a spark about 4 inches long in air, it took
about eight hours' sparking to produce the maximum diminution.
    4. That this diminution takes place equally well whether platinum
or aluminium electrodes are used.
    5. That the ratio of the maximum diminution to the original
volume is independent of the volume of the discharge-tube and of the
extent of its surface.
    6. That if the tube be maintained at a temperature of over 100° C.
for several hours, the gas regains its original volume.
    We attribute this diminution in the volume of the gas to the forma
tion of an allotropic modification of nitrogen.*
    We now proceed to give a detailed description of the experiments
and of the various parts of the apparatus.
                             Discharge-tube and Gauge.
    We had a good deal of trouble in getting this part of the apparatus
satisfactory; we found that discharge- tubes of the ordinary kind
were very liable to leak round the electrodes after a series of sparks
had been passed through them.             The form of tube we finally adopted
is represented in fig. 1. AB is a glass tube about 25 cm. in length
and 1 cm. in diameter, into which the         JJ -piece E, F, G, fused up at G,
is fused, sulphuric acid or mercury is placed at the bend of this (J -tube,
and serves as a gauge to measure alterations in the pressure of the
gas in AB.        The end B dips into a vessel containing mercury, the
level of which is higher than that of the part of the tube through which
the electrode passes ; a piece of glass tubing is placed over the top of
the discharge-tube, and the interval between the tubes caulked with
glass wool ; the cup thus formed is filled with mercury, which reaches
above the entrance of the electrode into the tube.           The electrodes are

then covered with mercury, which prevents any leakage between the
electrode and the tube, which we found frequently happened if this
precaution was not taken.    The tubes were cleaned before being used
by filling them (1) with aqua regia, which was boiled in the tube, (2)
with caustic potash, (3) distilled water, (4) very pure alcohol. After
this they were carefully heated and dried.       This was the treatment
adopted for the greater part of the tubes, some of them, however,
were treated with boiling sulphuric acid in addition.
   The sulphuric acid in the gauge was boiled with sulphate of
ammonia before being used ; when the sulphate was first added to the
acid, the acid became dark, but it was boiled for about half a day
until it was quite colourless, and its volume about one-fourth of its
original value.
   The levels of the liquid in the legs of the gauge were read by a
cathetometer ; when the liquid was sulphuric acid the readings could
be made accurately enough by placing a sheet of white paper behind
the gauge and illuminating it by a gas flame. When, however, the
liquid in the gauge was mercury a different course was adopted. In
the first place, the gauge-tube had to be much larger to prevent
mistakes arising from the sticking of the mercury to the sides of the
tube. The gauge used for mercury was of the shape shown in fig. 2 ;
the diameter of the tube where the free surface of the mercury came
into contact with it was about 2 cm. A different method of reading
the levels of the mercury in the legs of the gauge had also to be
adopted, because it was found that when the gas flame was in front

of the mercury different readings could be obtained by moving it
about, the surface of the mercury was therefore illuminated from
behind by a parallel and horizontal beam of light which passed
through an alum cell to avoid any heating effect.
   The electrodes were either platinum or aluminium, generally pla
tinum ; in some of the tubes these were fused into small pieces of
glass tubing, so that only the tips of the electrodes were exposed to
the nitrogen.     Before being sealed the tabe was connected with the
pump    and   the  gas supply in the way shown in fig. 3.  After being
                                  Fig. 3.
cleaned and dried, and the gauge filled either with sulphuric acid or
mercury, the tube was pumped out and filled with nitrogen, and this
process was repeated several times ; when the pressure was very low
the tube was heated to as high a temperature as it would stand with
out softening, in order to drive off any gas that might be on the

surface.     Then a series of sparks from six very large Leyden jars
charged    with  a Holtz machine were sent through the tube ; at first
when the light produced by the sparks was examined by the spec
troscope the hydrogen lines were seen to be very bright, the hydrogen
presumably coming out of the electrodes ; as the sparking and pump
ing continued the hydrogen lines diminished in brightness, and we
went on sparking alternately with the Holtz and the induction coil
until they had disappeared.         We may mention in passing that the
relative brightness of the hydrogen and nitrogen lines in a mixture
of these gases is to a very large extent a question of pressure ; we
found that after we had gone on sparking until there were no
hydrogen lines visible at a pressure of 8 mm. of mercury, if we
pumped out the gas until the pressure was reduced to 2 mm., the
hydrogen lines immediately reappeared, and it required a great deal
more sparking to get rid of them at this pressure. The lower the pres
sure the more prominent were the hydrogen lines. We went on spark
ing until there were no hydrogen lines visible at a pressure of 8 mm.,
when the sparks were produced either by the Holtz or the induction
coil, and until there were no hydrogen lines visible at a pressure of
2 mm., when the sparks were produced by the induction coil. We
never, however, were able to satisfy ourselves that the hydrogen lines
were absent when the large sparks from the Holtz were sent through
the tube at this pressure, though if they were there they were only
very faint. When we had reached this stage the hydrogen lines
showed no tendency to reappear when fresh nitrogen was introduced
into the tube, showing that the hydrogen came from the electrodes
 and not from damp in the nitrogen. We found more difficulty in
 getting the hydrogen ont of aluminium terminals than out of platinum
ones. When the tube had reached this stage fresh nitrogen was let
in and pumped out until the pressure in the tube was the required
 value, generally 8 mm. of mercury ; the tubes g and h, fig. 3, were then
 fused off, the gauges being watched all the time to see that there was
 no influx of air during this operation.      When the tube had cooled the
 difference of level of the fluid in the (J-tube was read by the cathe-
 tometer.     It was then generally left to stand over night, and another
 reading taken the next day ; except in the few cases when the tube
 had cracked, the readings were always found to be the same as those
 taken on the previous evening.           The tube was then ready to be
 experimented     on.
                         Preparation  of the Nitrogen.
    The nitrogen was prepared        by passing air over red-hot copper.
  A  porcelain tube about 70 cm. long was placed on a gas furnace, it
 was filled with copper turnings and copper gauze ; during one-half of

the experiments the gauze was placed at the ends and the turning's in
the middle, in the other half, half the tube was filled with copper
turnings and the other half with gauze. The air was sucked through
a tube containing pieces of pumice moistened with potash, and through
a bottle half filled with the same substance, the other end of the tube
was stopped by an indiarubber cork coated with paraffin, through
which a glass tube passed which conducted the nitrogen to a series of
bottles and tubes. These bottles and the porcelain tube were made
quite air-tight ; this was tested by putting the tube through which
the air passed on its way to the copper in connexion with an air-
pump, and exhausting down to a pressure of about 20 mm. of mercury,
even with this exhaustion there was no appreciable leak through the
whole arrangement of porcelain         tube, drying-tubes and bottles,
discharge  -tubes  and connexions.   The  porcelain tube was connected
by a piece of thick-walled indiarubber tubing with a series of bottles
and tubes containing purifying reagents.      After leaving the copper
the nitrogen passed through a potash solution in a bottle, then
through two large tubes filled with carefully prepared pumice
moistened with potash, it then bubbled through sulphuric acid which
had been boiled down with sulphate of ammonia to about one-fourth
of its original volume, it then passed through two large \J -tubes
filled with phosphorous pentoxide divided up into a number of layers
by asbestos plugs, it then went into a large bottle about one-fourth
filled with phosphorous pentoxide. All the phosphorous pentoxide used
was tested and found to be free from free phosphorus.     The gas after
leaving the phosphorous pentoxide bottle passed through thick-walled
indiarubber tubing into the discharge-tube.     The volume of the tubes
and bottles was very large compared with that of the discharge- tube,
and as our consumption of nitrogen was slow the gas we used had
stood over the phosphorous pentoxide for several days at least and
often much longer.       On the other hand, the gas had only been in
contact with indiarubber for a short time, for the indiarubber bungs
in the bottles were all coated on the inside with paraffin, and the only
long piece of tubing was that leading from the last drying bottle to
the discharge-tube ; gas that had stood in this for more than a few
minutes was always sucked out, and was never used for filling the
discharge-tube.
    The oxide of copper formed in the tube was reduced from time to
time, in most cases by passing hydrogen through the tube ; the
hydrogen was generally prepared by pouring sulphuric acid on zinc,
but   as we suspected that a trace of sulphur dioxide which we detected
had its origin in this source, we endeavoured to reduce the copper
oxide by electrolytically prepared hydrogen ; we could not, however,
produce the hydrogen fast enough in this way, and so we finally
 reduced the copper oxide by carbon monoxide prepared from pure

formate of potassium ; in this case the nitrogen showed no trace of
sulphur dioxide, there was, however, no alteration in its behaviour in
the discharge-tube.
   We detected the trace of S02 by the change produced by the gas in
the colour of paper soaked in a mixture of ferric chloride and ferric
cyanide, the amount of           it,
                           however, must have been very small, as the
gas produced no colouration in a paper soaked in a solution of iodide
of potassium and starch, which         a very delicate test for sulphur
                                              is
dioxide.   The  diminution  in  the  volume of the nitrogen which we
observed could not have been due to the trace of S02, as        occurred          it
when   the copper oxide had  been  reduced by CO,  and  no trace  of S02
was to be detected even by the ferric chloride and ferricyanide
solution.
              Determination      of    the Quantity      of   Oxygen   in   the Gas.
  We were unable to detect any change of colour in a small quantify
of a solution of pyrogallol and caustic potash when 50 c.c. of our gas
was passed through into a eudiometer. It was thought desirable, how
ever, to have a more perfect testing arrangement, and the following                         is
a description of the form ultimately adopted.

   The apparatus consists essentially of four tubes and a bottle whose
volume      known by means of connexions of indiarubber tubing,
             is             ;
taps, and clamps, each tube can be put in communication with the
nitrogen supply and with the bottle separately.    The tap between                          C

potash, and D with a solution of pyrogallol, also well boiled.             The
tube connexions    are  then  replaced,  and    the  bottle E, whose  volume is
large compared with that of the other parts of the apparatus, is then
exhausted as far as possible by means of a water-pump.             A stream of
nitrogen is allowed to flow into the tubes, which are exhausted by
connecting them with the bottle.            After exhausting and refilling
several times the tube C is left     exhausted,      and D in connexion with
the nitrogen supply.       The tap between C and D is then cautiously
turned, as soon as this is down the contents of D flow over into C.
 As the potash solution is denser than the pyrogallol, a very perfect
 mixing of the fluids takes place automatically in C. As we never
 succeeded in getting the mixed solution colourless, it is necessary to
 preserve some of it as a standard for comparison.             This is done by
 connecting B and C with the nitrogen supply together, and opening
 the clamp between them ; the liquid then flows into B till it stands at
the same level there as in C. The capacities of the tubes are arranged
 so that there are sensibly the same quantities of liquid in B and C,
 this can be done by raising or lowering B. The clamp between B
 and C is now closed, C put in communication with the exhausted
 bottle, and D in communication with the gas supply.* The pressure
 of the gas in the exhausted bottle is observed : suppose it is p. The
 tap between C and D is then opened, so as to allow a slow stream of
the gas to pass from D up through C into the bottle ; as soon as a
 sufficient deepening of the colour has taken place in the liquid in C,
 the tap is turned off and the new pressure p in the bottle noted.
 Knowing p and p' and the capacity of the bottle,, we can calculate the
 quantity of gas which has flowed through the liquid in C. The stream
 of gas passes very slowly, and it is assnmed that all the oxygen it
 contains has been absorbed by the liquid in C. We now require to
 know how much oxygen is required to produce the same change in
 colour, this is done by comparing the colour with that of the liquid in
 B. A is a pipette divided into cubic centimetres, and dipping below
 the surface of water contained in a beaker, the top of the pipette is
connected with the delivery-tube        sealed into and running down B.
 This tube is very fine inside B, and ends in a very fine point. In
 order to make the comparison of colour, the upper part of the tnbe is
 exhausted, and the clamp connecting it with the pipette slowly
opened, a stream of air will pass up from the pipette into B. This
 process is stopped when the operator judges the colour of the liquid
to be the same in B and C. The level of the water around the pipette
is brought to the same level as that of the water inside, and the
 quantity of air taken is read off. From this we can calculate how
much oxygen is required to produce the same change of colour as that
                 * In the diagram the bottle is at the wrong end.

produced   by the gas we are testing.  We found in this way that our
gas certainly did not contain one part of oxygen in 500, and probably
not one part in 1000.
                                The Experiments.
  A tube carefully prepared and sealed off in the way we have already
described was taken, and after the cathetometer readings had shown
that the pressure had remained constant for several hours, it was
sparked through, generally with an induction coil. In order to get
the effect we are describing, it is necessary to introduce a large resis
tance into the circuit, for this purpose we used a piece of wetted
string, this makes the discharge through the tube much less intense
and the heat produced comparatively small ; we were not able to get
the effect when the discharge passed straight through the tube
without any resistance beyond that of the tube and the connecting
wires.   The fact that heat restores the gas to its original condition is
sufficient to account for this, for when there is only a small resistance
in the circuit, the heat developed in the tube is much greater and
 the tube becomes very hot.       We noticed a similar thing when we
 ased a Holtz machine instead of a coil : if we charged up five large
Leyden jars with the Holtz and then discharged the jars through the
tube, no permanent alteration in the pressure was observed;         if,
                                                                     how
ever, we never allowed the jars to get fully charged, but sent a
succession of small sparks through the tube, then a permanent
diminution in the volume of the gas took place.
    When the discharge from the coil with a piece of wet string in the
circuit went through the tube, slow diminution in the volume of the
                                   a
gas took place the rate of diminution diminished as the sparking went
               ;
on and ultimately the permanent volume of the gas remained un
affected by the passage of the sparks. It took, however, a considerable
time to reach this state as a rule each tube was sparked through for
                           ;
between three and four hours on each of three consecutive days, the
diminution in the volume at the end of the first day was about two-
thirds of the maximum diminution, there was a diminution of about
one-half of this on the following day, and no appreciable diminution on
the third day.
   The gauges of the tubes used at first were filled with sulphuric acid,
and after the discharge had passed through until the pressure had
become steady,     itwas always found that the sulphuric acid in the
limb of the gauge next the tube had risen towards the tube, showing
that the pressure exerted by the gas in the tube had diminished.
The difference of level between the legs of the gauge increased in the
case of five different tubes by from 4-5 to  mm. now the pressure in
                                              7    ;

 about 8 to 12 per cent. We thought at first that this diminution
might be due to the combination of the nitrogen with the sulphuric
acid vapour.    In order to test this we had a tube made with a mercury
 gauge of the kind already described, the difference of level between
the mercury in the two legs of the gauge was increased by 0"9 mm. of
 mercury by the sparking : 0'9 mm. of mercury are equivalent to about
 6'5 of sulphuric acid, so that the magnitude of the effect is practically
the same whether the gnage be filled with mercury or sulphuric acid,
and the effect therefore cannot be due to any combination of nitrogen
with the vapour of sulphuric acid.
    We then thought it might possibly be due to condensation of gas
on the sides of the tube, though it seemed very improbable that this
cause could produce such a large effect upon the pressure.        To test
this, however, we had a discharge-tube made whose diameter was
about 3£ times that of the tubes we had previously been using,
so that in this case the glass was much further away from the line
joining the electrodes, and in fact was so little affected by the glass
that the heating was scarcely perceptible.        In this case the final
result was the same as for the smaller tubes, though it took longer to
arrive at a state of equilibrium ; the difference between the levels of
the sulphuric acid in the limbs of the gauge was increased by 4'8 mm.
Another reason why the diminution in pressure can scarcely be due to
this cause is that it depends very much upon the pressure of the gas.
We sealed off a tube at a pressure of 16 mm. of mercury, and found
that when the discharge had been sent through it until the pressure
had reached a steady state, the pressure had diminished only by that
due to 2'5 mm. of sulphuric acid ; so that the diminution is only about
half the absolute value, and therefore only one-quarter of the relative
value of that which takes place at a pressure of 8 mm. of mercury. It
would seem to be difficult to explain this result by the hypothesis that
it is due to an adhesion of gas to the surface of the glass. The
experiment with the large tube shows that it cannot be due to an
absorption of gas by the electrodes, for in this case the diminution in
pressure would depend upon the ratio of the volume of the electrodes
to the volume of the tube, so that if we increased the volume of the
tube, keeping that of the electrodes the same, the effect ought to be
diminished ; the experiment with the wide tube showed that it is not.
We also found that the effect was not diminished by using a very long
tube, about three times as long as the ordinary ones.
   We next tried whether the diminution in the pressure depended on
the nature of the electrodes by having a tube made with aluminium
electrodes, we got, however, with this tube, the same diminution as we
had previously obtained with those furnished with platinum electrodes ;
the tube, however, was more troublesome to prepare, as the aluminium
electrodes seemed to contain more hydrogen than the platinum ones.

1886.]     Passage  of an Electric Discharge through Nitrogen.         339
This result snows that the decrease in pressure is not due to the
formation of a compound of nitrogen and platinum, a conclusion which
is confirmed by the fact that the decrease is independent of the ratio
of the volume of the electrode to that of the tube. The diminution in
the pressure is too large to be explained by supposing that it is due to
the formation of ammonia, which we know takes place when an
electric spark passes through a mixture of nitrogen and hydrogen, for
it would require at least 15 per cent. of hydrogen to be present to
produce a diminution in the pressure of the gas of from 8 to 12 per
cent., and we feel certain from the spectroscopic tests we have applied
to the gas that the quantity of hydrogen or hydrocarbon present is
extremely small, neither the hydrogen nor the hydrocarbon lines can
be detected at the pressure at which we work. Again, the gas is
restored to its original pressure by keeping it for some time at a
temperature just above 100° C, while ammonia is not decomposed
 except at a much higher temperature.
    The combination of nitrogen and oxygen which takes place when a
 spark passes through a mixture of the two gases is attended by a
 diminution in volume, but we have calculated a superior limit to the
 quantity of oxygen present, and find that it is very much too small to
 explain the effects which we have observed in our tubes.
    It seems to us that the effect is too big to be explained as the result
of an impurity in the gas, and that the only hypothesis which agrees
 with the facts is that we have an allotropic modification of nitrogen
produced by the passage of the sparks.           The formation of this is
quite analogous to that of ozone from oxygen, and we have found that
just as ozone is destroyed by continuous heating, so the diminution in
 pressure which we have observed in nitrogen is permanently destroyed
 if the tube be kept for some time at a temperature of 100° C. ; we
 have not observed any tendency for the diminution in pressure to
disappear as long as the tube is kept at the temperature of the room,
about 15° C. The diminution we have observed seems to depend even
 more than the formation of ozone on the kind of spark which passes
 through the gas, and we are disposed to attribute partly at any rate
 the great differences which we have observed at different pressures
 to this fact, at some pressures it seems impossible to get quite the
 right kind of spark.
    We have noticed that when the electrical discharge goes through
 nitrogen whose pressure has been diminished by previous sparking, it
 has a much greater tendency to produce a beautiful golden colour
than when it passes through a new tube. Exactly (as far as we can
judge) the same discharge which when it goes through a new tube will
produce a bluish-pink colour, will, when it goes through an old one in
which the pressure has diminished, produce a peculiar yellow colour
 between that of chamois leather and gold.

    We have made no attempts to ascertain the chemical properties of
this modified gas, and there are other points which we should have
liked to develop before publishing an account of our experiments, but
as one of us is leaving Cambridge for Australia it seemed advisable to
publish an account of the experiments we have been able to make
together.
    We are indebted     to Mr. Robinson for advice on some chemical
points, and we cannot conclude without acknowledging how much we
owe to the zeal and ability of Mr. Sinclair, the Assistant at the
Cavendish Laboratory, who has done much the greater part of the
large quantity of glass-blowing required for this investigation.

        J. Thomson, M.A., F.R.S., Fellow of Trinity College, and
        Cavendish   Professor   of Experimental Physics in the Uni
        versity of Cambridge, and R. Threlfall, Caius College,
        Cambridge, and Professor of Experimental Physics in the
        University of Sydney.      Received May 1, 1886.
    The first experiment was made in order to see whether ozone could
 be formed by    placing oxygen in a very strong electric field, the field,
 however, being just not strong enough to cause sparks to pass through
 the gas.
     This experiment finally took the following form : — ABC is a box
 made of flat pieces of glass about -^th of an inch thick, fastened
 together with paraffin ; into the box two glass tubes, G and H, are
 inserted, the air entering the box through G, and leaving it through
 H. Against one side of the box a glass bottle, D, with flat sides, is
 placed and filled with water containing a little sulphuric acid, this
 serves as one electrode ; the other electrode is a blackened tin plate,
 E, placed against the opposite side of the box, the distance between
 the electrodes being an inch and a half. The two electrodes are
  connected with the terminals of a Holtz machine.        By altering the
  distance between the terminals any difference of potential can be
  produced between the plates.     When the terminals are close together,
  all the sparks pass between them, but when they are pulled far apart
  the sparks flash across the box, the discharge taking the form of a
  great number of separate sparks from the inside of one plate to the
  inside of the opposite one; the appearance of the box when the
  discharge passes is very pretty, it looks as if several hundred bright
  silver nails with broad heads were connecting the insides of the box.
     The air entered the box through the tube G, having previously
  passed through a series of tubes and bottles filled respectively with

1886.]         Experiments  on the Production  of Ozone.            341
phosphorous pentoxide, pumice moistened with sulphuric acid, and
caustic potash ; it was also freed from dust by passing through a
tube containing a plug of cotton-wool.     After passing through the
box it bubbled through a test-tube, F, containing an iodido of
potassium and starch solution, pieces of filter-paper moistened with
this solution were also fastened to the sides of the box.    We deter
mined the most sensitive solution of potassium iodide and starch by
adding a constant quantity of chlorine-water to various proportions
of potassium iodide and starch ; when the most sensitive solution had
been determined it was always made up of this strength. We found
that the papers were quite as delicate a test of ozone as the test-tube
full of the solution.
   When the observations were being made the whole arrangement
was placed inside a large wooden box, the sides of which were
 blackened, the observer put his head through a hole in one of the

342           Experiments on   the   Production   of   Ozone.   [May 6,
sides of the box, and a black velvet clotb was then put over the box
so that all stray light was excluded, and any spark traversing the box
could easily be detected.   The air was sucked through the box at the
rate of about a litre in ten minutes.    Before trying the experiment
air was sucked through for about half an hour when the electrodes
were at the same potential ; but not the slightest colouration of the
potassium iodide solution in the test-tube or on the pieces of paper in
the box could be detected.     "We then adjusted the distance between
the terminals of the Holtz machine so that the sparks just did not
pass across the vessel, in this case the terminals of the Holtz were
about 4 inches apart, so that the field was as intense as it could be
without producing a discharge.       Air was then sucked through for
more than an hour, but not the slightest colouration could be detected
in either the test-tube or the pieces of paper, though the passage of a
single flash was sufficient to produce a most distinct colouration.
This experiment was repeated over and over again, but always with
the same result ; we never found any ozone unless we had previously
seen a flash across the vessel, hence we conclude that ozone is only
produced when sparks pass through the oxygen.
    A special experiment was made in order to estimate the delicacy of
the test for ozone : to the same quantity of the solution of iodide of
potassium as that through which the air bubbled on its way out from
the vessel, chlorine-water was added until we could detect a discolour
ation.     The amount of chlorine in the quantity of chlorine-water
added was then determined by finding the quantity of iodine set free
by 10 c.c. of it. This was done by means of some very carefully
prepared solution of sodium        hyposulphite, kindly made up and
standardised for us by Mr. M. M. Pattison Muir.              From the
minimum quantity of chlorine required to produce a discolouration
of the solution, we found that the smallest quantity of ozone we
could detect with certainty was 0'0384 mgram. But 6 litres of air, that
 is 1*5 litres of oxygen, had passed slowly through the apparatus and,
 since no discolouration was produced, the amount of ozone formed
 must have been less than O0384 mgram., or less than 0'00016 of the
whole quantity of oxygen which had passed through the apparatus.
 In the second experiment we took an ozonizer made of two concentric
 tubes, and sealed up in it air free from ozone and a large quantity
of phosphorous pentoxide, this was left for three months, so that at
the end of the time the air was presumably dry; on causing the
electric discharge to pass through    it,
                                        however, ozone was produced in
 large  quantities, so that ozoneis   produced when an electric spark
passes through very carefully dried oxygen.

   The author has recently had the honour of presenting to the
Society a memoir relating to the internal friction of metals when
vibrating torsionally at temperatures ranging from 0° C. to 25° C. He
now brings forward results which have been obtained in experiments
on the effect of change of temperature on the torsional elasticity and
internal friction of metals. The apparatus used and the mode of
experimenting are fully described in the paper, so that it will be
sufficient, perhaps, to state here that the vibration-period and the
logarithmic decrement were very carefully determined                              at four
different temperatures between 0° C. and 100° C, and that the
formulae given below were worked out by the method of least squares ;
these formulae are to be found in Tables                I and II.
   A full account of the method adopted for eliminating the effect of
the resistance of the air has been given in the previous memoir above
alluded to.

days to two months.          This treatment consisted in repeatedly heating
the wire to 100°          C,  and then cooling it again until the torsional
elasticity and the internal friction both became constant at all the
temperatures at which the wires were tested, and produced the
following permanent effects : —
   (a.) Very appreciable increase of the torsional elasticity in the
case of some metals and appreciable increase of the torsional elasticity
in all   cases.
   (6.) Large diminution of the internal molecular                  friction, the effect
on the friction being considerably greater than                     the effect      on   the
elasticity.
   (c.)   Very appreciable        increase of the limiting amplitude beyond
 which the logarithmic decrement ceases to be independent of the
amplitude.
    From a consideration of Tables                  I and   II  it may be gathered
that :—
    (i.) The torsional elasticity of all metals is temporarily decreased
 by rise of temperature between the limits of 0° C. and 100° C, the
amount of decrease per degree rise of temperature increasing with the
temperature.         To this may be added that the percentage decrease of
 torsional elasticity produced by a given rise of temperature is for most
metals about twenty times the corresponding percentage increase of
length.
    (e.) If we start with a sufficiently low temperature the internal
friction of all annealed metals is first temporarily decreased by rise of
temperature and afterwards increased.                  The temperature of minimum
 internal friction is for most annealed metals between 0° C. and

 1886.]      On converting Heat Energy into Electrical Energy.          345
100° C.    ;  for most hard drawn wire, however, the temperature of
minimum internal friction is below 0° C.
    (/.) The temporary change, whether of the nature of increase or
decrease, wrought by alteration of temperature in the internal friction
of metals, is in most cases enormously greater than the corresponding
change in the torsional elasticity.

stannous chloride caused a precipitate of metallic tin, the reaction
forming chromic chloride.

the precipitated metal was in a great measure redissolved, forming
the original solution, chromous chloride and stannous chloride, with
out the liberation of hydrogen.
   On cooling this solution the tin was again precipitated, the action
continuing as often as the solution was heated and cooled.
   As chromous chloride has a great affinity for oxygen, it is necessary
the air should be excluded from the solution, otherwise the chromous
chloride would be reduced to oxychloride of chrome, as Loewel states,
and the reactions would cease to take place after a time, the stannous
chloride formed during each heating remaining in solution.
   I  constructed, in the form of a simple galvanic cell, a small element
with this solution, chromic chloride,* as the electrolyte, using tin as
the positive, and platinum as the negative metal.
   At 60° F. this element gives no electromotive force, although in
this case, when the cell was first set up, it gave O0048 volt, owing
probably to the presence of some foreign substance.
   On the elevation of its temperature by the application of heat, the
electromotive force rose and fell, as indicated in the diagram ; the
curves A, B, C, D, E, represent its increase during the rising tempe
rature, and the curves F, G, H, I, J, its fall while cooling.
   The irregularity of the curves A, B, C, D, E, was probably due to
unequal heating.
   At the termination of      the experiment, when the cell had cooled
down to 60° F., no electromotive force was observed, as indicated on
  * The solution used was made    by combining chromium trioxide with hydro
chloric acid, and heating.

motive forces, the ordinate's to the temperatures Fahrenheit.
   The highest electromotive force was 0-2607 volt at 197° F., the
highest degree to which the temperature was raised.
   If the platinum be replaced by a negative electrode of carbon, the
electromotive force will be higher. It may be of interest to mention
that the action of this element during heating is entirely different
from that of the galvanic battery during a similar elevation of its
temperature.

 1886.]    On  the Sun-spot Spectra Observations at Kensington.       347
   W. H. Preece, Esq., F.R.S. (see " The Effects of Temperature on
the Electromotive Force and Resistance of Batteries," " Proc. Roy.
Soc.," vol. 36, p. 48), states "that changes of temperalure do not
practically affect electromotive forces, hut that they materially affect
the internal resistance of cells."
   -When the temperature of this element was lowered to about 145° F.,
the reactions before mentioned took place.
   The tin taken up by the solution during heating commenced to
precipitate, increasing as the temperature lowered, and the metal fell
to the bottom of the cell in a form to he again utilised in the genera
tion of the current.
   The amount of local action or chemical corrosion which took place
above 150° F. was excessive, but the metal taken up by the solution
was very much less when the temperature of the electrolyte was not
raised above the point of precipitation, 140° F.
   The metal taken up below this point appears to be precipitated
under the same conditions as that taken up at higher temperature, and
seems to be precipitated whether the circuit be open or closed.
   It will be seen on the curves F, G, H, I, J, with falling temperature
that the electromotive force increased between 150°{F. and 140° F.,
this might have been due to the reactions which took place during the
precipitation of the metal.
   Further investigations to determine the efficiency of this element
would be of interest.
V. "Further Discussion of the Sun-spot Spectra Observations
      made at Kensington."          By J. Nokman Lockyer, F.R.S.
      Communicated       to the Royal Society by the Solar Physics
      Committee.       Received May 5, 1886.
   I have recently discussed, in a preliminary manner, the lines of
several of the chemical elements most widened in the 700 spots
observed at Kensington.
   The period of observation    commences November,     1879, and extends
to August, 1885.      It includes, therefore, the sun-spot curve from a
minimum to a maximum and some distance beyond.
   It is perhaps desirable that I should here state the way in which
the observations have been made. The work, which has been chiefly
done by Messrs. Lawrance and Greening, simply consists of a survey
of the two regions F — b and 6 — D.
   The most widened line in each region — not the widest line, but the
most widened, is first noted; its wave-length being given' in the
observation    books from Angstrom's map. Next, the lines which

most nearly approach the first one in widening are recorded, and so
on till the positions of six lines have been noted, the wave-lengths
                          o
being given from Angstrom's map, for each region.
   It is to be observed that these observations are made without any
reference whatever to the origin of the lines ; that is to say, it is no
part of the observer's work to see whether there are metallic coinci
dences or not ; this point has only been enquired into in the present
reductions, that    seven months after the last observations now dis
                       is,
cussed were made.      In this way perfect absence of all bias is
secured.
     It   may   further       be remarked         that the number of lines widened
throughout      a   sun-spot period        is   about the same, so that the conditions
of observation vary very little from month to month, and from year
to year.
     It
      may be further remarked that the absolute uniformity of the
results obtained in the case of each of the chemical elements in
vestigated indicates,    think, that the observations
                               I                       have been
thoroughly well made         and, as a matter of fact, they are not
                                 ;
difficult.
I    first give tables (A, B, C) showing that for each of the chemical
elements taken — iron, nickel, and titanium — the number of lines seen
in the aggregate in each hundred observations            reduced from is
minimum to maximum, and that this result holds good for both
regions of the spectrum.
I     next give another table (D) showing that during the observations
the lines recorded as most widened near the maximum have not been
recorded amongst metallic lines by either Angstrom or Thalen, and
that many of them are not among the mapped Fraunhofer lines, though
some of them may exist as faint lines in the solar spectrum when the
observing conditions are best.

   The reduction of the latitudes of the spots is not yet completed.
   The result of these observations may be thus briefly stated. As we
pass from minimum to maximum, the lines of the chemical elements
gradually disappear from among those most widened, their places
being taken by lines of which at present we have no terrestrial
representatives.      Or, to put the result another way — at the mini

mum period of sun-spots when we know the solar atmosphere is
quietest and coolest, vapours containing the lines of some of our
terrestrial elements are present in sun-spots.     The vapours, however,
which produce the phenomena of sun-spots at the sun-spot maximum
are entirely unfamiliar to us.
    The disappearance of the lines of iron, nickel, and titanium, and the
appearance of unknown lines as the maximum is reached is shown by
curves in fig. 1 given on the next page.
    The results, in my opinion, amply justify the working hypothesis
as to the construction of the solar atmosphere which I published some
years ago. (" Proc. Roy. Soc," vol. 34, p. 291.) In the region of the
spectrum comprised between 4860 and 5160,          I  find in the case of
iron, to take an instance, that sixty lines were distributed unequally
among the spots in 1879 and 1880, many iron lines being visible in
every spot. In the last observations, about the maximum, only
three iron lines in all are seen among the most widened lines.      These
three lines also have been visible in four spots only out of the last
hundred. The same thing happens with titanium and nickel, and
with all the substances for which the reductions are finished.
    I am quite content, therefore, to believe that iron, titanium, nickel,
and the other substances very nearly as complex as we know them
here, descend to the surface of the photosphere, in the downrush that
forms a spot at the period of minimum, but that at the maximum, on
the contrary, only their finest constituent atoms can reach it. It may
also be remarked that these particles which survive the dissociating
energies of the lower strata are not the same particles among the
 constituents of the chemical elements named which give the chromo-
 spheric lines recorded by Tacchini, Ricco, and myself.
    Having thus found the working hypothesis to which I have referred
 stand the severe test which the sun-spot observations apply to it,      I
 have gone further, and have endeavoured to extend it in two direc
 tions.
    First. I found   that the view to which the hypothesis directly leads,
 that the metallic prominences are produced by violent explosions due
 to sudden expansions among the cooler matters brought down to form
 the spots, when they reach the higher temperature at and below the
 photosphere level, includes all the facts     I know touching spot and
 prominence formation.        Thus, for instance, the close connexion
 between metallic prominences and spots ; the entire absence of metallic
 prominences with rapid motion from any but the spot-zones ; the fact
 that the faculee always follow the formation of a spot and never pre
 cede it ; that the faculous matter lags behind the spot as a rule ; the
 existence of veiled spots and minor prominences in regions outside
 the spot-zones   ; the general injection of unknown substances into the
                                                              2 B 2

the following volumes : —

    In these higher figures we certainly do seem nearer the scale on
which we know solar phenomena to take place; the tremendous
rending of the photosphere, upward velocities of 250 miles a second,
and even higher horizontal velocities according to Peters, are much
more in harmony with the figures in the second table than the first.
    I may mention in connexion with this part of the subject, that
the view of the great mobility of the photosphere which this hypo
thesis demands, so soon as we regard metallic prominences as direct
effects of the fall of spot material, is further justified by the fact that
if we assume the solar atmosphere, that is the part of the sun outside
the photosphere, to be about half a million miles high, which                    I
regard as a moderate estimate, the real average density of the sun is
very nearly equal to one-tenth that of water, instead of being slightly
greater than that of water, as stated in the text-books.*
   We can then only regard the photosphere as a cloudy stratum exist
ing in a region of not very high pressure. It is spherical because it
depends upon equal temperatures.
   The second direction in which            I  have attempted to develop the
hypothesis has relation to the circulation in the sun's atmosphere.              I
have taken the facts of the solar atmosphere as a whole, as they are
recorded for us in the various photographs taken during eclipses since

read in the light afforded by these photographs.
    I find that the working hypothesis at once suggests to us that the
sun-spot period is a direct effect of the atmospheric circulation, and
that the latitudes at which the spots commence to form at the mini
mum, which they occupy chiefly at the maximum, and at which they
die out at the end of one period in one hemisphere, probably at the
moment they commence to form a second one in the other (as happened
in 1878 — 9), are a direct result of the local heating produced by the
fall of matter from above descending to the photosphere, and perhaps
piercing it. The results of this piercing are, the liberation of heat
from below, and various explosive effects due to increase of volume,
which, acting along the line of least resistance, give, as a return
current, incandescent vapours ascending at a rate which may be
taken as a maximum at 250 miles a second, a velocity sufficient to
carry them to very considerable heights.

     The view of the solar circulation at which             I  have arrived may be
 briefly stated as follows :    —
     There are upper outflows from the poles towards the equatorial
 regions.     In these outflows a particle constantly travels, so that its
 latitude decreases and its height increases, so that the true solar
 atmosphere resembles the flattened globe in Plateau's experiment
 (see photographs,      1878, and fig. 3).
    These    currents, as they exist in the higher regions of the atmo
sphere,   carry   and gather the condensing and condensed materials till
at last they meet over the equator.
    There is evidence to show that they probably extend as solar
meteoric masses far beyond the limits of the true atmosphere, and
form a ring, the section of which widens towards the sun, and the
base of which lies well within the boundary of the atmosphere (fig. 2) .
    If we assume such a ring under absolutely stable conditions, there
will be no disturbance, no fall of material, therefore there will be no

358                    Mr.  J. N. Lockyer.    On  the           [May   6,
spots, and therefore again there will be no prominences.       Such was
the state of things on the southern surface of the ring  from December,
1877, to April, 1879, during which period there was not a single spot
observed the umbra of which was over 15-millionths of the sun's
visible hemisphere.
    Assume a disturbance.      This may arise from collisions, and these
collisions wonld be most likely to happen among the particles where
the surface of the ring meets the current from the poles.          These
particles will fall towards the sun, thereby disturbing and arresting
the motion of other particles nearer the photosphere, and finally they
will descend with a crash on to the photosphere, from that point where
the surface of the ring enters the atmosphere, some distance further
down.
    The American photographs in 1878 supply us with ample evidence
that this    will be somewhere about latitude 30°, and here alone will
the first spots be formed for two reasons.
    (1.) In the central plane of the ring over the equator, the particles
will be more numerous, a rapid descent, therefore, in this central
plane will be impossible, for the reason that the condensed matter
has to fall perhaps a million of miles through strata of increasing
temperature ; there will, therefore, be no spots ; and practically
speaking, as is known, there are no spots at the equator, though
there are many small spots without umbrae between latitudes 3° and
6° N. and S.
    Above latitude 30°, as a rule, we have no spots, because there is no
ring, and further the atmosphere is of lower elevation, so that there is
not sufficient height of fall to give the velocities required to bring
down the material in the solid form.
    The lower corona where the corona is high, and it is highest over
the equator, acts as a shield or buffer, volatilisation and dissociation
take place at higher levels.       Where this occurs, spots are replaced
by a gentle rain of fine particles slowly descending, instead of the
fall of mighty masses and large quantities of solid and liquid
material.
    Volatilisation will take place gradually during the descent, and at
the utmost only a veiled spot will be produced.
    We know that when the solar forces are weak, such a descent is
 taking place all over the sun, because at that time the spectrum of the
 corona, instead of being chiefly that of hydrogen, is one of a most
 complex    nature,  so complex   that before 1882 it was regarded by
 everybody as a pure      continuous spectrum, such as is given by the
limelight.
    The moment the fall of spot material begins we get the return
 current in the shape of active metallic prominences, and the produc
 tion of cones and horns which probably represent the highest states of

 1886.]           Sun-spot Spectra Observations         at Kensington.              359
 incandescence over large areas and extending to great heights                  ;   and,
 besides these, the production of streamers. See fig. 4.
Fig.   4.   H years from   maximum, 1858. Tracing of drawing by Liais, showing "cones.1
    Two results follow : —
    1. In consequence of the increased temperature           of the lower
 regions, the velocity of the lower currents towards the poles, and
 therefore of the upper currents from the poles, is enormously increased.
 The disturbance of the ring will therefore be increased.
    2. Violent uprushes of the heated photospheric         gases, mounting
 with an initial velocity of a million miles an hour, can also disturb
 the ring directly.
    In this way the sudden rise to maximum in the sun-spot curve, and
 the lowering of the latitude of the spots, follow as a matter of course.
 And the part of the ring nearest the sun, its base, so to speak,                   is,
                                                                                      it
 would appear, thrown out of all shape, and we get falls over broad
 belts of latitude N. and S.
    Does this hypothesis explain then the slow descent to minimum and
 the still decreasing latitude    It does more, demands it. Tor now

 been formed     so highly heated, and its height

 can reach the photosphere.
     The best chance that descending particles have now to form spots,
 is,   they fall from points in lower latitudes. The final period, there
       if

 360                   Mr. J. N. Lockyer.      On  the            [May 6,
 fore, of the sun-spot curve must be restricted to a very large extent
 to latitudes very near the equator, and this is the fact also, as is well
 known.
    It will be seen that on this view, as the brightness and therefore
 the temperature    of the atmosphere as we know increases very con
 siderably from minimum to maximum, the masses which can survive
 this temperature must fall from gradually increasing heights.
    It may be pointed out, how perfectly this hypothesis explains the
 chemical facts observed and associates them with those gathered in
other fields of enquiry.
    At the minimum the ring is nearest the sun, the subjacent atmo
 sphere is low and relatively cool.
    Particles falling from the ring therefore,* although they fall in
smaller quantity because the disturbance is small, have the best
chance of reaching the photosphere in the same condition as they
leave the ring, hence at this time the widening in many familiar lines
of iron, nickel, titanium, &c.
    The gradual disappearance of these lines from the period of
minimum to that of maximum, is simply and sufficiently explained by
the view that the spot-forming materials fall through gradually
increasing depths of an atmosphere which at the same time is having
its temperature as gradually increased by the result of the action       I
have before indicated, until finally when the maximum is reached, if t
we assume dissociation to take place at a higher level at the maximum,
dissociation will take place before the vapours reach the photosphere,
and the lines which we know in our laboratories will cease to be visible.
    This is exactly what takes place, and this result can be connected
as   I have stated elsewhere, with another of a different kind.      This
hypothetical increasing height of fall demanded by the chemistry of
the spots is accompanied by a known acceleration of spot movement
over the sun's disk, as wo lower the latitude — which can only be
explained so far as   I can see by a gradually increasing height of fall
as the equator is approached.
    There are two other points.   (1.) The sunspot curve teaches us that
the slowing down of the solar activities at the maximum is very
gradual.     We should expect therefore the chemical conditions at the
maximum to be maintained for some time afterwards.            As a matter
of fact they have been maintained till March of the present year, and
only now is a change taking place which shows us chemically that we
are leaving the maximum conditions behind.        (2.) The disappearance
of the lines of the metallic elements at maximum is so intimately
connected with an enormous increase in the indications of the
presence of hydrogen, that there is little doubt we are in the presence of

direct consequence of the dissociation of the metallic elements.

1886.]        Sun-spot Spectra Observations at Kensington.               361
   It will   be convenient    to refer here to the facts which have been
recorded     during those    eclipses which have been observed at the
 sun-spot minimum and maximum.
    At the minimum the corona is dim ; observations made during the
 minimum of 1878 showed that it was only        \  as bright as the corona
 at the preceding maximum.          There are no bright lines in its
 spectrum, and both photographic and eye observations proved it to
 consist mainly of a ring round the equator, gradually tapering towards
 its outer edge, which some observations placed at a distance of twelve
 diameters of the sun from the sun's centre.
    The same extension was observed in the previous minimum in 1867,
 and the polar phenomena were observed to be identical in both
 eclipses.   At the poles there is an exquisite tracery curved in opposite
 directions, consisting of plumes or panaches, which bend gently and
 symmetrically from the axis, getting more and more inclined to         it,
                                                                         so
 that those in latitudes 80° to 70° start nearly at right angles to the
 axis, and their upper portions droop gracefully, and curve over into
 lower latitudes.
    Although indications of the existence of this ring have not been
 recorded during eclipses which have happened at the period of
 maximum, there was distinct evidence both in the eclipses in 1871
and 1875 of the existence of what regard as the indications of out
                                      I
ward upper polar currents observed at minimum.
    The fact that the solar poles were closed at the maximum of 1882,
 while they were open in 1871,    is one of the arguments which may be
 nrged that at times the whole spot-zones are surmounted by streamers,
 with their bases lying in all longitudes along the zones.
    It was probably the considerable extension of these streamers
earthwards, in 1882, which hid the finer special details at the poles,
 while in 1871, the part of the sun turned towards the earth was not
rich in streamers of sufficient extension.
    Touching these streamers,    it    an important fact to be borne in
                                      is
mind, that no spots ever form on the poleward side of them.
    Itis   obvious, therefore, that spots are not produced by the
condensation of materials on their upper surfaces, for in that case the
spots would be produced indifferently on either side of them, and the
width of the spot-zones would be inordinately increased.
    Although in the foregoing  I   have laid stress upon the indications
afforded by the observations of 1878 of the existence of       a   ring,     it
should be remarked that, so far, the eclipse appearances on which the
idea rests have not been observed at maximum.            This, however,       is
not a fatal objection, because precautions for shielding the eye were
necessary even in 1878 when the corona was dim            ;   and  if   it    is
composed merely of cooled material         itwould not readily be photo
graphed.

  It  may Be urged hy some that the phenomena observed in 1878
may only after all have been equatorial streamers.
  It is obvious, therefore, that this point deserves the closest attention
during future eclipses, until it is settled one way or the other.

       Langley, M.A., F.R.S., Fellow and Lecturer of Trinity
       College, Cambridge.   Received April 14, 1886.
   The cells of mucous salivary glands I have previously described as
consisting of a framework or network, containing in its spaces hyaline
substancenmd granules.*              I
                                 have also mentioned that during secre
tion the granules disappear from the outer portions of the cells.f A
similar disappearance of granules has been found by BiedermannJ to
occur in the cells of the mucous glands of the tongue of the frog.
   The granules of the mucous salivary glands are rendered very dis
tinct by irrigating a mounted specimen of a fresh gland with mode
rately dilute solutions of neutral or alkaline salts. I have generally
used sodium chloride solution 5 per cent., and sodium carbonate solu
tion 3 per cent.    In these fluids the granules can scarcely be distin
guished from small fat globules ; those of the submaxillary gland of
the dog have a diameter of 1 to 2 /i, those of the orbital gland of the
dog are a little larger.
   In the resting gland the granules are fairly closely packed through
out the cell, in a line stretching from basement membrane to lumen

 there are 8 to 12 granules.        After   a time the outlines    of the granules
 become indistinct    ; this takes place much sooner in alkaline than in
 neutral salt solution.
     The reactions of the granules are best observed by irrigating pieces
 of gland which have been teased out in neutral salt solution.                    On
 irrigating with dilute alkalis, dilute mineral acids, or with water, the
 granules disappear as if they were bubbles bursting.                It is difficult,
 however, to be certain that they are completely dissolved ; after treat
 ment with dilute mineral acids, and still more frequently after treat
 ment with water, pale, very slightly refractive masses are seen, appa
 rently consisting of swollen and altered granules.                  On irrigating
 with osmic acid the granules swell up considerably, and become less
 refractive.    On irrigating with alcohol or with acetic acid they
 remain, but are somewhat shrunken.
     The hyaline substance of the cells swells up and in part dissolves in
 3 per cent, sodium carbonate.          The solution forms a viscid fluid ; on
 irrigating with acetic acid or with alcohol a membranous precipitate
 of mucin takes place. Since the granules are not, for a time at any
 rate, dissolved by sodium carbonate, it follows that the hyaline sub
stance gives rise to mucin.         The granules also give rise to mucin ; in
most of their reactions they resemble mucin ; on solution they form
a viscid fluid ; further, when a gland is hardened in alcohol, and a
section mounted in Canada balsam or in glycerine, the granules in the
hyaline substance are usually indistinguishable, both together form
the clear mucigen portion of the cells.
    During secretion both the hyaline substance and the granules are
turned out of the cells ; after prolonged secretion the cells consist of
an outer zone, chiefly of freshly formed substance, and of an inner
zone of network, hyaline substance, and granules, as in the resting
state.    When the saliva has a high percentage of solids, both the hya
line substance and the granules can be seen in it ; such saliva is
obtained from the submaxillary gland of the dog by stimulating the
sympathetic, and often by strong stimulation of the chorda tympani.
The hyaline substance is more soluble than are the granules, and is
thus less commonly seen ; it is partly dissolved, partly swollen up into
a continuous mass ; the less swollen parts appear as strings or blebs.
The granules in saliva vary greatly in appearance ; they may be very
slightly swollen, and have fairly sharp outlines ; or they may be more
swollen and run together, forming pale masses of various size ; occa
sionally in more dilute saliva they are just visible as pale spheres ;
these are probably the spheres mentioned by Heidenhain,* as seen
by him in the submaxillary saliva of the dog after combined stimula
tion of the chorda tympani and sympathetic nerves.

   Hence then, when a small amount of fluid only is secreted, the hya
line substance and the granules are turned out of the cells without
being completely dissolved, when a certain amount more of fluid is
secreted the hyaline substance is completely dissolved, and with still
more fluid, the granules also are completely dissolved.                     Some small
fat globules are usually turned out of the cells during secretion.
   According to Heidenhain,* nerve stimulation causes some consti
tuents of the cell to be converted into a more soluble form, this is
usually expressed by saying that mucigen is converted into mucin.
Apart from the reasons given by Heidenhain, this is probable, since
both hyaline substance and granules appear to be more soluble in
osmic acid and in chromic acid when they are in saliva than when
they are in the gland cells ; but the proof does not seem to me to be
conclusive.
   Kleint has described the mucous cells as being open towards the
lumen, in this     I  am inclined to agree with him ; it is not easy to see
in all cells, but in many it is perfectly distinct.
   Although     I  think that the mucous cells are able to turn out bodily
their products, I am unable to agree with the view of Heidenhainf
and of Lavdowsky,§ that the cells disintegrate during secretion.                      As
the decrease in the interfibrillar substance takes place, there is a
fresh formation of substance in the outer part of the cells, i.e., as the
cell secretes it also grows : the changes which take place are closely
comparable to the changes which take place in the pancreas and in
other glands, in which there is no question of the disintegration of
cells.   Moreover, in saliva          I  can find no evidence of broken down
 cells ; when the cells of a fresh gland are treated with osmic acid the
cell membrane becomes very distinct, when sympathetic saliva is
treated with osmic acid no signs of cell membrane are found; nor
are nuclei present except those in
                                                 " salivary corpuscles," which, as
stated by Pfluger,|| are leucocytes.
    Further, there is not,          I   think, any satisfactory proof that the
 demilune cells multiply during secretion, and give rise to mucous
 cells.  I have examined glands at various times after stimulation of
 the chorda and of the sympathetic, and have not, except extremely
 rarely, found nuclei undergoing indirect division. As                     I  have pre
 viously said,^[    I  hold the   demilunes     to  be secreting  cells   of  a different
 nature from that of the mucous cells, for in different glands all

1886.]             Structure     of Mucous Salivary Glands.                    365
glands wholly mucous.             Glands with demilunes are simply glands in
which the " albuminous " element is reduced to a minimum. The
apparent increase in size of the demilunes, described by Lavdowsky*
as taking place in the first stage of secretory activity,              I take to be
due to the decrease in the size of the alveoli, so that the ordinarily
flat demilunes become more spherical.             Moreover, the demilune cells
show signs of secretory activity ; in the submaxillary gland of the
dog after prolonged secretion the demilune cells, in section of the
gland hardened in alcohol, are smaller, they stain more readily with
carmine, and their nuclei and nucleoli are more conspicuous.                   The
"young"      cells   described     by  Heidenhain   and    by Lavdowsky are,      I
think, chiefly altered mncous cells.
   The network of the cell consists of two parts, one in the cell-mem
brane, the other stretching from this throughout the cell. The
peripheral network is best seen in the isolated cells of the orbital
gland of the dog after treatment with chloral hydrate, 2 per cent., for
a week to a fortnight.          It consists of very delicate fibres ; at some of
the nodal points there are small spherical swellings.               From lumen to
basement     membrane        there are twelve to fifteen meshes. In many
cases this network        is    perfectly distinct, every fibre in it can be
followed without the slightest difficulty. In such specimens, on the
other hand, it is often difficult or impossible to make out any cell-
membrane.      That a membrane exists I conclude chiefly from observing
cells isolated   in sodium chloride, 5 per cent., and then treated with
osmic acid.       In such specimens the outline of the cells although
beaded appears to be continuous.            The beading of cell-membrane has
been noticed by Schiefferdecker ;f it is obvious with most methods
of treatment, it is caused by the fibres of the network, seen in optical
section.
   The internal network is connected with the peripheral network,
but it appears to me to have much larger meshes. From basement
membrane to lumen there are in the submaxillary gland of the dog
four to six meshes, in the orbital gland of the dog five to seven
meshes, i.e., the number of meshes in a given direction in the cell is
about half that of the number of granules.             This network is seen on
treating with dilute mineral acids fresh cells which have been teased
out in sodium chloride, 5 per cent. ; it is seen more or less distinctly
in cells treated with the ordinary dissociating agents, and is seen after
 hardening in various reagents.            The reagent which I have found to
 give most constantly satisfactory results, is a mixture containing
 0-3 per cent. of chromic acid and O'l per cent. of osmic acid.

very closely resembles that described by Klein,* as shown by mucous
cells after treatment with spirit or with a mixture of chromic acid
and spirit.     I  cannot, however, find a network with such close meshes
beneath the limiting membrane.            The passage from the close-meshed
limiting network to the wide-meshed internal network can often be
traced with a good lens, such as Powell and Lealand's -fa oil-immer
sion, with angular aperture 1'45.
    With certain modes of treatment the cell network is not seen, thus
when a piece of gland is hardened in osmic acid and subsequently
with alcohol, the cell usually appears to consist of faint granules
imbedded in the cell-substance.          In such cases the hyaline substance
and the network are indistinguishable, and the two together may
stain and leave the granules unstained.             At any one focus the stained
•substance      will then appear as a close network, and the unstained
granules    as   the meshes of the network.           On careful focussing, how
ever, it can be seen that the stained substance is simply the mass of
the cell in which the granules are imbedded.                 This is,    I  think, the
explanation of the close network described by Schiefferdeckerf and
 by PaulsenJ in certain mucous cells.                 And that the " network "
adescribed by Schiefferdecker       is in part the hyaline interfibrillar sub
 stance of the cell is indicated by his account of it ; according to him
 it consists of mucigen.
    The sublingual gland differs in various respects from other mucous
glands ; a considerable portion of it consists of
                                                              " albuminous " cells.
 According to Klein§ no demilunes are present and the gland tubes
 have only one layer of cells.        This is certainly true of the larger part
aof the gland;       the appearance of two layers of cells in a tube is
 occasionally caused by the section passing obliquely through a spot
 where a side tube is given off or where the lumen suddenly alters its
calibre.     But whilst none of the tubes have a complete double layer of
-cells, it is   I  think an open question whether demilunes are absent
 from the gland.        The sublingual gland has been taken as an especially
 favourable one in which to observe the disintegration of the mucous
 cells.   I do not find that there is any more evidence of disintegration
 here than there is in ordinary mucous glands.                   The mucous cells
 undergo    the   same  changes  as  do these   in  the  submaxillary of the dog,
 they discharge hyaline substance and granules, and they form fresh
 cell-substance.      Secretion does not cause any division of nuclei.             The
 " albuminous " cells probably secrete on nerve-stimulation as do the
 mucous cells ; in speaking of these cells as

   The object of this paper is to propose a method of computing the
harmonic components of formulae to represent the daily and yearly
variations of atmospheric temperature and pressure, or other recur
ring phenomena, which is less laborious than the ordinary method,
though practically not involving sensibly larger probable errors.
   According to the usual method the most probable values of the
harmonic coefficients are found by solving the equations of condition
supplied from the hourly or other periodical observations, by the
method of least squares.     The number of these equations is, however,
much larger than the number of unknown quantities, when these are
limited, as is usual, to the coefficients of the first four orders, and the
numerical values of the coefficients of those quantities which depend
on a series of sines of multiple arcs, afford peculiar facilities for the
eliminating process, so that values of the harmonic coefficients may be
obtained by applying certain multipliers to combinations of the original
observations    obtained by a series of additions and subtractions, the
results giving probable errors virtually the same as those got by the
method of least squares.      These multipliers for the two first orders of
coefficients are so nearly equal to       and for the third order so nearly
0'07, that the values may readily be found without tables, though
such tables have been calculated to facilitate computations.
   Approximate methods of determining the coefficients and of the
components for each interval of the series, are also given, from which
last a graphical representation of the components may easily be ob
tained.
   The system of computation is applicable to all cases in which the
angular intervals between the observations are such as to make the
circle a whole series, exactly divisible by 6 and 8, and it has been
extended, by aid of an interpolation, to the case of the 73 five-day
means of a yearly period, in which the calculation by the ordinary

                                 (Abstract.)
    After  a  brief historical notice   of the observations     of  Savart,
Masson, Sondhauss, Kundt, Laconte, Barret and Tyndall, Decharme,
and Neyreneuf, on the sympathetic vibrations of jets and flames, the
author describes his own experiments.        Attention was directed to the
subject by the accidental observation that a pulsating air-jet directed
against a flame caused the latter to emit a musical sound.        The pitch
of this sound depended solely on the rapidity of the jet pulsations,
but its intensity was found to increase in a remarkable way with the
distance of the flame from the orifice.       In order to study the pheno
menon, air was allowed to escape against the flame from a small orifice
in the [diaphragm of an ordinary telephone, the chamber behind the
diaphragm     being placed in communication        with a reservoir of air
under gentle pressure. Vibratory motions being then excited in the
diaphragm, by means of a battery and a microphone or rheotome in a-
distant apartment, the discovery was made that speech as well as
musical and other sounds could be quite loudly reproduced from the
flame.    Certain observations led the author to suspect that motion of
the orifice rather than compression of the air in the chamber was the
chief agent in the phenomenon ; and, in fact, precisely similar result*
were obtained when a light glass jet-tube was cemented to a soft iron
armature, mounted on a spring in front of the telephone magnet.
    Experiment also showed that an air-jet at suitable pressure directed
against a flame repeats all sounds or words uttered in the neigh
bourhood.     Except, however, where the impressed vibrations do not
differ widely in pitch from the normal vibrations of the jet (dis
covered by Sondhauss and Masson), these effects are likely to escape
notice, owing to the inability of the ear to distinguish between the
disturbing sounds and their echo-like reproduction from the flame.

    In these experiments the primary action               of the impressed vibra
 tions was undoubtedly exerted on the air-jet           ; but a' singular and per
  plexing   fact  was  that   no  sound,  or at best  very faint sounds, could be
  heard from the latter when the flame was removed, and the ear or the
  end of a wide tube connected with the ear, was substituted for it.

  sound from the flame, must be relative changes of different parts of                 it,
  the author was led to try a very small hearing orifice, about as large
  as the jet orifice.      The results were most striking. By introducing
  this little hearing orifice into the path of a vibrating air-jet, the
  vibrations can be heard over very wide area. Close to the jet orifice

 along    the  axis   of  the   jet,  and reach   their  maximum     at a certain
 distance.     Experiments with smoked air showed that this point of
 maximum sound         is  that at which the jet loses its rod-like character,
 and expands rapidly         ;   it  has been named the " breaking point,"
  because just beyond       itthe sounds heard from the jet acquire         broken

 conclusions from his experiments and those of others are as
follows —:
    A jet of air at moderate pressure (below 10 mm. of water) from
an orifice    1to 1£   mm. in diameter, forms a continuous column for a
certain distance, beyond which            expands and becomes confused.
                                           it
    Any impulse, such as tap on the jet support, or a short and sharp
                                 a
sound, causes     a  minute disturbance to start from the orifice.            This
disturbance increases in area as             progresses, and finally causes the
                                            it
jet to break. By directing the jet against a flame or a hearing orifice
it is readily perceived that such disturbances travel along the jet
path with     a velocity which         not that of sound in air. In fact, the
                                      is
sound heard in the ear-piece resembles an echo of the disturbing
sound.
   The disturbances produced by sounds of different pitch travel
along the jet path with the same velocity. This      evident   since
                                                                is            ;

at a distance from the orifice would be impossible.         This velocity is
much less than tnat of sound in air, and is probably the mean velocity
of the stream.
   A vibrating air-jet playing into free air gives rise to very feeble
sounds, but these sounds are much intensified when the jet impinges
on any obstacle which serves to divide it into two parts.           Of such
arrangements    the best is a perforated  surface, the orifice being placed
in the axis of the jet.
   A jet of air at low pressure responds to and reproduces only
sounds of low pitch. Sounds above a certain pitch, which depends
on the pressure, either do not affect it or are only faintly reproduced.
   At pressures between 10 and 12 mm. of water an air-jet reproduces
all the tones of the speaking voice, and those usually employed in
music, with the exception of very shrill or hissing noises.          When
the pressure in the reservoir equals about 13 mm. of water, hissing
sounds are well reproduced, while sounds of low pitch become fainter.
At higher pressures, up to about 25 mm. of water, shrill or hissing
noises produce very violent disturbance, while ordinary speech tones
have little effect.   But at these pressures sounds of high pitch
frequently cause the jet to emit lower sounds of which they are
harmonics.
   In   general a pressure of about 12 mm. of water will be found
most suitable for reproducing speech or music.       Under this condition
the jet is very sensitive to disturbances of all kinds, and will repro
duce speech, music, and the irregular sounds classified as " noises."
   It must be understood that the pressures here given are only suit
able for jets of not too small diameter.        When the diameter of the
orifice is only a small fraction of a millimetre the above limits may be
much exceeded ; since the velocity of efflux no longer depends solely
on the pressure.
   A   jet of air escaping from a perfectly circular orifice does not
vibrate spontaneously so as to emit a musical sound. But musical
vibrations may be excited in it by the passage of the air on its way
to the orifice through a resonant cavity, or through any irregular
constriction.
   An air-jet impinging on any obstacle, such as a flame, frequently
vibrates spontaneously, if the obstacle is at sufficient distance and of
such a nature as to diffuse the disturbances produced by impact or
throw them back on the orifice.        This constitutes one of the chief
objections to the use of a flame as a means of rendering audible the
vibrations of a jet. The disturbances excited in the surrounding air
by the impact of the stream upon it are so intense as easily to react
on the orifice.   When, therefore, the jet is thrown into any state of
vibration it tends to continue in the same state, even after the excit
ing sound has ceased.

1886.]              On  the Sympathetic  Vibrations  of Jets.          371
   A  jet of air usually responds most energetically to some particular
tone   or set of related tones (Sondhauss). Such a particular tone
may be called the jet fundamental.             The practical inconvenience
arising from this may be diminished by raising the air-pressure until
the jet fundamental is higher than any of the tones to be repro
duced.
   When a flame and an air-jet meet at right angles vibrations im
pressed upon the flame orifice also yield sound.         The conditions of
pressure, &c., are somewhat       different ; but the changes produced at
the orifice grow in the same way as those in an air-jet. The best results
are obtained when a gentle current of air is directed from a wide
tube just below the apex of the blue zone.
   It is difficult at first sight to account for the fact that a vibrating
jet gives rise to sound only when it strikes upon some object which
divides it into two parts.       The following experiments, however, in
some sense explain this. The relative normal velocity at different
points in the stream may be measured by introducing into its path
the open end of a capillary tube which is connected with a water
manometer.        This velocity diminishes continuously along the axis
from the    orifice  to the breaking point ; and also diminishes continu
ously from any point of the axis outwards towards the circumference.
Now a sudden disturbance communicated to the air at the orifice will
be found to produce a fall in velocity along the axis of the jet, but a
rise in velocity along its extreme outer portions. It thus appears that
the changes along the axis and along the circumference, produced by
a disturbance, are of opposite character.         When the jet plays into
free air these opposing changes neutralise each other in the main ; but
tbis interference is prevented when the jet strikes upon any object
which serves to divide it.
   When a vibrating air-jet plays against a small flame, the best
sounds are heard when the stream strikes the flame just below the
apex of the blue zone. At the plane of contact an intensely blue
flame ring appears, and this ring vibrates visibly when the jet is
disturbed. The production of sound from it doubtless depends on
changes in the rate of combustion of the gas. This may be proved
by inserting into the ring a fine slip of platinum, connected in circuit
with a battery and a telephone. When the jet is thrown into vibra
tion the consequent variations in the temperature of the platinum
affect its conductivity, and hence a feeble reproduction- of the jet
vibration may be heard in the telephone.
   To Savart we are mainly indebted for our knowledge of the
sympathetic vibrations of liquid jets. This physicist showed that a
liquid jet always tends to separate into drops at a distance from the
orifice in a regular manner; and that this tendency is so well marked,
that when the jet strikes upon any object, such as a stretched mem

 brane, so arranged that the disturbances caused by impact may be
 conducted back to the orifice, a definite musical sound is produced.
 The pitch of the sound, or the number of drops separated in a given
 time, varies directly as the square root of the height of liquid in the
 reservoir, and inversely as the diameter of the orifice.    Savart further
showed that external vibrations impressed upon the orifice may act
 like the impact disturbances, and cause the jet to divide into drops.
Impact on a stretched membrane may then cause the reproduction as
sound of the impressed vibrations.        The tones capable of producing
this effect were considered to lie within the limits of an octave below
and a fifth above the jet normal.
    The author has found, however, that jets of every mobile liquid are
capable of responding to and reproducing all sounds whose pitch is
below that of the jet normal, as well as some above ; and that the
timbre or quality of the impressed vibrations is also preserved, pro
vided that the jet is at such pressure as to be capable of responding
to all the overtones which confer this quality.        Other essential con
ditions for perfect reproduction are, that the receiving membrane
should be placed at such distance from the orifice that the jet never
breaks into drops above its surface ; and that it should be insulated
as carefully as possible from the orifice.
    In order to assist the action of aerial sound-waves on the fluid, it is
advisable to attach the jet-tube rigidly to a pine sound-board about
fths of an inch thick. The surfaces of the board should be free,
otherwise it may be supported in any way.        The receiving membrane
iB formed by a piece of thin sheet rubber, tied over the end of a brass
tube about jj ths of an inch in internal diameter.         A wide flexible
hearing    tube  furnished  with  an  ear-piece is  attached  to the brass
tube.     The jet-tube is connected with an elevated reservoir by an
india-rubber pipe.
    With an apparatus of this kind, and a tolerably wide jet-tube
 having an orifice about 0-7 mm. in diameter, a pressure of about
 15 decimetres of water is required to bring the jet into condition to
respond to all the tones and overtones of the speaking voice (except
hissing sounds) and those employed in music. At a somewhat higher
pressure it will reproduce hissing sounds.       It is not easy for an nn-
trained ear to distinguish between the disturbing sounds and their
reproduction by the jet, when both are within range of hearing.
Vibrations may however be conveyed to a jet from a distance in a
fairly satisfactory way, by attaching one end of a thin cord to the jet-
support, and the other to the centre of a parchment drum. The cord
being stretched, an assistant may speak, sing, or whistle, to the dis
tant drum.      Other devices for conveying vibrations from a distance
are described.
    Now when the jet is disturbed in any way, and the receiving mem

 1886.]          On the Sympathetic     Vibrations   of Jets.           373
brane is introduced into its path close to the orifice, scarcely any
sound can be heard in the ear-piece. But <if the membrane be moved
away from the orifice along the path of the jet the sounds become
gradually louder, until at a certain distance (which varies both with
the character of the orifice and the intensity of the impressed vibra
tions) a position of maximum purity and loudness is reached. At
greater distances the reproduction by the jet becomes at first rattling
and harsh, and finally unintelligible. In the latter case the jet will
be seen to break above the membrane.
  From this experiment we may draw             the conclusions previously
arrived at for air-jets ; viz., that all changes produced by sound at the
orifice grow in accordance with the same law ; and that all changes
travel with the same velocity, which is probably the mean velocity of
the stream.
   The mode in which the jet acts upon the membrane becomes
apparent when instantaneous shadow photographs of vibrating jets
are examined.        When the jet is steady, and the orifice strictly
circular and well insulated, the outline in the upper part of the stream
is that of a slightly conical rod, the base of the cone being at the
orifice. When, however, vibrations are impressed upon the support,
swellings and constrictions appear on the surface of the rod, which
become more pronounced as the fluid travels downwards.               At the
breaking point     the  constrictions  give way,   those  due to   the  more
energetic sound impulses being the first to break.           When the im
pressed vibrations are complex, the outline of the jet may be very
complicated.     When the membrane is interposed, we have then a
constantly changing mass of liquid hurled against          it, and vibratory
movements are therefore excited         init, proportional to the varying
cross section of the jet at its surface.
   It would appear at first sight that the mode of growth of the
vibratory changes in a liquid jet must be different from that which
characterises the vibrations of an air-jet. It   is   possible, however, by
special arrangements, to receive the impact of only a small section of
a vibrating liquid jet, and thus to get a reproduction of its vibrations
as sound.    We are thus led to conclude that the sound effects of a
vibrating liquid jet may not be simply due to its varying cross section,
since actual changes occur in the translation- or rotation-velocity of
its particles.    Experiment shows that these changes are greatest
along  the axis of  the jet.
   One of the most interesting and beautiful methods of studying the
vibrations of a jet consists in placing some portion of   it in circuit with
a battery and telephone, whereby its vibrations become audible in the
telephone.   A  number of forms of apparatus for this purpose have
been constructed, but one will serve as   a   type.   Savart in the course
of his experiments showed that the vibrations of the jet are preserved

 in the " nappe " or thin sheet of fluid formed when the jet strike*
 normally on a small surface.       So far then as vibratory changes are
 concerned, the nappe has all the properties of the main stream.
 Although the diameter of this excessively thin film is abont the same
 whatever be the distance of the surface from the orifice, the intensity
 of the vibratory changes propagated to it varies with this distance,
 as for the jet itself.    It is simply necessary then to insert into the
nappe two platinum electrodes in circuit with a telephone and a
battery having an electromotive force of from 12 to 30 volts, to get an
accurate and faithful reproduction of the jet vibrations.       Loud sound*
 can thus be obtained from a jet which is finer than the finest needle,
and the arrangement constitutes a highly sensitive " transmitter."
     A jet transmitter, in its simplest form, consists essentially of a glas*
jet-tube which is rigidly attached to a sound-board, and supplied from,
 an elevated reservoir containing some conducting liquid (distilled
 water acidified with -j^oth of its volume of pure sulphuric acid is the
 best) ; and a couple of platinum electrodes, embedded in an insulator,
 such as ebonite, against which the jet strikes.     The jet may issue from
 a circular orifice, about ^th of a millimetre in diameter, in the blunt
 and thin-sided end of a small glass tube. Much smaller jets may be
 used : but for one of the given size the pressure required for distinct
 transmission of all kinds of sounds will not exceed 30 inches.          The
 receiving surface is the rounded end of an ebonite rod, through the
 centre of which passes a platinum wire.        The upper end of the rod
 should be about 1 millimetre in diameter, and should be surrounded
  by a little tube of platinum ; and the end of the central wire and the
 upper margin of the tube should form a continuous slightly convex
  surface with the ebonite, fi'ee from irregularities.      The inner and
  outer platinum electrodes are joined respectively to the terminals of
  the circuit. The jet is allowed to strike on the end of the central wire,
  and thence radiating in the form of a nappe, comes into contact with
  the tube, thus completing the circuit.          The dimensions of the
  apparatus may be varied to suit jets of different sizes ; it is highly
  desirable, however, that the jet nappe should well overlap the inner
  margin of the ring-shaped electrode.
     With small jets the impact disturbances       are so feeble that slight
  precautions are necessary to insulate     the receiving surface from the
  orifice, unless the former is placed       low down in the path.        The
  strength    of battery may be increased until the escape of electrolytic
  gas-bubbles causes a faint hissing noise in the telephone.       The liquid
  on its way to the jet should pass downwards through a wide tube
  lightly packed with coarse clean cotton, by which minute air-bubbles
  which violently disturb the jet, and small particles of dust which
  might obstruct the orifice, are stopped. This tube should never be
  allowed to empty itself.

1886.]            On the Sympathetic  Vibrations of Jets.             375
    Experiments are given to show that in this instrument the jet may
act upon the electric current in two ways : firstly, by interposing a
constantly changing liquid resistance between the electrodes ; and,
                                                  " polarisation " of the
eecondly, by causing changes in the so-called
electrodes.   In one form of instrument, namely, that in which both
jet  and  electrodes are entirely immersed in a mass of liquid of the
same kind as the jet liquid, the action must be entirely at the surface
of the electrodes.
   In  the latter case a liquid jet becomes similar in structure and
properties to a jet of air in air, and the velocity at different points
when it is steady and when it is disturbed varies in precisely the
manner already described.
   The author briefly passes in review the leading facts to be accounted
for, and lays stress upon the parallelism of the properties of gaseous
and liquid jets.    Some shadow photographs of vibrating smoke jets
have shown that these also present drop-like swellings and contrac
tions which grow along the jet-path. The most satisfactory explana
tion of the phenomena will then be one which refers the vibratory
changes in jets of both kinds to the same origin.
    The beautiful and well-known experiments of Plateau have supplied
a satisfactory explanation of the normal vibrations of a liquid jet in
air. He has shown that a stationary liquid cylinder, whose length
exceeds a certain multiple of its diameter, must break up under tho
influence of the " forces of figure " into shorter cylinders of definite
length, which when liberated tend to contract into drops. Now, the
jet being regarded as snch a stationary cylinder, we have a satisfactory
explanation of the musical tone resulting when its discontinuous part
strikes upon a stretched membrane, and when the impact disturbances
 may be in any way conducted back to the orifice.    These disturbances
then accelerate the division of the jet after it leaves the orifice.
 Plateau endeavoured to show that division of the jet might take place
at other than the normal points, thus explaining Savart's experimental
conclusion that a jet can vibrate in sympathy with a limited range of
tones. Lord Rayleigh, moreover, has recently shown that the inferior
limit of this range is not so sharply defined theoretically as Savart's
experiments would prove it to be.
   Both Savart and Magnus, however, describe experiments in which
a water-jet, carefully protected from impact and other disturbances,
does not exhibit the peculiar appearances characteristic of rhythmical
division ; and the author's experiments conclusively prove that this
rhythmical division does not take place in a well insulated jet. While
the tendency so to divide may therefore be admitted, and the normal
rate of vibration of the jet and its greater sensitiveness to particular
tones may thereby be explained, Plateau's theory cannot be held to
account for the uniform growth along the jet-path of all changes,

however      complex   their form.    For this growth takes place inde
 pendently of the
                      " forces of figure," and nnder conditions in which
 they are entirely absent, as when a gaseous or liquid jet plays within
a mass of fluid of its own kind.
     The author is inclined rather to refer the properties of jets of all
 kinds to conditions of motion on which hitherto little stress has been
 laid, viz., the unequal velocities at different points in the stream after
 it has left the orifice. From the axis towards the circumference of a
jet near the orifice the velocity diminishes continuously, and the
 motions of the stream may be regarded as resultants of the motions
of an infinite series of parallel and coaxial vortex-rings. In many
respects, in fact, the appearance of a jet resembles the appearance of
a vortex-ring projected from the same orifice. Thus a jet from a
circular orifice, like a vortex-ring from a round aperture, remains
always circular. In a frictionless fluid a vortex-ring, uninfluenced by
other vortices, would remain of constant diameter ; a condition to
which a horizontal liquid jet approximates.           When, however, the
ring moves through a viscous fluid it experiences retardation and
expansion, which are precisely the changes which a jet playing in a
fluid of its own kind undergoes.        The vibrating smoke-ring projected
from an elliptical aperture changes its form in exactly the same
manner as a jet, at sufficiently low pressure, from an elliptical orifice.
-These analogies might be considerably extended.
     In a liquid jet in air, or in a vacuum, internal friction must
 gradually equalise the velocities.       At a distance from the orifice,
therefore, depending on the viscosity of the liquid, such a jet must
approach the condition of a cylinder at rest, and must tend to
 divide in accordance with Plateau's law. The rapidity with which
 drops are formed depends mainly on the superficial tension of the
 liquid. The length of the continuous column should therefore bear
.some inverse ratio to the viscosity and superficial         tension of the
 liquid ; a view which is in harmony with the results of Savart's
 experiments, and some of the author's, in this direction.
     Where the jet plays into a flnid of its own kind the retardation and
 expansion which it experiences are mainly due to its parting with its
 energy to the surrounding medium.          When, as a result of vibration,
 growing swellings and contractions are formed in it, this loss must be
 more rapid, and the jet therefore shows a diminution of mean velocity
 along the axis, which increases with the distance from the orifice.
      Such being the conditions, it is evident that any impulse com
 municated to the fluid, either behind or external to the orifice, or to
 the orifice itself, must alter the vorticity of the stream.    That vortex-
  rings are generated by impulses of the first kind is well known ; the
 action when the orifice is moved is intelligible, if we consider that a
 forward motion of it will produce acceleration, a backward motion

 retardation, of the outer layers of the jet. As the result of a rapid
 to-and-fro motion we may then imagine two vortex-rings to be
 developed — the foremost layer of greater energy and moving more
 slowly than the hindmost.       These two rings in their onward course
 will then act on each other in a known manner; the first will grow in
 size and energy at the expense of the second, at the same time
 diminishing in velocity ; the second will contract while its velocity
 increases.    The inequalities in cross-section, initiated at the orifice,
 thus tend to grow along the jet-path, and will be attended also by
 growing inequalities of the normal and rotational velocities of the
 particles.    Since the stream lines of a vortex-ring are crowded
 together at its centre, the disturbances produced by impact of the jet-
 rings will be greatest along the axis, and least along the circum
 ference.
    Indeed the sound disturbances produced by impact of a common
 vortex-ring are quite analogous to those of a vibrating jet. Let an
 air-ring be projected into a trumpet-shaped tube connected with the
 ear, and little more than a rushing noise will result.     But let it be
 projected against a small orifice in the hearing-tube,      and a sharp
 click will be heard at the moment of impact. This click is loud
 when the centre of the ring strikes the tube, but faint, although still
 aof the same character, when produced from the circumference.
    The foregoing considerations may be extended to cases in which
 the motions of the orifice are complex vibrations. Expansions and
 contractions are then initiated in the fluid proportional at every point
 to the velocity of the orifice.   The inequalities must tend to further
 •diverge in the manner described.
     Similar considerations apply to cases in which the motions of the
 aorifice are the result of lateral impulses.    In these cases the rings
 formed in the jet will not be perpendicular to its direction, and in
 their onward course may possibly vibrate about a mean position.
    The author further points out how the viscosity and surface-tension
 of the fluid may influence its sensitiveness.        When the surface-
 tension is very high, as in mercury, it prodnces a tendency in the jet
 to break easily under the influence of moderate impulses.
    The foregoing is little more than the outlines of a new theory of
jet-vibrations.    The author hopes to supply in the future further
experimental evidence in support of it.

IV. " Intensity of Radiation through Turbid Media."                    By
      Captain   Abney,   R.E.,  F.R.S.,    and     Major-General Festing,
      R.E. Received May 3, 1886.
   In the Bakerian Lecture for this year, which was delivered before
the Royal Society on March 4th, on Colour Photometry, we gave
 incidentally the results of some measurements we had made of the
intensity of visible radiation which penetrated through a transparent
medium as compared with that which penetrated through the same
medium rendered turbid.       We showed that the formula deduced by
Lord Rayleigh from the scattering of light by small particles* was
confirmed by our experiments.     We thought, however, that the theory
might be more fully tested if a larger range of spectrum than that
to which we had confined ourselves were used, and at the same time
it would be more satisfactory if an instrument possessing no personal
equation could be utilised.      Our thoughts naturally turned to the
thermopile, and more particularly to that form which we described in
a previous communication      to the Royal Society (" Proc. Roy. Soc,"
vol. 37, p. 157, 1884), since its delicacy was extremely great.         In
the Bakerian Lecture the results we gave were obtained from water
rendered turbid, and it appeared to us that the same medium would
again answer our purpose — more especially if certain precautions
were taken.     It will be in the recollection of the Society that we
have shown that water possesses very definite absorption-bands          in
the infra-red of the spectrum (" Proc. Roy. Soc," vol. 35, p. 328,
1883), as also does alcohol.     Now, as the turbidity of the water we
desired to produce was made by adding a dilute solution of mastic
dissolved in alcohol to the water, it was evident that in addition
to the water-spectrum      we should also have superposed a faint
alcohol spectrum, if the addition of the latter was made in any
quantity.    Had the spectrum of a definite thickness of pure and
transparent water been compared with one of the same thickness
of water rendered turbid by the mastic, it is evident that a dis
crepancy might have arisen owing to alcohol being present in the
 one case and not in the other.      To avoid this difficulty, when great
 turbidity was  to be  produced,  the  amount of alcohol added with the
 mastic was measured, and the same quantity of pure alcohol added
 to the transparent water.     By this plan the mixture of alcohol and
 water was the same in the two cases, the only difference in the two
 being that one had extremely fine particles of mastic suspended in it.
 A reference to our paper (" Proc. Roy. Soc," vol. 35, p. 328, 1883) will
 show that a small thickness of water cuts off nearly all the spectrum

"below    XL4,000, and that     If inches     cnts off nearly everything below

up to \14,000 in that case the deflections of the galvanometer would be
sufficiently large in both cases to allow the proportion of rays trans
 mitted through the transparent and turbid media to be calculated
without fear of any grave error due to inaccuracy of reading.
    The spectroscope we have described was used for this purpose, and
 the source of light used was the crater of the positive pole of the
 electric light. The opening of the slit was about T^ inch, and that
-of the linear pile about -fc inch. In the first experiment we described
the colour of the crater of the positive pole as seen after passing
through the turbid medium was a lemon-yellow, and in the second a
 deep orange, nearly approaching red.                 It will be seen that theory
and experiment agree within the limits that might be expected.

    It may be well to remark that in order to get a proper fineness of
 particle in suspension in the water, a very convenient plan is to add
 the varnish very gently and by very small quantities in a glass jar in
 which the water is automatically or otherwise stirred.                 The water
 should be of large volume to get the best results. To make the
 fineness still more uniform we have prepared the turbid medium as
 above, and then rotated the glass flask in which it was placed at the
 rate of about 2500 revolutions per minute.                 By this means any
 particles, except the very finest, are deposited on the sides of the flask,
 and the filtered liquid — if we may so call it— can be poured off ready
 for any experiments.

    In the  full paper the author first describes the method he employed
for measuring the
                        " resistance," and then gives the numerical results
of the measurements in the form of a series of tables.
    He took a number of groups of chemically related acids and salts
of considerable degrees of purity, all of them in the proportions of
their equivalent weights, and dissolved in equal and sufficient quanti
ties of water to form quite dilute solutions..          The number of solutions
was    about   seventy,   and   included   those    of  hydriodic, hydrobromic,
hydrochloric, hydrofluoric, nitric, and sulphuric acids ; the iodides,
bromides,     chlorides,    fluorides,  hydrates,     carbonates,   nitrates, and
sulphates    of ammonium, caesium, rubidium, potassium, sodium, and
lithium ; the chlorides, hydrates, and nitrates of barium, strontium,
and calcium ; and a series of stronger solutions,                  of equivalent
strength to each other, of the chlorides of hydrogen, ammonium,

rubidium, potassium, sodium, lithium, barium, strontium, and calcium.
A series of similar liquids to those of one of the groups of acids, of
equal (not of equivalent) strength to each other, was also included.
   As electrodes he employed pairs of plates of zinc, cadmium, leadr
tin, iron, nickel, copper, silver, gold, palladium, and platinum ; and
separate ones formed of small bars of iridium.
   He took each group of solutions, and measured in each liquid
                                                  " total resistance " at the

two electrodes, and the separate " resistances

cathode respectively with each metal, and thus obtained about seventy
different tables, each containing about thirty-six measurements,
including the amounts of " total," " anode," and " cathode resistance
                                                                              "
of each metal, and the averages of these for all the metals.
   By comparing the numbers thus obtained, and by general logical
analysis of the whole of the results, he has arrived at various conclu
sions, of which the following are the most important : — The pheno
menon of " transfer-resistance " appears to be a new physical relation
of the atomic weights, attended by inseparable electrolytic and other
concomitants (one of which is liberation of heat,
                                                        " Phil. Mag.," 1886,
vol. xx i, p. 130).    In the chemical groups of substances examined, it
varied  in magnitude inversely   as the atomic weights    of  the constituents,
both electropositive  and electronegative, of the electrolyte, independently
of all   other   circumstances;  and in consequence of being largely
diminished by corrosion of the electrodes it appears to be intimately
related to " surface-tension." He suggests that corrosion may be a
consequence and not the cause of small
                                               " transfer-resistance." The
strongest evidence of the existence of the above general law was
obtained with liquids and electrodes with which there was the least
corrosion and the least formation of undissolved films ; those liquid*
 were dilute alkali chlorides, with electrodes of platinum.
   The research is an extension of a former one on " Transfer-resist
ance in Electrolytic and Voltaic Cells," communicated to the Royal
 Society, March 2, 1885. Further evidence on the same subject has

   A year ago, a paper was communicated to the Society on the
behaviour of ethyl alcohol when heated. A similar study of the
properties of ether has been made, in which numerical values have

 been obtained    exhibiting the expansion of the liquid, the pressure of
 the vapour, and the compressibility of the substance in the gaseous
 and liquid conditions ; and from these results, the densities of the
 saturated vapour and the heats of vaporisation have been deduced.
 The temperature range of these observations is from —18° to 223° C.
    It is the authors' intention to consider in full the relations of the
 properties of alcohol and ether ; in the meantime it may be stated
 that the saturated vapour of ether, like that of alcohol, possesses an
 abnormal density, increasing with rise of temperature and corre
 sponding rise of pressure ; that at 0° the vapour-density is still
 abnormal, but appears to be approaching a normal state ; and that the
 apparent critical temperature of ether is 1940°C. ; the critical pressure

III.  " On the Working of the Harmonic Analyser at the Meteoro
       logical Office." By Robert H. Scott, F.RS., and Richard
       H. Curtis, F.R. Met. Soc. Received May 6, 1886.
   On the 9th of May, 1878, Sir W. Thomson exhibited to the Society
a model of an integrating machine, which consisted of a series of five
of the disk, globe, and cylinder integrators, which had been devised
two years earlier by his brother Prof. James Thomson, and a descrip
tion of which will be found in the " Proceedings of the Royal Society,"
vol. xxiv, p. 262.     Sir W. Thomson's paper describing this model
will be found in vol. xxvii of the "Proceedings," p. 371; and refer
ence should be made to both these papers for an explanation of the
principle of the machine.       In the communication    last named it is
stated    that the  machine    was  about  to be  " handed over to the
Meteorological Office, to be brought immediately into practical work."
   The model was received at the Office in the course of the month,
and was at once set in action ; the results of the preliminary trials,
when obtained, being referred to a Committee consisting of the late
Prof. H. J. S. Smith and Prof. Stokes, who, on the 5th of July fol
lowing, submitted to the Meteorological Council a favourable report
on the performance of the model.
   The Council at once resolved to have a machine constructed, which
should be specially adapted to the requirements of the work for which
it was intended, viz., the analysis of photographic thermograms and
barograms.
   In preparing a working design for actual execution, it was found
necessary to make several modifications in the details of the mechani
cal arrangements of Sir W. Thomson's original model, and these were

   1886.]    The Harmonic Analyser at      the Meteorological Office.       383
  mainly worked out by Prof. Stokes and Mr. de la Rne. Plans were
  obtained from two firms of mechanical           engineers, and those of
  Mr. Mnnro being ultimately adopted, the construction of the instru
  ment was entrusted to him. It was considered sufficient to limit the
  action of the machine so as to extend only to the determination of
  the mean, and the coefficients as far as those of the third order, in the
  expression
           'E=a+a1 cos 0+\ sin    0 + a2cos 26 + b2  sin 20-fOg cos 30
                              + 63sin 30 + &c,
 and to obtain these it was necessary to have seven sets of spheres,
 disks, and cylinders.
     A description of the machine, as actually constructed, was published
 in "Engineering" for December 17th, 1880, and we are indebted to
 the proprietors of that journal for permission to reproduce the
 engravings which illustrate that description, as well as a portion of
 the text, which we now proceed to quote : —
     " The machine is shown in the accompanying engravings, figs. 1 to
 3 ; figs. 2 and 3 showing details of the arrangements of the ball, disk,
 and cylinder.     In principle it is, of course, precisely similar to its
 predecessor  — differing from it only in constructive details intended to
 secure stability, and accuracy in its movements.           Instead of being
 largely  made  of  wood, as was   the  case with   the  model,  it is entirely
 of metal ; the cast-iron frames carrying the disks being secured to a
 firm iron bed supported by two substantial uprights ; the disks them
selves are of gun-metal, and the spheres of steel carefully turned, and
 nickel-plated to prevent rusting ; the horizontal bar carrying the forks
 for moving the spheres is also of steel and plated, and is carried above
 the disks upon five iron uprights or guides.         The forks are provided
with adjusting screws allowing of very accurate centering of the
spheres upon the disks, and adjusting screws are likewise provided
for the frames carrying the recording cylinders, by which their
parallelism to the faces of the disks can be rigidly secured.              The
spheres are not touched by the forks themselves, but by the flat faces
of two screws passing through their lower extremities, and in this

wheels, so arranged that they may, if desired, be changed for others
of different ratios to the cylinder carrying the curves, and in this way
the terms of other orders of the expansion may be obtained, should
they be required, with the same instrument, merely going over the
curves afresh, and using wheels of the proper ratios in place of those
used for the first, second, and third pairs of terms.
    " The cylinder over which the curves have to pass is provided with
an ingenious arrangement by which it can be expanded or contracted
to alter its circumferential measurement by about four-tenths of an
 inch, so that within certain limits variations in the length of the time
ordinates of the curves can be very readily allowed for.           To effect
this the cylinder (see figs. 4, 5, and 6) is made in three sections, each
provided with an eccentric movement ; of course, except when these
are at their normal positions the " cylinder
                                                 " is not
                                                          truly cylindrical,
but still, even when moved to their extreme limits, the deviation is
not so large as to cause any inconvenience in its use.         Adjustments
are also supplied to the pointers, of which two are used at once, the
one to follow the outline of the curve dealt with, and the other the
zero line from which the ordinates are measured ; and throughout the
machine all racks and toothed wheels are skew cut to further lessen
the risk of error from backlash.
    " The height of the machine is 3 feet 8 inches, and the length of the
steel bar, which is rather longer than the bed of the machine, 9 feet.
    " The machine has now for some time been in regular use at the
Meteorological Office, and notwithstanding the weight and solidity
of some of its parts, the whole is so nicely balanced and fitted that it
works with the utmost case and smoothness."
    The machine was delivered at the Office in December, 1879, and a
lengthened series of trials was at once commenced, to determine its
constants, and thoroughly test the accuracy of its working, for which
purpose systems of straight lines and curves, of which the values were
known, were first used. A few small unforeseen difficulties were early
met with, necessitating slight modifications      in some portions of the
instrument.
    The chief of these faults was a slight turning of the cylinders upon
their axes, when the balls were moved to and fro along the disks,
                                                               2 d 2

parallel to the axes of the cylinders.           The movement was always in
 the same direction, namely, towards the disks, whether the ball was
moved to the right or left.          After the trial of many expedients the
defect was finally, in great measure, overcome by attaching weights to
 the spindles of the cylinders.        It however still exists in the machine
to a slight extent, and its effect is to decrease the readings on the
cylinders by a very small amount.
   It was decided to employ the analyser, in the first instance, in the
determination of temperature constants, and careful comparisons have
been made of the results obtained by its means, with those got by
actual measurement of the photographs and numerical calculations,
as will presently be mentioned, and the accordance is so very close as
to prove that the machine may safely be trusted to effect reductions
which could only otherwise be accomplished by the far more laborious
process of measurement and calculation.
   It will facilitate an apprehension of the method of using the machine
to give a somewhat detailed account of the operations involved in the
treatment of the curves, with an example of the manner in which the
readings of the machine are recorded and dealt with.
   The machine is furnished with three pairs of recording cylinders
and disks, numbered consecutively 1 to 6, which give the coefficients
for the first three pairs of terms of the expansion, and in addition a
seventh cylinder and disk from which the mean is obtained.              In the
thermograms which supply continuous photographic records of the
march of temperature, the trace for twenty-four hours covers a length
of 8' 75 inches, while a vertical height of about 0*7 inch* corresponds
to a range of ten degrees in temperature ; each thermograph sheet
contains the record for forty-eight hours.
                  * This value varies slightly for each
                                                        observatory.

     Conveniently placed in the machine is a cylinder or drum, the
circumference of which is equal to the length of twenty-four hours
 upon the thermograms.       Round this cylinder the thermograms are
rolled, the fluctuations of temperature indicated by the curves being
 followed, as the cylinder revolves, by a combination of the move
 ment of the cylinder with that of a pointer moving in a line parallel
 to its axis.
     The handle by which the cylinder is turned gives motion at the
same time to the seven disks of the machine, and the operator thus
controls by his left hand both the speed with which the curves are
paid through the machine and the consequent velocity of the angular
motion of the disks, while by a suitable contrivance, the movements
of the pointer, governed by his right hand and following the curve,
produce on the face of the disks corresponding movements to the right
or left of the balls by which the motion of the disks is conveyed to
the recording cylinders.
    At the commencement of an operation all the cylindersjare set to
,ero ; the twelve months curves are then passed consecutively through
the instrument ; the first pair of cylinders, which gives the coefficients
of the first order, and also the mean cylinder, 7, being read for each
day, while cylinders 3 and 4, and 5 and 6, which give the coefficients
of the second and third orders respectively, are only read for each five
days and at the end of each calendar month.                   The numbers on the
cylinders are, however, progressive, so that the increments upon them
for any given period could very easily be obtained. The form in which
the readings are recorded is as follows : —

    At present only the monthly increments of the readings have                 been
dealt with, so as to obtain the coefficients of the mean daily variation
for each month of the year. The process followed is, therefore,
simply to divide the monthly increment by the number of days in the
 month, and then to multiply the quotient by a factor which is deter
 mined by the scale-value of the thermograms, and which will there
fore be different for each observatory.
    The ratios of the factors for cylinders 1 to 6 to that of No. 7
 were very carefully determined from a series of experimental curves,
 of which the values were known. The numerical factor is obtained
 for each observatory by obtaining on cylinder No. 7 the scale reading
 corresponding to a vertical movement of the pointer of 10° on the
thermogram, which in the case of Kew is 0 75 inch. The factor for
 cylinders Nos. 1 and 2 is eight times that for cylinder No. 7 ; the
factor for Nos. 3 and 4 is four times that quantity, and for Nos. 5 and
 G is eight-thirds of that quantity.        The signs of the factors depend on
 the direction in which the disks and cylinders are caused to revolve.
 The constant quantity added to the reduced reading of cylinder No. 7
corresponds to the temperature which is assumed as the zero at the
commencement of the operation.

   After   some   trials with the curves for the year 1871, the year 1876
was taken      up, inasmuch as for that year the records had been dis
cussed by Mr. H. S. Eaton, M.A., F.R. Met. Soc., who had calculated
the hourly means of the various meteorological elements for each
month separately, and who kindly placed his results at the disposal
of the Council.
   The working of the machine was thus subjected to an exact test by
comparing the results obtained by it with the coefficients in the har
monic series which were calculated from Mr. Eaton's means ; and
their trustworthy character, and the adequacy of these calculations to

 390             Messrs. R. H. Scott and R. H. Curtis.          [May 20,
serve as a standard with which the coefficients obtained     by means of
the machine might be compared, was established by calculating them,
 from the odd and even hours, quite independently, for all the seven
observatories.
    The outcome of this experiment was thoroughly satisfactory, and
 the entire series of results obtained both by calculation and from
 the machine was published as Appendix IV to the Quarterly Weather
Report for 1876, together with a Report prepared by Prof. Stokes,
the concluding paragraphs of which may be quoted here, since they
sum up in a few words the conclusions arrived at.
   " Disregarding now the systematic character of some of the errors,
and treating them as purely casual, we get as the average difference
between the constants as got by the machine and by calculation from
the twenty-four hourly means 0'065°.        It may be noticed, however,
that the numbers are unusually large (and at the same time very
decidedly systematic) in the case of the second cylinder of the first
order (bx), for which the average is as much as 0-150°, the seventh
of a degree.
   " If
        6! be omitted, the average for the remaining cylinders of the
machine is reduced to 0'047°.
    " We see, therefore, that with the
                                           exception perhaps of bx, the
constants got by the machine for the mean of the days constituting
the month are as accurate as those got by calculation, which requires
considerably more time, inasmuch as the hourly lines have to be
drawn on the photograms, then measured, then meaned, and the
constants deduced from the means by a numerical process by no
means very short."
    The curves for the twelve years 1871 to 1882 inclusive have now
been passed through the machine, and the results obtained have been
carefully checked so far as the arithmetical work involved is concerned,
upon a plan approved by the Council.           No direct check, short of
passing   the curves a second  time  through the machine can however
at present be put on any portion of the results except as regards the
means, which have been compared with the means calculated from
the hourly readings obtained by measurement from the curves.         The
results of this work will be published as an appendix to the " Hourly
Readings from the Self- Recording Instruments," for 1883, but the
general results may here be stated.
    As a rule, the monthly means yielded       by the harmonic analvser
agree well within a tenth of a degree with those obtained by calcu
lation from the hourly measurements of the curves ; and although in
some exceptional cases larger differences have been found, amounting
in rare instances to as much as half a degree, it is probable that
generally these are less due to defects in the working of the instrument
than to other causes. In some cases largo breaks in the curves, due

 1886.]     The Harmonic Analyser at     the Meteorological Office.   391
 to failure of   photography, &c, were interpolated when the carves
 were   passed  through   the machine, but not when the means were
 worked out from the hourly measurements.        Some differences rather
larger than usual, and confined chiefly to the earliest years dealt
with, have been ascertained to have arisen from the circumstance that
when the curves were first measured, to obtain hourly values, the
method of making the measurements was not the same as that found
by subsequent experience to be the preferable ; and also that in some
cases the scale- values first used were less accurately determined than
has since been found possible.
   In both these respects the two methods were on a par in the later
years dealt with, and therefore the fairest comparison is to be had
with their means.
   For 1880, the average difference of the monthly mean for all the
seven observatories is 0-09° ; for 1881 it is 0-05° ; and for 1882 0-06° ;
and in these three years a difference of 0'3° between the analyser
and calculated means occurred but once, and of 0'2° but five
times.
   What has been said is sufficient to show that the instrument is
completely applicable to the analysis of thermograms.
   It has also been employed on the discussion of barograms, and the
curves for the years 1871, 1872, and 1876 have been passed through
the machine.
   The year 1876 was selected owing to the existing facilities for
comparing the resulting figures with those obtained by calculation
from Mr. Eaton's means, and the result in this case was equally
satisfactory with that for temperature already mentioned.
   In conclusion, the Fellows may perhaps be reminded that on
June 18th, 1874, one of us (Mr. Scott) read a paper " On the use of
an Amsler's Planimeter for obtaining mean values from Photographic
Curves," " Proc. Roy. Soc," vol. 22, p. 435. This paper contains a
table exhibiting the differences between the means so obtained and
those yielded by the hourly values.
   We reproduce this table, appending to it the values obtained from
the analyser for the same period.
   It will, of course, bo remembered that the mean is the only result
which can be got from the planimeter, while it is but a small part of
what is yielded by the harmonic analyser ; but a comparison of the
figures obtained by the two instruments from the same photographic
curves may be interesting, as being got in the case of the planimeter
from an instrument in which there is a combined ''rolling and slipping"
movement, while the movement in the analyser is one of " pure
rolling contact."

 I. " Family Likeness in Eye-colour."              By Francis Galton,
                     F.R.S. Received May        10, 1886.
     My inquiry into Family Likeness in Stature (ante, p. 42) enabled
me to define, in respect to that particular quality, the relation in
which each man's peculiarity stands to those of each of his ancestors.
The object of the present memoir is to verify that relation with
respect to another quality, namely, eye-colour.
     Speaking of heritage, independently of individual variation, and
 supposing female characteristics to be transmuted to their male equi
 valents,    I showed (1) that the possession of each unit of peculiarity
 in a man [that is of difference from the average of his race] when
 the man's ancestry is unknown, implies the existence on an average
 of just one-third of a unit of that peculiarity in his
                                                             " mid-parent,"
 and, consequently, in each of his parents ; also just one-third of a
 unit in each of his children ; (2) that each unit of peculiarity in each
 ancestor taken singly, is reduced in transmission according to the
  following average scale : — from a parent, to ^ ; from a grandparent,
  to -To ; from a great-grandparent, to   Jj, and so on.
      Stature and eye-colour are not only different as qualities, but they
  are more contrasted in hereditary behaviour than perhaps any other
  simple qualities.     Speaking broadly, parents of different statures
  transmit a blended heritage to their children, but parents of different
   eye-colours transmit an alternative heritage.       If one parent is as
   much taller than the average of his or her sex as the other parent is
   shorter, the statures of their children will be distributed in much the
  same way as those of parents who were both of medium height. But
   if one parent has a light eye-colour and the other a dark eye-colour,
  the children will be partly light and partly dark, and not medium
  eye-coloured like the children of medinm eye-coloured parents.        The
   blending in stature is due to its being the aggregate of the quasi-
   independent inheritances    of many separate parts, while eye-colour

 appears      to be much         less various    in its origin. If then it can be
 shown, as I shall be able to do, that notwithstanding this two-fold
 difference between the qualities of stature and eye-colour, the shares
 of hereditary contribution from the various ancestors are in each case
 alike, we may with some confidence expect that the law by which
those hereditary contributions are governed will be widely, and
perhaps even universally, applicable.
    Data. — My data for hereditary eye-colour are drawn from the same
collection of
                     " Records of Family Faculties "
                                                                   (" R.F.F.") as those
upon   which       the  above-mentioned       inquiries  into   hereditary stature were
principally based.           I  then analysed the general value of these data in
respect     to   stature,   and    showed that they were fairly trustworthy.               I
think they are somewhat more accurate in respect to eye-colour, for
which family portraits have often furnished direct information, while
 indirect information has been in other cases obtained from locks of
 hair that were preserved in the family as mementos.                          I have also
 been able to collate some of my results with those lately published by
 M. Alphonse de Candolle,* who instituted an inquiry that has in many
 particulars, though not in the main object of the present memoir,
 covered the same ground as my own, and which was of course founded
 on an entirely different collection of data. My conclusions in respect
 to those particulars, of which only a few find place here, are generally
 corroborated        by his.
    Persistence of Eye-colour in the Population. — The first subject of our
 inquiry must be into the existence of any slow change in the statistics
 of eye-colour in the population that might have to be taken into
 account before drawing hereditary conclusions.                      For this purpose       I
 sorted the data, not according to the year of birth, but according to
 generations, as that method of procedure best accorded with the
 particular form in which all my R.F.F. data are compiled.                          Those
 persons who ranked in the Family Records as the
                                                                      " children " of the
 pedigree, were counted as generation                 I ; their parents,       uncles and
 aunts, as generation          II   ; their grandparents,      great uncles, and great
aunts, as generation           III   ; their great grandparents,         and so forth, as
 generation       IV.     No account was taken of the year of birth of the
 " children," except to learn their age ; consequently there is much
overlapping of dates in successive generations.                      We may, however,
safely say,      that   the   persons    in  generation    I  are quite different from
those in generation III, and the persons in                  II  from those in IV.         I
had intended to exclude all children under the age of eight years, but
in this particular branch of the inquiry,                  I fear that some cases of
young     children       have   been    accidentally  included.       I  would willingly

have taken a later    limit than eight years, but could not spare the data
that would in that case have been lost to me.
    A great variety of terms are used by the various compilers of the
 " Family Records " to express eye-colours.        I began by classifying
 them under the following eight heads: — 1, light blue; 2, blue, dark
blue ; 3, grey, blue-green ; 4, dark grey, hazel ; 5, light brown ;
6, brown ; 7, dark brown ; 8, black.            I
                                          Then constructed Table I.
   The accompanying diagram will best convey the significance of the
figures in Table I. Considering that the headings for different eye-
colours are eight in number, the observations are far from being
sufficiently numerous to justify us in expecting clean results ; never
theless the curves come out surprisingly well, and in accordance with
one another.     There can be little doubt that the change, if any, during
four successive generations is very small, and much smaller than mere
memory is competent to take note of.       I therefore disregard a current
popular belief in the existence of a gradual darkening of the popula
tion, and shall treat the eye-colours of those classes of the English
race who have contributed the records, as statistically persistent
during the period under discussion.
   The concurrence of the four curves for the four several generations
affords some internal evidence of the trustworthiness of the data.     For
supposing we had curves that exactly represented the true eye-colours
for the four generations, they would either' be concurrent or they
would not.     If concurrent, the errors in the R.F.F. curves must have
been so curiously distributed as to preserve the concurrence.       If not,
the errors must have been so curiously distributed as to neutralise the
non-concurrence.      Both of these suppositions are improbable, and we
must conclude that the curves really agree, and that the R.F.F. errors
are not large enough to spoil the agreement.         The mnch closer con
currence of the two curves, derived respectively from the whole of the
male and the whole of the female data, and the still more perfect
form of the curve derived from the aggregate of all the cases, are
additional evidences in favour of the goodness of the data on the whole.
   Fundamental Eye-colours. — It is agreed among most writers on the
subject (c/. A. de Candolle) that the one important division of eye-
colours is into the light and the dark. The medium tints are not
numerous, and they may have four distinct origins. They may be
hereditary with no notable variation, they may be varieties of light
parentage, they may be varieties of dark parentage, or they may be
blends.     These medium tints are classed in my list under the heading
"4. Dark grey, hazel," and they form only 12- 7 per cent, of all the
observed cases.     It is common in them to find the outer portion of
the iris to be of a dark grey colour, and the inner of a hazel.        The
proportion    between   the grey and the hazel varies in different cases,
and the eye- colour is then described as dark grey or as hazel, accord

ing to the colour that happens most to arrest the attention of the
observer.     For brevity, I will henceforth call all intermediate tints by
the   one name  of hazel.
    I will now investigate the history of those hazel eyes that are varia
tions from light or from dark respectively, or that are blends between
them.     It is reasonable to suppose that the residue which were in
herited from hazel-eyed parents arose originally either as variations
or as blends, and therefore the result of the investigation will enable
us to assort the small but troublesome group of hazel eyes in an equit
able proportion between light and dark, and thus to simplify our
inquiry.
    The family records include 168 families of brothers and sisters,
counting only those who were above eight years of age, in whom one
member at least had hazel eyes.             The total number of these brothers
and sisters is 948, of whom 302 or about one-third have hazel eyes.
For distinction     I   will describe these as " hazel-eyed families " ; not
meaning thereby that all the children have that peculiarity, but only
some of them.       The eye-colours of all the 336 parents are given in the
records, but only those of 449 of the grandparents, whose number
would be 672, were it not for a few cases of cousin marriages.                Thus
I  have   information      concerning    about    only two-thirds  of  the  grand
parents, but this will suffice for our purpose.            The results are given
in Table II.

It will    be observed       that the distribution of eye-colour among the
grandparents of the hazel-eyed families is nearly identical with that
among the population at large.              But among the parents there is a
notable difference ; they have a decidedly smaller percentage of light
eye-colour and a slightly smaller proportion of dark, while the hazel
element is nearly doubled.           A similar change is superadded in the
next generation.          The total result in passing from generation            III
to I, is that the percentage of the light eyes is diminished from 60 or
61 to 45, therefore by one quarter of its original amount, and that

408                            Mr. F. Galton.                    [May 27,
the percentage of the dark eyes is diminished from 26 or 27 to 23,
that is to about one-eighth of its original amount, the hazel element
in either case absorbing the difference.     It follows that the chance of
a  light-eyed parent having hazel offspring, is about twice as great as
that of a dark-eyed parent.       Consequently, since hazel is twice as
likely  to be  met  with  in  any given light-eyed family as in a given
dark-eyed one, we may look upon two-thirds of the hazel eyes as
being fundamentally light, and one-third of them as fundamentally
dark. I shall allot them rateably in that proportion between light
and dark, as nearly as may be without using fractions, and so get
rid of them. M. Alphonse de Candolle has also shown from his data,
that yeux gris (which I take to be the equivalent of my hazel) are
referable to a light ancestry rather than to a dark one, but his data
are numerically insufficient to warrant a precise estimate of the
relative frequency of their derivation from each of these two sources.
    Heredity of Light and Dark Eye-colour. — In the following discussion
I  shall deal only with those family groups of children in which the eye-
colours are known of the two parents and of the four grandparents.
There are altogether 211 of such groups, containing an aggregate of
1023 children. They do not, however, belong to 211 different family
stocks, because each stock which is complete up to the great grand
parents inclusive (and I have fourteen of these) is capable of yielding
three such groups.     Thus, group 1 contains a, the "children;" 6, the
parents ; c, the grandparents.     Group 2 contains a, the father of the
" children," his brothers and his sisters ; 6, the parents of the father ;
c, the grandparents of the father.      Group 3 contains the correspond
ing selections on the mother's side. Other family stocks furnish two
groups. Out of these and other data, Tables    III  and IV have been made.
In Table   III I have classified the families together whose two parents
and four grandparents present the same combination of eye-colour,
no class, however, being accepted that contains less than twenty
children. These data will enable us to test the average correctness of
the law I desire to verify, because many persons and many families
 appear in the same class, and individual peculiarities tend to dis
appear.                  I
           In Table IV have separately classified on the same system
all the families, 78 in number, that consist of six or more children.
These data will enable us to test the trustworthiness of the law as
applied to individual families.       It will be seen from my way of
discussing them, that smaller families than these could not be ad
vantageously dealt with.

children from the total number of children. Nothing would have
been gained by their insertion, while compactness would have been
sacrificed.
   The entries in the tables are classified, as       I  said, according to the
various combinations of light, hazel, and dark eye-colours in the parents
and grandparents.        There are 6 different possible combinations among

no means evenly distributed among the classes.           I have no returns at

    Calculation. — have now to show how the expectation of eye-
colour among the children of a given family is to be calculated on the
basis of the law laid down for stature, so that those calculations of
the probable distribution of eye-colours may be made, which fill the
three last columns of Tables      III   and IV, which are headed I, II, and
 III, and which are placed in juxtaposition with the observed facts as
entered in the column headed " Observed."               These three columns
contain calculations based on data limited in three different ways, in
order the more thoroughly to test the applicability of the law that it
is desired to verify. Column          I  contains calculations based on a
 knowledge of the parents only ;        II  contains those based on a know
ledge of the grandparents only ;        III  contains those based on a know

    Let the letter M be used as a symbol to signify the person for
whom the expected heritage is to be calculated.              Let P stand for
the words " a parent of M ;" Gj for " a grandparent of M ;" G2 for
 "a
      great-grandparent of M," and so on.
    Now suppose that the amount of the peculiarity of stature pos
 sessed by P is equal to r, and that nothing whatever is known with
 certainty of any of the ancestors of M except P. We have seen* that
though nothing may be actually known, yet that something definite
is implied about the ancestors of P, namely, that each of his two
parents (who stand in the order of relationship of Gj to M) will on
 the average possess %r.     Similarly that each of the four grandparents
of P(who stand in the order of G2 to M) will on the average possess
\r, and so on. Again we have seen that P, on the average, transmits
 to M only J of his peculiarity ; that Gj transmits only         ; Gjj only
and so on.       Hence the aggregate of the heritages that may be ex
pected to converge through P upon M, is contained in the following
series  : —

That is to say, each parent must in this case be considered as con
tributing 0'30 to the heritage of the child, or the two parents toge
ther as contributing 0"60, leaving an indeterminate residue of 0'40 due
to the influence of ancestry about whom nothing is either known or
implied, except that they may be taken as members of the same race
as M.
   In applying this problem to eye-colour, we must bear in mind that
a given fractional chance that each member of a family will inherit
either a light or a dark eye-colour, must be taken to mean that that
same fraction of the total number of children in the family will pro
bably possess it. Also, as a consequence of this view of the meaning
of a fractional chance, it follows that the residue of 0-40 must be
rateably assigned between light and dark eye-colour, in the propor
tion in which those eye-colours are found in the race generally, and
this was seen to be (see Table II) as 6T2 : 26-l ; so            I allot 028 out of
the above residue of 0'40 to the heritage of light, and 0-12 to the
heritage of dark.       When the parent is hazel-eyed I allot of his total
                                                                       f

the two parents of G1 (who stand       in  the relation of G2 to M) will
also possess \r that each of the four grandparents of Q1 (who stand

So that each grandparent contributes on the average 0-16 (more
exactly 0'1583) to the heritage of M, and the four grandparents
contribute between them 0'64, leaving 36 indeterminate, which when
rateably assigned gives 0'25 to light and 0-11 to dark. A hazel-eyed
grandparent contributes, according to the ratio described in the last
paragraph, 0-10 to light and 0-06 to dark. All this is clearly expressed
and employed in the columns        II of Tables V and VI.

   Suppose P to possess r, then P taken alone, and not in connexion
with what his possession of r might imply concerning the contri
butions of the previous ancestry, will contribute an average of 0-25
to the heritage of M. Suppose Gx also to possess r, then his contri
bution together with what his possession of r may imply concerning
the previous ancestry, was calculated in the last paragraph as
^y=0-075.       For the convenience of using round numbers         I take this
as 0-08. So the two parents contribute between them O50, the four
grandparents together with what they imply of the previous ancestry
contribute 0,32, being an aggregate of 0-82, leaving a residue of 0'18
to be rateably assigned as 0-12 to light, and 0-6 to dark. A hazel-
eyed parent is here reckoned as contributing 0-16 to light and 0-9 to
dark ; a hazel-eyed grandparent as contributing 0-5 to light and 0'3
to dark. All this is tabulated in Table V, and its working explained
by an example in the columns headed         III  of Table VI.
   Results.  — A mere glance at Tables         III  and IV will show how
surprisingly accurate the predictions are, and therefore how true the
basis of the calculations must be.        Their average correctness is shown
best by the totals in Table III, which give an aggregate of calculated
numbers of light-eyed children under Groups I, II, and            III  as 623,
601, and 614 respectively, when the observed numbers were 629 ; that
is to say, they are correct in the ratios of 99, 96, and 98 to 100.

    Their trustworthiness when applied to individual families is shown
as  strongly in Table IV, whose results are conveniently summarised in
Table VI.      I have there classified the amounts of error in the several
calculations : thus if the estimate in any one family was 3 light-eyed
children and the observed number was 4, 1 should count the error as 1-0.
I have worked to one place of decimals in this table, in order to bring
out the different shades of trustworthiness in the three sets of calcula
tions, which thus become very apparent. It will be seen that the calcu
lations in Ciass   III are by far the most precise. In more than one-half
of those calculations the error does not exceed 0-5, whereas in andI     II
more than three-quarters of them are wrong to at least that amount.
Only one-quarter of Class       III  are more than 1*1 in error, but some
where about the half of Classes         I and II are wrong to that amount.
                 I                                       I
In comparing with II, we find I to be slightly, but think distinctly,
the superior estimate.        The relative accuracy of   III  as compared
with I and II, is what we should have expected, supposing the basis
of the calculations to be true, because the additional knowledge
utilised in III, over what is turned to account in I and II, must be
an advantage.
    Conclusion. — The general trustworthiness of these calculations      of
the probable proportion of light-eyed and dark-eyed children in indi
vidual families, whose ancestral eye-colour is more or less known, is
comparable with the chance of drawing a white or a black ball out of
a bag in which the relative numbers of white and black balls are the
same as those given by the calculation. The larger the proportion
of data derived from a certain knowledge of ancestral eye-colours,
and not from inferences about them, the more true does the com
parison    become.      My returns are insufficiently numerous and too
subject    to uncertainty of observation to make it worth while to
submit them to a more rigorous analysis, but the broad conclusion to
which the present results irresistibly lead, is that the same peculiar
hereditary relation that was shown to subsist between a man and
each of his ancestors in respect to the quality of stature, also
subsists in respect to that of eye-colour.

 specific inductive capacity is changed, what will be the electrioal con

 induction which may be stated as follows : —
    When a dielectric is brought into a field of electric force and the
 specific inductive capacity is there altered, in general the dielectric
 becomes electrified.
    To give definiteness to our notions, let us imagine a field of electric
 force to be due to an electrified conductor, which we will call the
 " primary ;" inclosing this primary is a conducting shell which is
 connected to earth.
    For simplicity we will assume, for the present, that the charge on
 the primary remains unchanged in magnitude during this series of
 operations    : —
    (1.) The dielectric is brought into the field of force   ;
    (2.) The specific inductive capacity is increased;
    (3.) The dielectric is carried out of the field.
    The state of the field is exactly the same as it was before the
 operations were performed.       We can therefore fix our attention on
 the dielectric.
    Let us compare the work done       by electrical forces with the work
 done against them in the operations (1), (2), (3). We have in (1)
 work done by electrical forces in assisting to bring the dielectric into
 the field; work is also done by (say) the forces in (2). In operation
 (3) work is done against electrical forces. The question to be answered
 iB this,  does the  following equation hold in every  case ?
    Work done by electrical forces in bringing the dielectric into the
          field
     4-  work done by the forces during the change of specific inductive
          capacity
    = work done against the electrical forces in carrying the dielectric
          out of the field.
    If  this equation be true under all circumstances, there is no excess
 of work done by or against electrical forces. We would have then no
 reason to expect to find an electric distribution on or in the dielectric,
 whose energy would be the equivalent of the excess of work done.
,Now that the above equation should always hold seems to me at
 variance with sound conceptions regarding the effect of an arbitrary
 change in the physical state of a body.
    Take, for instance, a case such as that of a piece of hot glass left to

electric forces of the field ; and when cold carried out of the field.
   The important      part here played by the element time, renders it
quite impossible     to  maintain a priori that the above hypothetical
equation should hold under all circumstances:        the proof would need
to be experimental.
   The investigation given below is designed to express in definite
terms the effect of the somewhat general conditions therein specified.
   Let us denote the potential of the primary by V, its charge by q ;
the specific inductive capacity of the dielectric placed in the field of
force by K ; and the electrostatic capacity of the whole system by C.
Then the theorem is that the magnitude and sign of the " apparent
                "
electrification    of the dielectric are given by an equation       of the
form —
where h denotes the rate of change of the apparent electrification
of the dielectric with regard to the specific inductive capacity K as
independent variable ; and w denotes the rate of change of the work
done against     electrical   forces with regard to the same independent
variable.
   By translating the theorem into the language of magnetism, we
obtain a theorem relating to magnetic induction in matter placed in a
magnetic field of force.
                                       Proof.
   The dielectric being supposed in the field of force, let the specific
inductive capacity be changed. The influence of this change of
specific inductive capacity of the dielectric on the electrical state of
the primary can be expressed by taking as independent variables the
potential V of the primary, and the specific inductive capacity K of
the dielectric.    Due to an arbitrary change of potential SV, and an
arbitrary change of specific inductive capacity £K, there will be an
augmentation Sq of the charge of the primary — by connecting it to
proper sources of electricity — given by an equation of the form —
                      iq=C.SV      + Y.^.SK+h.SK                       (1.)
   The first term of the right hand member expresses the well-known
relation   between the charge, the potential, and the capacity of an
electrical system ; the second term expresses the effect of the change
of capacity caused by the alteration of specific inductive capacity ;
and the third term expresses the effect of the electrification of the
dielectric due to the same cause.         What  I propose to show is, that

   the quantity h need not be zero, unless          under very special circum
  stances.
      As it appears   in (1), h .  SK is clearly the quantity of electricity that
  must be given       to the primary in order to maintain the potential
  constant whilst      the specific inductive capacity is altered by £K, and
  this in addition    to the influence of the mere change of capacity of the
  system.
      We may assume       as a  well-known result that for     a closed cycle     of
  operations
                                          Sq=0,
 and    cq is a perfect  differential.*
      Expressed in words, this is equivalent to stating that, when after
  undergoing a series of changes, the potential is brought back to any
 given value V, and the molecular condition of the dielectric in the
  field of force is brought back to its initial state, then the charge of the
 primary is the same as at first.
      The analytical statement of the condition that       cq in (1) is a perfect
 differential gives us —a

      In order to obtain another relation between the quantities, let ns
 denote by     £e the increment of electrical energy of the system during
 the series of operations         described above as leading to (1). This is
 expressed by an equation of the form —

     The meaning of the first term of the right hand number of (3) is
obvious ; the other term, jriK, denotes the work done against electrical
 forces when the specific inductive capacity of the dielectric is increased
by *K.

    It  appears therefore that in order to have no electrification of the
 dielectric when the specific inductive capacity is altered, the change
 of capacity of the system must be proportional to the change of
 specific inductive capacity.

    Remark also that since     —   must in general be positive, the quantity
o, and therefore also ir, mast be negative, by (7).
    It is not difficult to prove that the condition             = const. leads to
the conclusion      that the whole electric field must be occupied by an
electrically homogeneous dielectric.
    The following proof seems to be convenient.                Let us imagine the
assumed heterogeneous medium to consist of shells of dielectric
material whose boundaries are equipotential surfaces ; each shell is
supposed to be itself homogeneous.           If the bounding equipotential
surfaces consisted of excessively thin conducting shells, the distri
bution of electric force in the field would be unaltered.                    Each
consecutive pair of conducting equipotential surfaces with the (homo
geneous) shell of dielectric between, would then form a condenser.
And since the same quantity of electric induction crosses all the
equipotential surfaces in the field, the capacity of the whole system
would be simply that of a series of condensers in " cascade."
    When air is the dielectric, denote the capacity of the condenser
which consists of the primary, the first conducting equipotential
surface, and the space between, by C1 : the capacity of the condenser
formed by the first and second equipotentials by C2, and so on. If,
instead of air, the spaces be respectively filled up by dielectrics of
*pecific inductive capacities Kj, K2, and so on, we have for the capacity
of the whole system C, the relation —
                             U    i  +  JL+          .   . .
 Replacing the shells of dielectric by others of different specific induc
tive capacity, and denoting the changed quantities by dashes, we have —
                           -4=^+^+

 so  that the alteration of specific inductive capacity is the same for all

 and (6') express the effect of heterogeneity in the constitution of the
 dielectric medium.
     Note. — It may be well to notice here an objection that might be
 raised against the validity of the above theorem.                 It could be urged,
 that since Dr. Hopkinson has found by experiment* that no change
of specific inductive capacity could be detected when glass was
 subjected to electric stress varied through a very wide range of
 magnitudes, the quantity ir in the theorem has no existence.                         The
experiments just referred to, however, only prove that the quantity tt
 is very small.        It is shown in Part         II  of this paper that for most
substances      ir has   a value  different   from     zero, being positive in some
cases, negative       in others.

   Application     to the Theory    of  the Origin of Electrification      by  Friction.
     The rubbing together of two bodies is the most ancient means
 known of obtaining electricity.                  The absence of any accepted
explanation of         this  historical mode of rendering a body electrified
does not need to be enlarged upon.
     I  have ventured       to entertain    the hope that the general theorem
proved above, together with the experimeDtal results obtained by Dr.
 Kerr in his memorable researches in the region of " electro-optics,"
may be found to prove adequate to the explanation of the fundamental
and important subject of electrification by friction.
    As is well known, Dr. Kerr has proved that transparent dielectrics
become as a rule doubly refracting when subjected to electric force.
Under the action of electric stress, a dielectric becomes strained.
With the electric stress different at different parts of the field of
force, the strain varies from point to point.                This space-variation of
strain manifests itself optically by the material assuming the property
of converting plane polarised into elliptically polarised light, when
the incident light is passed transversely across the direction of the
electric induction in the dielectric, and the plane of polarisation is
inclined at an angle to this direction.
    Moreover, as has been pointed out and proved experimentally by
Prof. Quincke,t the electrically-induced strain — the effect of which
Dr. Kerr observed as double refraction — produces a change in the
index of refraction. When the strain is uniform, Quincke has shown
that no double refraction ensues. Doubly refracting properties are

point.
   Dr. Kerr has made the remarkable discovery that some dielectrics
become optically "positive," others "negative," when subjected to
electric stress.        I
                       think it may be inferred from Prof. Quincke's
experiments just    referred  to, that those bodies which Dr. Kerr found
       "
to be positive   " have their index of refraction decreased by electric
                      " bodies on the
stress ; " negative                        contrary have their index of
refraction increased. I am not aware that this point has been decided,
but I hope shortly to investigate it in the laboratory of University
College, London.
   The sign of the change of index of refraction is not essential to
the present discussion.      We will assume, however, simply for con
venience of statement, that a " positive
                                                " dielectric
                                                              experiences a
decrease, and a
                 " negative

                                dielectric experiences an increase of index
of refraction when placed in a field of electric force.
   Now, whatever opinion may be held concerning the electro
magnetic theory of light, there can be no doubt that along with
change of index of refraction of a dielectric, there goes always
change of specific inductive capacity.       With the supposition we have
made above regarding the sign of the change of index of refraction
produced in the dielectrics examined by Dr. Kerr, his results when
expressed in electrical terms translate into the statements that : a
" positive " dielectric has its specific inductive capacity decreased by
electric force ; a " negative
                                  " dielectric has its
                                                         specific inductive
capacity increased by electric force. In view of the theorem proved
in Part     Iof this communication,       this form of statement is very
important.

  It   means that       if
body be decreased in presence of a field of force, then the electric

 with liquids it is probable that only the heating effect of friction can
 influence the results.
     According    to  what law the electrification goes on increasing when
 once started      is a point still to be cleared up, the value for any
 material of the quantity it having still to be worked out experi
 mentally.
     Before discussing (8) it is convenient here to notice that when two
 bodies are in very close contact, the capacity of the system that con
  sists of the two opposed surfaces and the extremely small distance
 between them, must be very great indeed.                If then at any moment
  Q  be  the  charge  on  either  of these  opposed    surfaces  and C denote the
  capacity of the system, then (6) becomes         —
                               ,

need only take account of the value of —                   f°r each.

   To simplify discussion         of (8) we will take the second body               as
" neutral "; i.e.,            = 0-      We shall           that boxwood

nearly to fulfil this condition.          Also for brevity and convenience, we
will put _^.=a.
   Two    cases arise   for consideration.
   Case   I.
               positive, i.e., work is done against          electric forces by in
   J^(a)
creasing the specific inductive capacity.
          " Positive " liquids. If a liquid dielectric be warmed, the
   (a) .
index of refraction, and therefore the specific inductive capacity, is
decreased.       Hence, by friction there is a change of specific inductive
capacity     —  £K to be expected.           Using AE in the same sense as
in (8)-
                                       AE = -(-oq^K.
   It   is shown by the experimental results quoted below, that AE
positive indicates that by friction this class of liquids tends to become
positively electrified.       And since in this particular case the sign of
AE    is the same as that of the electrification,              it ought to hold in
general.      It will be seen that this is true.
   (b) . "Positive" solids.          Here friction, by raising the temperature
of the surface, tends to change the specific inductive capacity by an
amount
                                    .-. AE=-«0eK.
   Such bodies tend to become negatively electrified by friction.
   Case   II.
               negative.     Here work is done by electrical forces when
   J^-(a)
the specific inductive capacity is increased.

"Negative" solids therefore tend to become positively electrified by
friction.
   The conclusions under (a), (6), (c), (d) are all found to                be verified
by experiment.
   Professor Foster has suggested to me that, in connexion with the
ideas expressed by equation (8), it is interesting to find the statement
by Beccaria* that the cause of the electrical difference set up between
two pieces of similar silk ribbon when rubbed together lies in the
unequal warming of the opposed surfaces.                     The oft-quoted experi
ments of Faraday with a feather and piece of canvas fall obviously
under the same head.
   I  may perhaps be allowed to cite in addition some very old experi
ments with glass made by Bergman.t                 On rubbing two similar strips
of glass together, the portion of the surface of either strip which
received the greatest amount of friction per unit area became positive.
This agrees perfectly with what may be deduced from (8). For the
two strips,             a was the same        ; hence by (8) —
              dV
   If SKj>ST£2 we get      AEj positive,      as Bergman found.
          Experiments on the 'Electrification        of Steam by Friction.
   The experimental results given below are far from complete ; but
I venture to publish them as affording in some measure an experi
mental verification of the ideas put forward in Part I.
   The method of experimenting and the arrangement of apparatus
employed were essentially the same as were used by Faraday in his
classical experiments on this same subject.            J
   It is needless for me to say how very much                       I am indebted to
Faraday's observations during the whole course of this experimental
enquiry. Like all that the great experimenter undertook, the record
of his observations in the " Researches

                                                      is a treasure-house for later
experimenters    to draw    supplies    from.
   To generate steam, a small vertical copper boiler was used, which
was heated by gas led to the burner by india-rubber tubing.                         By
placing the boiler on small blocks of shellac the insulation was found
at all times to be excellent.       The weather was very favourable.

    The electrical condition of the boiler was the thing tested in all
the experiments : a gold leaf electroscope connected to it served as
indicator.
   The steam was led from the boiler through a straight brass tube
nbout 1*2 cm. diameter and 120 cm. long, to a steam-globe of copper
10 cm. in diameter.      This steam-globe was always kept well supplied
with distilled water, as Faraday points out how essential it is to have
the steam wet. A " feeder- tube
                                      "
                                         was used to contain the substance
to be experimented upon : it was of glass 1*5 cm. internal diameter,
and about 15 cm. long.        A short length of narrow tubing, furnished
with a glass stopcock, was fused to the main tube at the centre and at
right angles to the axis.      It was used to renew the supply of material
in the wider    tube below       along which the current of steam was
passed to sweep the material away.            This arrangement was found
convenient in working ; and it possessed the great merit of allowing
the pieces to be easily cleaned.
    For the friction-piece that was rubbed by the current of fluid, I
worked principally with a boxwood tube of as nearly as was con
venient the dimensions of the tube described by Faraday as an
" excellent exciter."*
    By a fortunate chance, this tube was found to be very nearly at
the neutral line where Dr. Kerr's " positive " and " negative " sub
stances meet.
    In order to find out     if possible what was the meaning of some
anomalous results that appeared in the experiments, a number of
observations were made with, amongst others, tubes of pine, haw.
thorn, birch, sulphur, plaster-of-paris, and a tube formed out of a
piece of carbon     rod 1*2 cm. diameter, such as is used in electric
lighting.   The results obtained with the sulphur and plaster-of-paris
tubes were interesting, but in no way decisive, as the tubes were
found to have become very much disintegrated by the action of the
current of stearn ; they are, therefore, not recorded in what follows.
The results with the hawthorn tube will illustrate the effect of
friction-tubes of materials whose place is on the negative side of the
neutral line ; carbon stands on the positive side.
   Between the two lies the boxwood tube.             This is well shown by
the results obtaiued with methylic         alcohol and amylic alcohol as
shown in the list given below.
   The wooden tubes used were always kept well soaked with distilled
water.
   After each day's work with the apparatus, it was taken to pieces,
and the copper steam-globe and the feeder-tube were left to steep in a
strong solution of carbonate of soda ; then they were well rinsed out
with distilled water before being used again.            As occasion required,

methylated spirit was tised to give the apparatus a thorough cleansing
from all traces of oil, &c.
   As a valuable test of the proper working of the apparatus, oil of
turpentine was constantly in use. If everything was going well, the
effect of adding a small quantity of the oil to the distilled water in
the feeder-tube was to make the boiler positive, and the steam nega
tive.   On continuing to blow out, the boiler quickly passed on to
negative.
   This was repeated as a rule between the testing of each pair of sub
stances.
   It will be observed in the list given below that there are three
persistent apparent exceptions to the rule that holds for all the other
substances tried   ; these are turpentine, sperm oil, and chloroform.
   The extremely uncertain composition of the first and second of
these three bodies did not allow their exceptional behaviour to
assume much importance in my eyes.           But that chloroform should
remain an exception to the rule appears to indicate that either the
influence of the water masks that of the chloroform (vide remarks by
                         "
Faraday on Alcohol,        Exper. Res." §2115, 2116), or that there has
been a change of sign in the electro-optical    position of the body due
to rise of temperature.       These points, together with some others
that have been raised in my mind in connexion with the present
                                           I
application of the theorem of Part I, hope to be able to clear up
by experiments in a different direction from those recorded here.       It
may be desirable to state also, that I began experiments in which dry
compressed air was used instead of steam, but was not able to con
tinue them.
    In conclusion  1 desire to record  my thanks to Prof. Poster, for the
valuable   criticisms with whioh    he has favoured me during the pre
paration   of this paper.
   Note. — In the experimental results which follow, the sign of the
electrification is that assumed by the body to whose name it stands
opposite when rubbed on the material whose name is at the top of
the column.

   In this paper an endeavour is made to show the Dature of the
changes which have resulted from the action of heat upon certain
vitreous rocks.      The changes which take place in such rocks through
natural processes may sometimes be effected by heat alone, at others
by heat in presence of moisture.                Of these actions the latter is
probably the more frequent, but, at the outset, it seems important to
ascertain the action simply of dry heat before studying the more
complicated conditions engendered by the presence of water and the
pressure of superincumbent rock masses.

  1886.]        Alteration by Heat in certain       Vitreous Rocks.           431
     The following examples which have been operated upon are few,
 but typical, and the alterations which they have undergone will be
 found to have a certain petrological significance.
     The first subject taken for experiment was a small fragment of the
 well-known pitchstone of Corriegills in the Isle of Arran.             This was
 kept at a temperature ranging from 500° up to about 1100° C, during
 a period of 216 hours. The change visible at the end of the nine days'
 heating is not so strongly marked as might have been expected, the
 fragment still exhibiting a resinous lustre, but the colour; originally
 a deep green, has been altered to a deep reddish-brown or chocolate-
 colour.      The rock in its normal condition has already been described
 by Mr. S. Allport* and others, and a section cut from the specimen
 before heating presents exactly the same characters shown in Allport's
 drawings, published in the
                                     " Geological Magazine," in
                                                                     Vogelsang's
 " Krystalliten," Plate 13, fig. 2, and in Zirkel's " Mikroskopische
 Beschaffenheit der Mineralien und Gesteine," fig. 43.
     A section made from the specimen now described, but prepared
 prior to heating, has furnished the figs. 1, 3, and 5, on Plate 3. The
 three right-hand figures on the same plate have been drawn from a
 section made after nine days' heating at a temperature ranging from
 500° up to about 1100° C.          For the sake of comparison the figures on
 opposite    sides  of the  plate  have been drawn under the same amplifica
 tion.
     When the artificially altered rock is examined under a power of
 25 linear it presents the general appearance shown in fig. 2, Plats 3.
 On comparing this with fig. 1 ou the same plate we see that a marked
 change has taken place.          The clear spaces surrounding the crystallites
 or belonites of hornblende have increased, while the dusty-looking
 matter no longer shades off into the clear glass but lies within more
 or less sharply defined boundaries.         It also presents a coarser appear
 ance than     in  the  section   taken from   the unaltered specimen.       With
 increased amplification the character of the change becomes more
clearly perceptible.
    In fig. 4, Plate 3, we find, on comparing it with fig. 2 on the same
plate, that the hornblende belonites themselves have undergone very
considerable alteration.         They have to a great extent lost their frond
like appearance.         Their delicate lateral growths seem to have shri
velled up, and their green or greenish-brown colour has changed to a
deep rusty brown.          Their stems or central rods have become opaque,
and the lateral fringes frequently share this opacity.            They seem, in
fact, mere withered representatives of the greenish fern-like crystallites
which occur in the natural state of the rock, and the change appears

to consist in the peroxidation of the protoxide of iron in the horn
blende.     The general aspect of these crystallites is mnch darker than
that of their unaltered representatives, and they stand out in bold
contrast to the clear glass around them.
    On looking at the left-hand portion of fig. 4, Plate 3, we see a
number of coarse spicule which under a lower power, as in fig. 2,
Plate 3, appear merely as stippling. This stippling in fig. 2 is the
altered condition of those parts of fig. 1 which are softly shaded, or
seem to be so under an amplification of 25 linear.            When magnified
250    diameters   this  portion    of the  normal   rock  still appears finely
stippled, but contains numbers of very minute spicule, as shown in
fig. 3, Plate 3. When we compare this stippling in fig. 3 with the
coarse spicule on the left of fig. 4, Plate 3, the extent of the alteration
produced by the nine days' heating becomes striking.             It is probable
that these spicule are hornblende, and that they are evidently a
further development of the much smaller ones so plentiful in the
glassy ground-mass of the unaltered rock.           In the dusty looking parts
of the nnaltered glass we find, under an amplification of 1150 dia
meters, some indication of the source from which this wealth of
crystalline spicule has been derived, fainter and smaller spicule
being visible, together with sparsely distributed dark specks, a few
blunt-ended colourless microliths, and a profusion of colourless globu-
lites, as in fig. 5, Plate 3.
    The spicule shown on the left of fig. 4 are again represented in
 fig. 6, Plate 3, under a power of 1150 diameters.           They are grouped
in a stellate   manner      and  constitute  a large proportion of the rock,
 while the fine dusty matter previously visible has almost entirely dis
 appeared.     Although, through the agency of dry heat, we have here
 an instance of further crystalline development, yet no approach to a
 felsitic structure is discernible in the glassy matter of this rock ; the
 new crystallites which have been formed being certainly neither
 felspar nor quartz, but possibly actinolite.
    The next specimen to be considered is a piece of black obsidian
 from Ascension, about as typical an obsidian as it would be possible
 to find, and showing a faintly banded structure. The general micro
 scopic character of this rock is shown in figs. 1 and 3, Plate 4,
 fig. 1 being magnified 25, and fig. 3 570 diameters.              In fig. 1 the
 banded structure is well marked, and streams of colourless microliths
 lie with their longest axes in the general direction of the banding.          A
 fragment of      this  rock   was   kept  for the same period at the same
 range of temperature          adopted in the case of the Arran pitch-
 stone.
     The rock in its normal condition is a       deep  black glass with a well-
 marked     conchoidal    fracture.    In section,    when not very thin, it
  appears by transmitted light of a brown or coffee colour, and contains,

as already stated, numerous microliths, mostly bacillar or spicular,
sometimes in rectangular forms, and often shaped like a butcher's
meat-tray. In the artificially heated specimen a remarkably vesicular
structure has been developed, the rock, in fact, has become filled with
vesicles, mostly spherical, or approximately so. The sand in which
the specimen was heated has adhered firmly to its surface.     Vitreous
lustre is visible on fractures.   Under the microscope between crossed
Nicols the rock shows no sign of devitrification from its protracted
heating, but the section is full of the large vesicles which have been
developed (fig. 2, Plate 4). The glass still contains great numbers of
microliths, a few small stellate or cruciform groups being here and
there visible, but it seems probable that they are fresh developments,
and that the old ones have been dissolved, for there is no longer any
banded structure, or only very faint indications of            it,
                                                         the microliths
lying in all directions and not in streams. This view      favoured by
                                                                 is
the almost necessary assumption that the rock must have been
reduced to a condition bordering ou fusion to have permitted the
development of such an extremely vesicular structure, while further
evidence of this       seen in the firm adhesion to the surface of the
                        is
specimen    of the   sand-grains in which    was embedded during the
                                                 it
process of heating.          In spite, however, of the great molecular change
 of position implied by this development of vesicles, there           no sign of
                                                                      is
 devitrification, unless indeed the microliths be fresh ones formed
 during the heating of the specimen, or during two days in which             it
cooled from 800° to about 100° C. They do not probably equal those
 present in the normal condition of the rock.

                      4,                     asection of a piece of the same
 obsidian, which was kept for 701 hours at a temperature ranging from
about 850° to 1100° C.        The specimen has been nearly fused, and           is
 pitted on the surface by the impressions of the sand-grains in which
it   was embedded, a few of the grains still adhering.               There is   a
resinous   or  subvitreous  lustre  on  some parts   of  the specimen, but one
 face    dull.
        is       Internally     it full of vesicles, but a thin compact crust
                                     is
exists in which there are none, and this crust             continuous with the
                                                          is
spongy vesicular portion.          One or two of the cavities are nearly
half an inch in diameter, i.e., they occupy nearly the whole thickness
of the specimen, while others are of very small dimensions. They are
irregular in form, and appear as a rule to communicate with one
another.
   Under the microscope, with an amplification of twenty-five diameters,
the section shows large irregular vesicles            ;their walls (i.e., what
remains of the roc1.) appearing to consist of greenish-brown matter
traversed by opaque and approximately parallel bands.               The trans
lucent portions of the section       seem,  under   this  low  power, to consist
of micro-crystalline matter, the general aspect being that of fine dust

mixed     with  a  felted   microlithic substance, while between crossed
Nicols numerous doubly refracting granules and needles are visible.
    Where the actual margin or outer crust of the specimen is included
in the section the substance is quite transparent and colourless by
ordinary transmitted light, and is seen to contain numerous green
microliths.
    By reflected light the whole section appears of a greyish-white,
except the parallel bands, which are of a rather darker grey, and
 the more vitreous portion of the outer crust, which appears dark.
 The extreme outer crust is seen by substage illumination to be almost
or quite opaque.
     Under a power       of 250 diameters the outer crust may be distin
 guished as consisting of three layers, the outermost of extreme thin
 ness, transparent,      and coffee-coloured ; the next quite opaque or
 feebly transmitting a brown or brownish-green light. It is of much
 greater thickness      than the outermost    glassy  layer, and consists of
 greenish-brown microliths matted parallel            to one another, and
 directed with their longest axes at an angle to the outer surface of
 the specimen, the angle being sometimes nearly a right angle, and
 seldom less than about 20° or 30°.       This shades off or fringes off into
 a clear colourless glass layer, also containing numerous           greenish-
 brown spicular microliths, evidently identical in character with those
 which, by their massing together, form the nearly opaque band last
 described.    It is not easy to say what these microliths are, but they
 appear to be some form of amphibole or pyroxene ; they have, as a rule,
 a somewhat frayed and ragged or fibrous aspect, and it seems occa
 sionally that they either belong to the rhombic system, or extinguish
 at a very small angle with their longest axes.        With the exception of
 the glassy band in the thin outer crust, the remainder of the rock
 has been completely devitrified, fig. 4, Plate 4.       Owing to the porous
 nature of the specimen it was scarcely possible to prepare a very thiu
 section, but, judging from what can be seen, it consists of doubly re
 fracting microliths with an admixture of minute crystalline granules.
     The devitrification does not in this case appear to be precisely of the
  same character as that met with in naturally devitrified obsidians, but
  at all events we have here a proof that the actiou of dry heat during
  701 hours has been capable of devitrifying this glassy rock.
     The next specimen, a black obsidian from the Yellowstone Dis
  trict, Montana, U.S., was in the first instance kept at a temperature
  ranging from 500° to about 1100° C. for 216 hours.         Some of the sand
  in which the specimen was heated adheres firmly to ite surface.          On
  fractures the rock is still vitreous in lustre, but it appears of a much
  paler colour than in its natural condition.        This is probably due to
  the development of great numbers of small vesicles, the colour being
  now grey, whereas in the unaltered specimen it was black.

1886.]       Alteration by Heat in certain Vitreous Rocks.              435
   Microscopic examination of a section of this obsidian in its normal
condition shows the presence of numerous trichites, resembling small
eyelashes, and often occurring in radial or stellate groups ; globulites
are also plentiful, but, with the exception of these and some minute
gas-pores, the obsidian is remarkably free from enclosures, although
here and there a few porphyritic felspar crystals and a spherule or
two occur. This was, therefore, regarded as a very favourable speci
men to experiment upon.
   The appearance of a section of this rock in its normal condition is
represented in fig. 5, Plate 4, as seen under a magnifying power of
570 diameters.      In this drawing rather faint indications of banding
are shown.     Part of the same section is also represented in fig. 7,
magnified   570 linear, in which some of the trichites are visible.     The
specimen which was heated for 216 hours has developed an exceed
ingly vesicular    structure,  but apart from this it appears to have
undergone but little change.        The vesicles are large, fig. 6, Plate 4.
Their sections are nearly all circular or approximately so.             The
trichites seem to have disappeared entirely, but some small opaque
granules are now visible, and in some instances they have distinctly
triangular sections. These by reflected light appear black and are no
doubt magnetite.
    In order to ascertain what change would take place by further
 heating, another fragment, taken from the same specimen as the pre
 ceding, was heated for a period of 701 hours at a temperature of from
 850° to about 1100°C.
    The rock is still vitreous, but a marked change has occurred.       The
 specimen   had  no   sand adhering  to its surface, and  it  perfectly pre
 served its original external form, the conchoidal fractures and sharp
 cutting edges remaining quite distinct, but the outer surface has
 merely a dull sub-resinous or flint-like lustre, although on freshly
 fractured surfaces the lustre is quite vitreous.    Here and there upon
 the surface very slight elevations occur, and these are mostly per
 forated by a diminutive hole, as if made with a common sewing-
 needle.    When a point was inserted in one of these apertures and the
 crust was prized off, a remarkably cavernous interior was exposed,
 the cavities appearing to have been formed by the coalescence of more
 or less spherical vesicles, averaging from a quarter to half an inch in
 diameter.
    In these cavities white crystalline pellets were found, for the mo*t
 part about a third the size of the cavities in which they respectively
 occurred.
    Three of these pellets are represented in the middle line of figures on
 Plate 4. Some of them are approximately spherical, and they are usually
 crystalline crusts, either empty or enveloping a smaller pellet of the
 same kiud. The walls of the cavities in which they occur are also at
                                                                2 g 2

times lined with crystals apparently of the same mineral.          The pellets
themselves are too friable to admit of any sections of them being cat,
while no satisfactory conclusion has yet been arrived at by crashing'
them and examining the fragments under the microscope. Small glisten-
ing faces sometimes showing a certain parallelism of growth may be
detected with the help of a lens, and, so far as general appearances go,
the mineral bears a somewhat close resemblance to rhyacolite. They
are, at all events, probably anhydrous silicates allied to the felspar or
nepheline groups.       In some cases the pellets adhere slightly to the
walls of the vesicles, yet in one or two instances they appeared to be
loose,   but may possibly have been detached by the shock in breaking
open   the  specimen. On examining one of these pellets by reflected light
under a half-inch objective, the white crystalline surface was seen to
be studded     with minute black or deep blackish-red crystals, having a
brilliant metallic lustre.     One of them exhibited a six-sided face as
shown in the bottom figure of the middle line in Plate 4.                 This
was turned sufficiently well into position to enable all parts of the face
to be brought at once into focus, when it was found that measure
ment of the angle formed by adjacent edges was 60°.                  There is,
therefore, little doubt that these small crystals are specular iron,
which has separated out during the process of artificial heating, no
such crystals being visible in a microscopic section of the rock in its
normal condition.
   Under a power of 250 linear the section of this artificially heated
rock still appears as a clear glass, but trichites similar to those present
in the unaltered obsidian are again seen; they are, however, much
more numerous.        A vesicular structure still exists, and the sections of
the vesicles are sometimes circular, at others oval.           Two or three
porphyritic felspar crystals occur in this section, one of them,
apparently twinned on the Carlsbad type, has a very irregular outline,
somewhat like that of a comb with broken teeth.              Felspar crystals
with equally irregular contours occur, however, in the unaltered
rock.
   In   this specimen the devitrification has been confined to the forma
tion   of the white crystalline pellets, the rest is glass, containing
trichites and globulites, which of course may be regarded as evi
dences of incipient devitrification.      Still they are also present in the
unaltered     rock, and between     the  two   sections  the  differences  are
barely     appreciable, even under the microscope.            Figs. 7 and 8
 (Plate 4) show how close the resemblance is.
   Being anxious to ascertain the result of dry heat upon basic as well
as highly silicated glassy rocks, a small fragment of the very vesicular
basalt-glass from Mokua Weo Weo, Sandwich Islands, was treated in
the same manner as the previously described specimens.                    This
 became     completely  disintegrated   in the process of section-cutting.

The specimen had, however, quite lost its vitreous lustre, and had
changed      from black to a pale brown colour. Another fragment of
basalt-glass from Kilauea, very vesicular, but less so than the previous
sample, was kept at a high temperature, about 750° to 1200° C, for a
period of 960 hours.
    The effect of this heating has been to completely destroy all glassy
lustre.    The specimen is still vesicular, but the colour has, like that
of the Mokua specimen, changed from black to purplish-grey or light
brown.
    Fig.  1,  Plate  5, shows the general    character of a section of the
unaltered basalt-glass of Kilauea, cut from the same specimen as that
submitted to the furnace.        The drawing, made under an amplification
of 25 linear, shows portions of three vesicles, several crystals of
olivine, some small spherulites, and numerous crystallites, in a clear
brown glass.        The minute crystallites in this lava are extremely
beautiful, and especially worthy of careful study.           They frequently
assume delicate pectinate forms, which one would think quite as
likely to be preserved or to be re-formed after the fiery ordeal as the
little trichites in the obsidian previously described.         A glance, how
ever, at the section prepared from the altered specimen at once dispels
all hope of seeing them again, or indeed of seeing anything which is
not translucent, and does not occupy the entire thickness of the thin
section which, in spite of its thinness, appears of a deep brownish-
black and perfectly opaque. When examined by reflected light under
a power giving about 30 diameters it is then seen to be of a deep
reddish-brown colour with paler streaks, often cracks, which circle
round the porphyritic crystals of olivine, which are still present and
seem to have undergone little or no change (fig. 2, Plate 5).           These
cracks represent perlitic structure, evidently due to unequal tension in
the glass surrounding the olivine crystals.         The opacity of the altered
rock must probably be attributed to the passage of some of the prot
oxide of iron in the normal rock into the state of peroxide, thus
giving rise to the formation of magnetite.              The normal rock is
scarcely, if at all, magnetic, but the altered specimen causes a strong
deflection of the needle.
    This passage of a clear basic glass into a perfectly opaque substance
is a point of considerable interest, since it seems highly probable that
some of the opaque and extremely              scoriaceous lapilli in certain
volcanic tuffs of palaeozoic age are simply fragments of basic glassy
lavas, like those of the Sandwich Islands, which have undergone a
change similar to that here described.            That in course of time the
magnetite      in some  of these ancient lapilli should pass into limonite is
also a point worth bearing in mind.
    It seems probable that some of the opaque lapilli and dust in the
volcanic ejectamenta of Snowdon and Brent Tor, especially those of

the latter locality, where the lavas are chiefly of a basic character, may
be simply altered fragments of vesicular basalt-glass.
    The following specimens were prepared some years since by Mr.
G . F. Rodwell, late Science Master in Marlborough College.          Fig. 3,
Plate 5, represents part of a section made from a black vesicular glass
which resulted from the fusion of some of the basalt from the Giants'
Causeway, in an ordinary Stourbridge-clay crucible, over a gas furnace.
The mass was then rapidly cooled. The glass appears perfectly clear,
and shows merely vesicles and irregular cracks. Another sample of the
same rock was also fused in the same manner, but was allowed to cool
slowly. A section cut from this (fig. 4, Plate 5) is translucent only
on certain edges, where a prismatic structure is visible, the marginal
portions of the prisms showing a radiating crystalline or fibrous
character as indicated in the drawing. The rest of the section is
opaque, as in the altered Kilauea lava.     It may be added that a some
what similar prismatic structure is occasionally to be seen in opaque
specimens from the Sandwich Island lavas.           Among Mr. Rodwell's
numerous experiments he placed a fragment of cold basalt from the
Giants' Causeway upon the surface of a molten mass of the same rock
and allowed it to sink to the bottom of the crucible.        Figs. 5 and 6,
Plate 5, represent parts of a section taken through the enveloped
fragment and the enveloping glass.          The latter is quite clear, as
shown on the right of fig. 6. On the left of this figure will be seen a
belt of opaque matter, which intervenes between the fragment of
basalt, seen on the left of fig. 5, and the clear glass on the right of
fig. 6 ; while on the right of fig. 5 we see more of this opaque belt
where it comes in contact with the enveloped fragment of basalt. The
boundaries of this opaque belt are sharply defined, especially where it
adjoins the clear glass. Within this dark belt are numerous radiating
groups of colourless, transparent, acicular crystals, the terminations
of some of them being shown in the dark half of fig. 5, Plate 5.
    Whether the formation of this opaque zone is due to the chilling
 influence of the cold fragment on the hot magma into which it sank,
 is a question which may have its bearings upon the formation of
 tachylyte at the sides of intrusive veins and dykes of basalt where
 the molten mass has come in contact with the walls of a fissure.         It
 may also be that the fragment of basalt parted with its heat less
 rapidly than the surrounding magma, and that the latter consequently
 cooled more slowly where it came in contact with the fragment.         This
 seems at least a plausible explanation, and harmonises with the results
 of Mr. Rodwell's earlier experiments, shown in figs. 3 and 4, Plate 5.
    Additional investigations will be made upon the rocks treated of in
 this paper, since the results hitherto obtained have been effected
 under conditions which may not be regarded as the most favourable
 for producing changes similar to those which take place in nature,

        1886.
                                   (Abstract.)
    Platean, Ludtge, and van der Mensbrngghe have investigated
 experimentally the relation between the thickness and surface-tension
 of thin films. None of these observers, however, have used films thin
 enongh to show the black of the first order of Newton's colours.        The
 authors have therefore made a careful comparison of the surface-
 tension of black films with that of coloured films, the thickness of
 which was from 10 to 100 times greater. The principle of their method
 is the same as that utilised in Liidtge's experiments.     The interiors of
 the films to be compared are connected, and the relation between
 their surface-tensions is deduced from measurements by which their
 curvature is determined.       In the authors' experiments a cylindrical
 film was thus balanced against another, which, though sometimes
 cylindrical and sometimes spherical, was initially of the same
 curvature as itself.      The necessity for this arrangement arises from
 the fact that the authors' previous observations have shown that a
 film thins to the black of the first order more readily if it is cylindrical
 than if it is of any other form.      The fact that small changes in the
forms of cylindrical and spherical films, attached to two circular rings,
convert them into unduloids or nodoids, renders the mathematical
theory somewhat complicated, but other considerations have been
made to give way to the necessity of obtaining films which readily
yield the black.
    The sensitiveness of the methods employed by the authors and by
previous experimenters is investigated.         All these methods depend
upon the measurement of a length, such as the change in the diameter
of a cylinder, or in the sagitta of a spherical segment (Ludtge and
van der Mensbrngghe), or the displacement of the liquid in a mano
meter tnbe (Plateau).
    Let an increment dT in the surface-tension T produce an alteration
dL in this length. The fraction T dh/dT is taken as a measure of the
sensitiveness   of the experiment.    If dL and dT are infinitely small, this

442             Prof. A. W. Reinold and A. W. Riicker.            [May 27,
is called the limiting sensitiveness.     In any experiment the observed
value of dh divided by the sensitiveness gives the fractional change of
surface-tension.
    The numbers expressing the sensitiveness indicate the relative
merits    of the different experimental arrangements.         Some of the
authors' experiments were more sensitive than those of any previous
observer, but the possibility of improvement          in this direction is
limited by the fact that if the arrangement is too sensitive the films
do not remain sufficiently steady for accurate measurement.
   The apparatus and method of observation are then described.
Preliminary experiments were instituted to test the observations of
Liidtge and van der Mensbrngghe as to the difference of surface-
tension between two films one of which had been formed more
recently than the other.      These experiments showed that when one
of  the films  was kept thick  by supplying liquid to its upper support
(flooding), while the other was allowed to thin, a considerable
apparent difference of surface-tension was obtained.           Before, how
ever, this conld be accepted as a trustworthy determination of an
actual difference of suriace-tension,          several possible sources of
 error had to be considered.       Thus, experiment shows (1) that the
fact that the thicker film displays the greater surface-tension cannot
be attributed to any peculiarity of the apparatus or mode of thicken
ing adopted ; and (2) that it is not due to the weight of the thicker
film.
    It was also important to determine whether the gradual disappear
ance of the liquid rings by which the films were attached to their
solid supports could produce changes in the forms of the films which
would account wholly or partially for the phenomenon observed.
Two films      of the same surface-tension attached to two rings of
different sizes could not both be cylinders, as the curvature and there
fore the pressure exerted on the internal air would be different.         A
difference in the forms of the films might thus be due, not to the
difference of surface-tension    but to an inequality in the magnitude of
their supports.     The solid rings were accurately turned to the same
diameter, but it was thought possible that the draining away of the
small liquid masses by which the thinning film was attached to the
solid rings might produce alterations equivalent to a change in the
 diameters of the latter.       To test this the following method was
adopted.
    Theory shows that provided the form of the film does not differ
much from a cylinder, the ratio dT/T           can be readily obtained by
means of an expression which does not         involve the diameters of the
 supporting rings. To make use of this        expression, it is necessary to
 measure three diameters of the film.         The ratio dT/T can also be
 calculated from measurements of the          principal ordinate (i.e., the

1886.]    On Thickness and Surface-tension    in Liquid Films.         443
maximum    or minimum ordinate      which lies halfway between the
rings), and from the sensitiveness, in the calculation of which the
assumption is made that the generating curve of the film passes
through the edges of the upper and lower cups.
   The result of comparing the values of dT/T obtained by the two
methods was to show that only a small part of the difference of form
of two films could be ascribed to a slipping of the film over the
liquid attachments to the solid supports.
   The method of measuring three ordinates was applied to a great
number of films, and gave results from 0-5 to 1 per cent, lower than
those obtained from the sensitiveness.    In the case, however, of two
films which were both flooded, and presumably in the same state, the
two methods gave results, the differences between which were both
more irregular and less in amount, averaging not more than 0'2 per
cent.   It is therefore probable that when the bulging or contraction
of a film becomes considerable there is a little slipping, though not
more than enough to account for a small part of the total change of
form observed.
  Phenomena     similar to those described are explained by van der
Mensbrugghe by the consideration that when the surface of a film is
being continually renewed, it is cooled, and its surface-tension is in
consequence increased.    This explanation is shown to be inadequate.
A colourless film being certainly 250 times thicker than a black one,
the increase of surface-tension due to cooling would be only 0'0016
per cent., whereas in some of the experiments there is evidence of a
difference of 9 per cent.
   The cause of the phenomenon    cannot at present be assigned with
certainty. Perhaps many causes    are at work. Experiments designed
to test the effects of oxygen and carbonic acid on the result, though
not conclusive, indicate that the phenomenon under discussion is
affected by the nature of the atmosphere in which the films are formed.
Reasons are given for the conclusion that it is merely an instance of
the difficulty which many observers have found in preserving a liquid
surface pure.
   On the assumption that the rapid change in the surface-tension of
a newly formed film is not due to its thinning, but to a disturbing
cause, attempts were then made to eliminate this cause, or reduce it
so as to compare films of very different thicknesses.
   Two methods of attacking the problem were carried out. In the
first the procedure was as follows : — The diameters of two cylindrical
films were measured when they were in the same state, an electric
current was then passed up one of them in order to thicken       it, and
aftera   sufficient length of time had elapsed for the direct effect due
to the disturbance produced by the current to pass off, the diameters

                                       it   was possible to compare two

films, one of which was nearly all black, while the other displayed a
little black and the colours of the first and second orders.Both films
were then allowed to thin, and assuming (in accordance with previous
observations of the authors) that that which was already black
remained   in a constant state, any change of diameter which took
place as the coloured film became black, could be regarded as due to
changes in the thinning film.
  An objection    to which this method is open requires discussion.
Most of the films observed were partly black and partly coloured.
If any difference of surface-tension existed between the different parts,
the films wonld not be cylinders or simple unduloids, but the black
and coloured    parts would have different curvatures.   Measurements
based    on the sensitiveness would not therefore be trustworthy,                   if,
owing to this cause, appreciable changes took place in the forms of the
films, or in the pressures which they exerted upon the enclosed air.
It was therefore necessary to investigate the form of film consisting of
                                                                 a
two parts of different surface-tensions, assuming that     does not much
                                                                   it
differ from a cylinder. As result of the mathematical investigation,
                                  a
a table was drawn up giving the ratio of the change of pressure due
toa  change of surface-tension    affecting a part of the surface, to that
produced by an extension of the change over the whole film.
  Next follows a detailed description of a number of experiments in
which two cylinders were balanced against each other, and the electric
current was made         use of           their rate of thinning. The
                                   to influence
theory applied to the results of these experiments gave the percentage
change of surface-tension due to change of thickness.
   In a second group of experiments a cylinder was balanced against
a sphere. As a spherical film thins more slowly than         cylinder,   a          a
comparison  between a thick film (sphere) and a black or partially
black film (cylinder) could be made without having recourse to an
electric current, and greater differences of thickness were obtained
than in the earlier observations.
   The differences of surface-tension measured in these observations
were very small.   They never exceeded l'fi per cent., and the black
films were sometimes more and sometimes less curved than the thicker
films with which they were compared.  There was no evidence of any
regular change in the surface-tension           as the thickness     diminished, and
the average difference between the tension of the black and coloured
films as deduced from fifteen experiments was only 0-13 per cent.
   The general result of the inquiry therefore appears to be that
when the black    part   of   a soap   film forms in   the normal       way, spreading
slowly   over   the surface, no evidence       of   any change     in surface-tension
dependent on the thickness   the film

of the tensions  thin and thick films over a range
                 of                                         of   thickness extending
from 1350 to 12 millionths        of   a millimetre.

1886.]     On Thickness and Surface-tension                in   Liquid Films.           445
  This conclusion is based upon a method of experiment by which a
change of    \
             per cent. in the value of the tension must have been
detected, had    it existed, and upon fifteen independent              comparisons       of
the tensions of black and coloured films.
   The whole of the observations were carried out under the conditions
which the previous researches of the authors have shown to be
necessary to maintain the composition and the temperature of the
films unchanged.
   The authors next discuss the bearing of their observations upon
the question of the magnitude of the so-called "radius of molecular
attraction."    They point out that if the mere equality in the surface-
tensions of thick and thin films is to be considered conclusive, they
have accumulated much stronger evidence for the statement that the
radius of molecular attraction is less than half the thickness of a
black film, i.e., < 6 x 10~6 mm. than Plateau produced for the assertion
that 59 X 10-6 mm. is a superior limit to its magnitude.      They are,
however, unwilling to draw this conclusion from their experiments
until an explanation is forthcoming, in harmony with             of the      it,
apparent discontinuity in the thickness     of  the film which always
(except under very special circumstances) occurs at the edge of the
black.
   They are themselves inclined to look upon the sharp edge of the
black as evidence of a change in surface-tension due to the tenuity of
the film, and to regard the result of their experiments as fixing a
superior limit (0-o per cent.) to the difference of the tension of the
black and coloured parts.
   As no explanation of the discontinuity at the edge of the black has
(as far as the authors are aware) ever been put forward, they
conclude by a suggestion which, though no doubt of a speculative
character, may serve to draw attention to a subject which           they           is
believe of considerable interest.
  They show that the main facts to be accounted                      for, viz., the dis
continuity, the uniform thickness of the black, the wide variations in
the thickness of the part of the coloured film which        in contact  is
with the black, and the equality in the surface- tensions of the black
and coloured films, could be explained        were supposed that the
                                                    if
                                                    it
surface-tension  has a critical value when the thickness     somewhat   is
greater than 12 X   10~6 mm.
   The possibility  of the  existence of such a critical value has been
pointed out by Maxwell.*       It would be explained by the assumption
frequently made    in  discussions  on the nature of molecular forces,
that   as the distance     between two molecules diminishes, the mutual
force between them       is alternately attractive and repulsive.

V. " Experiments with Pressure                   on Excitable Tissues."        By
       George       J.  Romanes, F.R.S.          Received May 18, 1886.
    The effects of temperature on excitable tissues have been well
worked out ; but, so far as         I  have been able to ascertain, no 'physio
logist has     tried   the  effects   of pressure.    From physical analogies it
appeared to me probable that increase of pressure would act on
excitable tissues in a manner analogous to decrease of temperature,
and conversely ; but the results of my experiments have not borne out
this anticipation. Nevertheless, the research seems worth publishing.
    In a small glass chamber, made for the purpose,            I was able to place
the freshly excised heart of a frog or a tortoise, and there to submit
the rhythmically beating tissue to any increase of atmospheric
pressure that      I  desired, up to a maximum limit of twenty-two atmo
spheres, beyond which it was not safe to go with the glass chamber
that  I  had. Through one end of this chamber two platinum electrodes
were    admitted,    by means of which I was able to stimulate the nerve
of a nerve-muscle preparation, when this, instead of a heart, was
placed in the chamber.
    The result of a number of experiments was to show that neither the
rhythm of the beating heart nor the excitability of the motor nerve
 was in any way affected by an increase of twenty-two atmospheres ;
for both the rhythm and the excitability remained the same whether
the chamber was exhausted by means of an air-pump or filled with air
at a pressure of twenty-two atmospheres.                In these experiments the
excitability    of the  nerve   was    tested from   time  to time by noting the
distance from the primary coil to which the secondary coil of an
 ordinary du Bois induction apparatus had to be drawn in order to
yield a minimal stimulation ; and the rhythm of the heart was
 counted by watching it through the glass. In some of the experi
ments the pressure was let in gradually, in others suddenly ; in some
it was let in and again released a number of times in rapid succession ;
while in others it was allowed to remain at twenty-two atmospheres
without alteration for half an hour.            During these long exposures the
rhythm     of  the  heart  and   the  excitability of the nerve would sometimes
slightly and continuously fall; but it did not appear to me that this
 was due to the pressure, since the diminution of excitability in either
case was not any greater than that which is often observable in moist
chambers at ordinary pressures.
    Wishing to try whether still higher pressures would produce any
 effects,  I  discarded the glass chamber and had one made for me of
 gun-metal.                    I
                  With this was able to go up to 150 atmospheres, but
was not able to see what was going on inside.                     My method of

experimenting here, therefore, was to take the rhythm of the heart, or
the excitability of the nerve, immediately before screwing up the
apparatus, and again immediately after taking it down.                 I was thus
unable to observe the effects of the pressure during the time that it
 was being     actually applied ; but as it only took me a quarter of a
minute    to unship the chamber and turn its contents out on the table,
 if  the 150 atmospheres      had exerted any marked           influence  on the
 excitability of the tissues, it would probably have been easily detected
 by this method. Yet neither the heart nor the nerve showed any
change after an exposure of five minutes to this great increase of
pressure.

       Effect of Magnetisation on the Elasticity and the Internal
       Friction of Metals." By Herbert Tomlinson, B.A. Com
       municated by Professor W. Grylls Adams, M.A., F.R.S.
       Received May 18, 1886.
                                  (Abstract.)
    The principal object of this investigation was to test the sound
ness of the view advanced by Professor G. Wiedemann respecting
the cause of the internal friction of a torsionally oscillating wire.*
According to this view the internal friction is mainly due to per
manent rotation to-and-fro of the molecules about their axes ; it
seemed probable, therefore, that experiments                on the effects of
magnetising a wire either longitudinally with a helix or circularly
by passing a current through it would aid in elucidating the matter.
    In the experiments on the effects of longitudinal magnetisation
arrangements were made so that the heat generated in the magne
tising helix should not reach the wire, whilst the effect of the heat
generated in the wire when an electric current was passed through
it was eliminated in a manner which is fully described in the paper.
    Besides   the experiments     on the effect of      magnetisation     on   the
internal friction and on the torsional elasticity of metals, others
were made relating to the longitudinal elasticity of metals.                  The
following are the principal results which have been obtained : —
    1. When the deformations produced by the oscillations are small,
the internal friction of a torsionally vibrating wire of iron or steel is
not affected by sustained longitudinal magnetisation of moderate
amount.      The internal friction is also not affected by the sustained
magnetisation even when the latter is carried to the point of satura-

tion, provided the magnetising current be, previously to experiment
 ing, reversed a great number of times. When no previous reversals
 have been made the internal friction is slightly increased by intense
magnetisation.
   2. When the deformations          produced by the oscillations are large
the internal    friction  is  very sensibly increased by sustained longi
tudinal magnetisation of large amount.
   3. The torsional elasticity is entirely independent of any sustained
longitudinally magnetising stress which may be acting upon an iron
or steel wire, provided the deformations produced by the torsional
oscillations be small.      When the deformations are large, the number
of oscillations executed in a given time is very slightly lessened by
sustained longitudinal magnetisation of large amonnt.
   4. When the magnetising         current is interrupted and, to a greater
extent, when it is reversed repeatedly whilst the wire is oscillating,
the internal friction is increased, provided the magnetising stress be
of moderate amount.          The increase of internal friction may become
very considerable when the magnetising stress is great.
   When the number of interruptions or reversals in a given time of
the magnetising current exceeds a certain limit the effect on the
internal friction begins to decline.
   5. When the deformations produced by the oscillations are small,
the torsional elasticity is not affected by either repeatedly interrupted
or reversed longitudinal magnetisation          even when the magnetising
stress is large.
   6. There exists a limit of magnetic stress within which no per
manent rotation whatever of the molecules is produced.            This limit
may   be  widened   by previous   repeated  reversals of a large magnetising
stress.
   7.  The passage of a moderate electric current, whether sustained or
interrupted, through a torsionally vibrating wire of iron, steel, or
nickel does not affect, except by heating, either the internal friction
or the torsional elasticity, provided the deformations produced by the
oscillations be small.
   8. The effect of longitudinal magnetisation, even when carried to
the point of saturation, on the longitudinal oscillation of an iron or
steel wire, is nil.
   9. The passage of an electric current, whether sustained or inter
rupted, through a longitudinally oscillating wire of iron or steel does
not, except by heating, affect the number of oscillations executed in a
given time.
   10. When the deformations produced by the oscillations do not
exceed a certain limit, the internal friction cannot apparently depend
upon the permanent rotation of the molecules about their axes.
When, however, the deformations exceed this limit, the internal

friction becomes very sensibly larger, and does partly, if not mainly,
depend upon the permanent            rotation to-and-fro of the molecules
about their axes. The above-mentioned limit can be widened by
allowing the wire to rest after suspension with oscillations at
intervals, by annealing, and by repeated heating and cooling.

   I. The    objects are, first to enquire, by means of accurate measure
ment, whether there does not exist a definite relation between the area
of the disk of a star image impressed on a photographic film and the
" photometric     magnitude
                               " of that star as determined by instrumental
means.
   For this purpose,- several plates of portions of the Pleiades were
taken by varying exposures in the focus of the De la Rue reflector of
 13 inches aperture,       in the Oxford University Observatory.         The
diameters of the star disks on these plates were then carefully
measured, both with the macro-micrometer and with a double image
micrometer,      in the same establishment.         The result is that the
relation sought for is expressed by —
                          D-D'=8{logM'-logM},
where D, D' are the measured diameters of two star disks on the same
plate, and M, M' their corresponding " magnitudes," as recorded in the
" Uranometria      Nova Oxonienses."
   The mean difference between the observed and computed magni
tudes as derived from the foregoing formula, applied to 28 stars
all impressed on each of the four plates and ranging from magnitude
3 to magnitude 9-5, is 0'16 magnitude.                A few stars (3) here
*tand out, in all the plates, as was. to be expected, arising from the
peculiar actinic action of their spectra.       Similar anomalies, as is well
known, exist in the application of the photometer.
   II. In the next section of the enquiry the effect of alteration of the
time of exposure on the areas of the star images is referred to. The
enquiry is not fully completed, but as far as it extends, it indicates
that for stars not very faint, the areas of the disks of the same star on
the same plate vary as the square root of the time of exposure.

Bond in 1858 considered that these areas varied as the time of
exposure.     Further investigation is required.
    III. In the last section the more important question is answered,
as to whether, on these modern photographic plates, where the times
of exposure are reckoned by hours and minutes rather than by
minutes     or seconds, measures may be made of relative stellar
coordinates as exact and trustworthy as those derived from the best
astronomical instruments applied directly to the heavens. For the
purposes of this enquiry, resort is made to the same plates of the
Pleiades which furnished the results in Section       I  of this research.
The distances of twenty-five stars from Alcyone were measured with
the Oxford macro-micrometer: each measure on each of the four
 plates was repeated the same number of times as Bessel measured the
same distances with his Konigsberg heliometer.         The result of the
comparison     is slightly in favour of  the photographic  measures ; the
average deviations of the repeated measures from the mean being in
the case of photographs 0'24" and with Bessel's heliometer measures
0-29."
    A remarkable    circumstance fortunately occurred in the course of the
 measures, in the case of one of the four plates ; unmistakable evidence
 appeared that the photographic        film had very slightly but mea
 surably shifted in the neighbourhood of three of the stars, but on no
 other portions of that plate nor on any portion of any of the other
 plates.    This indicates the unadvisability of relying on any single
 plate uncorroborated by others.
    The applicability therefore of this form of photography to the most
 precise astronomical measurements seems to be established, even for
 plates exposed for considerable times.       I  now propose to test the
 method still further, by applying it to the determination of stellar
 parallax.

     Numerous researches have been made upon the self-induction of
  coils of wire, and but few in relation to the influence exerted by the
  nature and geometrical sectional form of the electrical conductor
  when employed in straight wires as in those of a telegraph line with

 each other;       our present theories class all non-magnetic              metals
together, taking only into account their specific resistance and the
 diameter of the wires ; they admit, however, a certain modification in
magnetic metals duo to their magnetic permeability, bat we have
had but little experimental evidence of the effect produced.
    The whole subject seemed to me worthy of experimental investiga
tion, and I have lately* given the results of a first series of experi
ments made last year.           I  have remarked since writing that paper
many new and important effects, and               I  have made a new series of
researches,    the   results of   which   I wish   particularly to point out in
 this paper.
    In my late researches        I   made use of a modified " Wheatstone's
         "
             together with a portion of my
                                                      " induction balance," by
bridge
 means of which the induced or extra currents from the wire under
observation were balanced by a secondary current induced from an
independent circuit ; this gave excellent results, but the method has
 been criticised as having the fault of not being clear in its indications.
 In order to meet this objection and also verify the results which                 I
had previously obtained,           I  constructed     an entirely new bridge
founded upon a most simple and well-known principle, and as the
bridge admits of no change in the relative resistance of its sides, its
action can be easily understood ; it is with this instrument that have      I
made my new series of experiments.
    The instrument consists of an ordinary Wheatstone's bridge, with
the exception that a telephone replaces the galvanometer ; there are
in addition two coils of insulated copper wire, one in each portion
of two sides of the bridge, by means of which the mutual self-induction
of its convolutions can be increased or decreased as desired.
    The electrical contacts are made either by a continuous periodic or
tuning fork contact maker, or by a peculiar clockwork rheotome
which    I   have made, in which a contact spring rests lightly on a
wheel whose roughened surface is divided into eight equal parts of
contact and insulation, by means of which we receive on the tele
phone eight equal periods of sound and silence each revolution of the
wheel.      We are by this means better enabled to appreciate feeble
sounds than if they were continuous, and as the wheel can be made
to revolve at any between two and ten revolutions per second, we
have from sixteen to eighty periods of silence between each rubbing
contact per second.
   The following figure shows the theoretical plan of the electrical
communications of the bridge : —

 cylinder is graduated, we may (if the central collar is fixed) approach
 more or less either side of the helix, and read the degree of approxi
 mation of the coil, thus adjusting the mutual induction of each side
 to a perfect balance or zero. In practice I prefer moving the central
 collar, using the end collars only for the perfect      adjustment of its
 zero, as we then have a double effect, viz., closing the coil say from
 A to F, increasing its mutual self-induction, and at the same time
 decreasing the previously balanced induction of the coil AE ; this not
 only gives a wider range of effect, but renders the scale readings
 more uniform ; the end F of the helix is joined to about 10 cm. of
 German silver wire, completing the circuit from G to D ; this supple
 mentary German silver wire is simply for the purpose of making the
 resistance of AD equal to DC, and its length should be adjusted to

this purpose ; the end of the helix E joins directly with the terminal
N ; the -wire to be tested X is joined to N and H ; from H to there  I
is a second supplementary German silver wire allowing ns by means
of the contact side M, which is in direct communication with B, to
introduce more or less of        the German silver wire in the side AB.
The resistance of the wire       to be tested should always be less than
that of the opposite side of    the bridge, and we then make up the total
resistance of AB by sliding      the contact slide M until the resistance of
AB    equals  AD.
    It will  be evident that   in the whole series of experiments there
can be no change in the resistance of either side whenever zero is
found, the induction coils or balance having the same proportional
current in all the changes of the wires under observation, the battery
and telephone circuit present also a continuous absolnte relation ; we
may, however, when desirable, keep the resistance from H to M a
constant, and vary the resistance or the length of the German silver
wire GD, we then balance the wire X by an equal resistance on the
opposite side of the bridge, but then the battery and telephone
circuits no longer possess the invariable relations which are so
extremely necessary in experiments of the nature of which             I have
been making.
    The battery circuit is joined in the usual manner to AC, the current
can be interrupted by the rheotome K, or by means of a commutator
 (not shown in the diagram) close the battery circuit, and transfer the
contact maker to the telephone circuit BD ; this allows us to observe
the effect of an intermittent current compared with that of a constant
or steady flow. M. Gaugain has termed the period of a steady flow of
current the stable period, and that in which a rise or fall of the
current takes place the variable period ; these terms have since been
generally adopted by telegraph electricians, and in order to avoid
introducing new terms, they will be used in this paper.
    It would require too much space to enter into the details of the
construction of the bridge, special care is required in the construction
of the balancing induction coils, and in securing perfect electrical
contacts in all parts of the bridge ; the induction balance requires
calibration, and for this purpose      I introduce as the wire X successive
lengths of 10 cm. 1 mm. diameter copper wire, thus forming a table
of values throughout the range of the induction balance, or by equal
increments of 10 cm. of copper wire up to 20 metres.
    Having no unit of self-induction to which my results could be
quickly and practically referred,        I have adopted as unit the self-
induction of a straight copper wire 1 mm. diameter and 1 metre in
length; this gives on my calibrated induction scale 100 degrees, and
 it is to this standard that all the comparative force of extra currents
mentioned in this paper is compared.

   The self-indnction of a wire is proportional to its length, conse
quently a source of error might exist in the different lengths of the
supplementary resistance wire HI introduced to balance the resist
ance of GD, but as we are enabled by the high specific resistance of
German silver wire to obtain a very great change in resistance by a
comparatively small movement of the sliding scale, this error in most
cases of comparative experiments is but a fraction of 1 per cent., and
when taken into account as it should be the error no longer exists.
    The telephone used should be of the most perfect kind, and
adjusted expressly for rapid and feeble sounds.        I have found it best
to employ an extremely          soft Swedish iron diaphragm,        without
varnish     or  anything  that can   diminish   or  deaden  the  sound ; its
fundamental note should be higher than those generally in use, or at
least 500 double vibrations per second, for we have to deal with
extremely rapid effects which on short wires cannot be rendered
evident upon a galvanometer, but which with a telephone in perfect
adjustment are heard most distinctly with an electromotive force in
the battery circuit ranging from O'OOl to 0-250 ampere.
   In the sketch of the communications the wire to be tested, X, is
shown in the form of a wide loop, but in practice the instrument is
constructed on two separate frames of wood articulated together
at D, by means of which we can separate the terminals NH, and
introduce straight wires, sheets, or tubes of lengths varying from
5  cm. to   1  metre.
   The object of my researches being to observe the self-induction
which takes place in straight wires, or in those of a single wide loop
where the reaction from any return wire is at such a distance that its
influence is not appreciable,      I  shall, therefore, use the term self-
induction to indicate the effects due to the electric current in its own
portion of the wire, and mutual induction to those where the reactions
of different portions of the current and circuit react on each other,
as in the case of coils ; and although some theoreticians consider the
two cases as the same, they are, as my experiments prove, entirely
distinct, for we have, as will be shown, for copper wires a low
coefficient of self-induction with a high mutual induction, whilst in
iron wires the reverse is the case, for we there have a high coefficient
of self-induction with an extremely feeble coefficient of mutual induc
tion.
      Influence of the Nature of the Conductor upon its Self-induction.
    I   found,  as  shown  in my late paper, that there was       a marked
difference in the specific inductive capacity of iron and copper, and
this entirely agrees with well-known theories ; but I suspected that
there might be some difference in the non-magnetic metals inde
pendent of their specific resistance.                        I
                                           For this purpose made a series

1886.]            On  the   Self-induction    of an Electric Current.                455
of experiments with wires of the                same length and diameter, but of
different resistance.           These showed a marked difference provided the
current was increased in proportion to its diameter or conductivity,
but no difference could be found when the current was kept a con
stant, and the interior differences in resistance of the wires were
compensated by an external added resistance ; but if we take wires of
different metals — all of the same length and resistance, but of different
diameters — there is a marked difference due to the mutual reactions
of the current in its own wire, being less in wire of large diameter
than in small wires. These effects have been fully explained in my
late    paper, and have since been completely verified by the method
used at present.          I   showed by the use of my late method a critical
point in the rise and fall of the induced currents ; this is not shown
by the present method of compensating by external resistance, but the
 rapid decrease in the electromotive force of the induced                    currents, as
indicated by the induction balance, is well shown by                        the   present
method.         The following table shows the observed force                of the extra
currents for wires of the same length (1 metre), but                         of different
diameters       : —

     The fall in force is now           even  more rapid than shown by my late
 method, and        it will     be seen    that iron is peculiarly sensitive to an
 increase in diameter, having nearly six times the force of copper in
 wires of 0'25 mm., and not twice the force of copper in wires of
 10 mm. section.
      Reactions of an Electric Current in its own Portion of Conductor.
     The phenomenon of a constant decrease in the electromotive force
of self-induction, as measured by the induction balance, with each
 increase of the sectional area of the conductor, is well shown by the
 present method, and an experimental                  investigation of its cause has
 shown that we should not consider a current in a wire as a single
 element reacting solely upon exterior wires, but that the current
acts precisely as would an infinite number of independent stream
 lets of current reacting upon each other in the interior of its own
 wire similarly to their known effects upon exterior wires.                   My experi
 ments      demonstrate      this  to  a degree   that  leaves  no  doubt   on  my mind

456                       Prof. D. E. Hughes.                   [May 27,
as to its truth, for according to this view we should be able to reduce
the self-induction to a very great extent by employing thin flat sheets
where the outlying portions are at a comparatively great distance from
the central portions.    This   I  have experimentally proved to be the
fact, but this experiment alone does not show if the reduction of self-
induction is due to a different arrangement of the current in sheets as
compared with solids.     If  the reduction is due to the greater separa
tion of the streamlets, then we should be able to reduce this induction
in a still greater degree by employing a conductor composed of
numerous small copper wires through which the current is equally
divided, and which could be separated or brought close together as
desired.    This proves to be also an experimental fact, for the con
ductor formed of numerous strands has far less self-induction than a
thin sheet when its wires are separated, so that they can no longer
react on each other, and surpasses the thin sheet and approaches the
value of a circular wire when these wires are brought near together,
s0 that their mutual reactions can approximate those of the numerous
streamlets in a solid conductor.
   Iron shows a still greater reduction in its self-induction when in
the form of thin flat sheets or numerous small iron wires separated
from each other, with the exception that we cannot restore or approach
the value of a solid wire by bringing them in close proximity.       The
reduction of the induced currents by employing thin sheets instead
of a wire is so great in iron that we could not account for it on the
mere separatiou of contiguous portions of the same current, but if we
assume that the comparatively high force in iron wires is due to the
induced circular magnetism, and that this almost disappears in flat
sheets, we account for the fact that a thin flat sheet of iron has less
inductive capacity than a similar sheet of copper of the same resist
ance, but of different widths ; and if thin strips of copper, brass,
lead, and German silver are compared with similar iron strips, and
their resistance rendered equal by the added resistance in the bridge,
no difference is found between iron and the non-magnetic metals, for
under these conditions their inductive capacities appear equal.
 Reactions of an Electric Current between Separate Portions of the same
                                  Conductor.
   In order to distinguish two distinct effects      I have defined self-
 induction as the effect produced by an electric current on its own
 portion of the wire, and mutual induction as the effect of the reaction*
 between separate portions of the wire on each other.
   The mutual induction in iron and copper wires is very different io
degree, as shown by the following table : —

    There is a remarkable fall in the induction of a straight wire or
single wide loop of a copper wire when this wire is doubled upon
itself as a return wire in close proximity.                       The effect of mutual
induction is also shown by the equally remarkable rise when the
mutual induction of ten layers of a coil react on each other.                       This is
well known, but what              I   believe has not yet been experimentally
observed is the remarkably feeble mutual induction of iron wires,
either when in parallel return in close proximity or when in coils of
numerous layers.            The percentage of increase of induction in a
copper wire from a wide single loop to that of the ten layers being
507 per cent., whilst in iron under precisely the same conditions there
was an increase of but 13"6 per cent.
    That this remarkable difference as shown between the mutual
induction of iron and copper wires is due entirely to the circular
magnetism in the iron wire, and that the mutual reactions of the
streamlets of the current in a thin flat iron conductor prevent this
formation       I have proved in various ways, for if the circular magne
tism is the cause, flat iron sheets which have as low self-induction as
copper should be equally sensitive to mutual induction as the non
magnetic metals, for they no longer in any appreciable degree possess
the protecting magnetic sheath which enfeebles the mutual reactions

ribbon of iron having the same coefficient of mntual induction as
copper, and it no longer behaves as a magnetic body.
   Table I shows the difference in the mutual induction of iron wires
and strips ; it will be seen that when the iron is in the form of a
wire the circular magnetism produces a marked difference between
iron and copper, whilst in the form of flat strips the iron resembles
copper (as regards mutual induction) in every respect.
                      Influence of Circular Magnetism.
   I have shown in my late paper that an iron conductor composed of
numerous fine stranded wires (as in a rope) behaves like copper, and
this I regard aa entirely due to the breaking up or prevention of
circular magnetism ; I also showed a phenomenon which            I could not
then explain, viz., that when an iron wire was heated to a yellow-red
heat it lost its previous high specific inductive capacity and behaved
like copper. The effect of heat upon magnetism is well known, con
sequently we can readily explain the fall in its inductive capacity by
the disappearance of its circular magnetism.          I  found also that in
thin flat strips of iron there was no change whatever in its inductive
capacity at the yellow-red heat ; this can now be readily explained : it
behaved     like   copper when cold, and, having but little circular
magnetism      to destroy, there was no appreciable change produced,
except    that due to the extra resistance caused by the increased
temperature of the strip, and to which copper and iron are almost
equally sensitive, consequently we may consider iron (when in the
form of thin flat sheets) to behave like non-magnetic metals through
out all temperatures.
      Influence of Self-induction   on the Resistance of the Conductor.
   A   phenomenon of great importance is the effect which             I have
observed of the resistance of a wire being greater during the rise of
the current, as in the variable period, than that measured or known
during the constant       flow, as in the stable period ; by resistance     I
mean a pure ohmic resistance, a resistance which can only be
measured, expressed, or balanced in ohms, and, whatever the cause,
the effect is one of pure ohmic resistance.
   We can imagine that at the first moment of contact             there is no
current flowing through the wire, its resistance is then infinite, but
the current gradually increases in force until it arrives at its
maximum, as in the stable period.            We have thus between the
moment of contact and period of steady flow a variable period
wherein the resistance falls in the form of a curve from infinity to its
well-known stable resistance ; the telephone is unable to give the

1886.]        On  the Self-induction  of an Electric Current.         459
oxact form of this curve directly, but it gives by the nul method com
parative results as to the different duration in time of the curve in
different metals.
    If we take a straight copper wire 1 metre in length and balance its
resistance in the stable period, we shall find that there is only traces
o£ a difference in its resistance in the variable period, and we can
balance its self-induction by the induction balance ; but if we replace
the copper by an iron wire of the same length, or even a much shorter
wire, viz., 20 cm., we find that in the variable period we can no
longer balance the wire by the induction balance alone, but we must
compensate for its increased resistance by the sliding scale, the
amount of subtracted German silver wire expressing in fractions of
ohms (the value of the wire being already known) the additional
resistance of the iron wire in the variable period ; we can thus reduce
 or balance the iron wire to a perfect zero, provided the current from
 the battery does not exceed 0-10 ampere ; but with greater current
there will still remain a slight muffled sound, which cannot be
 reduced to zero either by the induction balance or the resistance slide.
 It therefore became important to determine if this muffled sound was
due to a difference in resistance which could not be balanced, or to
the lengthened duration of the extra currents being slower than the
 balancing current from the induction balance ; the latter proved to be
the case, for on prolonging the duration of the balancing currents
from the induction bridge by introducing a core of iron in its coil, the
 balance or zero became absolutely perfect.        In this case we must
choose between cores of different diameter to find one whose reaction
 on the time effect of the induction coil equals the retardation of the
extra currents in the wire tested.
    If we observe the method employed in the bridge, we shall see that
 the induction balance can balance the extra current of the wire X,
 irrespective of the position of the resistance slide M, or any relation
 between the sides AB and AD, but we cannot equalise the resistance
of these sides except by the necessary adjustment of the resistance
slide, consequently when we are forced to adjust the induction
 balance we are compensating the extra current, and when we are
 forced to move the resistance slide we are balancing resistance.
    The disturbance in the bridge caused by the change of resistance
of the wire tested in the variable period, causes a momentary primary
 current to pass through the telephone in the same direction as the
 extra current, and if these are not separated by balancing the extra
current by an induction balance, the mixed effect would be read as a
single effect of the extra current. To show the importance of
 separating these two effects, it is only necessary to say that in most of
the cases cited in this paper the momentary primary current due to the
extra resistance greatly exceeds that of the extra current ; conse

for all observers  find   precisely the same   values both for the resistance
and for the extra current.
   The method is, however, defective in measuring any small diffe
rence of resistance in the variable period in copper wires, as the
induction balance itself introduces an additional but opposing resis
tance by the approaching of its coils, consequently any resistance
which we observe      is a fraction less than the real amount.      To prove
this we have only to use        balancing induction current produced from
                                   a

this small difference, and better, observe any small difference of
resistance in a straight copper wire, and greater when the wire                                   is
formed into a coil.
   Soft iron wire gives a far higher resistance in the variable period
than hard iron, but each wire, according to its molecular structure,
has its own value     ; the effect increases with the diameter, ranging
from 25 per cent. increase of resistance for wires of mm. in diameter,   2
to 500 per cent. for those of       cm.  6

   The table shows that copper and the American compound wire
coated with copper have an extremely rapid action or curve from an

infinite to its stable resistance, due to their freedom from circular
magnetism, whilst iron shows a comparatively slow curve. A remark
able result will be seen where a copper wire has been coated with
iron, its variable resistance being 220 per cent. above that of its stable
period, and 54 per cent. greater than that of a solid iron wire.
   I  found in my previous researches that the resistance in the
variable period could not be changed by a change in speed of a
periodic or tuning-fork contact maker, and that the telephone was
more sensitive when the rubbing contacts were used without any
regard to their frequency of interval.    I also found that the telephone
was far more sensitive and alone suitable for these experiments when
its diaphragm was entirely free from varnish or coating, and suffi
ciently thick to give a clear musical dominant tone of about C or
512 double vibrations per second, the electromagnet being also as
close as possible without being in actual contact.      I noticed that no
matter what number of vibrations were sent, that the tones given by
the telephone on each side of the zero of the bridge were invariably
those of its dominant note.     Suspecting that the frequency of vibra
tion of the diaphragm had a direct relation with the resistance found,
I altered its note through a range of one octave by employing different
thickness of diaphragms, and found that the results were in absolute
proportion to the frequency of the vibrations of the diaphragm.       The
highest tone giving a perfect zero with a high resistance in the
variable period and the low tone giving its zero at a marked less
resistance.    Thus it was evident that the telephone selected from the
mixed vibrations sent by the transmitter those which alone cor
responded to its period of vibration, and that we could thus observe
the effect of more or less rapid periodic contacts.
   The power which vibrating bodies have of selecting from a con
fused number of vibrations those in accordance with their own, is
shown in Helmholtz's resonators, and still more as regards electrical
waves in the remarkable harmonic telegraph of Elisha Gray, who
proved that if the armatures of several electromagnets are made to
vibrate, each with a different musical tone or rate of vibration, then
we may by the use of a vibrating transmitter of a fixed rate of speed
select the electromagnet alone whose period of vibrations is similar,
and that we may send several different periods of vibrations at the
same time without any confusion in the receiving magnets, as each
electromagnet selects from the compound vibrations those in accord
ance with its own.       This is exactly what occurs with a telephone
when using a periodic contact maker, but        I have found in addition,
that a telephone arranged as I have described, will select and respond
loudly in its own clear musical dominant tone to a confused mass of
rapid contacts such as those produced by a scraping contact, and
which in an ordinary telephone gives only the effect of noise, of not

one-third the power or loudness of that produced by the tone of the
musical telephone.           We may thus have ten or more telephones of
different musical notes, each responding separately in their own tone
or all at the same time, as each diaphragm selects its own period
from the confused periods of contacts sent by the scraping contact
maker.
   In  order to verify the results,                I    have used in these experiments
both periodic and mixed sound transmitters, but find that owing to
the difficulty of keeping the periodic transmitter and telephone in
perfect tune with each other, that the mixed sound transmitter is pre
ferable, as      it gives no trouble whatever, and we have more accurate
results, as we then have only to keep onr telephones in accord with
the number of vibrations desired.
   The experiments mentioned in this paper were all made with a fixed
note of vibration of the diaphragm of 512 double vibrations per
second.     I  will, however, mention a few made with varying rates of
vibration, and as I propose in a future paper to give a more extended
series of observations through a wider range : I will confine myself
to these examples.

   The diagram shows the results obtained on iron wires of different
diameters ; their stable and variable resistance were all reduced to
comparative values, the stable resistance being taken as 100.                             Three
telephones were employed, the first having the musical note of G or

 1886.]       On the Self-induction   of an Electric  Current.         463
 768 double vibrations, the second C sharp or 576 double vibrations,
and the third, one octave below the first or G 384 double vibrations
per second.
   It will be seen that a great change in the variable resistance takes
place in the range of a simple octave, and that the fall from the wires
of 6 mm. to that of 1 mm. is so regular as to be almost a continuous
curve, and the total curve would be probably that taken by the wire
of 6 mm. in its approach to its stable resistance.     If this is the case,
as future researches may show, then the resistance of this wire with
the comparatively slow contact speed of six per second would still
have 14 per cent. higher resistance in the variable than in the stable
period, or an ordinary Morse telegraph instrument working at a slow
speed of only eleven words per minute would experience this addi
tional resistance ; consequently this effect should be easy to prove by
the ordinary methods with galvanometers, and this can be accom
plished as soon as we have found a method of completely separating
the extra current from that due to the increased resistance, as     I have
                                                     I
already succeeded in doing by the method which have described.
   The iron wire of 6 mm. diameter shows for a speed of 384 contacts
per second a comparative resistance in the variable period of 638, or
more than six times its stable resistance, but with 192 contacts per
second its resistance is but 371 ; the fall of resistance is so rapid here
that for a single octave difference in the telephones, the fall is far
greater than the whole stable resistance.     The extra current, as well
known, is proportional to the length of contact for fine wires, but in
large wires the curve indicates that the extra currents have a local
reaction on the cessation of the primary current.

   The remarkable phenomenon wherein a non-magnetic metal such as
                                    "
copper shows a higher " variable resistance when under the influence
of an external coating of iron than a wire of solid iron (and this not
withstanding that the resistance of the side of the bridge is kept a
constant or by balancing its resistance on the opposite side GD as
mentioned) seemed worthy of experimental research.
   Experiments were made in order to find what form of conductor
would give the maximum increased resistance in the variable period,
      I
and found that an external tube of iron insulated from its central
core produced this effect, for if the tube was not insulated but joined
in electrical contact the results were reduced, due I believe to a
transversal neutralisation taking place in its own portion of the wire,
as I have mentioned in my reply to the discussion on my first
paper.

the magnetic reaction of the tube upon the primary current passing in
the wire produces a marked effect upon the different metals, the
force of the extra currents as measured by the induction balance rise
in value from 82 to 410, this being a constant for all metals except
iron, which alone shows the higher force of 615 ; the force of the extra
currents, however,            has no direct relation to the extra resistance
shown in the variable period, but the latter must be in direct relation
with the duration or length of time required to pass from an infinite
to the stable resistance.
    The table shows on comparing the resistance of a metal in its stable
period with that found in the variable, that copper has the highest
percentage of increased resistance, being 600 per cent. increase, or
seven times that found for its stable resistance, each metal in the
order of their specific resistance having a less percentage of increased
resistance until we arrive at the German silver wire, which shows only
36 per cent. against the 600 per cent.               of the copper ; we have also here
the     remarkable       fact   that   iron    even   with a circular section stands
simply in its order of specific resistance, showing only one-sixth of the
increased resistance experienced                    by copper;       the percentage           of
increased resistance            of  a   metal     when     under   the     influence     of an
insulated magnetic sheath is directly as its conductivity or inversely
as its specific resistance.
     If we regard the phenomenon from a different point of view,
confining ourselves simply to the additional resistance above that of
its specific stable resistance, all metals whether magnetic or non

  1886.J        On the Self-induction   of  an Electric  Current.       465
  magnetic have an almost invariable quantity dependent entirely upon
  the coefficient of the electromagnetic action of the iron tube, and
  independent of the resistance or nature of the wire.
     The experiments with an insulated iron sheath may be considered
 as a forced condition which does not occur or need not be taken into
  account, but the reaction        of the iron tube is evidently electro
  magnetic,   and   as  our  atmosphere is also magnetic, we may assume
 that its reaction would be similar though in a far less degree to that
  which I have shown.
                                Submarine Cables.
     The influence of a magnetic sheath upon an external insulated
  wire is one of vast practical importance in relation to our electrical
  submarine cables, as they are all constructed with an insulated wire
 surrounded by a spiral sheath of exterior iron wires. In order to
 study this question     I made several cables of short lengths (1 metre)
 and found (most fortunately for our practical applications) that when
 the exterior iron sheath is divided as in a cable, or when the sheath
 consists of several large wires in close contact, that its effects are
 reduced to a mere fraction of what it would be if the external sheath
  was a continuous tube ; this is entirely due (as      I have shown in the
 case of stranded wires as compared with solid) to the imperfect
 formation of circular magnetism.         I will cite a few examples illus
 trating   this :  a   cable  was  formed   of a similar copper wire and
 insulation to that shown in Table III, the iron tube being replaced by
 eight iron wires (of 2 mm. diameter each) wound with a slight spiral
 of five turns per metre, this showed but 100 per cent, increase in the
 force of the extra currents against 400 per cent. increase when the
same wire was in the iron tube ; the increased resistance in the
 variable period was but 50 per cent. against 600 per cent. for the iron
 tube, or only one-twelfth of the additional resistance caused by the
tube ; these wires were replaced by galvanised iron wire which
prevented magnetic contact, and the variable resistance became much
less, and when these were replaced by numerous fine iron wires the
effect was reduced to the minimum found, or only 20 per cent.
increased resistance in the variable period, or 30 times less than that
of a solid iron tube of much less iron.
    It is therefore evident that the circular magnetism plays an
important role, and that most fortunately our cable manufacturers
(without knowing the immense reaction which would be produced by
a continuous      sheath   of iron) have constructed our cables with a
protection of     iron   divided  into several iron wires instead of a
continuous iron sheath ; there are, however, many telegraph lines
which in passing through tnnnels use a continuous iron tube as the
    VOl. Xl.                                                      2 I

effects that         I  have shown to be caused by the reaction of circular

     It    is well known that a coil of wire                has a higher self-induction

induction when we introduce an iron core.                       I  have made, however, a
series of experiments in order to measure the influence of a core upon
the resistance in the variable period, and also note the influence

      A helix        was formed      of an insulated silk-covered copper wire of
 24      single layers, having an interior diameter of 2 cm., the object
 being to form a coil having as little mutual induction as possible, but
 which would be readily acted upon by any core of metal introduced ;
 and in order to measure the high forces obtained an induction balance
 of great power and range was used, the method, however, being the
 same as        that already described.
       The helix alone showed an induction value for its extra currents of

460, and    a feeble increased   resistance  in the variable period of bin
 10 per cent. ;  if we now introduce a core of solid copper of 1'75 cm.
diameter and 5      cm. long, a great change takes place both in the force
of the extra currents      and the resistance in the variable period, the
extra currents fall in value from 460 to 352, whilst the extra resis
tance is increased to 52 per cent, above that of the stable period ; we
have here a double and contrary effect, the reduction of the force of
the extra currents and the increase in the resistance cannot be due to
the magnetic nature of copper, but must be due to the induced or so-
                               "
called " Foucault currents       circulating in the core ; to prove this the
core was replaced by another similar in every respect but cut longi
tudinally to its centre, the currents now ceased to circulate, and the
copper core had not the slightest effect either on the extra currents
or the variable resistance ; this is shown in the table, where for
greater precautions a core of insulated copper wires replaced the
solid core. Evidently the induced current in the core was the cause
of the extra resistance ; work was done by the primary current, and
a loss of energy at the expense of the electromotive force of the extra
currents, but in doing this work a resistance was produced which was
no doubt caused by the currents circulating in the core. These
currents required time, passing through the variable stage and thus
producing from their electromagnetic inertia an equivalent reaction
and electromagnetic inertia in the primary coil itself.           That this
inertia is due to the electromagnetic character of the current and not
to an electric current considered apart, is proved by the fact (which I
have verified) that when we coil a wire into a coil of several super
posed layers, its electromagnetic reactions introduce a measurable
resistance in the variable period precisely similar though feebler than
that which would be produced by the reaction on the conductor of a
magnetic body such as iron.
   The effect of a solid iron core and a bundle of iron wires on the
increase of the force of the extra currents is well known, but the
table shows an interesting result as to their effects on the variablo
resistance;    the solid iron core shows a very high force of extra
currents produced by its magnetic reaction on the wires of the helix,
the resistance in the variable period has increased 275 per cent., and
its extra currents are extremely high, as we should expect; now if the
extra resistance is due to magnetic reaction alone it should increase
when we are enabled to increase this reaction, but if it is due in
greater part to the electromagnetic inertia of electric currents circu
lating in the bar, then by preventing these currents from being formed
 (as we did in the case of copper) we should greatly reduce the extia
resistance.     This proved to be the case, for on replacing the solid iron
core by a bundle of fine iron wires the force of the extra currents rose
from 2338 to 5360, or more than double the force of that produced by
                                                                2 i 2

a solid bar,  whilst the resistance in the variable period fell from 275
to but 69 per cent.
   It is well known that a bnndle of fine wires magnetises quicker than
a solid bar, and this may have had its effect, although not more
important than the suppression of the eddy currents, as the latter may
be the cause of the former.       The table shows that where we have
suppressed these currents as far as possible by introducing a core of
insulated wires containing less iron than in the previous experiment
but fully insured against eddy currents, the induction was the highest
and the resistance the lowest yet found for a helix containing an iron
core ; the experiment proves to my mind that the extra resistance
found in the three last experiments is due both to the electromagnetic
inertia of the eddy currents, and the inertia of the magnetic molecules
of iron.
    The experiments     related in this paper have been most carefully
made and verified, and from the ease and certain action as well as the
invariable results obtained by the method which          I have described,
they should be easy to repeat by others.
    If we regard the whole of these researches we cannot fail to notice
certain important laws which act in the greater portion of them.           I
have shown : 1st. That the contiguous portions of the same current
react upon each other in the interior of its own portion of the con
ductor similar to their known exterior reactions on separate portions
of the same conductor.       2nd. That the coefficient of mutual induction
is less in iron than copper wires, but that their coefficient is the same
when the conductor is in the form of a ribbon.        3rd. That the induc
tive capacity  of  different  metals depends on their specific resistance,
on their electromagnetic capacity for circular magnetism, and on the
geometrical form of their conductors.           4th. That the inductive
capacity of a conductor of magnetic metal is dependent upon the for
mation of circular magnetism and not upon its internal magnetic
permeability.     5th. That a magnetic metal can be rendered equally
free from circular magnetism as the non-magnetic metals. 6th. That
we have experimental evidence of electromagnetic           inertia and the
deleterious effects of eddy currents in the cores of electromagnets.
   In addition to the above effects, we have the discovery of a large
increase in the ohmic resistance during the variable period, allowing
us to demonstrate and measure the gradual rise of an electric current
in its conductor.

IX.    " Contribution to the Study of Intestinal Rest and Move
       ment."    By J. Theodore Cash, M.D. Communicated by
       T. Lauder Brunton, M.D., F.R.S.                Received May 25,
       1886.
                                (Abstract.)
   Experiments were made upon a dog in which a Weller's fistula had
been established.    The length of the isolated intestine (upper part of
the jejunum) was 18'5 cm.
    By merely observing the mouths of the fistula, it was ascertained
that during a condition of hunger, periods of complete quiescence,
varying from two to twelve minutes, occur.           At any time, however,
contractions having a very regular rhythm, might make themselves
manifest.     On food being presented to the animal, immediately after
swallowing and for some time after ingestion the movements became
much more active and persistent.       Some hours (four to five) after a
full meal they fell to their minimum.
   For the closer study of the speed of transit of a solid or semi-solid
body through the fistula, travelling sounds connected with a regis
tering apparatus were employed.        Compressible but fixed sounds for
the study of local contraction were also used.         The most important
results obtained were the following : —
    1. That the act of swallowing, whether empty, i.e., produced by
external friction of the larynx, or of liquids, is frequently succeeded by
contraction, sometimes by distinct peristalsis of the intestine.      Inha
                                                 —
lation of sulphuric ether for a few seconds which causes abundant
salivation and deglutition — is almost invariably followed by active
intestinal contraction.
   2. Mental impressions, tickling the walls of the abdomen or the
application of cold to them, are amongst the causes of contraction of
the small intestine.
   3. An unfailing means of producing well-marked peristaltic con
traction is the administration of food to the fasting animal.      Not only
does   this  cause the  individual  contractions   to  ensue  with  greater
regularity and force than before, but they have less of the pendulum
character (contraction succeeded by complete relaxation), and during
the pauses the travelling sound is so effectually "gripped" that it

recedes but little, and     is therefore forwarded throngh the fistula
with great rapidity.       For a varying time after a full meal (two to
three hours), the progress of a body is steady and moderately rapid ;
after that time it usually becomes much slower.
   The following figures give an approximate idea of the speed of
transmission under various conditions    : —
Fasting —
   1 cm. of fistulous intestine traversed in 2 to 4'.
Immediately after a meal —
   Ditto in 30 to 40".
Several hours after a meal (4 or 5) —
   Ditto in some instances 1 cm. only in 10'.
   4. Propulsion of a solid body is in the physiological direction.
   5. The introduction of water or bodies in a state of solution into
the fistulous intestine is succeeded by a constant and peculiar modi
fication of the peristalsis which may be present at the time.
   6.  Exercise of slight traction upon the travelling body renders its
passage difficult or impossible, although it calls into play powerful
and "griping" contractions of the intestine.
   7. Exercise is highly favourable to a rapid and effective peristalsis.
   8. Mechanical irritation (as the licking of the mouth of the fistula
by the rough tongue of a dog) causes powerful co-ordinate movement.
   9. The effect of electrical stimulation, and the action of a large
number    of drugs have been examined, the results      obtained  will   be
made the object of a further communication.

some others, had that afternoon witnessed the experiment.

       to the Morphology of the Vascular System in the Verte-

       of Biology in the University of Otago, N.Z. Communicated
       by Professor *M. Foster, Sec. R.S. Received June 4, 1886.
                                 (Abstract.)
    The paper describes in detail the arteries and veins of Mustelus
 antarcticus, comparing them with those of other elasmobranchs, and
 with the embryonic trunks of the vertebrata generally.
    As far as the author's resources would allow, the synonymy of the
principal vessels is given.
    The paper is illustrated by four quarto plates, and two diagrams in
 the text; the figures are, as a rule, made by combining the results of
several dissections ; the topographical relations of the chief vessels
are shown in drawings of transverse sections of a frozen specimen.
    The account of the vessels in Mustelus is supplemented by reference
 to the chief vascular trunks in the embryo of Scymuus of " Stage O
                                                                           "
 (Balfour) ; several sections of this embryo are figured.
    The blood is taken from the heart to the gills by five pairs of
 afferent branchial arteries, one for the hyoidean demibranch       or half-
 gill, and  one  for  each of the holobranchs  or complete gills   borne  by
 the first four branchial arches.
    The blood is returned from the gills by nine pairs of efferent
 branchial arteries, one for each demibranch ; the two efferent arteries
 of each holobranch are united by two transverse commissures at about
  the middle of their length, and the arteries of the adjacent demibranchs
 of successive gills anastomose dorsally and ventrally, forming loops
 which encircle the internal gill-clefts.
    The anterior efferent artery of each holobranch is the main re-vehent
 trunk of the branchiomere, and is directly continued into an epi-
  branchial artery lying dorsal to the gill ; the posterior efferent artery
 discharges into the epibranchial artery of the next following gill.
    There are thus four pairs of epibranchial arteries belonging to
 branchial arches 1 —4, i.e., formed from the dorsal portions of the
 aortic arches of those branchiomeres.
    The first efferent artery — that of the hyoidean demibranch —
 discharges into the first epibranchial artery, i.e., into the aortic arch
 of the next succeeding branchiomere.

   The dorsal portion of the hyoidean aortic arch (hyoidean epibranchial
artery) is represented by the proximal portion of the posterior carotid
artery and by a delicate vessel proceeding backwards and inwards
from     which, uniting with its fellow of the opposite side, forms
         it,                                                                a
slender median longitudinal trunk, the rudimentary anterior (inter-
hyoidean) portion of the dorsal aorta.
  It   suggested that the original mandibular aortic arch
       is                                                       repreis
sented partly by the pseudobranchial artery which supplies the pseudo-
branch (mandibular gill) and partly by the mandibular artery, which
springs from the ventral end of, and takes a course parallel with, the
first efferent branchial artery.

arches)    and (6) those arising from the dorsal aorta.
            ;
   The anterior carotid artery, formed by the union of the efferent
arterioles of the pseudobranch, supplies the brain and eye, and
anastomoses with the posterior carotid.
   The posterior carotid supplies the orbit, snout, and jaws.
   The mandibular artery supplies the angle of the mouth and the
submental region, and gives off nutrient vessels to the hyoidean
demibranch.
  The subclavian artery— the first vessel springing from the dorsal
aorta — divides into a brachial artery for the pectoral fin, and a hypo-
branchial artery, which unites with its fellow, anastomoses with the
whole  series of efferent branchial arteries,        and gives off coronary,
pericardial, and nutrient branchial arteries.
   The splanchnic arteries consist of a coaliaco-mesenteric, a lieno-
gastric, and anterior and posterior spermatico-mesenteric arteries;

the coronary veins and (e) system of the cutaneous veins.
                        ;
   The caudal vein, on emerging from the hsemal canal, divides into
right and left renal portal veins, which send branches into the kidneys
and receive the posterior spinal and oviducal veins.
  There     a large intra-intestinal vein enclosed in the
                is                                                   free edge
of the spiral valve, and continued directly into the hepatic portal
vein.
   There are two hepatic veins, opening into a large hepatic sinus,
which communicates by two small apertures with the sinus venosus.
  The paired precaval sinuses receive the ugular, the inferior jugular,

and the lateral veins, and are directly continued   one  into each end of
the sinus venosus.
   The jugular veins receive the blood from the orbital and hyoidean
sinuses ; the anterior cerebral and anterior facial veins discharge into
the orbital sinus, the posterior facial and nutrient hyoidean veins
into the hyoidean sinus. The posterior cerebral and myelonal veins
open by numerous commissures into the jugular, cardinal, renal portal,
and caudal veins.
   The inferior jugular receives   a nutrient branchial vein from  each of
the four holobranchs,     and anastomoses in front with the hyoidean
sinus.
   The cardinal veins are asymmetrically developed, only the right
being complete.      The latter arises by the confluence of the efferent
renal veins, and, passing forwards, joins with the left cardinal. Each
vein dilates anteriorly into a cardinal sinus, which communicates with
its fellow by a wide aperture, that of the right side receiving a large
spermatic vein.
   There is a large anastomotic      trunk between the spermatic and
portal veins.
   The lateral vein receives the veins from the pectoral and pelvic fins,
 and unites with its fellow across the dorsal aspect of the pubic
cartilage.
   The lateral vein is considered to be homogeneous with the epigastric
or anterior abdominal vein of amphibia and reptiles ; it is also sug
gested that it may be derived from the vein of the hypothetical
lateral fin of the proto-vertebrata, and possibly also from the primary
lateral vessel of the proto-chordata.    In this connexion some recent
speculations on the phylogeny of the chordata are discussed in their
bearing on the vascular system.
   There are two coronary veins opening into the sinus venosus.
   The cutaneous veins are five in number, a dorsal, an anterior and a
posterior ventral, and a pair of lateral vessels. The dorsal cutaneous
vein opens into the left renal portal, the anterior ventral into the
lateral veins anteriorly and into the iliacs posteriorly, the posterior
ventral into the cloacal veins, and the lateral into the subscapular
sinus.    The dorsal and the posterior ventral vessels form closed loops
round    the bases of the median (first and second dorsal and ventral-
anal)  fins.  The lateral cutaneous vein anastomoses posteriorly with
the caudal and with the dorsal cutaneous vein.
   Attention is drawn to the large number of anastomoses between
important arteries and veins, and to the sinus-like or lacunar
character of many of the venous channels.

   Method of Experimentation is explained in detail, as also the mode of
subdivision of the part of the cortex investigated into centres of
about 2 mm. square.
    From the results of excitation   are then deduced the two following
axioms : —
   Axiom   I. — Viewing  as a whole the  motor area of the cerebral cortex
for the upper limb, as defined by Professor Ferrier, we find that the
regions for the action of the larger joints are situated at the upper
part of the area, i.e., closer to the middle line, while those for the
smaller and more differentiated movements lie peripherally at the
lower part of the area.
   Axiom II. — As a broad result, extension of all the joints is the most
characteristic movement of the upper part of Ferrier's arm centre ;
while flexion is equally characteristic of the movements obtained by
stimulating the lower part. Finally, between these two regions there
is a small portion where flexion and extension alternately predominate,
a condition to which we have given the name of confusion. (Here
both flexors and extensors are contracting at the same time, and
consequently the joint is usually fixed in a neutral position, each

    In the first part of the paper it is shown that the usual investigation
 by which the second variation of an integral is reduced, requires that
the variation given to y (the undetermined function) is such that its
 differential coefficients, taken with regard to « (the independent
 variable)   are continuous    up   to the twice-nth order,      — £ being the
 highest   differential coefficient of y appearing in the function to be
 integrated.     But it is not necessary that the variation should be con
 tinuous beyond its (,— l)th differential coefficient, and a method of
 reducing the variation to Jacobi's form by a process which is not
 open to the above objection is then given ; and the method has the
 additional advantage that its simplicity enables it to be easily
 extended to other cases where there are more than two variables.
    But in dealing with multiple integrals especially, any method
 depending on algebraic transformation is necessarily defective, inas
 much as it is invalid unless solutions, which do not become either
 zero or infinite within the limits of the integration, can be found for
 a number      of simultaneous partial differential equations containing
  at least as many unknown quantities as equations.           It is pointed out
  that it is not in general possible to obtain such solutions, and that
  even when the particular problem is assigned, it would be impracti
  cable to ascertain whether there were such solutions.
     The method given in the second part of the paper does not depend
  on or require any algebraic transformation.         The second variation is

taken in its unreduced    form, and, by considerations    founded on the
degree of continuity required in the variations        of the dependent
variables, it is shown without difficulty that, when the range of integra
tion is small, the sign of the Becond variation is the same as that of a
certain quadratic function. The limits of integration within which
this result is applicable are then determined by considerations de
pending on the continuity of the integrals.
   The following is a brief sketch of the method of obtaining the
quadratic function on which the sign of the second variation depends.

(the form of yu j/2, . . . y» as functions of Sj, x3, . . . x„ having already
been determined by making the first variation vanish). Taking the
second variation by Taylor's theorem, we may write —

when ss and z' typify any of the quantities ylt y2, . . . yn, or their
differential coefficients, and 2 means that all such terms are to be
taken.   Restricting ourselves to the case in which the limits are fixed,
we have Bylt Sy2, . . . $y„ zero at the limits, and similarly any differ

IV. "   On the Anatomy, Histology, and Physiology of the Intra
       ocular Muscles of Mammals." By Walter H. Jessop, M.A.,
       M.B. Cantab., F.R.C.S., Demonstrator of Anatomy at St.
       Bartholomew's Hospital, London, &c. Communicated                  by
      Sir W. Bowman, Bart., F.R.S. Received June 7, 1886.
                                 (Abstract.)
   This research was prompted by the variety of opinions on the
subject of the histology, anatomy, and physiology of the intra-ocular
muscles.
   Owing to the wide range of the subject        I have been obliged to
restrict myself almost entirely to the action of these muscles in
mammals.
   Most of the experiments have been on rabbits, dogs, or cats, and
numerous observations, especially on the histology and action of the
ciliary muscle, have been on human eye3. The animals experimented
on have always been completely anaesthetised.
   The subject has been divided into three chief parts —
   I. The anatomy and histology ; II. The physiology           ;   III. The
action of cocaine, atropine and eserine, both singly and in combina
tion.
   I. The anatomy of the intra-ocular muscles has been considered
as to   (1) the muscular tissue, (2) the nerves, (3) the vessels.
    (1.) The muscular tissue.
   A. The Iris consists of a sphincter muscle.
    This muscle in mammals is suspended to the ciliary border by a pos
terior limiting membrane of elastic tissue.    I have found no developed
dilator muscle extending from the pupillary to the ciliary border except
in rabbits, and in these animals it is very thin. Koganei says in the
otter, however, it is well developed.
    Any muscular fibres found are in the stroma of the iris in front of
the posterior limiting membrane.
    B. The ciliary muscle consists of unstriped muscle in mammals
attached by a tendon to the sclero-corneal junction, and its fibres
interlace by bundles in every direction, the most developed being the
radial and circular fibres, and the position of the ciliary body
determines the preponderance of so-called radial and circular fibres.
The author is inclined to think from the great variety in length and
development of the longitudinal fibres that they are chiefly attach
ments of the muscle to the elastic tissue of the choroid, and may thus
correspond to the so-called radial fibres of the iris when they exist.
    (2.) The nerves proceeding to the intra-ocular muscles are branches

of (a) the third, (3) the nasal branch of the ophthalmic,       and (7) the
sympathetic.
   as. The nerve to the inferior oblique  muscle from the third nerve
generally gives  off the branch  to  the ophthalmic ganglion, and from
this are given off the short ciliary nerves proceeding to a plexus iu
the ciliary muscle.
  /). The nasal nerve   gives off generally about four long ciliary
branches, which surround the optic nerve, piercing the sclerotic and
going to the plexus before mentioned.
   The nasal also gives off farther forward the long branch to the
ophthalmic ganglion.
   7. The sympathetic or so-called mydriatic nerve of the eye receives
from the lower cervical and upper dorsal part of the spinal cord fibres
generally by the second dorsal nerve. From the second dorsal they
pass to the superior thoracic ganglion of the sympathetic and by the
annulus Vieussenii to the inferior cervical ganglion, then along the
cervical sympathetic to the superior cervical ganglion, and through the
carotid canal to the Gasserian ganglion.       From here they pass by
the nasal branch of the ophthalmic through the long ciliary nerves to
the plexus before described.
   This plexus situated in the ciliary muscle, and containing ganglion
cells, receives fibres from all three nerves from the plexus are given
                                             ;
off branches to the iris and ciliary muscle.
   (3.) A. The arteries of the iris come from the ciliary branches of
the ophthalmic, and are arranged at the ciliary border as the circulas
arteriosus iridis major, and from this are given off radial branches
proceeding towards the sphincter, and forming the circulus arteriosus
minor, which gives branches to the sphincter.    The veins accompany
the arteries.
   B. The arteries of the ciliary body come from the long and anterior
ciliary and form an anastomosis behind the circle for the iris.
   II. The physiological action of the intra-ocular muscles may also
be classified under the headings of (1) the muscular tissue, (2) the
nerves, and (3) the vessels.

   The mydriatic fibres accompanying the sympathetic therefore find

rest of their course, be proved by division of them all, when irritation
of the cervical sympathetic gives rise to no alteration in the pupil.

was dilated to start with, general increase in the mydriasis occurred.
If, however, the pupil were partially contracted by pilocarpin only
half the pupil j-esponded, and      the pupil were more contracted only
                                     if
one-quarter     dilated.
     In birds stimulation of the cervical sympathetic has no effect on
the pupil.

  4. The carotid vessels are constricted            when
                                                   the pupil begins to

  7. Section of the trigeminus in front or behind the Grasserian
ganglion gives rise to myosis which soon passes off.
   Stimulation of the trigeminus generally gives rise to myosis,
which     probably reflex, as on section of the third nerve,

   a.(1.) Stimulation of the third nerve or the short ciliary nerves
gives rise to contraction of the ciliary muscle.
   (2.) Section    of the third     nerve gives rise    to relaxation of the
ciliary muscle.
    /3.   When the ciliary muscle   is   not completely relaxed stimulation of
the long ciliary nerves gives rise to relaxation of the muscle, and in
consequence paresis or paralysis of accommodation.
   Stimulation of the track followed by the cervical sympathetic in
the neck gives rise to no alteration in the ciliary muscle, observed by
the images on the anterior surface of the lens seen through the
phakoscope, therefore the fibres to the ciliary muscle along the long
ciliary nerves must come from another source, and this have little I
doubt      the fifth, but here as with the pupil the difficulty
           is                                                      to      is
prevent the reflex along the third nerve.
   (3.) On section of the cervical sympathetic the arteries of the iris
are dilated.
   On irritation of the cervical sympathetic the arteries of the eye are
contracted.
   On section of the trigeminus there       also dilatation of the blood
                                               is
vessels of the iris and ciliary body according to Rogow.
     The separation of purely mydriatic fibres of the cervical sympa
 thetic from the vaso-constrictor has been already proved.
     The fact of tapping the anterior chamber of          normal or atro-

                                             is
 tension overfilling the arteries of the iris, as proved by an experiment
 cited.
    In an animal bled to death the pupil contracts on faradaising the
 third nerve or its branches the pupil also dilates on stimulating the

    4. Stimulation of third nerve induces myosis in the pupil under
cocaine.
  5. Stimulation of sphincter pupillae easily overcomes the cocaine
mydriasis.
  6. On the exsected eye cocaine induces mydriasis.

   8.  On cocaine mydriasis section of the cervical sympathetic     had no
effect.
   9. In cases of ad maximum cocaine mydriasis, stimulation of the
cervical sympathetic had no effect.
   10. In cases of section for some time of cervical sympathetic cocaine
has no effect on the pupil.
   11. On tapping the anterior chamber of an eye under cocaine there
is very little and often no constriction of the pupil.
   From these data we may conclude that cocaine acts on the endings
of the cervical sympathetic nerve in the eye.
   B. On the Ciliary Muscle. — Cocaine on the ciliary muscle produces
relaxation and paresis, or in some cases paralysis of accommodation,
and it is reasonable to suppose from analogy that it acts here on the
endings of the fifth nerve to the muscle.
   Atropine.    A. On the Pupil. — 1. Atropine produces, in mammals,
mydriasis not acting to light and accommodation.
   2. It has no effect on the pupils of birds.
   3. It only produces a partial mydriasis in rabbits.
   4. It increases the mydriasis     produced by section of the third
nerve, or the short ciliary nerves.
   5. Stimulation of the third nerve has no effect on an atropinised pupil.
   6. The myosis due to section of the cervical sympathetic        is over
come and mydriasis produced by atropine ; this seen even after section
for three months in a rabbit.
   7. Section of the cervical sympathetic    diminishes slightly atropine
mydriasis.
   8.  Stimulation of the cervical sympathetic         increases atropine
mydriasis.
   9. Atropine dilates the pupil after excision of the superior cervical
ganglion.
   10.  Atropine mydriasis increased by stimulating one or more of the
long ciliary nerves.
   11. Atropine mydriasis    increased by faradaising the periphery of
the cornea.
   12. Atropine    mydriasis diminished somewhat by cutting the
trigeminus.
   13. Section of the trigeminus and atropine subsequently put in the
eye produced mydriasis.
   14. Section of the trigeminus and the third nerve, and instillation
of atropine followed by mydriasis.
   15. In an ordinary atropine mydriasis direct electrical stimulation
of the sphincter produces myosis, but if the pupil be completely under
atropine stimulation of the sphincter has no effect.
   16. Czermak cut away the cornea, letting out the contents of the
anterior chamber, and on adding atropine produced mydriasis.

   B. On the Ciliary Muscle. — On the ciliary muscle atropine pro
duces relaxation, and if used for a long time complete paralysis.
   From the above experiments on atropine, and the fact that else
where atropine paralyses the unstriped muscular tissue of the body, it
may be assumed that it acts so on the intra-ocular muscles.
   The effect of section of the cervical sympathetic and trigeminus,
preventing extreme atropine mydriasis, may be explained by their
effect on the blood-vessels producing turgescence of the iris, and
therefore acting against the elastic recoil of the sphincter.

   2. It contracts the pupil of an animal            after section of the
third nerve or short ciliary nerves.
   3. In full eserine myosis faradaic excitation of the third nerve does
not increase the contraction of the pupil.
   4. Section of the fifth nerve in front of the Gasserian ganglion, and
on putting eserine into the eye the pupil contracts as usual.
   5. Faradaic stimulation of the cervical sympathetic            overcomes
eserine myosis    if partial, but if complete it has no effect.
   6. Cut cervical sympathetic in the neck and eserine still induces
myosis, even after the section has been made three months.
   7. For an animal bled to death I have seen eserine induce myosis.
   B. On tlxe Ciliary Muscle. — Eserine produces contraction of the
ciliary muscle, giving rise to spasm of accommodation.
   In   cases of palsy of the third nerve eserine induces contraction of
the ciliary   muscle.
   The action of eserine on the intra-ocular muscles can be explained
by its stimulating directly the muscular tissue.
   The antagonism of atropine, eserine, and cocaine is next discussed,
and found to agree with the action attributed to each alkaloid.
    Conclusion. — From consideration of the foregoing experiments and
observations the writer describes the intra-ocular muscular system as
consisting of two circular muscles, the pupillary and ciliary. These
are supplied, the firstsby three nerves, the third, the cervical sympa
thetic, and the fifth, and the second by the third nerve and the fifth.
   The muscles are capable of extreme relaxation and contraction,
owing to the elastic supports they have.
   Section of a nerve producing contraction does not give rise to com
plete contraction of the muscle, nor does section of a nerve producing
relaxation have as a sequel complete relaxation.
                                                                2 K 2

   The state of the muscle after section of its nerves is that of
" tonus."
   Atropine by acting directly on the unstriped muscular tissue, and
paralysing      it,
                can produce a greater dilatation than mere section of
the third nerve, and so also on section of the third nerve eserine
directly stimulating the muscular fibre gives rise to extreme
contraction.
   The intra-ocular muscles therefore have     similar anatomical, histo

logical, and physiological action, and they also are associated together
during the act of accommodation.      The pupil contracts on accommo
dating, and dilates on relaxation of the ciliary muscle the former            ;

the nasal branch of the fifth.
    The ordinary light reflex of the pupil takes place by the third, as
the motor nerve, and the cervical sympathetic as the inhibitory nerve
giving rise to dilatation of the pupil. The two chief actions of the
pupillary muscle are thus divided off from one another in mammals.
 In birds possessing voluntary control over their irides this     not so,         is
 and  the cervical sympathetic has  no  power  over the pupil, the nerve
 producing dilatation of the pupil being the trigeminus.
V. " On the Place of Origin of Uric Acid in the Animal Body."
      By Alfred Baring                        Garrod,        M.D.,     F.R.S.     Received
      June      8,
            1886.
                                          (Abstract.)
   The endeavour of the author in this communication has been to
show the place of origin of uric acid in the animal body, and to
ascertain which of the two hypotheses on the subject     correct, viz.,      is
whether uric acid   first present in the blood and then secreted from
                         is
the blood by the kidneys, or whether           formed by the kidneys
                                                        it   is
themselves.   To enable him to satisfactorily prosecute many of his
observations, the author has devised               a   new method      for discovering the
presence of uric acid in very minute quantities of blood.
   The results of his investigations are embodied in the form of the
nine following propositions          :   —
   Prop.    — Uric acid
           I.            secreted by the kidneys as ammonium urate,
                               is
               and in the case of birds and reptiles, whose urine                        is
                      semi-solid,   itfound in a definite physical form, more
                                         is
                      in the vitreous condition than in the truly crystalline
                      shape.
   Prop.   II. — Uric     acid, when present in the blood,             is   found under the

 1886.J        Origin    of Uric Acid in       the Animal Body.             485
                 form of sodium       urate,    and, when   deposited from the
                 blood during life in any tissue, it    is also as sodium urate
                 in its characteristic crystalline form.
   Prop. III. — The daily quantity of uric acid in relation to their
                 body-weights secreted by different animals varies ex
                 tremely.    In  some,    as the carnivorous     mammalia,   the
                 ratio may be less than      1 to 1,000,000, whereas, in others,
                 as  birds, it may be       as   1 to 85.   In man it may be
                 regarded as about     1 to 120,000.
   Prop.  IV. — The     quantity of uric acid contained in the blood of
                 different animals has little relation to that secreted by
                 the kidneys.       In birds, secreting daily so large a
                 quantity,  the   blood   is often found to be as free from
                 uric acid as it is in animals whose daily elimination of
                 uric acid is excessively small.
    Prop. V. — When uric acid is absorbed from the alimentary canal
                 the blood becomes strongly impregnated, and, in fact,
                 often almost saturated with it, so that its presence is
                 readily discovered by any ordinary test.
   Prop. VI. — One cause of the appearance of an unusual quantity of
                uric acid in the blood of birds in health is the presence
                of uric acid in the water they drink, and occasionally in
                their solid food.
   Prop. VII. — When uric acid is taken into the stomach of man, or
                 other animals, the secretion of this principle from the
                kidneys is not increased, although at the time the blood
                may be rich in it.
   Prop. VIII. — Uric acid is found in varying quantities in the blood
                obtained from different veins in the same animal.          It is
                found in larger quantity in that from the efferent renal
                veins of birds than in that from the portal afferent, or
                from the jugular veins ; and the same test which freely
                exhibits uric acid in the blood from the former, often
                fails to show it at all in that from the latter two.
             —
   Prop. IX. The quantity of uric acid secreted daily by the kidneys
                of a bird is in close relation to the quantity of nitrogen-
                ised food taken during the time.
   Having    brought forward proofs to confirm these propositions
severally, the author draws the following conclusion, viz., that every
argument is in favour of the hypothesis that uric acid is formed by
the kidney-cells, in the form of ammonium urate, and that the traces
of sodium m-ate ordinarily found in the blood are the result of a
necessary absorption, slight in amount, of the ammonium urate from
the kidneys into the blood, and its subsequent conversion by that fliid
into sodium urate.

VI. "      On the Lifting Power           of Electromagnets and the Mag
       netisation of Iron." By            Shelford Bidwell, M.A., LL.B.
       Communicated by Lord               Rayleigh, Sec. R.S. Received
       June       1, 1886.
    I believe      that no very recent investigations have been made with
reference to the maximum lifting power which an electromagnet is
capable of exerting, and the experiments conducted by Joule between
the years 1839 and 1852 still form the basis of most of our practical
knowledge on the subject.*
    It   is a matter of common experience that if an electromagnet be
excited by a gradually increasing current a limit is soon reached,
beyond which the ratio of increase of sustaining power to increase of
current becomes rapidly smaller ; and it has generally been assumed
that this ratio continues to diminish indefinitely, so that an infinite
current would not impart to a magnet much greater lifting power
than that which it possesses when an approach to saturation is first
indicated.
    Joule, after having shown by experiment that the power of an
electromagnet varies as its sectional area, expressed the opinion that
" no force of current could give an attraction equal to 200 lbs. per
                                                            J
square inch," t and much later Rowland stated, as a probable result
of his well-known researches in magnetic permeability,                       that the
greatest weight which could be sustained by an electromagnet with an
infinite current was, for good but not pure iron, 177 lbs. per square
inch, or 12,420 grams per square centimetre of section.
    It has long been known that when an iron rod is magnetised its
length is in general slightly increased.              Some experiments on this
effect of magnetisation, an account of which has been given in two
papers recently communicated to the Royal Society, § show that if the
magnetisation          is carried beyond the point at which the magnetic
elongation         of the  rod reaches a maximum, the length of the rod,
instead of remaining unchanged, steadily diminishes, the curve ex
pressing the relation between the length and the magnetising force
descending in a perfectly straight line which within the limit of the
experiments shows no tendency to become horizontal.                     Some further
experiments (not yet published)            have   also   been  made    with    rings of
iron instead of rods, and effects of precisely the same character were

obtained. The diameter of a ring was found to be increased by a
comparatively small magnetising current, and diminished by a strong
one. Now the retraction in question does not begin to occur until
after the stage of magnetisation, loosely called the " saturation point,"
has been passed, when, according to the common belief, the magneti
*ation of the iron has practically reached a limit, and is not sensibly
affected by any further increase of the magnetic force; and hence
arises a difficulty in accounting for the phenomenon.             The most
obvious method of explaining the retraction is to assume that under
the influence of increasing currents the magnetic attraction of the
particles of the iron towards one another is increased, and thus the
rod becomes compressed. But this cannot be the case if the magnetic
condition of the iron has become constant and independent of the
magnetising current.         And a similar objection will apply to any
hypothesis      which  assumes   (as   I think all must) that some pro
perty of the iron dependent upon its magnetic condition varies in a
sensible degree with the magnetising force after the " saturation
        " has been
point                passed.
    I was  led by considerations of this nature to the belief that it would
be desirable to make some experiments with the view of ascertaining
whether the lifting power and general magnetic condition of an iron
rod are as nearly uniform under strong magnetising forces as is com
monly supposed. Two pieces of apparatus were therefore prepared.
The first consisted of a rod of iron hooked at each end and divided
transversely in the middle, together with a long solenoid, inside which
the divided rod could be placed. The second was an iron ring cut into
two equal parts each of which was encircled with a coil of insulated
copper wire. In both cases the construction was such that an intense
magnetic force could be produced with comparatively small battery
power.     The divided ring could be used either as a semicircular elec
tromagnet with a semicircular armature, or, if the current were passed
through both coils, as two semicircular electromagnets.
   Merely to test the hypothesis of Joule and Rowland, two or three
determinations     were made of the weight which could be sustained
when the current was caused to circulate around one only of the semi
circles, the other being used as an armature.        With a current of 4-3
amperes     the  weight supported    was  13,100  grams per square centi
metre of surface ; with a current of 6-2 amperes the weight supported
was 14,200 grams per square centimetre.           In the latter case, there
fore, the lifting power exceeded that which both Joule and Rowland
considered the greatest that could be imparted to a magnet by an
infinite current.     Had it been worth while to incur the risk of
injury to the insulation of the coil, there is no doubt whatever that
by applying stronger currents the lifting power might have been
carried still further' — for there was no indication that a limit was

 488            Mr. S. Bidwell.       On  the  Lifting Forcer of     [June 10,
 being approached.       But it was of greater interest to study the effects
 produced when both portions of the ring or of the rod were under the
 direct influence of the magnetising coil.
    The first experiment was made with the divided rod.             One portion
 was supported by means of its hook in a vertical position ; a scale-pan
 was attached to the hooked end of the other portion, and the flat ends
 of the two were brought into contact and surrounded by the solenoid.
 Currents of gradually increasing strength were then caused to pass
 through the solenoid, and note was taken of the greatest weight
 which could in each case be placed in the scale-pan without tearing
 asunder the ends of the two rods.          The general results are briefly as
follow  : — When the intensity      of  the field at the junction had reached
 about 50 C.G.S units, the weight supported was nearly 7000 grams
 per square centimetre of the section of the rod. After this value was
exceeded it became quite evident that the weight which could be
 sustained was increasing more slowly than the magnetising current,
and the proportionate increase became rapidly smaller as the current
was made stronger.        This state of things continued until the intensity
of the field was about 270 units, when the weight supported amounted
to 10,800 grams per square centimetre of section. But from this point
onwards the magnetising current and the weight that could be curried
 increased in exactly the same proportion.         The rate of increase of the
load was, indeed, comparatively small, but it was perfectly constant,
and continued so until the field had attained            the high intensity of
 1074 C.G.S. units.      Here the experiment was stopped, the greatest
 weight supported having been 15,100 grams per square centimetre.
    On account of some uncertainty as to the possible influence of the
 external ends of the divided rod, it was thought desirable to make the
 experiment with the divided ring, the current being caused to pass in
 the same direction through the coils surrounding both portions.           The
 general character of the results was the same as before, but the
 weight supported per unit of area was from first to last somewhat
 greater.    The falling off in the rate of increase of the lifting power
 was well marked when the intensity of the magnetic force had
 reached 50 C.G.S. units, at which point the weight sustained was about
 10,000 grams per square centimetre.            And it continued to diminish
until the magnetic force was 250 units and the weight supported
 14,000 grams.      From this point the increments of lifting power and
 of magnetic force appeared to be exactly proportional, and continued
to be so until the magnetic force had been carried up to 585 units,
when the limit of the battery power was reached and the experiment
stopped, the maximum weight supported having been 15,905 grams
per square centimetre or 226-3 lbs. per square inch.*

     I proceed   to describe the experiments         in greater detail.
     For several reasons it appeared desirable that the apparatus should
  be on as small a scale as conveniently possible.            Accordingly,     I chose
 for the rods a piece of iron wire, the diameter of which                as measured
 by   a micrometer gauge was 2 64 mm. The length of each rod was
  12 cm. when straight, and 10-5 cm. when one end had been bent into
  the form of a hook.           The flat ends were rendered as true as was
 possible by means of a lathe with a slide rest, but they were not
 ground. The bobbin consisted of a brass tube 4 mm. in internal
 diameter and 112 mm. in length fitted with ebonite ends. Around
 this insulated copper wire, 0'7 mm. in diameter, was wound in nine
 layers, each layer containing 104 turns.             The internal diameter of the
 coil of wire was 6 mm., its external diamater 21 mm., and its length
 between the ebonite ends 99 mm.                The magnetic field at its centre
 produced by     a  current   of  C amperes was therefore
                 I*
           4"- X       104
                            cos 7° 41'    X 10 C  =    118  C very nearly.
 The coil was fixed in a vertical position beneath a small table.                  One
 of the iron rods was passed into the coil through a hole in the table
 and suspended by its hooked end from a horizontal brass bar, the
 height of which was so adjusted that the flat end of the iron was
 exactly in the centre of the coil.               A scale-pan for carrying the
 weights was attached to the hook of the other iron rod. Around
 each rod near the flat end two or three layers of paper were gummed,
 of sufficient thickness to serve as a guide and ensure that the two
 ends should meet concentrically inside the coil, but not so thick as to
 cause any material friction.
    The source of electricity was a battery of 27 Grove cells, and the
 strength of the current was varied by varying the number of cells in
 use, or when there was only one cell by inserting resistance.                    The
 current was measured by a tangent galvanometer of Helmholtz's
pattern (by Elliott), having two rings of thick copper wire. With
the stronger currents the heating effect was found to be so great that
the circuit could not be kept closed for more than a fraction of a
second.      This of course did not allow sufficient time to make a
galvanometer reading.           A spiral of bare German silver wire was
therefore provided of the same resistance as the coil when cold,
through which the eurrent could be diverted by means of a switch,
and the galvanometer reading leisurely made.
    The method of proceeding was as follows : — A. certain number of
battery cells having been arranged so that they could be thrown into
(iee Tabic II, cols. 1 and 2), it appears that the lifting power due to the magnetisa
tion of the iron only was 14,993 grams per square centimetre, or 213'3 lbs. por
square inch. — [July 1, 1886.]

circuit with the coil by depressing a key, the rod carrying the scale-
pan was introduced into the coil and held in contact with the fixed
rod.   Weights were then placed in the scale-pan and the key momen
tarily depressed, the lower rod at the same time being left free to hang
or to drop ; and this operation was repeated with various weights in
multiples of 10 grams until it was found that the further addition of
10 grams was sufficient to detach the two rods from each other.        A
record having been made of the greatest weight which was supported,
the current was switched through the German silver wire and a
galvanometer reading was made with the current both direct and
reversed.    The same process was gone through with currents of
different strength until the whole number of 27 battery cells had been
used.
   The results, of the experiment are given in Table I, the first column
of which shows the intensity of the magnetic field at the centre of
the coil, and the second the weight supported per square centimetre

     A point marked on the curve indicates the magnetic force under
  which in some experiments with a rod of the same iron retraction
  began.    The point corresponding with the maximum magnetic force
  reached in Rowland's experiments is also marked.
      The ring was made of very soft charcoal iron rod 6-4 mm. in
   thickness, the joint being carefully welded.     It was turned in a lathe
   to a uniform circular section, and when finished its external diameter
   was 8 cm., and the diameter of its transverse section 4'82 mm.        The
  ring was sawn into two equal portions, and the cut faces ground as
  flat as possible, first with fine emery, and afterwards with rottenstone.

   But was unable to get rid of a very slight convexity which, though
  it perhaps affected the permeability of the ring, was of some advan
  tage in preventing the possibility of complications arising from non
  magnetic adhesion.       Upon the ends of one-half of the ring pieces of
  thin brass tube 5 mm. in length were fitted : these projected 1 mm.
  beyond the faces, forming shallow sockets into which the ends of the
  other portion of the ring could be inserted, thus insuring exact
  coincidence of the cut surfaces.        Each half of the ring was then
  covered with ten layers of insulated wire 0-7 mm. in thickness, the
  radial gaps in every layer being filled with paraffin wax before a new
  layer was wound on. The number of turns of wire upon the portion
  having the brass tubes was 980, and upon the other portion, the ends
  of which protruded about 1*2 mm. beyond the wire, 949. The total

 number of turns was, therefore, 1929, and when the two halves were
fitted together the coil was practically continuous.
     The mean radius of the divided ring being 3-76 cm., its mean cir
cumference is 23"6 cm.             Hence the magnetic force produced by a
current through the coil of C amperes = 102"7 C.
     The experiment was made in the same manner as before, but the
length of the wire contained in the ring-coil was about twice the
length of that in the straight solenoid, and in consequence of the
increased resistance thus introduced and other differences in the con
ditions of the arrangement, the greatest magnetic force which could
be produced by the whole battery of 27 cells did not exceed 585 units.
 On the other hand, it was found possible to obtain satisfactory results
with smaller currents than could be used in the former case. When
the magnetic force was less than 40 units the residual or permanent
magnetism of the divided rod seriously interfered with the observa
tions ; but in the experiment with the divided ring, owing partly
perhaps to the superior quality of the iron, and partly to the difference
of the arrangement, the magnetic force could be diminished to about
4 units before the residual magnetism began to be troublesome.*
    The results of the experiment are given in the third and fourth
columns of Table I, and plotted in fig. 1 as a curve which from
|J=240 is sensibly a straight line represented by W=53 |S+ 12,800.
     It occurred to me that if an expression could be found which
would satisfactorily connect the magnetic force and the weight lifted
with the magnetic intensity of the iron ring, the results above
obtained might be applied to the investigation of the changes of
magnetisation which correspond to changes of magnetic force.!                      The
common belief that at a comparatively early stage the intensity of
magnetisation becomes sensibly constant is, I imagine, founded rather
upon inference than upon actual observation.                   At all events,    I   am
acquainted with no experiments bearing upon the subject which have
been made with magnetic forces at all comparable in magnitude with
those used by myself.
    If  from   a  portion of a magnet in which the direction and intensity
of the magnetisation are uniform there be hollowed out a cavity in
the form of a thin disk whose plane is normal to the direction of
magnetisation,        a unit magnetic pole at the middle of the axis
experiences a force 4wl dne to the attraction of the superficial
magnetism of the disk on the positive side, and the equal repulsion
   *  If it did in fact exert any material influence before this point was reached, the
effect was at all events uniform, and not apparently capricious.
   t  The   expression    used  by Rowland      in the  paper   before  referred  to   is
W   =
       Q3/24655O000O kilograms per square centimetre, which translated into G.G.S.
units and the ordinary notation, becomes ~W=^j8irff grams per square centimetre.
This is clearly erroneous.

of the superficial magnetism of the disk on the negative side.* In
calculating the force upon unit of area of one surface of the disk
itself, we must omit the half due to the surface in question.                       Thus
the    force   becomes   2jtI2  per unit  of  area   of surface.      To  this   must  be
added the force due to the mutual action of the coil and the iron

     If, therefore, W=the grams weight supported per unit of area, we
have for the divided ring —

    In connexion with the well-known experiments and views of
Professor Rowland, the figures thus obtained are of the highest
interest.   In order to exhibit the results of his experiments in the
form of a curve which (as he believed) would be of finite dimensions,
Rowland adopted the method of plotting the values of            as ordinates   fi
against those of       as abscissae,
                         s3          and thus obtained  the curve shown by
a  dotted line in fig.    which
                              2,     taken from his paper. The curve was
                                          is
carried by actual experiment as far as the point marked X, before
reaching which       had apparently become an almost perfectly straight
                        it
line. Rowland, therefore, assumed that the line would continue to
be straight until       met the horizontal axis at
                        it                             point    the abscissa
                                                                    a          C,
of which would indicate the greatest possible value of                for an        £8
infinite magnetic force. He thus arrived at the conclusion that for
ordinary bar iron the maximum of magnetic induction was about

1886.J        Electromagnets and         the   Magnetisation   of Iron.             495
17,500 units. For pure            iron he thought it might reach 18,000, or
even go above that.*
  Now, the magnetic force used in Rowland's experiments was very
small. The highest value — that corresponding to the point X in the
curve, fig. 2 — .being only 65 C.G.S. units.    The imaginary part of
the curve from X to C therefore corresponds to values of p, ranging
from 65 to infinity. A part of this exceedingly wide gap is filled by
my experiments, which include values of p up to 585. A curve
constructed from the fourth and fifth columns of Table II, showing
the relation between fi and         is given on a small scale in fig. 2,
beside that of Rowland.        It corresponds, of course, only with a
portion of Rowland's curve, the lowest value of *i included in it
being 7390.    But it seems to throw much new light on the subject.
Beginning with a rapid descent it turns aside soon after the limit of
Rowland's observations has been passed, and ultimately when £8 =
19,800 it has become almost parallel to the horizontal axis.        The
latter portion of the curve, from $ = 15,100, is given on a larger scale
in fig. 3.  We may conclude then that if £8 has any ultimate limit at

   There may, perhaps, be some doubt whether the expression
used above is exactly applicable to the case of my divided ring,
and small errors may possibly be introduced by the fact that the
contact between the opposite faces was not quite perfect throughout, t
But apart from minute accuracy of detail, the general character of
the results is entirely free from doubt, and would be quite unaffected
by a very large margin of uncertainty in the expression.     They show
that the generally accepted ideas with regard to several important
points need modification.
   Thus it is not true that the lifting power of an electromagnet
reaches a practical limit under a comparatively small magnetising
force, and that even if excited by an infinite current it could not
support a weight of 200 lbs. per square inch of surface.
   It is not true that the magnetisation of iron becomes sensibly con
stant when the magnetic force exceeds a certain moderate value.
   And it is not true that the maximum of magnetic induction, if it
exists at all, is represented              by anything like so small a value as
18,000 units.

  Tangent galvanometers are much used for the exact quantitative
measurement of currents of considerable       strength, such as are
measured   in amperes,  but  they are not  so generally used for the
measurement of smaller currents in milliamperes.    This arises from
a notion that they are not sensitive enough ; although the most
sensitive instrument in practice — Sir William Thomson's mirror
galvanometer — is really a tangent instrument. The ordinary forms
— Joule's, Gaugain's, or Helmholtz's — are not very sensitive. Their
    *   It   is hardly necessary to point out that   if   there is any   limit to   |i,   the suscepti
bility, k, must become negative when the magnetic force exceeds a certain value.

divisions ; and to avoid parallax the indicator is reflected in a mirror,
so that when the image and the indicator are in one line, no error from
this cause occurs.
   Mr. Eden, one of the assistant electricians of the Post Office,
discovered while experimenting that the galvanometer could be made
more sensitive to increments of current for high deflections if it were
                                                     " slewed " round so
given a false zero. In fact, if the instrument be
that the plane of the coil makes an angle of 60° with the meridian,
then the instrument becomes twice as sensitive as it was before ; and
he suggested a double scale such as is shown in Fig. 1 (p. 497) to
utilise this fact.
   This plan has been adopted, and all tangent galvanometers in the
Post Office service will be gradually altered to the new scale.
   It is quite clear that it owes its increased sensitiveness to the fact
that when the needle reaches its maximum deflection, its angle to the
lines of force of the field is in the most favourable direction for
deflection by the current. In fact, the plane of the coil becomes
parallel to the plane of the needle which is then in the most uniform
portion of the field.
   By changing the zero of the instrument the range of movement
can be considerably increased.      Thus if 0" be the angle which the
needle normally makes with the coil, and if a" be the angle to which
the needle has been deflected on the other side of the coil, then,/
being the deflective force, we have —

tamed when the zero was 60° to one side of zero, would be twice
what it would be if it had been deflected from the ordinary zero. The
ratio of these angles, however, decreases in value, and at a certain
point becomes equal to 1 ; that is to say, the angular deflection from

|/3°, then the deflection from the new zero will be less still; so that
there is no advantage in the use of the new zero unless the deflections
exceed ^/3°.
    If the angle |3° be made greater than 60° then the possible angular
movement of the needle becomes still further increased ; but inasmuch
as any increase in the length of the tangent scale brings the divisions
at the ends of the scale proportionally closer together, and makes
them more difficult to read from, there would be no practical
advantage in making the angle larger.
     A marked advantage under certain conditions is found when the
new zero has such a value that the deflection from a given current
causes the needle to move up to the ordinary zero, that is to say, to
the position where the needle becomes parallel to the coil ; in this
case the instrument becomes highly sensitive, and any increase in the
strength of the current produces       a very considerable change   in the
deflection.

     On the 8th December, 1858, at the South Foreland High Light,
 house, and with the direct current magneto machines of Holmes, the
 first important application of the electric arc light, as a rival to oil
 and gas for coast lighting, was carried out by the Trinity House,
 under the advice of Faraday. The carbons then used, and for several
 years afterwards, were sawn from the residuum cai-bon of gas retorts ;
 they were square in section, 6£ X 6£ mm., and the mean intensity of
 the arc, measured in the horizonal plane, was 670 candle units, being
  17 candle units nearly per square millimetre of cross sectional area of
 the carbon.     The crater formed at the point of the upper carbon of
 the "Holmes" lamp was so small that no appreciable loss of light
 was found to occur, and the arc proved to bo very perfect in affording
  an exceptionally large vertical angle of radiant light for application
  -with the optical apparatus as shown, one-third full size, in the sketch
  (Plate 6).
     The most reliable and efficient machine that has yet been tried for
  lighthouse purposes is the large size alternate current magneto
  machine of De Meritens.        The average results with these machines
  are as follows, viz. : —

  It will be observed from this statement that the intensity of the arc
in the horizontal plane per square millimetre of sectional area of
carbon is about 35 per cent. less than it was with the small square
carbons used by Holmes, although it might reasonably be expected
that, with the improvements since effected in the manufacture of
carbons,  the efficiency of the old small carbons would at least be
maintained.    The relative efficiency of the large carbons used with
the powerful currents now available appears to be due, 1st, to the loss
of a large portion of the most intense part of the arc which is confined
within the crater of each carbon  ; and, 2nd, to the fluctuations in the
intensity  of the arc caused by  the  current passing between various
parts of the end of each carbon. For a new electric light installation,
about to be made by the Trinity House at St. Catherine's Lighthouse,
Isle of Wight, it is intended to utilise the large " De Meritens "
machines that were used at the recent South Foreland experiments
for determining the relative merits of electricity, gas, and oil as light

for the transmission    of  light,  that the  flashes are not reaching their
advertised range.     The defect here arose, which        is  common to all
electric flashing lights where     a  minimum     and  a maximum     intensity
are adopted, viz., that the duration of the flashes of minimum and
maximum intensity would vary in the ratio of the difference in the
diameters of the carbons employed with one and two machines
respectively, which in this case should be 50 mm. and 35 mm., this
mean difference amounting to 36^ per cent. nearly.
   It evident that such
     is                      a  variation in the duration of flash would
seriously impair the distinctive character of the signal.         It occurred
to me, however, that,   if carbons of  a   fluted section were employed for
the arc of minimum intensity        whose   extreme diameter corresponded

  exactly with the diameter of the carbons used for the arc of maximum
  intensity, and of exactly half the sectional area of the latter, the
  defect referred to would be entirely obviated, and the flashes of
  maximum       and   minimum intensity would have exactly the same
  duration. As all carbons for electric arc lights are now made in
  moulds, I saw that such a form as shown in the accompanying full-
  size sketch (and model) would not involve any more difficulty in
  manufacture than if cylindrical, while there would be less liability of
 fracture occurring in the process of drying and baking.                  Other
 advantages to be obtained with fluted carbons are, 1st, a larger
 vertical angle of radiant light from the arc, and with a higher coeffi
 cient of intensity in consequence of the unobstructed radiance through
 the fluting at the points of each carbon ; and, 2nd, a steadier light is
 obtained owing to the localising of the current at the central portion
 of each carbon.
     The results of many experimental trials with fluted carbons 50 mm.
 diameter, as shown by the sketch and models submitted herewith,
 have entirely confirmed my expectations.           It will be observed that no
 crater   is formed,     and the point of each carbon is all that can be
 desired for utilising fully the maximum light of the arc.           My experi
 ments have not been sufficient to determine accurately the additional
 intensity of light obtained from the arc of a pair of the fluted carbons
 as compared with that from the arc of a pair of cylindrical carbons,
 but I am of opinion that the gain with fluted carbons is not less than
 10 per cent.
 IX. "On       some    new Elements in Gadolinite and Samarskite,
       detected spectvoscopically."          By William Crookes, F.R.S.,
       V.P.C.S. Received June 9, 1886.
     The recent discovery by my distinguished friend M. de Boisbau-
 dran* on the existence of a new element which he calls Dysprosium
makes it unadvisable on my part, as a fellow investigator in spectro
scopic research, to delay any longer the announcement of some of the
results I have obtained during the fractionations of the samarskite
and gadolinite earths.
    I will first take the earths which give absorption-spectra when their
solutions are examined by transmitted light.             These occur chiefly at
the higher end, beginning with didymium and proceeding, through
samaiium, holmium, &c., to erbium, which is one of the least basic.
The earths which give phosphorescent spectra chiefly occur at the
lower end, but each group overlaps the other; for instance yttria
occurs above erbia.

    One of the highest of the absorption-spectrum         earths is didymia.
The spectrum of didymium, as generally met with, is well known,
and is given in my paper on         " Radiant Matter Spectroscopy   :  Part  2,
             "
Samarium        (par. 135).
    It has long been suspected that didymium is not a simple body, and
in June, 1885, Dr. Auer v. Welsbach announced that by a series of
many hundred fractional crystallisations he had succeeded in splitting
up didymium into two new elements, one giving leek-green salts and
the other rose-red salts.        The green body he called Praseodymium
and the rose-red Neodymium. I have not found that my method of
fractionation gives a decomposition similar to this ; probably didy
mium will be found to split up in more than one direction, according
to the method adopted ; but by pushing the fractionations at the
didymium end of the series to a considerable extent, a change gradu
ally comes over the spectrum.           At the lower end the earth gives an
absorption-spectrum        such  as  is usually attributed to didymium, but
with no trace of some of the bands in the blue end, the one at X 443
being especially noticeable by its absence. The intermediate earths
give the old didymium spectrum, the relative intensities of some
of the bands varying according to the position of the^ earth in
the series, the band 443 becoming visible as the higher end is
approached.      The highest fractions of all give the band 443 one of
the most prominent in the spectrum, being accompanied by other
fainter bands which are absent in the lowest didymium spectrum.
     In my note-book, under date 3rd March, 1886, after discussing the
absorption-spectrum given by one of my earths rather lower down in
 the series (fraction —3), and comparing coincidences of the lines with
those given by holmia, erbia, didymia, thulia, and samaria, I remark
 "the big blue line (X451'5) is still unclaimed." In ignorance that
my friend M. de Boisbaudran was on the same track, and running
me somewhat close, I deferred further examination of these fractions
till a few months longer work had been performed on them, when                I
hoped to get fuller evidences of a new absorption-spectrum.           This big
 line in the blue,   X, 451 '5, now proves to be the characteristic     line of
 dysprosium.      This line does not occur in didymium.            The next
 strongest line, X. 475, is coincident with a very faint line in the old
 didymium spectrum, and it also falls within a broad band of samarium.
 M. de Boisbaudran says that this line is not due either to didyminm,
 erbium, or samarium ; as it follows the same variations of intensity as
 the other lines of dysprosium he considers it due to the same element.
     The earth (—3), which I have already mentioned as giving the
 broad black band (45T5) of dysprosium, shows this band wider (and
 therefore presumably stronger) than in the spectrum given by M. de
 Boisbaudran, without the slightest trace of the band 475, which,
 according to M. de Boisbaudran, should be wider and almost as dense

as the band                      It
                       is obvious therefore that the element giving

the band 475 cannot be the same as the one causing the band 451'5,
and if the body giving the strongest of these is called dyspro
sium another name must be chosen for the element which gives rise
to the absorption-band 475.
   And now comes the question : What is the origin of band 475 ?
                                                       I
In remarks made on the band 443 mentioned that it is accompanied
by other fainter lines. One of these occurs at 475, and therefore                                   I
was prepared to connect these bands as being due to one and the
same           ; but M. de Boisbaudran,
              element                      in his description of the
spectrum  of dysprosium, has shown that band 475 can be obtained
strong in the absence of 443. The bands 443 and 475 therefore are
not caused either by didymiura, dysprosium, or any hitherto identified
element ; consequently each must be regarded as characteristic of a
new body.
     I
    now come to a branch      of the subject which promises to yield
results even more fruitful than those given by the examination of
absorption-spectra :             I
                      refer to the spectra yielded by some of the earths
when phosphorescing    in vacuo.     This method has been so fully
explained before the Royal Society, in my papers on
                                                       " Radiant Matter
Spectroscopy,"  that I need not repeat it.
  In my Bakerian Lecture on Yttrium* described the phosphores     I
cent spectrum of this earth, and gave a drawing of it.         In the
Samarium paperf I gave a similar description and drawing of the
samarium spectrum, and also described and illustrated some anomalous
results obtained when yttria and samaria were mixed together.
Under the conditions described in the paper a sharp and brilliant
orange line made its appearance, which at that time seemed as if it
belonged to the samarium spectrum, and was only developed in
greater intensity by the presence of yttria.  This explanation, how
ever, did not satisfy me, and                    I called   the line   f\.   609   =i-           "the
                                                                                         2693^

have since further investigated the occurrence of this line, with more
than usual good fortune in the extent and importance of the new
facts thereby disclosed.
  Systematic fractionation was carried on with the portions of the
general series giving the strongest appearance of line 609, and
itsoon became apparent that the line closely followed samarium. The

presence of yttria was not necessary to bring it out, although by
deadening the brightness of the other bands it was useful, not
seeming to affect the line 609.         Several circumstances, however,
tended to show that although line 609 accompanied samarium with the
utmost pertinacity, it was not so integral a part of its spectrum as the
other red, green, and orange lines. For instance, the chemical as well
as physical behaviour of these line-forming bodies was different.          On
closely comparing     the spectra of specimens   of samaria   from  different
sources, line 609 varied much in intensity, in some cases being strong
and in others almost absent. The addition of yttria was found to
greatly deaden the red, orange, and green lines of samarium, while
yttria had little or no effect on the line 609 ; again, a little lime
entirely suppressed line 609, while it brought out the samarium lines
with increased vigour. Finally attempts to separate line 609 from
samarium and those portions of the samarskite earths in which it
chiefly concentrated resulted in sufficient success to show me that,
given time enough and an almost inexhaustible supply of material, a
separation would not be difficult.
    But what was then practically impossible to me, restricted by limited
time and means, Nature has succeeded in effecting in the most perfect
manner.      I had been working on samarskite, and many observations
had led me to think that the proportion of band- forming constituents
varied slightly in the same earth from different minerals.         Amongst
others, gadolinite showed indications of such a        differentiation,   and
 therefore I continued the work on this mineral.       Very few fractiona
 tions were necessary to show that the body giving line 609 was not
 present in the gadolinite earths, no admixtures of yttria and samaria
 from this source giving a trace of it. It follows, therefore, that the
 body whose phosphorescent spectrum gives line 609 occurs in samar
 skite, but not in gadolinite; thus it cannot be due to samarium,
yttrium, or a mixture of these two elements; the only other probable
alternative is that the source of this line is a new element.
    Chemical fractionation is very similar to the formation of a spec
 trum with a very wide slit and a succession of shallow prisms.           The
centre portion     remains   unchanged   for a  long   time,  and  the   only
 approach to purity at first will be at the two ends, while a consider
able series of operations    is needed to produce   an appreciable change
in the centre.
    During the later fractionations of the yttria earths another           set
of facts, formerly only suspected, have assumed consistent form. The
spectrum bands which hitherto I had thought belonged to yttria soon
began to vary in intensity among themselves, and continued fractiona
tion increased the differences first observed.       It would exceed the
limits  of a  preliminary  note were I to enter into  details respecting the
chemical and physical reasons which lead me to the definite conclu

sions  I now bring before this Society.          More than 2000 fractionations
have been performed        to  settle this single point.    I  will content myself
with stating the results. The element hitherto called yttrium appears
to be a highly complex molecule, capable of being dissociated into
several simpler substances, each of which gives a phosphorescent spec
trum of great simplicity, consisting for the most part of only one line.
   Taking the constituents in order of approximate basicity (the
chemical   analogue of refrangibility) the lowest earthy constituent
gives a violet band (X 456), which            I have reason to believe belongs
to ytterbia.    Next comes a deep blue band (X 482) ; then the strong
citron band (X 574), which has increased in sharpness till it deserves
to be called a line     ; then     come a close pair of greenish-blue lines
 (X 549  and X 541, mean 545) ; then a red band (X 619), then a deep
red band (X 647), next a yellow band (X 597), then another green
line (X 564) ; this (in samarskite yttria) is followed by the orange
line (X 609) of which        I  have already spoken ; and finally, the three
samarium bands remain at the highest part of the series.                 These for
the present  I  do not touch, having my hands fully occupied with the
more easily resolvable earths.
   In the " Comptes rendus " for April 19th, 1886, M. de Boisbaudran
announces to the Academy that M. de Marignac, the discoverer of Y«,
had selected for it the name Gadolinium.                                   I
                                                       In February last gave a
                                                 I
short note on the earth Y«,* in which described its phosphorescent
spectrum (agreeing exactly with that given by Ya of M. de Marignac's
preparation). Referring to my paper it will be seen that Y« is com
posed of the following band-forming bodies: — (541, 549), (564),
(597), (609), (619), together with a little samarium.                  Calling the
samarium an impurity, it is thus seen that gadolinium is composed of
at least four simpler bodies. The pair of green lines (X 541 and
X 549, mean 545), being the strongest              feature in its spectrum, may
be taken as characteristic of gadolinium : the other lines are due to
other bodies.
   It is by a method of his own, differing from mine, that M. de Bois
baudran has obtained phosphorescent spectra of some of these earths.
He takes the induction spark between the surface of a strong and
acid solution of the metallic chloride, and a clean platinum wire a few
millimetres above it. The platinum wire is kept negative and the
solution positive ; it is then observed that in many cases a thin layer
of fluorescent light is seen at the surface of the liquid.              This layer
gives  a spectrum    of   nebulous     bands.    For  the  sake   of brevity I will
adopt M. de Boisbaudran's term, and call this process the method of
reversion (the direction of the spark being reversed).             As this method
is entirely different to the one        I  adopt, it is not surprising that the
results also are different.          Experimenting in this way M. de Bois-
                   »  "Proc. Roy. Soo.," vol.   40 (1886), p. 236.

  1886.]          New Elements in Gadolinite and Samarskite.                          507
 baudrau has obtained, among others, two bands (X 573 and X 543-2),
  which he considers to be caused by two elements, named respectively
 Za and Z/3, and which he considers new, at all events if we except
 terbium, and possibly the elements of what was formerly called
 holmium. His method fails to show any spectrum in solutions of
 yttria which by my method give the yttria bands with the greatest
 brilliancy ; while conversely his method shows a fluorescent spectrum
 in solutions of earths separated as widely as possible from yttria,
 chemically as well as spectroscopically.               My experiments on both
these methods tend to the conclusion that our bands are not due to
the same cause, although M. de Boisbaudran's experiments have led
him to the opposite conclusion.             The band of Z/3 (543) falls between
the double green         band    of  gadolinium (549 and 541), and the band of
Za (573) would come very near the citron line (574).
    A hitherto uurecognised band in the spectrum by absorption or
phosphorescence is not of itself definite proof of a new element, but
if it is supported by chemical facts such as I have brought forward
there is sufficient prima facie evidence that a new element is present.
Until, however, the new earths are separated in sufficient purity to
enable their atomic weights to be approximately determined, and
their chemical and physical properties observed, I think it is more
prudent to regard them as elements on probation.                  I should therefore
prefer to designate them provisionally by the mean wave-length of the
                                  I
dominant band. In this am following the plan adopted by astrono
mers in naming the minor planets, which are known by a number
encircled by a line. If, however, for the sake of easier discussion
among chemists a definite name is thought more convenient                           I will
follow the plan frequently adopted               in such  cases,  and    provisionally

   The initial letters D, S, and G recall tbe origin of the earths
respectively from Didymium, Samarskite, and Gadolinite.
   The radiant-matter test applied to these phosphorescing bodies
proves itself to be every day more and more valuable, and one of
the most far-searching and trustworthy tools ever placed in the hands
of the experimental chemist. It is an exquisitely delicate test capable
of being applied to bodies which have been approximately separated,
but not yet completely isolated, by chemical means ; its delicacy is
unsurpassed even in the region of spectrum analysis ; its economy is
great, inasmuch as the test involves no destruction of the specimen,
and its convenience is such that any given specimen is always avail
able for future reference. Likewise the quantity of material is limited
solely by the power of the human eye to see the body under examina
tion. Beyond all these excellencies is its trustworthiness.               I  should
be exceeding the legitimate inference from experience were              I  to claim
that this test is infallible ; but this I may say — during the five years
in which this test has been in daily use in my laboratory,           I never once
have been led to view its indications with suspicion.             Anomalies and
apparent contradictions have cropped up in plenty ; but a little more
experiment has always shown that the anomalies were but finger-posts
pointing to fresh paths of discovery, and the contradictions were due
to my own erroneous interpretation of the facts before me.

        Mines. Communicated by E. FranKLAND, F.R.S. Received
        June 7, 1886.
    The micro-organisms         in air have formed the subject of investiga
tions by Pasteur, Tyndall, Miquel, and many others. The researches
of these experimenters have shown that although these organisms are
most widely distributed throughout the accessible regions of the atmo
sphere, yet that very marked differences do exist in the numbers
which are present in different places, and in the same places at
different times.

 510                       Dr. P. F. Frankland.                [June    10,
     The majority of these experiments were made before the methods
 of cultivating micro-organisms on solid nutritive media had been de
 veloped and perfected.     These methods of cultivation have proved of
 such inestimable advantage in the study of micro-organisms in all its
 branches, that it is not surprising that they should have also been
 applied to a reinvestigation of the micro-organisms of the air. These
 methods are, moreover, particularly fitted for this purpose, inasmuch
 as they simultaneously supply information as to the number of micro
 organisms present, as well as furnishing these micro-organisms in a
 state of pure cultivation for purposes of further study.
     A method of adapting the solid culture-media to the bacterioscopic
 examination    of air has been devised by Hesso (" Mittheilungen
 Kaiserl. Gesundheitsamte,"      Berlin, 1884), who has conducted a
 number of experiments showing that the results obtained by this
 method can lay claim to a fair degree of quantitative accuracy, and
since the gelatine-peptone of Koch is used for the cultivation of the
 organisms obtained, the range of organisms which are capable of
 being discovered in this way is very considerable indeed.
    Wishing to conduct some experiments on the relative abundance
 of micro-organisms in the air of varions places and at different alti
tudes, I selected, after careful consideration and preliminary trial, the
method of Hesse for their execution, and have adopted the various
precautions which he has recommended so as to render my results as
comparable as possible with those which he has obtained in his in
vestigation on the air of Berlin.
                    Description of Apparatus employed.
    This consists essentially of a glass tube about 2 feet 6 inches in
length and 1^ to 2 inches in diameter, coated on its internal surface
with the nutritive gelatine medium.        One extremity of this tube is
fitted with a perforated aperture 0'5 inch in diameter, the other
extremity being provided with a tightly fitting india-rubber cork,
through which passes a short glass tube plugged with cotton- wool.
    In preparing the tube for use, the perforated cap mentioned
above is covered with a second non-perforated one, which is tightly
wired on so as to be watertight.      The empty tube with its caps and
cork are first sterilised by placing them in the steamer for several
hours, the cotton-wool plug employed in the tube which passes
through the cork having been previously sterilised by heating in an
air-bath until it is browned.     The cork is now removed, and about
50 c.c. of the melted peptone-gelatine are poured into the tube.      The
cork is replaced, and the whole tube with its contents is then steamed
for fifteen minutes on three successive days.        In this sterilisation
the tube is placed, with the capped end downwards, in the ordinary
steamer, the lid of which is replaced by a truncated conical shade,

through which several of these tubes can protrude, their ends being
then covered by a glass shade externally coated with cotton-wool or
any other non-conducting material. By contriving this simple ar
             I
rangement was able to keep every portion of the tubes in an atmo
sphere of steam, whilst no condensed water could find its way into
the tubes.
                                    Fig.  1.
    I  have found    it very necessary not to overdo the steaming, as the
 melting point    of   the gelatine is considerably reduced by its being
 prolonged, and in these experiments it is of the greatest importance
 that the gelatine should be capable of resisting the temperatures
 which are incidental to the experiments, and which are encountered
 in travelling with the apparatus.       If the gelatine be too sensitive to
 heat many experiments may be entirely lost, and the time and labour
 spent upon their careful execution wasted.        I would therefore recom
 mend that both in the preparation and       in the sterilisation of the gela
 tine-peptone used in these tubes, the steaming should be reduced to a
 minimum consistent with sterility.
    When finally sterilised, and whilst the gelatine is still fluid, the
 tube is held horizontally under a cold-water tap, being simultaneously
 rotated and moved backwards and forwards, so that uniform cooling
 is effected. As the gelatine approaches its solidifying point it be
 comes more and more viscid, and gradually adheres to the surface of
 the tube, so that with a little management the whole interior cau be
 uniformly coated. In this operation contact between the gelatine
 and the cotton-wool plug in the small tube at the end must be care
 fully avoided, otherwise when cold the tube may become blocked up.
    The tube after being preserved for some time to insure sterility, is

                          Method of Experiment.
   Tubes   prepared as above are easily transportable in cylindrical
cardboard boxes, the exterior of which should be coated white to
prevent heating if they have to be exposed to sunshine.         The tube is
strapped to a small horizontal table supported by an ordinary port-
                                   Fio. 2.
able camera stand, and the end of the small tube passing through the
cork is connected by flexible tubing with an aspirator, which, so as to
render it as portable as possible, consists of two bottles or strong flasks,
each of rather more than 1 litre capacity, arranged as in the figure to
form a reversible syphon.     A measured litre of water is poured into
one of these flasks, and by syphoning this into the second, a litre of
air is made to pass through the experimental tube. The rate of flow
is regulated by a screw clamp, and by alternately connecting the end
of the tube with the two syphon flasks any desired volume of air may
be drawn through the apparatus.
   The experiments of Hesse show that the rate of aspiration should
not exceed 1 litre in two or three minutes, and that when this precau
tion is observed the organisms present in the air are almost wholly
deposited in the first two-thirds of the tube, the remaining third being
either wholly free or practically so. In my experiments I have almost

 uniformly restricted the rate to the 1 litre in three minutes, and can
 fully confirm the fact of the remarkably complete deposition of the
organisms in the front part of the tube, as well as of their being
almost uniformly found on the bottom.           In conducting experiments in
the open air,    I   have made, with few exceptions, the invariable prac
tice of directing the aperture of the tube at an angle of about 135° to
the direction of the wind, so as to avoid currents of air penetrating
into the tube irrespectively of the action of the aspirator.
    In commencing the experiment the outer uuperforated india-rubber
cap is removed and carefully folded up, so that its inner surface is not
exposed to the air, and as soon as the experiment is over it is carefully
replaced and wired on. The tube is kept in a chamber at 20 — 25° C.
for incubation in the position in which it was used, and in the course
of a few days the organisms which have been arrested by the gelatine
are readily distinguishable by the colonies, visible to the naked eye or
by means of a low power, to which they give rise. Unless the number
of organisms which have fallen on the gelatine is very great, each
colony will consist of a pure cultivation of a particular organism, and
can be further examined as desired.
    From the number of colonies found in a given volume of air the
number in any standard volume, say 100 litres, can be calculated.
             Examination of    Air  by Gelatine- surface Exposure.
    In addition   to the tube experiments above described,        I have con
sidered it advisable to make simultaneous       tests by exposing for a definite
period of time a surface of nutrient gelatine of definite area as originally
recommended by Koch (" Mittheilungen Kaiserl. Gesundheitsamte,"
Berlin, 1881), as in this manner an idea is obtained, not of the
number of organisms contained in a given volume of air, but of what
for many purposes is more important, of the number falling on a given
surface in a definite time.
    For this purpose small circular glass dishes rather less than 1 inch
in height and about 3 inches in diameter, and provided with a glass
cover fitting loosely and overlapping like the lid of a pill-box, were
filled to a depth of about one-third of an inch with nutrient gelatine
and sterilised for fifteen minutes on three successive days in the
steamer.     As long as the covers are on, the gelatine in these dishes
remains   sterile   for practically an indefinite length of time, and can be
transported without danger in a tin box.
    In using these for experiment, the lid is removed and placed with
its mouth downwards on a clean surface, and then after the desired
 exposure replaced on the dish.

                     General Scope of the Experiments.
   A   number   of experiments have been made on the roof of the
 Science   Schools,   South Kensington Museum, with the view of
ascertaining   the   influence of season and atmospheric conditions
generally upon the abundance of micro-organisms.         This position is
well fitted for observations of the kind, the roof being about 50 or
60 feet above the surface of the ground, and thus removed from
local and accidental influences.
   A series of experiments was carried out with a view of ascer
taining the relative abundance of micro-organisms at different alti
tudes in towns.        These comparisons were effected by collecting
samples of air at different       elevations on the spire of Norwich
Cathedral, on the dome of St. Paul's in London, and on Primrose
Hill. Comparative experiments have also been made in the country,
as well as in buildings such as museums, hospitals, &c.
   The results obtained in the tube experiments are calculated to the
number of micro-organisms       contained in 10 litres of air, whilst the
results yielded by the exposure of the gelatine-dishes are stated so as
to represent the number of micro-organisms falling on 1 square foot
in one minute.      The conditions under which the experiments were
performed are also recorded.

   These   figures show that in cold weather, especially when the
ground is covered with snow, the number of organisms in the air is
very much reduced and presents a very striking contrast to the
number found in the warmer weather, even immediately after much
rain.
   The experiments made on the 9th of March show that during cold
and dry weather with a strong east wind blowing over London, a
large number of micro-organisms may still be present in the air ; for
although the tube-experiment made on that day cannot be regarded
as satisfactory, yet from the number falling on the square foot it is
evident that they must have been very abundant, certainly very much
more abundant than on the 16th of March, when with much the same
temperature the wind was more moderate and blowing from the
north-west.
   It is particularly noticeable that even after such exceedingly heavy
rain ns was experienced on the morning of the 22nd of May, within a
few hours afterwards the number of micro-organisms in the air should
be as abundant as usual.
   It will be seen on comparing the number in the above table that,
with the exception of the experiment made on January 21st, when
snow was on the ground and actually falling at the time, the number
of micro-organisms     present in the air collected on the roof of the
Science Schools, never fell so low as in some of the experiments to be
presently mentioned, which were made in the country.
   Taking the average of the experiments recorded above, it will be
seen that the mean number of organisms found in 10 litres of air
amounted to 35, whilst an average of 279 fell on 1 square foot in
one minute.

520                        Dr. P. F. Frankland.              [June   10,
   In  the table (p. 519), the results of the experiments    made near
Reigate aud in the vicinity of Norwich are recorded.
   These figures present a very marked contrast to those contained in
the previous table ; thus the average number of organisms found in
the country experiments amounts to only 14 in 10 litres, whilst
an average of 79 fell on 1 square foot in one minute.
   Particularly noticeable is the great relative freedom from micro
organisms of the air collected on the heath near Norwich daring the
comparatively warm weather of April last when the ground was dry.
In the experiments made both at Norwich and Reigate it will be
observed that the    air in gardens was richer in micro-organisms than
that of the open country, although in the Reigate experiments of
May 23rd there were more on the dish exposed on the hill than in the
garden, bnt this is easily accounted for by the fact that the wind on
the hill was very much stronger than in the garden, the number
found in a given volume being very mnch less in the case of the air
on the hill.
   In the table (p. 521) are the results of the examination of the air in
 Kensington Gardens, Hyde Park, and Primrose Hill.
   From these figures it will be seen that on the whole the number of
organisms found in the air of these open spaces is less than in that
collected on the roof at South Kensington, but greater than in the
 experiments made in the country, although the number found in the
second experiment in Kensington Gardens is scarcely in excess of
 anything found in the country places.
    The average number of micro-organisms found in 10 litres amounts
 to 24, whilst an average of 85 fell on 1 square foot in one minute.

1886.]        The Distribution of Micro-organisms in       Air.        523
   At  the suggestion of Mr. Edwin Chadwick, C.B.,        I was induced to
make a comparison       between the air at different altitudes iu towns.
The   results obtained are recorded in the above table.
   These figures     are particularly instructive, as illustrating the fact
that  with  increasing altitude the air becomes poorer in micro-organ
isms. The tube experiment on the Golden Gallery at St. Paul's on
the 29th May must be disregarded, as during the progress of the
experiment the direction of the wind changed completely and vitiated
the result by blowing down the open extremity of the tube, thereby
increasing the number of organisms deposited beyond what was
actually due to the volume of air aspirated.         The exposed dish, on
the other hand, would not be affected in the same way, and it will be
seen that, as regards the number of organisms falling on the square
foot, the result on the Golden Gallery carries on the diminution
noticed on the Stone Gallery.
   The differences noticed in the case of the St. Paul's experiments
may perhaps be most vividly appreciated by comparing the averages
of the two experiments with some of the averages already quoted for
other places. Thus at the base of St. Paul's we find an average of
56 organisms in 10 litres, which is considerably greater than the
average for the South Kensington experiments, in which only 35 were
found in the same volume ; on the Stone Gallery there were 29 in
10 litres, whilst in the Golden Gallery in the successful experiment
the number only amounted to 11 in 10 litres, thus closely resembling
the average number found in the experiments made in country places,
which was 14 in that volume.

    These experiments show that in enclosed spaces, when there is
little or no aerial commotion, the number of suspended organisms is
very moderate, but as soon as any atmospheric disturbance is occa
sioned either by draughts or by the moving about of people, the
number rapidty rises, and may become very large indeed.         This is a
fact very familiar to all who have had much experience in the
cultivation of micro-organisms, and it is of particular importance in
connexion with the process of plate cultivation with gelatine.
    The experiments made in the railway carriage afford a very striking
example of the enormous number of micro-organisms which become
suspended in the air when a large number of persons are crowded
together.
    In my own laboratory, where every care is taken       to prevent the
circulation of dust, the number of organisms did not amount to more
than 13 in 10 litres, and of t!he comparative purity of this air I have
had the most abundant evidence in the almost inappreciable amount
of aerial contamination which is exhibited by the plate cultivations
prepared there.
    In conclusion,  I  have to express my thanks to the Deans of St.
Paul's and    Norwich,  General Festing, Professor Flower, Dr. Theodore
Williams, and Mr. F. E. Colenso, through whose courtesy           I   have
been    enabled  to carry out many  of  the experiments  recorded   in the
above paper.
    I must also acknowledge the valuable help which     I  have received
from my assistant, Mr. Hart, A.R.S.M., who is now proceeding with
these investigations, the results of which we shall hope to have the
honour of communicating later.

from Water (" Proc. Roy. Soc," vol. 38 (1885), p. 379), had occasion
to point out the extraordinary rapidity with which micro-organisms
may become multiplied even in ordinary distilled water.           It was
there shown that if a few drops of diluted urine-water be added to
ordinary distilled water and kept in a sterilised bottle plugged with
sterilised cotton-wool, the number of micro-organisms remaining sus
pended in the water became multiplied in the following manner : —

   These numbers       represent the number of micro-organisms found in
the upper layers      of  the water without agitating the contents of the
bottle.   More recently .this subject has been touched upon by Dr. T.
Leone (" Gazzetta Chimica Italiana," xv, 385), who found that the
micro-organisms present in the water supplied to the city of Munich
became multiplied in the course of five days from 5 per cubic centimetre
to upwards of half a million in the same volume of water.
   As this subject is one which is of muoh importance, from many
points of view, I have carried out a number of experiments with the
object of throwing some light upon these phenomena.
                              Methods of Experiment.
   The number of micro-organisms present in the liquids employed
was determined by means of Koch's method of plate cultivation with
gelatine peptone. The apparatus used was substantially the same as
that described in my previous paper (loc. cit.), a few modifications of
the process having, however, been since then introduced.                     The
sterile plates are now placed upon a levelled glass slab, resting upon
a dish containing iced water, and covered with a glass shade, the
latter being momentarily raised whilst the inoculated and fluid gela
tine is poured upon the plate. With this arrangement the solidifica
tion of the gelatine is almost instantaneous, and the plate can be at
once transferred to the moist chamber for incubation, thus enabling
the preparation of a very .much larger number of plates in a given
time than was formerly possible, when the rate of solidification of the
gelatine was dependent upon the temperature of the room. Instead
of a solntion of mercuric chloride in the moist chamber, I now simply
employ steiilised distilled water, as       I have found that the presence of
the mercuric -chloride      in the moist  chamber     may exercise a prejudicial
effect upon the full development of the colonies on the plate.             When
these   modifications    of  the process tire  carried  out with  care in a room
in which the distribution of dust is scrupulously avoided, the aerial
contamination is altogether insignificant, but the process should in all
cases be checked by pouring blank plates, in order to ascertain whether
the precautions employed have been adequate or not. When, however,
sufficient experience has been acqnired in the management of the
process, the preparation -of these blank plates becomes rather a matter
of form than of any practical importance, nevertheless when mixtures

of organisms and not pure cultivations are being dealt with, it               is a
check which should on no account be neglected.
                          Scope   of the Experiments.
   The bacteriological examination by plate cultivation of a large
number of natural waters showed that practically all waters contain
micro-organisms in greater or less abundance, but that the nnmber
found in such natural waters varies within exceedingly wide limits.
Thus whilst the number found in the rivers Thames and Lea usually
amounts to thousands in the cubic centimetre, that found in certain
deep well-waters, which         I have had under continual observation,
rarely   exceeds ten  in the  same   volume.    It appeared to me, therefore,
of interest to study the further history of the organisms present in
these waters of different origin and character.
   In the second part of the paper will be found a description of a
nnmber of experiments made upon the power of multiplication pos
sessed by certain pathogenic organisms, when placed under similar
conditions.
     I. Experiments with Micro-organisms present in Natural Waters.
   The waters which were made the subject of study are those sup
plied by the eight Metropolitan Companies to London, and which for
various rrasons are well adapted for purposes of experiment.             Firstly,
they    include  waters   derived    from  various   sources, viz.,   from     two
different rivers —  the Thames and Lea— and from deep wells in the
chalk ; secondly, their chemical composition is well known, and is made
the subject of a very complete monthly investigation ; and thirdly,
 their biological character has now been under periodical observation
 for eighteen months past.
                   Micro-organisms     in Crude River-water.
    Samples of unfiltered river-water (temp. 2"C.) collected in sterile
 stoppered bottles were submitted to plate cultivation the day after
 collection, whilst duplicate samples were allowed to stand at a tem
 perature of about 20° C. for five days, and then similarly examined.
 The following results were obtained : —

viour of the micro-organisms           present in river-water.             The results
obtained were as follows :     —

    Thus in both cases there was a marked reduction in the micro
 organisms after storing for two and four days respectively.
    From the experiments made with these river-waters, it would
 appear that there is a decided tendency for the micro-organisms
 which they contain to become reduced in number when the waters
 are kept at the ordinary temperature of the air (20° C), whilst the
 numbers may be temporarily enormously increased by exposing them
 to an incubating temperature.
    A very large number of experiments was also made with the filtered
 river- waters, as supplied to the metropolis.             These waters have sub
 stantially  the   same   chemical      composition     as   the rivers from which
 they are derived, but the number of micro-organisms which they con
 tain at the time of collection rarely exceeds on the average 5 per
 cent, of that present in the raw river-waters. The results obtained
 are recorded in the following tables : —

multiplication taking place when samples of the filtered river-waters
are exposed for twenty-four hours respectively in frosty weather, and
in the incubator.            The results obtained are comparable with those
already recorded for the crude river-waters which were similarly

    Thus the micro-organisms in the filtered river- waters, on standing
for twenty-four hours, even in cold weather, undergo a slight although
 distinct multiplication, thus bearing out the observations made with
 the same waters when kept in the refrigerator for a week. It is
                                                                                      2x2

further seen that when allowed to stand at a temperature of 20° C,
the multiplication which takes place in the course of a few days is
generally very considerable indeed, whilst at the temperature of the
incubator (35° C.) the multiplication, even in the course of a single
 night, is enormous.           On the other hand, when the storage is con
 tinued for a sufficient length of time, the number of micro-organisms
 diminishes, and may become reduced below that which was present at
the outset.         It would appear, however, that the micro-organisms in
 these filtered waters become multiplied at 20° C. with far greater
rapidity than those in the unfiltered waters, which, as already pointed
 out, have rather a tendency to become diminished, unless raised to
 the temperature of the incubator.
    It now became a matter of interest to compare with the above the
power of multiplication which is possessed by the micro-organisms
found in deep well-waters. Similar experiments were, therefore, made
with the waters obtained from one of the wells in the chalk at Dept-
ford, belonging to the Kent Company.

    On comparing these results with those previously referred to, it will
be seen that whilst these organisms in the deep well-water have but
little tendency to multiply in the cold, the multiplication at 20° C. is
far in excess of anything observed in the case of the river-waters.
    Experiments were also made to ascertain the influence of the tem

   These tables show the enormous          capacity for multiplication which
is possessed by the micro-organisms present in this deep well-water.
This is the more surprising, at first sight, when it is borne in mind
that this water contains the merest trace of organic matter.                It must,
however, be remembered that this water is at the outset almost wholly
free from micro-organisms, and that it has never before been inhabited
by such living matters ; it is only reasonable to infer, therefore, that
those of its ingredients which are capable of nourishing the particular
micro-orgauisms which flourish in it are wholly untouched, whilst in
the case of the river-waters, the most available food supply must have
been largely explored by the numerous generations of micro-organisms
which have inhabited them. It should also be mentioned that the number
of different varieties of micro-organisms is far greater in the case of
the river-waters than in the deep well-water, as is at once evident to
the naked eye on inspection of a plate cultivation, the deep well-water
plates having generally the appearance of a pure culture ; in the
latter case, then, the organisms present will probably have a freer
field for multiplication than in the presence of competitors, some of
which may not improbably give rise to products which are hostile to
others.     This would also explain the greater capacity for multiplica
tion which we find, as indicated above, in the filtered as compared
with the unfiltered river-waters.           By the proress of filtration the
number of different varieties of micro-organisms is largely reduced,
as is at once seen by the inspection of the plate cultivations, and
those varieties which remain have apparently a more favourable
opportunity for reproduction than in the presence of more numerous
varieties.
           II. The Multiplication, of Pathogenic Micro-organisms.
   The remarkable      phenomenon of multiplication which is exhibited
by  the  micro-organisms found in most natural waters obviously leads
us to a consideration of the behaviour of parasitic micro-organisms
when accidentally introduced,       as they   frequently must      be,  into waters
of different composition.

534                          Dr. P. F. Frankknd.                  [June  10,
    In studying the behaviour        of parasitic micro-organisms      under
these conditions,    I  have selected three forms which are recognisable
with particular facility, owing to the highly characteristic appearances
to which they give rise when cultivated in the gelatine-peptone
medium.
     These forms are —
     1. Bacillus pyocyaneus.
     2. Finkler-Prior's Comma Spirillum.
     3. Koch's Comma Spirillum.
     The pure cultivations of these organisms were obtained directly, in
the case of the first two mentioned, and indirectly, in the case of the
third, from the laboratory of the Hygienic Institute of Berlin.
 1.   Appearance of the Bacillus pyocyaneus in Gelatine-tube Cultivations.
     At 20°  C, within twenty-four   hours of inoculation, the path of the
 needle is indicated by incipient liquefaction at the surface, which as
growth proceeds undergoes funnel-shaped depression, the fringe of
which soon exhibits blue-green fluorescence.          The diameter of the
 liquefied portion increases until the whole width of the tube is
 affected, the downward extension of liquefaction proceeding in the
 form of an inverted cone, in the apex of which a flesh-coloured pre
 cipitate is formed.      The bine-green fluorescence is seen only on and
 near    the  surface.   Ultimately the whole of the gelatine        becomes
 liquid, and of   a dirty green colour.
    Appearance of the Bacillus pyocyaneus in Gelatine-plate Cultivations.
     At  20° C. the colonies are generally  distinctly visible on the second
 day as small opaque light green disks, the whole plate presenting a
 blue-green fluorescence when viewed by reflected light.         The size of
  the colonies is dependent upon the number present on the plate,
  being exceedingly minute when the latter is densely crowded, and
  reaching several millimetres in diameter when only a few are scat
  tered over the surface.       The amount of liquefaction also varies
  inversely as the number of colonies, but even after considerable lique
  faction has taken place over the surface of the gelatine, the indi
  vidual colonies remain perfectly distinct, and do not become confluent,
  and so lose their identity, as is the case with many liquefying orga
  nisms.     Not unfrequently, especially when there are comparatively
  few organisms on the plate, those situated on the surface give rise to
  a remarkable     and very beautiful flocculent expansion of irregular
  contour and sometimes several millimetres in diameter.
      The plates possess a highly characteristic and very nauseous odour,
  which is at once apparent on opening a dish in which they have been
  developed.     Viewed under the low power of the microscope each

*pherical or ovoid sea-urchin covered with spines, and light brown or

2. Appearance     of    the Finkler- Prior's Comma Spirillum in Oelatine-
                                 tube Cultivations.
    The growth of this organism very much resembles that of the
 Bacillus pyocyaneus, only that no colouring-matter is produced.              The
 liquefaction, which is at first funnel-shaped, rapidly extends across
 the whole tube, and the downward extension into the solid gelatine
 becomes filled with a plug of a yellowish viscid material.               In the
 course of a few weeks the whole gelatine, or at least as far as the
 needle at the time of inoculation has reached, becomes liquid, the
 yellowish precipitate resting on the bottom, but the liquefied portion
 also remains turbid.

                                   Cultivations.
    The plate cultivations of this organism are very characteristic. The
 colonies making their appearance already on the first or second day
 as small milky white disks, which increasing in size cause rapid
 liquefaction of the gelatine, the depressions being filled with a white
 fluid resembling thin milk. If the centres are at all closely approxi
 mated they very soon become confluent, and lose their identity, the
 whole plate becoming fluid.
    Viewed under the low power of the microscope the colonies
 appear as brownish very finely granular disks, with a highly refract
 ing edge, which is also granular and not perfectly sharp.

                                   Cultivations.
    The growth of this organism in gelatine is slower than that of the
 other two. At 20° C, withiu a day or two of inoculation, the path of

the needle becomes visible as a fine thread, which sooner or later is
followed by a conical depression at the surface ; this depression is
filled with air at its wider upper extremity, and slowly increases in
width    ; as growth proceeds the track of the needle becomes thicker,
and the air-cavity at the surface becomes partially filled with clear
liquid, at the bottom of which there is a whitish somewhat flocculent
precipitate.
    The growth in peptone-broth is very rapid, the liquid becomes
turbid, and on the surface there is formed a tough pellicle which
increases in thickness, whilst the subjacent liquid is again clarified.
Appearance of Koch's       Comma Spirillum in Gelatine-plate   Cultivations.
    The plate cultivations exhibit in the course of two or three days
minute whitish spots, each situated at the bottom of a small depres
sion on the surface.        The colonies remain small, but when very
numerous the substance of the gelatine becomes largely liquefied.
        Magnifying  power nearly 1000.       Magnifying power about 100.
    Under the low power of the microscope the colonies present the
 appearance of somewhat irregnlar disks, with a more or less irregular
 and jagged edge, the interior of the disk being filled with coarsely
 granular matter.
           Multiplication Experiments with Specific Organisms.
    The pure cultivations of the three specific organisms mentioned
 above were introduced into the experimental waters in the following
 manner, so as to secure a degree of attenuation which admitted
 of satisfactory examination by plate cultivation.
     One or more needlefuls of the cultivation are first inoculated into
 about 50 c.c. of sterilised distilled water contained in a sterile stop
 pered bottle ; this first attenuation is then well shaken, so as to
  distribute the introduced organisms evenly throughout. From this
 first attenuation a certain number of drops are withdrawn by means of
 a sterilised pipette, and introduced into the sterilised experimental
  water contained in another sterile stoppered bottle. The latter is then
  in turn well shaken, and the number of organisms in a given volume
  determined by plate cultivation.       This 6econd attenuation is then
  exposed to any desired conditions of temperature,           <fcc., and the
 number of organisms determined in it at suitable intervals of
 time.

                   Experiments       with  the    Bacillus pyocyaneus.
   A large number of experiments were made upon the vitality of
this organism when introduced into various kinds of water. The
results of these experiments show that on introducing this organism
into purer water, such as distilled water, deep well-water, or filtered
Thames water, in the first instance a greater or less reduction in the
number of organisms capable of development often takes place, but
sooner or later a considerable increase in their numbers generally
follows, and only in very exceptional cases was the complete destruc
tion of their vitality observed.              On the other hand, when the same
organism is introduced into sewage a rapid and large multiplication
was observed in every case.              From a number of bottles of distilled
water which were inoculated with the Bacillus pyocyaneus in the
manner described above, the following number of colonies were
obtained.

   The great vitality of this organism is well illustrated by experi
ments No. 1, 2, and 3, with distilled water, in which after fifty-three
days there were in each case a great many more colonies obtained
than at the outset, although in each case the number was greatly
reduced immediately after the inoculation.          For experiment No. 5,
with distilled water, the number of organisms was in the first instance
so largely reduced that on the third day there were no organisms
demonstrable   even   in a whole cubic centimetre,          and even on the
seventh  day the number       had only risen  to nineteen in that volume.
The corresponding sample (No. 4) placed in the incubator multiplied
much more rapidly, showing 6200 colonies on the third day and
96,000 on the seventh in 1 c.c.
   In the deep well and filtered Thames waters there is abundant
evidence of extensive multiplication, the only cases (No. 7, 8, and 9)

 was in each case very great.
                             Experiments with Koch's Comma Spirillum.
    The first experiments were made with comma Spirilla from feeble
 cultivations in gelatine. In these cultivations the organisms appeared
 to grow with difficulty, producing little or no liquefaction, but only a
 deep depression on the surface of the gelatine at the point of inocula
 tion. On subsequently inoculating into broth a powerful growth was
 obtained, and from this again a strong growth in gelatine was pro
 cured.    It was with comma Spirilla from this broth cultivation that
 the subsequent experiments were made. When the comma Spirilla
 from the weak cultivations were introduced into various waters, in
 cluding sewage, their presence was, with one exception, no longer
 demonstrable after the first day, whilst the waters inoculated from the
 broth cultivation not only yielded colonies of comma Spirilla on plate
 cultivation after seven days, but during this time slight multiplication
 was exhibited in the potable water, and very extensive multiplication
 in the sewage. Thus —

   These experiments show that in every case the comma Spirilla from
this weak cultivation lost their vitality in twenty-four hours when
introduced into these dilute media. The one case (No. 6 in distilled
water) in which they were subsequently demonstrable, differed from
the others, inasmuch as this was the bottle in which the cultivation
was first attenuated, in fact Nos. 1, 2, and 3 were prepared by dilu
ting No. 6 about 300 times. But even in this first attenuation the
vitality of the organism is seen to be destroyed within nineteen
days, and    similarly the first attenuation,     from which the six last
experimental bottles above were inoculated, was also examined after
nine days, and the comma Spirilla no longer found demonstrable.
   In the following experiments the comma Spirilla employed were
taken from a vigorous cultivation in peptone-broth, the results ob
tained being as follows :-—

            Thus the comma Spirilla from the vigorous cultivation in broth
       was found in every case to flourish in sewage ; on the other hand, in
       deep well-water their vitality was lost in Nos. 1 and 2, whilst in
       Nos. 5 and 6 they were still demonstrable on the ninth day, having in
       the interim undergone considerable reduction in the first instance,
       and then multiplied, although incomparably less than in the sewage
       experiments.
            The first attenuation (in distilled water) from which Nos. 1, 2, 3,
       and 4 above were inoculated                   was also examined on the ninth day,
       and 15,650 colonies obtained from the cubic centimetre.                                Thus,
       although still alive, the reduction in number must have been very
       great, as originally this attenuation must have contained upwards of
       1 million per cubic centimetre.
           Dr. Koch (Second Cholera Conference, May, 1885, " Brit. Med.
       Journ.," January 9, 1886) mentions that Nicati and Bietsch have
       demonstrated the vitality of the comma Spirilla in the harbour water
       of Marseilles after a period of eighty-one days, and that he himself has
       proved them to be still alive in different kinds of water over periods
       of time varying from twenty-four hours to thirty days. From my
       experiments it appears that the behaviour of the Spirillum in different
       waters is largely dependent upon the source from which they are ob

water.

   Similar experiments to those described above were also made with
this organism.      These experiments show that although it possesses
such far greater vital activity in gelatine cultures than Koch's comma
Spirillum, yet when introduced into different kinds of water, including
sewage, its vitality is so rapidly lost that in no single instance have                                            I
been able to demonstrate its presence even after twenty-four hours,
still less to obtain evidence of any multiplication in these media.      In
fact  so perishable does this organism appear  to be when  placed in water,
that I have very frequently been unable to demonstrate its presence
even on the day of inoculation, whilst with the Bacillus pyocyaneus                                                I
have never failed in this manner, and with the comma Spirillum only
rarely.    The following results will serve to illustrate how rapidly this
organism loses its vitality in waters of various kinds : —

   From the differences which these three organisms present in their
 behaviour in water, and in different kinds of water, it is evident how
fallacious must be any conclusions as to the vitality of pathogenic
micro-organisms in general, more especially when such conclusions are
based upon observations made with organisms which are the natural
inhabitants of natural waters, as has often hitherto been the case. It
is obvious that each individual organism must be made the subject of
separate investigation as to its vitality.         To render such investiga
tions complete, it is necessary also that the organisms under examina
tion should be taken from different sources, as from the experiments
which   I  have quoted in the case of the comma Spirilla it is evident
that an initial weakness of the growth from which the inoculation is
made renders the organisms less capable of withstanding the con
ditions of the experiment.         It would also appear probable that this
initial difference in vitality may be the cause of some of the many dis
crepant results which have been obtained by different observers in the
study of antiseptic action.       That there exists a difference in resisting
power according to the virulence or initial vitality of the organisms
themselves     has already been drawn attention to by Dr. Klein
(" Micro-organisms and Disease," 1886).

other waters employed in the above experiments is recorded : —

 XII.    " Observations on Pure Ice and Snow."                   By THOMAS
        Andrews. F.R.S.E., F.C.S., Wortley Iron Works, near
        Sheffield.     Received June 10, 1886.
     The recent very severe winter afforded favourable opportunity and
 material    for investigating some of the properties of ice and snow.
 The object of the following observations was to obtain information on
 the relative conductivity of ice and snow, the dilatation of pure ice,
 and its relative hardness or penetrability at various temperatures.
           Set I. — The Relative Conductivity of Pure Ice and Snow.
     The experiments on the conductivity of the ice were made as fol
  lows : — 47 gallons of distilled water at a temperature of 48° F. were
  placed in a large circular iron tank, A, of the internal dimensions
  given on fig. 1. Around this tank was built a brick enclosure, of
 4 feet 2 inches internal diameter ; an opening was left near the bottom
  for easily removing the expended freezing mixtures. &c. The inter
  mediate space between the iron tank and the brickwork was filled
  with a freezing mixture of snow and salt, maintaining a constant
  temperature      of —4° F. throughout.          18 cwts. of this mixture
  was required for each charge, and the charge was entirely renewed
  every 12 hours during the 115j hours needed to freeze the above
  volume of water.         Thus about 8 tons of freezing mixture was used

for this part of the operation, producing for the experiments a cylin
drical mass of pure ice 2 feet 1^ inches diameter, having a cubic
content of 8-305 feet, and weighing nearly 4 cwts. 22 lbs. A wooden
frame had been securely fixed in the tank to hold the necessary
tubes containing the thermometers.          These were four in number,
and were placed at equal distances between the centre of the cir
cular mass of ice and its circumference, the bulbs being also midway
between the top and bottom as indicated in fig. 1. The thermo-

meters were each protected by iron pipes closed with corks.          The
bulb of each thermometer was immersed in mercury placed at the
bottom of the pipe, the top being also closed airtight by corks.
These thermometers were therefore easily removed, and replaced at
the stated times of observation.        As the water gradually froze, the
arrangement   became securely embedded in the ice.
   A suitable mass of pure ice having been thus obtained, and the
thermometers registering its temperature at 0° P. throughout, the
freezing mixture surrounding the tank was withdrawn and its place
supplied with about 15 cwt. of snow ; the gradual increase in the

temperature of the ice cylinder from exterior to centre until it reached
an uniform temperature of 32° P. was simultaneously periodically
taken by the thermometers Nos. 1, 2, 3, and 4, aud the results are
graphically recorded in Table No. 1. The surface of the ice was kept
covered to a depth of some inches with sawdust.            73£ hours were re
quired for the mass to attain the temperature of 32° F. from
zero (0C  F.).

     time required under equal conditions in each case for the respec

     Temperature surrounding ditto = 32° F.
   The relative conductivity of snow was taken in a similar manner.
An equal volume of fresh fallen snow was placed in the iron tank, A,
and only very lightly pressed to ensure solidity of the snow, but so as
to avoid regelation.     Its weight was 1 cwt. 2 qrs. 14 lbs. The iron
tank was then surrounded by the freezing mixture until the internal

 cylindrical mass of snow was at the uniform temperature of 0° F. The
 freezing mixture was then removed and replaced by about 15 cwt. of
 snow, and the temperature readings regularly taken until the snow
  mass in the tank arrived at one even temperature of 32° F. through
 out. The readings are delineated on Table I.        165£ hours were occu
 pied in arriving at this result.
    The relative conductivity of the ice was thus found to be about
 122 per cent. greater than the snow under the conditions of experi
 mentation.
     Set II.— Dilatation of Ice   between the Temperatures    of — 35° F.
                                and +32°   F.
    In conducting   these experiments, the dilatation of the ice between
 the temperatures of zero (0° F.) and 32° F. was ascertained by the
expansion of the ice measured between two iron bars 1 inch square
 by 19^ inches long, securely embedded to a depth of 13 inches in
 the ice, and perpendicular to its surface, at a distance of 16J inches
 apart.   Two other square iron bars of the same dimensions were also
securely frozen horizontally into the side of the ice cylinder. The
 measurements between the respective sets of iron bars were accurately
 taken by a delicate micro-vernier gauge, the limit of error in reading
 which by the aid of a telescope did not exceed one two-thousandth of
an inch. The gauge was securely placed on a suitable wooden frame,
and thus removed from the influence of the low temperature, so that
all the measurements were taken throughout at exactly the same spot
on the bars. The average of 100 measurements in each case was re
garded as the correct reading, and the results are recorded on Table II.
After the measurements had been taken with the ice at zero (0° F.),
the freezing mixture surrounding the ice tank was removed and re
placed by about 15 cwts. of snow, until the whole mass of ice again
reached the temperature of 32° F.         The relative distances between
the respective sets of bars at the higher temperature of 32° F. were
again taken, and the average of 100 readings regarded as correct.
The dilatation of the ice cylinder, both longitudinal and transversely,
thus obtained between the temperatures of zero (0° F.) and 32° F. is
given on Table II. A difference was observed between the longi
tudinal and transverse dilatation. This was not owing to error in
observation, as the deviation was constantly noticeable during the
course of the measurements.         Certain crystalline bodies dilate un
equally, and   the ice also appeared to behave in a similar manner; the
difference noticed   may, therefore, possibly have been due to the mode
of crystallisation of the cylindrical  mass of ice.
   The observations relating to the    expansion   of ice between —35°    F.
and +32° F. were conducted in a        similar manner: but to obtain the
lower temperature using a freezing      mixture of three parts bv weight

a temperature of —39° F.
    The vessel containing this mixture was itself further surrounded
by another freezing mixture of a constant temperature of —4" F., and
this arrangement was found to work admirably in maintaining a pro
 longed and constant low temperature.                     An alcohol thermometer was
 employed for taking the internal temperatnre of the mass of ice, sub
 stituting a little alcohol at the bottom of the protecting tube instead
of mercury.         The results are contained in Table IT.
    It will be noticed that the coefficients become less as the tempera
ture is reduced.

    The observations were periodically taken during the gradual in
crease in the temperature of the ice cylinder from —35° F. to +32° F.
A polished steel rod, 16 inches long by 0*292 inch diameter, blunt
at the end, was allowed to penetrate the ice under the influence of a
weight of 181-£ lbs. resting on its summit.                  A suitable apparatus was
arranged     to  carry   out   this   set  of   observations,    which is roughly de

    The relative depths to which the steel rod penetrated the ice under
the varied conditions of temperature (which were frequently ascer

which its power of resistance to the penetration of the steel rod rapidly
decreased with the increase of temperature.      It will also be noticed
that the relative contraction and dilatation of the ice between the
extremes of low temperature employed was considerable.         The whole
of the experiments were many times repeated to ensure accuracy, and
it may be observed that above 20 tons of snow and above 7 tons of

varied experiments of the investigation.
XIII.     " On      the     Gaseous      Constituents  of Meteorites." By
    Gerrard Ansdell,                F.C.S., and Prof. James Dewar, F.R.S.
    Received        June        10, 1886.
  The nature of the occluded gases which are present to a greater or
          in all meteorites, whether belonging to the iron, stony, or
less extent
carbonaceous classes, has engaged the attention of but few chemists.
It is, nevertheless, an especially interesting and important subject,
owing to the uncertainty which still exists                    as to the      origin of these
celestial bodies.
  Graham      Proc. Roy. Soc.," vol. 15 (1867), p. 502, was the first
               ("
who made any experiments in this direction, when he determined the
gases occluded in the Lenarto meteoric iron, which yielded 2'85 times
its volume of gas, 86 per cent. of which was hydrogen, and 4-5 per

550              Mr. G. Ansdell and Prof.      J. Dewar.       [June     10,
cent, carbonic   oxide.  He was followed in 1872 by Wcihler (" Pogg.
Ann.," vol. 146, p. 297) and Berthelot (" Compt. rend.," vol. 74, pp.
48, 119), who estimated approximately the gases contained in the
Greenland Ovifak iron. These gases consisted of about equal parts
of carbonic acid and carbonic oxide ; the celestial origin of this iron is,
however, very doubtful.
   In the same year (1872) the American chemist, Mallet (" Proc.
Roy. Soc," vol. 20, p. 365), made a very complete determination of the
gases occluded by the Augusta Co., Virginia, meteoric iron, which,
however, differed very considerably       from Graham's results.         He
obtained an amount of gas equal to 3'17 times the volume of the       iron,
made up of 35'83 per cent, of hydrogen, 38'33 per cent, carbonic oxide,
9"75 per cent, of carbonic acid, and 16'09 per cent, of nitrogen.
   Wright and Lawrence Smith followed Mallet, and our present know
ledge of this interesting subject is principally due to these American
chemists.   They have taken advantage of the numerous meteoric
masses which have fallen from time to time throughout America,
and which can easily be obtained in sufficient quantity for complete
and accurate observations on their gaseous constituents.
                                                                       "
   Wright contributed several papers to the " American Journal in
1875 and 1876, and, according to his analyses, the total volume of gas
occluded and the composition of the same differs considerably in the
two principal classes of meteorites.     He found the total volume of
gas extracted   was  much   greater in the  case of the stony meteorites
than in the iron ones, the principal characteristics of these gases
being, that in the former the carbonic acid greatly predominated,
accompanied by a comparatively small amount of carbonic oxide and
hydrogen, whereas in the latter the carbonic acid never exceeded
20 per cent., the carbonic   oxide being, as a rule, considerably    more
than this, and the hydrogen sometimes reaching as high as 80 per cent.
   It is impossible, however, to arrive at anything more than general
 conclusions as to the total amount of gas given off by any special
meteorite, or its composition, for, as shown by Wright and confirmed
by ourselves, both the total quantity and composition of the gases
vary very considerably according to the temperature at which they
are drawn off.
   Wright found a notable qnantity of marsh-gas in all the stony
meteorites which he examined, though not a trace in any of the iron
ones ; this seemed to be a distinctive difference between the two
classes of meteorites, but subsequently Dr. Flight, of the British
Museum (" Phil. Trans.," vol. 173 (1882), p. 885), found marsh-gas
in a specimen of the Cranbourne siderite, so that it is evident certain
of the iron meteorites also contain this gas.
   Lawrence Smith (" Amer. Jonrn.," 1876) confined himself princi
pally to an examination of the graphite nodules which are frequently

 1886.]         On   the Gaseous Constituents  of  Meteorites.         551
found imbedded in the iron meteorites, and to the nature of the
carbon in the so-called carbonaceous meteorites.         He extracted the
organic   or  hydrocarbon-like    bodies by means   of  ether, but did not
determine the gases given off on heating.         Previous to this, Roscoe
("  Pro. Phil.  Soc.   Man.," 1862) had  obtained  the same hydrocarbon
like body by exhausting the Alais meteorite with ether, but the
quantity he had to work upon was so small that he could not make a
very complete examination.
   These are some of the principal points that have been made out
with regard to the gases occluded by meteorites. The results, however,
are so comparatively few, that we thought it worth while to take the
opportunity which presented itself, of having several good specimens
of meteorites at our disposal, to confirm these results, and, if possible,
add something to our present knowledge of the subject.
   The investigation may be divided into five parts, having the follow
ing objects in view : firstly, the confirmation of previous results by the
examination of some well-known meteorite ; secondly, the analysis of
several whole meteoric stones, whose interior had never been exposed
to the effects of the atmosphere, by reason of the characteristic coating
of glaze ; thirdly, the examination of a celestial graphite nodule, taken
from the interior of an iron meteorite ; fourthly, the comparison of
some meteorite of the carbonaceous class with the above; and, fifthly,
the examination of different terrestrial graphites.
   The method employed for the abstraction of the gases was exactly
the same in every case, so that a short description will suffice for all.
The temperature was kept as nearly as possible the same in every
experiment, but no doubt differences of many degrees occurred in
some of the experiments, which was unavoidable in nsing an ordinary
combustion furnace.
   The meteorite or graphite, as the case might be, was broken up into
a coarse powder, introduced into a convenient length of combustion
tubing, and connected up with a Sprengel pump, a small bulb-tube
immersed     in a freezing    mixture intervening, so as to retain any
moisture or condensable volatile products that might come off.        The
tube was first thoroughly exhausted and then heated in an ordinary
gas combustion furnace to a low red heat. The gases, during the
heating, were gradually drawn off by the Sprengel, and when the tube
had remained for several minutes at a low red heat it was completely
exhausted. The total quantity of gas collected was in every case used
for the analysis.
   The " Dhurmsala specimen was an ordinary fragment of a much
                        "
larger original mass, but in the case of the Pultusk and Mocs
meteorites, we were fortunate in obtaining complete stones, weighing
respectively 57 and 103 grams, having the characteristic black glaze
on their surfaces.

552                 Mr. G. Ansdell and Prof.        J.  Dewar.        [June 10,
    Sucli  a large  quantity of water was condensed in the bulb tube in
heating the Dhurmsala meteorite, it being the first one examined, that
it was thought it might be principally due to the great absorptive
power of these porous bodies, and that therefore the moisture might
have been condensed in the pores of the meteorite from the surround
ing air. The Pultusk and Mocs specimens appeared to be especially
adapted for ascertaining whether this was the case, as the complete
covering of black glaze would probably prevent the moisture from
penetrating to the interior of the stones.             The fragments of ihese
stones were therefore transferred as quickly as possible to the com
bustion tube after they had been broken up.               Notwithstanding these
precautions, fully     as  much water was condensed from them as from the
Dhurmsala specimen, which seems to suggest that the water is really
combined in some form in the stone and not obtained directly from
the surrounding atmosphere, although it must be admitted that the
glaze on both the stones was not of a very glossy character, and did
not have the appearance of being absolutely impervious to moisture.
    The pumice-stone was examined merely with a view to comparing
 the gases occluded by a porous body of volcanic origin with those
contained in meteorites.         The sample taken was a fresh piece of stone,
 which had not been dried or purified in any way.
    It is evident that it differs considerably from the meteoric stones,
 the total occluded gas being very small, only about half its volume,
 the carbonic acid at the same time being much less with a propor
 tionate increase in the carbonic oxide.
     The general method of analysis was as follows, and the accuracy of
 the results was confirmed by varying in some cases the method of
  separating the gases.       The carbonic acid was first removed from the
  mixture by caustic potash, the carbonic oxide being then absorbed by
  subchloride of copper, and the remainder of the gases exploded with
  excess of oxygen.       The carbonic acid formed was again removed by
  caustic potash,    and   the excess of oxygen by alkaline pyrogallate, the
  residue being taken as nitrogen.         The relative quantities of marsh-gas
  and hydrogen were calculated from the total diminution after explo
  sion, and the amount of carbonic acid formed          : —

   It will  be seen that the above numbers are quite confirmatory of
Wright's results, the carbonic acid in the three meteorites examined
being by far the largest constituent, while marsh-gas in considerable
quantity was found in all. The percentage of this latter gas is some
what higher than that found by Wright in the stony meteorites he
examined,     but this is probably due to the fact that a rather higher
temperature     was employed by us to drive off the gases.           This
supposition seems to be confirmed on considering the analysis of
the Pultusk meteorite, which is the only one examined both by
Wright and ourselves ; for whereas his abstracted gas only reached
1*75 times the volume of the stone, the total quantity of gas obtained
by us was twice as much or equal to 3-54 times its volume.
   It is therefore unquestionable that marsh-gas is given off ou heating
these meteoric stones, but whether it exists as such occluded in the
material, or whether it is formed by some chemical decomposition of
some organic constituent of the mass is by no means clear.
   Wright came to the conclusion " that the marsh-gas really oxisted
as such in the stony meteorites, as the temperature at which it was
driven off would be too low for its formation," at the same time ho
thinks it quite possible that " at very much higher temperatures, in
the reaction by which the carbonic acid is broken up by the iron, a
portion of the carbon might combine with the hydrogen present to
form marsh-gas."
   We shall return to this question of the formation of marsh-gas, after
we have described the experiments in the various forms of graphite.
    Knowing the great absorptive power for gases possessed by porous
 bodies generally, it was thought advisable to determine directly what
 this absorptive power was in the case of these stony meteorites,
 which are of such an eminently porous nature.
    For this purpose the powdered Dhurmsala meteorite, from which
the gases had been removed, was left in moist air under a bell glass,
 for different periods of time as tabulated below, the gases being drawn
off at a low red heat after each period :—

    After 8 days more    ....    0-63       961     20         1-5   —
    The absorption of water and gases evidently went on tolerably
rapidly for the first seven days, but after the second heating of the
 meteorite, its porosity seems to have been affected in some way, for
after a further period of eight days, we find it taking up only about a
fourth of the quantity of gas which it had absorbed in the previous
six days.

 554              Mr. G. Ansdell and Prof.      J.  Dewar.         [June  10,
   The actual amount of water given off after this exposure to        a moist
atmosphere     was considerably    less than what was obtained in the
original heating of the meteorite, and from this we infer that the
 water is chemically combined in the stone. It would be difficult to
 explain, otherwise than by chemical combination, the power by which
 the water is retained by these meteorites, as it is not given off until a
 very high temperature is reached.        In any case it is clear that the
 hydrogen    must  come  from    the  action of water on the iron nickel
alloy, or finely disseminated carbon.       Greville Williams has pointed
out that the large amount of hydrogen obtained from heating finely
divided zinc-dust is not due to free hydrogen, but to the action of the
zinc on the hydrated oxide of zinc.
   We now pass on to the consideration           of  the various    graphites
examined. The celestial graphite was a perfect oblong nodule weighing
30 grams, which had been taken from the interior of a mass of the
Toluca meteoric iron. It had a uniform dull-black colour, except at
one   end where there was a slight incrustation of sulphide of iron. Its
fracture showed a uniform dull black, compact mass ; it was easily
 poanded up in a porcelain mortar, and formed a fine granular powder
without any lustre.
   On extracting the  gases from this specimen a considerable quantity
of marsh-gas was obtained, so that it appeared to us most important
to compare it with some samples of terrestrial graphites, more espe
cially as the occluded gases   had, to our knowledge,     never before been
determined in these bodies.
   For this purpose four samples of native graphites were obtained.
The Cumberland graphite was a magnificent specimen of the original
Borrodale, and had been in a private cabinet for over fifteen years. It
had the characteristic    dense homogeneous structure, and brilliant
external   lustre of the graphites coming from this district.            The
Siberian   example  was  from   the  Alexandref    Mine ;  its structure was
columnar and striated, with little external lustre ; it was rather more
easily broken up than the Borrodale, but formed the same dull black
powder.     The specimen from Ceylon was of the type usual to that
island ; highly lustrous and flaky, breaking up very easily, and
forming small shining plates when ground up. The last sample,
which was from the same cabinet as the others, but whose origin
was unfortunately unknown, had a dull external surface, was exceed
ingly porous, and much more brittle than any of the previous ones,
grinding up very easily into a dull black powder.           It had more the
appearance of the celestial graphites, which was heightened by having
slight incrustations of sulphide of iron in its surface. Its low specific
gravity also shows it to be some exceptional variety.
   It seemed to us most important in connexion with this subject to
examine some matrix with which the graphites are usually found

associated.        These rocks are very variable, but consist principally of a
 kind of decomposed trap or gneiss. We succeeded in obtaining a good
specimen of semi-decomposed gneiss from Canada with a consider
able quantity of graphite disseminated throughout the mass, and also
several samples of Ceylon graphite imbedded in its matrix, which in
this case consisted of felspar and quartz.
    The results, as tabulated below, confirm Wright's analyses of
several trap rocks, in which he found principally carbonic acid and
hydrogen.        The small quantity of marsh-gas no doubt comes from
the disseminated graphite, but. the presence of the hydrogen is more
difficult to explain and requires further investigation.

    On comparing these samples of graphite, it will be seen that the
Borrodale and the Siberian give off about the same total volume of
gas, that the celestial and the unknown graphites closely approximate
each other in this respect, yielding more than double the volume of
the others, and that the Ceylon sample stands alone in yielding a very
minute quantity. All the terrestrial samples, except that from Ceylon,
are alike in giving off a very considerable quantity of marsh-gas,
though they differ somewhat in the actual quantity, and it is evident
that, although the celestial graphite contains a considerable amount,
it is very much less than that yielded by the terrestrial samples.
    A few tentative experiments were made to ascertain the absorbing
power for gases of this celestial graphite.            For this purpose dry car
bonic acid, marsh-gas, and hydrogen were respectively drawn through
the tube containing the previously exhausted graphite for twelve
hours in the cold, the gases being pumped out at a low red heat after
each treatment with the dry gas. After the carbonic acid treatment
the volume of gas collected was only 1-1 times that of the graphite,
containing 98'4 per cent. of carbonic acid ; after the marsh-gas the
volume of the gas was only 0'9 that of the graphite, containing 94' 1
per cent. carbonic acid        ;  and after the hydrogen the volume of the gas

 556              Mr. G. Ansdell and Prof.         J.  Dewar.          [June   10,
collected was only 0'17 times that of the graphite, containing 95-0 per
cent. of carbonic acid.    It is therefore evident that the large quantity
of gas occluded     in celestial graphites cannot be explained by any
special absorptive power of this variety of carbon.            In view of the
 large and varying percentages of marsh-gas in the gaseous products
of all these graphites, it appeared to us of especial interest to
ascertain whether the quantity of marsh-gas extracted coincided in
any way with the hydrogen obtained by their combustion.                We there
fore submitted all the samples to ultimate analysis, with the following
results : —

    These analyses do not seem to point to any very definite conclusion
as to the origin of the marsh-gas.            The unknown graphite, which
contains the largest percentage of marsh-gas, certainly comes out far
the highest in hydrogen, and the hydrogen in the Ceylon graphite
also bears a certain     relation to the small quantity of marsh-gas             it
contains, but the first three samples are very similar to each other            in
the amount of hydrogen they contain.
    In order to get some further insight into the origin of this marsh-
gas in the celestial graphite, about 2 grams of the original nodule
were very finely ground up and digested for several hours with
strong nitric acid. After being thoroughly washed from every trace
of nitric acid and dried at 110° C, it was again submitted to analysis,
with the result that the amount of hydrogen remained exactly the
same as before, proving that it existed in the form of some very
stable compound in the graphite.
    To clear up this matter still further, about 10 grams of the original
nodule were digested with pure ether in the way described by Law
rence Smith for extracting the hydrocarbon-like bodies.                    It was
allowed to stand for twenty-four hours with excess of ether, and then
filtered, and washed with more ether.          The graphite thus treated was
dried at 110° C, and the gases extracted from it.
    For the purpose of comparing one of the terrestrial graphites with
the above in regard to its behaviour with ether, the specimen of
unknown origin was selected, as yielding the largest quantity of
marsh-gas.     The residue, after digestion with ether, was dried, and
the gases pumped oat as before.
    It will be seen that by this treatment with ether the volume of gas

given off by the celestial graphite, and also the marsh-gas, have been
reduced to rather more than one-half, while with regard to the un
known graphite, although the total volume of gas remains about the
same (probably due to a rather higher temperature                         being em
ployed),    the marsh-gas has also been reduced to rather less than one-
third the original amount, and the hydrogen has correspondingly
increased.

    These experiments prove that either the ether did not dissolve out
all the actual carbonaceous compounds present, or that the marsh-gas
was subsequently formed during the heating of the graphite.
    As Dr. De La Rue had kindly placed at our disposal a splendid
specimen of the Orgueil meteorite, we took the opportunity of com
paring the gases occluded by this typical specimen of the carbonaceous
class with those obtained from the stony meteorites and the graphites.
This meteorite has been so thoroughly examined by Cloez and Pisani
(" Compt. rend.," vol. 59 (1864), pp. 37, 132) with regard to its
chemical     inorganic constituents, that nothing need be said as to its
general composition.          We therefore confined ourselves to the gases
given off on heating which had not previously been determined.
    During tho heating of the meteorite a large quantity of water, on
which floated numerous small pieces of sulphur, collected in the bulb
tube immersed in the freezing mixture. This water was strongly acid,
and indeed smelt strongly of sulphurous acid.                  On evaporating it to
dryness    with   a  drop  of  hydrochloric     acid,  abundance     of ammoniacal
salts were found in the residue.          In the cool anterior part of the com
bustion-tube     a  considerable   sublimate    had collected, which proved to
be principally sulphate of ammonium with traces of sulphides and
sulphites, and a large quantity of free sulphur. A very large quan
tity of gas was given off, having the following composition: —

 Sulphurous acid is evidently the main constituent of the gases given
 off ; but if we eliminate this gas, which has been formed from the
 decomposition of the sulphate of iron, we find the meteorite yields
 9 8 times its volume of gas, having very much the same composition
 as that from some of the stony meteorites, mz- : —

 ClOez found the organic matter in this meteorite to be composed of
carbon 63-45, hydrogen 5'98, oxygen 30'57, which is nearly in the
proportions of a terrestrial humus substance.              We know such sub
stances break up by the action of heat into gases of the nature found
above, at the same time, however, a quantity of the carbonic acid
undoubtedly comes from the presence of the carbonates of magnesium
and iron.     The operation by which terrestrial carbon has been
changed into graphite is by no means clear.            As a rule the transition
of one kind of carbon into another necessitates the action of a very
high temperature.      If, therefore, a really high temperature is in all
cases necessary, it is difficult to explain how compounds of carbon
came to resist decomposition, and should come to be found associated
with all natural graphites.
    We may assume that the graphite resulted from the action of
water, gases and other agents, on the carbides of the metals, and that
during the chemical interactions which took place, a portion of the
carbon became transformed into organic compounds.
    In either case we are led to the conclusion that the method of for
mation of the meteoric and terrestrial graphites was similar, and it is
perfectly possible they may after all have come from a common
source.
    We purpose continuing this investigation, and in order to acquire
further information, it is our intention to examine the gases given off
from meteorites at definite temperatures, and especially the gases
from such as can be found coated with an impervious glaze, and to
examine more particularly into the presence of water in such bodies,
and the source of the nitrogen found in the same.
                                       Note.
    Since the above analyses of different graphites were made, we have
examined a sample of the artificial graphite which results from the
action of oxidising agents in the cyanogen compounds present in
crude caustic soda.    The following analysis shows that this artificial

     Communicated by Prof. H. N. Moseley, F.R.S. Received
     June    10, 1886.
   In  1872 Leydig* described a structure in Lacerta agilis, L. muralis,
L.                                                                        "
    vivipara, and Anguis fragilis, to which he gave the name of frontal
organ."
   In the embryo, owing to its being deeply pigmented, it forms a
prominent feature on the roof of the original forebrain in connexion
with the pineal gland ; in the adult it lies immediately beneath the
skin, and, according to him and subsequent observers, completely sepa
rated from the brain.
   In Anguis fragilis    the organ is seen microscopically to consist of long
cells like those of    a cylindrical epithelium, which are so arranged that
together they form a shallow pit with a circular outline.              The edge of
the pit is  directed   downwards,     and has a thick black   girdle of pigment.
It corresponds in position to that occupied by the parietal foramen
in the adult.
    Leydig regarded our knowledge of the organ as insufficient to allow
of any statement being made with regard to its function.
    Rabl-Ruekhard,t in 1882, describing the development of the pineal
gland in the trout, pointed out the resemblance between its develop
 ment as a hollow outgrowth of the brain and that of the optic
 vesicles.
    Granted such secondary developments from the epiblast and meso-
 blast as combine to produce the eye, and which are absent in the case
 of the pineal gland, though the distal extremity of the latter lies in a

favourable position immediately beneath the epiblast, and, be states,
there is no difficulty in the way of the idea that an nnpaired sense
organ similar to the eye would be developed out of the pineal gland.
   Ablborn* also, in 1882, independently arrived at the conclusion
that the epiphysis is to be regarded as the remains of an nnpaired
median eye, founding this conclusion upon general considerations,
such as the agreement in origin of the eye vesicles and the epiphysis
as hollow outgrowths of the brain, the connexion of the epiphysis
with the eye region of the brain (especially the optic thalami), and
the peripherally directed position of the structure in Selachian Ganoids
and Petromyzon, and the completely peripheral position in Amphibia
on the outside of the skull.          He even goes so far as to suggest a
comparison      of this structure  with   the unpaired eye of Amphioxus and
Tunicates.
    More lately Henri de Graaff has published an outline of his
results in studying the development of the epiphysis in Amphibia, and
its structure in the adult Lacerta agilis and Anguis fragilis.
    He agrees with Strahl and Hoffmann in stating that the " frontal
        " of
organ          Leydig is the distal part of the epiphysis completely sepa
rated off from the proximal.
    He describes in detail the structure of the organ in Anguis, where
it develops, he says, into a structure very similar to a highly
organised invertebrate eye, as that of Cephalopoda, Pteropods, and
Heteropods.
    The following is a preliminary notice of results obtained recently
by studying the structure of the organ in various forms of lizards, at
the suggestion of Prof. Moseley, and by means of materials procured
for the purpose with great kindness by him from various sources.                J

                            (1.) External Appearance.
     The organ is Bituated upon the dorsal surface in the median line,
 and at varying distances posterior to the level of the paired eyes ; the
 presence or absence of an external indication of the organ can be by
 no means relied upon as indicating the existence or non-existence of the
 structure in a highly developed state. In many cases, as Varanus Ben-
 galensia, the various species of Calotes and Lacerta ocelluta, the organ is
 marked externally by the presence of a specially modified scale, usually
 considerably larger than the surrounding ones, and with a circular
 patch of pigment behind the whole resembling a cornea.                   Being
 transparent, and forming the anterior boundary of a capsule con
 taining the organ, the appearance of a dark pupil surrounded by a
light circle is produced. On the other hand, as in Plica umbra or
 Cyclodus (sp.), a more or less highly specialised scale may be present,
 but the organ beneath be not highly developed ; or again, as in
 Hatteria, there may be no special scale, but only a general trans
 parency in the median line immediately above the organ, which may
 nevertheless be in a highly developed state.
                           (2.) Position of  the Organ.
    The organ may lie at different levels imbedded more or less deeply
 in connective tissue beneath the skin, or even within the skull cavity,
but is always placed external to the dura mater. It always has a
 definite relationship to the parietal foramen usually lying within this.
 In Calotes it is placed immediately beneath the specially modified scale        ;
 in most forms, snch as Varanus, Seps, Anolius, Leiodera, &c, it lies
 within the foramen, and separated by specially modified connective
 tissue from the skin. In Hatteria it lies on the inner side of the
foramen, which is filled up by a plug of connective tissue, and in
Lacerta ocellata the bone around the foramen is modelled to fit closely
to the outline of the organ and the connective tissue surrounding
this.
                          (3.) Structure of  the Organ.
    It may be said at once that Leydig's       "frontal organ " resembles in
essential structure an invertebrate eye.
    This resemblance    has lately been clearly pointed out by Graaf, in the
case   of  Anguis fragilis,  and is found to hold good for many others.
He in common with all previous observers regards the organ as the
been   allowed to examine duplicate specimens of ten species from the British
Museum ; they are not all described in this communication, but will be dealt with
more fully subsequently. By Professor C. Stewart's kindmsa also I  have been able
to examine duplicate specimens of Iguana and Varanus from the museum of the
Royal College of Surgeons.

distal portion of the epiphysis, which becomes completely separated
off from the proximal portion of the same, and lies completely sur
rounded by connective tissue in the parietal foramen.         If in contact
with    a nerve, as  frequently happens according to Graaf in Amphibia,
then the nerve in question is a subcutaneous branch of the ramus
supramaxillaris of the trigeminal.
    It is difficult to imagine why a single medianly placed organ should
be supplied in any way by a branch from one only of two paired
lateral nerves.
    The two most important facts established       by the present series of
observations are —
    (1.) That Leydig's "frontal organ" exists as a structure comparable
to an invertebrate eye, widely distributed amongst Lacertilians.           1 1
may, in reference to its position and structure, be perhaps best called
the pineal eye.
    (2.) That the eye is connected by a medianly placed nerve with the
proximal portion of the epiphysis, and thus with the dorsal surface of
the brain in the median line.
    There can be further little doubt that this nerve is the remains of
the part connecting the distal with the proximal part of the epiphysis,
 that it is in other words formed as the optic nerve from a hollow
outgrowth of the brain, which subsequently becomes solid.
    The structure of the oye in two or three typical cases is as
 follows : —
                     —
     (a.) Hatteria. In this form the organ is well developed, and being
 through Prof. Moseley's kindness enabled to procure a fresh specimen,
 it has been possible to determine the elements comprising tbe optic
 vesicle.
     In all the  eyes yet examined  a lens is  present.  Von Graaf figures
 it in Anguis as separated from the hinder part of the vesicle, but this
 does not hold good for any of those examined during the course of this
 work. The lens, on the contrary, appears to be only the modified
 anterior portion of the optic vesicle with the hinder walls of which
 it is directly continuous.      In Hatteria it is somewhat cone-shaped,
  with a broad base corresponding to the anterior surface of the vesicle ;
 it is distinctly cellular, the nuclei being well marked, and the cells
 having a definite arrangement.
     The walls of the vesicle posterior to the lens consist of the following
  elements : — (1.) A layer of rods bordering the vesicle internally,
  deeply imbedded in dark pigment, arranged as seen when the rods are
  separated so as to give the latter a clearly marked striated appearance.
  (2.) External to these is a layer composed of rounded nucleated
  elements, two, and in fact possibly three, rows deep. (3.) External to
 this what may be called a molecular layer, consisting of finely punc
 tated material, through which seems to run a supporting structure ;

 1886.]                (hi the Median Eye in Lizards.                    563
 processes from the structures on both sides of the layer seem to run
into its substance. (4.) External to the molecular layer an outer part,
in which three kinds of elements may be distinguished : (a) round
nucleated cells, somewhat larger than those of the inner layer ; (b)
rod-like structures, somewhat conically shaped, with their broad ends
external   ; (c) small nucleated spindle-shaped   elements, placed between
the latter at their   bases.   (5.) Though difficult to trace, a fine layer
of nerve fibres appear to spread round the vesicle from the nerve
which enters it at the surface nearest the epiphysis.         The elements
are connected serially, though processes from the rods may be seen
passing at times directly into the molecular layer, or the rod elements
externally, or even right through to the external surface. Such pro
cesses are accompanied by pigment, and may in some cases merely
indicate supporting structures.
    In Hatteria, as in other forms, a special bundle of rods lying in the
optic axis is highly developed, being much lengthened out and
running down into the nerve, their outer extremities being in connexion
with a particular group of nucleated cells.
    Von Graaf describes in Anguis a layer of small rod-like structures,
similar apparently to those found in many invertebrate eyes, though he
is not certain as to their nature. In Hatteria and other forms examined,
the vesicle appears to have been filled during life by a fluid material,
and this in coagulating adheres to the wall. The coagulation often
apparently sets in from definite points, and these being the ends of
 rods, gives the appearance, under certain conditions of light, of
 refracted processes attached to these structures.
    The nerve enters the vesicle posteriorly, certain fibres appear to enter
 into connexion with the cells connected with the specialised rods, the
remainder spread out around the external surface of the vesicle, and
here    enter   into connexion with the elements, that is, the rods
bound the internal surface of the vesicle, and the nerve-fibres the
external.
    The nerve, whilst differing in appearance from an ordinary one,
yet resembles more closely than anything else the developing optic
nerve, being formed of long spindle-shaped elements, which recall the
stage passed through when the at first round cellular elements of the
optic stalk are gradually lengthening out. The nerve in both cases
developes in a similar manner.
   The whole eye lies in a special capsule of connective tissue into which
enters and breaks up a blood-vessel, this vessel being present in con
nexion with the eye in all Lacertilia examined, even in those in which
a nerve could not be distinctly traced.

the surface, and so shut in by bone that it may be said to lie within

part of the vesicle apparently.          The retinal elements are imbedded
in pigment, and, save the rods, are difficult to detect, though by care
ful examination two rows of round nucleated cells may be detected.
The pigment obscures the nerve, which is nothing like so clearly-
marked      as  in Hatteria, due largely to the dura mater encasing the
 eye so closely that no capsule is formed.
    The nerve enters posteriorly, and a slight differentiation of the rods
at two points may be noticed, the nerve appearing to divide into two
just before entering the eye ; it passes down, lying in the dura mater
to join the proximal part of the epiphj'sis, which is itself deeply pig
mented.
    The blood-vessel accompanying the nerve is well developed.
    (c.) Iguana.
                   — The structure agrees in the main with that of Hatteria,
 though, owing to the eye being not so well preserved as in the latter,
the elements cannot be so clearly differentiated.        The lens is cellular,
 and somewhat similarly shaped to that of Hatteria ; the rods are as
 usual deeply pigmented, and external to them may be detected (1) a
 row of round nucleated cells ; (2) a well-marked molecular layer, in
 which the nucleated cells are often embedded; and (3) an outermost
 layer of cone-shaped bodies, similar to those of Hatteria.
    The rods in the optic axis are again lengthened out and prominent,
 running down into the nerve.
    The eye lies in a capsule of connective tissue within the foramen,
 and into the same space passes also a hollow process from the
 epiphysis, into which the nerve enters.
    In another Iguana examined the process appears not to be hollow,
 and the eye, instead of lying in a capsule, is closely invested by con
 nective tissue.
    In both    cases the vesicle is filled with a coagulation, indicating the
 presence    of  a fluid material in life.
    (d.) Anolius (sp. ?). — The eye lies close beneath the skin, and almost
 entirely fills up the parietal foramen, the remainder being occupied
 by vacuolated tissue, in which large nucleated cells are present at
 intervals,   together with branching pigment cells.
    The eye is elongated in the direction of the optic axis, and provided
 with a nerve running back through the vacuolate tissue and entering
 the proximal part of the epiphysis.
    Pigment is largely developed, ensheathing all the elements of the
 retina ; the rods may be traced into rounded elements ; these again
 externally into cone-shaped elements. The rods in the optic axis are
 again modi fled and prominent, and their ends facing into the vesicle
 appear striated.

1886.]                 On  the Median Eye in Lizards.                 565
    The lens is cellular, and has a slight development of pigment in some
of its cells in the optic axis.
    Special connective tissue fibres pass, as in some other forms, from
the capsule to the edge of the lens.
    (e.) Leiodera nitida.
                           — This may be taken as the type of several
forms, such as Galotes ophiomaca and versicola and Seps chalcidica,
in which the eye is lengthened out in a direction at right angles to the
optic axis. The lens is distinctly cellular, and continuous with the
hinder walls of the vesicle. The retinal elements consist of (1) rods ;
 (2) a layer of round nucleated cells ; (3) a well marked clear space,
corresponding in position to the molecular layer ; and (4) an external
layer of cone-shaped elements.
    In these forms a nerve cannot be detected with certainty, though
 very possibly with freshly killed specimens its presence might be
demonstrated.
    In   Leiodera the scale above the eye is beautifully modified, and a
 transparent dome-shaped cornea developed, sections showing that the
 pigment is absent from the scale in this region, though very abun
 dantly developed elsewhere.
    (/.) Varanus Bengalensis and giganteus. — The eye in these forms
 will be dealt with fully on a subsequent occasion ; at present one point
 only will be mentioned.       In two specimens examined (perhaps of dif
 ferent species of Varanus) the connexion with the proximal part of
 the epiphysis was of an importantly different nature ; in one it was
 in the form of a hollow process, in the other of a solid stalk, much
 as in Hatteria.
    There can be no doubt that the connecting parts in the two instances
 are equivalent to each other.
     (g.) Cyclodus gigas (?). — This may be taken as the type of those
 forms, in which no structure comparable to an eye is at present found.
 The distal extremity of the epiphysis is swollen out, the cells of its
 walls, which are thrown into folds, become shaped like those of cylin
 drical epithelium, and amongst them pigment is deposited, but no
 true retina is formed, or any structure comparable to a lens.
    The distal swollen part of the epiphysis is enveloped in pigment in
 the dura mater, some distance in front of the proximal part, with
 which it is connected by a hollow process. The whole structure lies
 on the inner side of the cranium, closely fitted to the bone, as in
 Lacerta ocellata.
     The scale on the surface of the head is imperfectly modified  to form
  a cornea, and has the appearance of degenerating.
