                                       (Abstract.)
  Notwithstanding the labour bestowed by many eminent men on the
chemistry of urine during the last sixty years, there are portions of the
subject of which we have but a very imperfect knowledge.        Of all the
properties of urine, none is more obvious, even to  the ordinary observer,
than its colour ; and yet very little is known concerning the chemical na
ture of the substances to which its colour is due. Our ignorance in this
respect may be ascribed to various causes, among which may be mentioned
the extremely minute quantities of these substances occurring in the se
cretion, the facility with which some of them are decomposed, their che
mical and physical properties (which present to our notice very little that
is characteristic), and, lastly, the little interest which they possess for the
chemist,  notwithstanding their importance from a physiological and patho
logical point of view.   According to the author, the colouring-matters
peculiar to urine may be divided into three classes, viz. —
      1st. Those which are only found occasionally in      in consequence
                                                                    it,

    The first  class  is again subdivided by the author into blue, purple or
 red, and black or brown colouring-matters.              The appearance of a blue
 colouring-matter      in  urine has  been  frequently observed, both in ancient
 and modern times. By some it has been taken for indigo-blue, by others
 for prussian blue, while several chemists maintain that it consists of a pe
 culiar substance, to which the name of cyanourine has been applied.            The
 red colouring-matter is generally found in association with deposits of
 urate of ammonia and urate of soda, to which it communicates a pink or
 carmine tinge.      Proust called it rosacic acid, while recent observers have
 given it other names, such as uroerythrine and purpurine. Very little is
 known regarding its true chemical nature.            Prout, indeed, suggested that
 it might be identical with purpurate of ammonia ; but he advanced no
 good grounds in support of this view, and it was proved to be erroneous
 by Berzelius.     Instances of black urine are even of rarer occurrence than
 those of urine coloured blue.         Indeed in many cases the black colour
 appears to have been due to red or purple pigments which communicated
 to the urine so deep a tint as to make it appear black.           The melanic acid
 of Prout seems, however, to have been a peculiar substance, though closely
 resembling, as remarked by Berzelius, the black pulverulent substance
 which is formed by the action of concentrated acids on the extractive
 matters of urine.
    The  second class    of urinary colouring-matters,      comprising those which
are formed by artificial      means and therefore do not preexist in the secre
tion, may also be subdivided according to colour — those which have hitherto
 been observed being either blue, red, or brown.              The author concedes
to Heller the merit of having first obtained from urine by artificial means
colouring-matters     of  a pure blue or red   tint ;  but the true nature of these
colouring-matters, as well as of the process by which they are formed, was
 not understood by him. Subsequent researches have proved that the
uroglaucine and urorhodine of Heller are identical with the indigo-blue and
indigo-red obtained from vegetables. After mentioning the experiments
of Hassall, who observed the formation in morbid urine of a blue colour
ing-matter which       he showed to be indigo-blue,        the author refers to his
own researches.       In  a paper published several     years ago, he showed that
urine contained as a never-failing constituent a body closely resembling if
not identical with indican, the indigo-producing body of vegetables, and
that hence the formation of indigo-blue and indigo-red from urine might
easily be explained.       This result has been confirmed by Carter and others.
The formation of brown colouring-matters by the action of acids on urine
was first observed by Proust, who obtained by this means a brown resinous
body and a black pulverulent substance.               The same or similar bodies
were obtained by Scharling and Liebig, as well as the author, who gave a
general account of them in the memoir just referred to. The simultaneous
formation of glucose, or at least of a body having the same action on oxide
of copper   as glucose, is a fact first observed by the author.       From an exa

  urination of the composition of the brown pulverulent substance resulting
  from the action   of strong acids on urine, the author infers that it may be
  expressed by the formula C14 H, N04, which is also that of anthranilic
  acid, a product of decomposition of indigo-blue.          All these products (the
  resin, the brown pulverulent substance which has received the name of
  uromelanine, and the glucose) are, in the author's opinion, derived from the
  extractive matter of urine, which by decomposition with acids yields these
  and perhaps other products.       The conclusion formerly arrived at by the
  author, viz.  " that the indigo-producing body will be found, as regards
 its formation and composition, to occupy a place between the substance of
 the tissues and the ordinary extractive matter of urine," is one which fur
 ther research, as the author thinks,     has only tended to confirm.
     The urinary colouring-matters belonging to the third class, consisting of
 those to which the ordinary colour of the secretion is due, have been less fre
 quently submitted     to investigation than those which make their appearance
 ouly exceptionally    or in consequence of some artificial process of decompo
 sition.   This circumstance may easily be accounted for. These so-called co
 louring-matters are all amorphous, and possess few characteristic properties ;
 hence their separation from the other constituents of urine is attended with
 great difficulties, and has even been pronounced impossible.          They are also
 compounds of very little stability — so much so that mere evaporation of
the urine seems to produce a complete change in their composition, as is seen
by the marked change of colour which takes place during the process.
The opinions entertained on the subject by the earlier chemists, such as
Fourcroy and Vauquelin and Proust, having been referred to, the author
gives a short account of the experiments of Uerzelius, Duvernoy, Lehmann,
Scherer, Harley, Tichborne, and Thudichum.                 Berzelius and Lehmann
both found the substance to which healthy urine owes its colour to be
completely soluble in water. Subsequently, however, most of the attempts
which were made to isolate the colouring-matter of urine ended in the
separation of substances quite insoluble in water.           These must in all cases
have been products of decomposition        ;  for the author considers it quite cer
tain   that the colouring-matters     derived from urine which are insoluble in
water are not contained as such in the secretion, provided the latter is in
its  normally acid state.
    Having concluded his summary of            the results obtained in previous re
searches,   the author proceeds to give an account of his own experiments.
Before doing so, he states that he shall apply the term "colouring-matter"
to those bodies only which, occurring naturally          in urine or else formed by
processes of decomposition, are insoluble or not easily soluble in water,
while the substances easily soluble in water to which the colour of normal
urine is due, he shall continue for the present to call " extractive matters."
The extractive matters being, in the author's opinion, the source whence
most of the colouring-matters of urine are derived, he resolved to com
 mence the investigation by a careful        examination of their properties and
                                                                        b2

composition.     Indeed the first step which he thought it necessary to take,
before proceeding with the investigation at all, was to ascertain whether
these extractive matters are bodies       of a definite chemical nature, or
whether they are merely accidental .mixtures of various excrementitioua
substances thrown out by the system, and differing in their nature accord
ing to circumstances.      In order to arrive at a positive conclusion on this
point, several series of experiments were undertaken. The method devised
for the purpose of separating the extractive matters from the other con
stituents of urine, and obtaining them in a state of purity, presents few
features of novelty as compared with those previously employed.        The ex
periments necessarily occupied a considerable time, since the author con
sidered it essential, in order to avoid decomposition, to evaporate all the
solutions at the ordinary temperature by means of a current of air.       The
certainty of the conclusions arrived at afforded, however, ample compen
sation for the loss of time and additional     labour thus occasioned.     The
composition of the extractive matters was determined by analyzing their
lead compounds, since the substances themselves cannot be obtained in a
state fit for analysis.
    From the experiments described in this part of his paper the author
thinks he is justified in drawing the following conclusions : —
    1. Human urine contains at least two peculiar aud distinct extractive
matters, one of which is soluble in alcohol and ether, while the other is
soluble in alcohol, but insoluble in ether.     The existence of an extractive
matter insoluble both in alcohol and in ether is extremely doubtful.
    2. The composition of these extractive matters varies slightly, without
any corresponding difference in their appearance and properties being per
ceptible ; but these variations are not due to any difference in the quality
of the urine or the source whence it was derived, but rather to the de
 composition which takes place during the process employed in their prepa
 ration, and which cannot be entirely avoided.
    3. When quite pure, the extractive matter soluble in alcohol and ether
has a composition corresponding with the formula
                                                     C„ HS1 NOS2, while that
 of the extractive matter soluble in alcohol but insoluble in ether is ex
 pressed by the formula C39 Ha7 NOM.

       In this paper the author considers the deportment of certain additional
  elementary bodies towards Radiant Heat.           He exposes powders and liquids
  of the same physical character, but differing from each other chemically,
  at a focus of dark rays, and describes the different effects produced.            He
  examines and explains the experiments of Franklin on the absorption of
  solar heat.      He then determines the radiative power of a great number
  of substances in the state of fine powder, and finds, contrary to the current
. belief, that in this state also chemical constitution exercises a paramount
  influence.      The results obtained by previous experimenters in connexion
  with this subject are illustrated and explained.         The reciprocity of radia
  tion and absorption on the part of fine powders is also illustrated.            It is
  moreover shown that the heat emitted from different sources, at a tem
  perature of 100° C, varies in quality, this being proved by its unequal
  transmission through plates of rock-salt of perfect purity. The absorption
  by such plates varies from 4 to 30 per cent, of the incident radiation.
   II. "On      the Spectrum of Comet 1, 1866."           By William Huggins,
          F.R.S.     Received January 11, 1866.
        The successful application of prismatic analysis to the light of the ne-
   bulte showed the great importance of subjecting the light of comets to a
   similar examination, especially as we possess no certain knowledge of the
   intimate nature of those singular and enigmatical bodies, or of the cosmi-
   cal relations wbich they sustain to our system. The importance of a pris
   matic analysis of cometary light is enhanced by the consideration of the
   general resemblance which some of the nebulee present to the nearly round
   vaporous masses of which some comets, in some positions at least in their
   orbits, appear to consist, — a resemblance which suggests the possible ex
   istence of a close relation between nebulous and cometary matter.
        I made several unsuccessful attempts to obtain a prismatic observation
   of Comet 1, 1864. The position of the comet and the weather were un
    favourable.     M. Donati succeeded in making an examination of the spec
    trum of this comet.
                            " It resembles," says M. Donati, "the spectra of the
    metals ; in fact the dark portions are broader than those which are more
    luminous, and we may say these spectra are composed of three bright
    lines"*.
        Yesterday evening, January 9, 1666,      I  observed the spectrum of Comet
               * Monthly  Notices, Royal Astronomical Society, vol. jsxv. p. 114.

     6                           Mr. Huggins on        the Spectrum                [Jan. 18,
      I, 1866.    The telescope and spectrum-apparatus which I employed are
     described in my paper " On the Spectra of some of the Nebulee " *.
         The appearance of this comet in the telescope was that of an oval nebu
     lous mass surrounding a very minute and not very bright nucleus.                    The
     length of the slit of the spectrum-apparatus was greater than the diameter
     of the telescopic image of the comet.
         The appearance presented in the instrument when the centre of the
     comet was brought nearly upon the middle of the slit, was that of a broad
    continuous spectrum fading away gradually at both                         These fainter
                                                                      edges.
     parts of the spectrum corresponded to the more diffused marginal portions
    of the comet.      Nearly in the middle of this broad and faint spectrum, and
     in  a position in the spectrum about
                                                   midway between b and       F of the solar
    spectrum, a bright point was seen.             The absence of breadth     of this bright
    point in a direction at right       angles   to that of the    dispersion showed that
    this monochromatic light was emitted from an
                                                             object possessing no sensible
    magnitude in the telescope.
        This observation gives to us the information that the light of the coma
   of this comet is different from that of the minute nucleus. The nucleus
   is self-luminous,     and the matter of which it consists is in the state of
   ignited gas. As we cannot suppose the coma to consist of incandescent
   solid matter, the continuous spectrum of its
                                                           light probably indicates that
   it shines by reflected solar light.
        Since the spectrum of the light of the coma is
                                                                   unlike that which cha
   racterizes the light emitted by the nucleus, it is evident
                                                                        that the nucleus is
  not the source of the light by which the coma is
                                                                 rendered visible to us. It
  does not seem probable that matter in
                                                      the state of extreme tenuity and
  diffusion in which we know the material of the

  to be, could retain the
                                  degree of heat necessary for the incandescence of
  solid or liquid matter within them.               We must conclude, therefore, that
  the coma of this comet reflects
                                           light received from without ; and the only
 available foreign source of light is the
                                                   sunt-    If  a very bright comet were
 to visit our system, it
                               might    be possible to observe whether the spectra of
 the coma and the tail contain the
                                              dark lines which distinguish solar light.
 If    the continuous spectrum of the
                                               coma of Comet 1, 1866, be interpreted
 to indicate that it shines
                                   by reflecting solar light, then the prism
                                                                                   gives no
 information of the state of the matter
                                                  which forms the coma, whether it be
solid, liquid, or gaseous.
                                    Terrestrial phenomena would suggest that
                                                                                         the
 parts of a comet which are bright

    We know, from observation, that the comae and tails of comets are formed
from the matter contained in the nucleus.
    The usual order of the phenomena which attend the formation of              a tail
appears to be that,       as the comet approaches the sun, material is thrown
off, at intervals, from the nucleus in the direction towards the sun.            This
material is not at once driven into the tail, but usually forms in front of
the nucleus a dense luminous cloud, into which for a time the bright mat
ter  of the nucleus continues      to stream.    In this way a succession of enve
lopes may     be   formed,   the  material   of which   afterwards is dissipated in a
direction opposite to the sun, and forms the tail. Between these envelopes
 dark spaces are usually seen.
    If the  matter of the nucleus is capable of forming by condensation a
cloud-like mass, there must be an intermediate state in which the matter
ceases to be self-luminous, but yet retains its gaseous state, and reflects but
little light.     Such a non-luminous and transparent condition of the come-
tary matter may possibly be represented by some at least of the dark spaces
which, in some comets, separate the cloud-like envelopes from the nucleus
and from each other.
    Several   of the  nebulae which   I have examined give a spectrum of one line
only, corresponding       in refrangibility with the bright line of the nucleus of
the comet referred to in this paper. Other nebulae give one and two fainter
lines besides this bright line.       Whether either or both of these were also
present in the spectrum of this comet I was unable to determine. The light
of the comet was feeble, and the presence of the continuous spectrum made
the detection of these lines more difficult.        I suspected the existence of the
brighter of these lines.         I  employed different eyepieces, and also gave
breadth to the bright point by the use of the cylindrical lens, but            I  was
not able to obtain satisfactory evidence of more lines than the bright one
already described.
    In my paper " On the Spectra of the Nebulae,"               I showed that this
bright line corresponds in refrangibility with the brightest of the lines of
nitrogen.       This line may perhaps be interpreted as an indication that
cometary matter consists chiefly of nitrogen, or of a more elementary sub
stance existing in nitrogen.
    The great varieties of structure which may exist among comets,            as well
as  the remarkable      changes which      the same   comet undergoes at different
epochs,    will  cause all those who are interested in the advance     of our know
ledge   of the   cosmical  relations of these bodies, and of the gaseous nebulae,
to wait with some impatience the visit of a comet of sufficient splendour
to permit a satisfactory prismatic examination of the physical state of
 cometary matter during the various changes which are dependent upon
the perihelion passage of the comet.

      " Note  on the Secular Change of Magnetic Dip,           as recorded   at
       the  Kew Observatory."       By Balfour Stewart, M.A., LL.D.,
       F.R.S., Superintendent of the Observatory. Received January
       10, 1866.
    The President of this Society has already called the attention of the
Fellows to the annual values of the magnetic inclination at Toronto, as de
duced from the monthly determinations.         In doing so he remarked that
" the general effect of the disturbances of the inclination at Toronto is to
increase what would otherwise be the amount of that element ; therefore,
if the disturbances have a decennial period, the absolute values of the in
clination (if observed with sufficient delicacy) ought to show in their
annual means a corresponding decennial variation, of which the minimum
should coincide with the year of minimum disturbance, and the maximum
with the year of maximum disturbance."           At Toronto, where the true
secular change is very small, the effect of this superimposed variation is
very visible, so that the yearly values of the inclination appear to increase
up to the period of maximum disturbance and to decrease after it. At Kew
 the general effect of disturbances is probably the same as at Toronto—that
is to say, tending to increase the inclination ; but the secular change being
considerable, and tending to decrease the inclination, the joint effect of the
 secular change and the superposed variation might be expected to appear
 in a diminution   of the yearly secular change for  those years during  which
 the disturbances are increasing from their minimum         to their maximum
 value, and in an increase of the yearly secular change for those years during
 which the disturbances are decreasing from their maximum to their
 minimum.
    The Kew records appear to exhibit a variation of this nature. Observa
tions of dip were commenced at the Kew Observatory in 1854 ; and by
 comparing a good number of observations taken during the latter months
of 1854, with two circles and four needles, with observations taken with the
same circles and needles during the same months    of  1855, we obtain a yearly
secular change of 2'-24.

      During      the years      from 1S5C to 1859 inclusive, monthly observations
were         made with a        circle known as the Kew circle, two needles being
always        used, and.      the mean of the two results taken as the true value of
the dip.
   From this circle we have the following results                         :   —

also include          that between 1854 and 1855,                  we have a mean value of yearly
secular  change, for the period between 1854 and 1859, amounting to
2'-29, and this value will not be sensibly altered    we omit the observa  if

those at Toronto in indicating that the yearly change of dip contains the
combined result of two things — -namely, the true secular change and the
change due            to disturbance   ;   and this ought to be borne in mind                       by   future

   I. "On       the Specific Gravity   of Mercury."      By Balfour Stewart,
         M.A., LL.D., F.R.S., Superintendent of the Kew Observatory.
         Beceivcd January 25, 1866.
      Some    time since,   in connexion with   a research on the fusing-point       of
  mercury, several observations were made        at Kew of the specific gravity      of
  this fluid.
      A specific-gravity bottle  was used   for this purpose and it was washed,
  in the first place with sulphuric acid, secondly with distilled wnter, and
  thirdly with alcohol ; when this was done it was found to contain mercury
  without any air-specks or any diminution of that metallic lustre which pure
  mercury exhibits when in contact with a vessel of clean glass. Three dif
  ferent specimens of pure mercury were used and were separately weighed
 in the specific-gravity bottle at 62° Fahr. The following results were
 obtained    : —
                                                                Weighed in air.

                  thermometer weighed at 62°     F         J
 the mean of these will be 13591-66 grs.
     It was found that the specific-gravity bottle had an internal volume equal
 very nearly to 4 cubic inches, and assuming that a cubic inch of air weighs
 0-31 gr., then the air displaced by the liquid filling the bottle would weigh
 1-24   gr.
     In like manner the air displaced by the Kew standard weights (sp. gr.
 8-2) would have the volume of 6-6 cubic inches, and would weigh 2-04 grs.
     From these premises we find that the real weight of the mercury in vacuo
would have been 13590-86 grs.
     Again, the amount of water which the same bottle held at 62° F. weighed
in air 1000 53 grs.
     Here the air displaced by the bottle is,     as before, 1-24 grs.,      while that
displaced by the weights is only 0-15 gr.
     From this we find that the real weight of water filling the bottle at 62°
F. would be in vacuo 1001-62 grs. We have thus —
        True weight of mercury filling the bottle at     62°   F. = 13590 86 grs.
       True weight of the same volume of water at        G2°   F. = 1001-62 grs.

  And hence the specific        gravity of mercury at 62° F., as compared with
 water at    the same temperature, will be 13'569 nearly.                ¦ .
    Again, if we assume the correctness of Regnault's Table of the absolute
 dilatation of mercury, and also that of Despretz's Table of the absolute dila
 tation of water, we shall find that the weight at 32° F. of a volume of mer
 cury weighing 13590*86 grs. at 62°           F. will be
                          13590-86    x 1-00298= 13631    -361 grs.
Also the volume        at  4°  C,  or 390,2  F., of a volume   of water weighing at
62°   F. 1001-62 grs., will       be
                         1001-62X      1-0011437=1002-766      grs.
Hence the specific gravity         of mercury, according to the French method of
determining      it, will  be
                                    13631-361

                                     1002-766
A determination        by Regnault gives 13-596.
   These two results agree very nearly with one another ; and this agree
ment tends not only to verify the correctness of Regnault's determination,
but to show that Regnault's Table of the dilatation of mercury, and Des
pretz's Table of the dilatation of water, agree together ; a remark that had
been previously       made by Dr. Matthiesscn in a paper which he recently
presented to the Society.

                                   Graphitoidal Silicon.
   It has been      so confidently assumed that [graphitoidal silicon is an allo-
tropic  condition     of silicon crystallized in octahedrons, that on ascertaining
by measurement          of angles that some graphitoidal silicon given me by
Dr. Matthiessen was in simple and twin octahedrons, I at once concluded
that the    substance had been wrongly named.            Later, however, I obtained
from Dr. Percy a supply of graphitoidal silicon of unquestionable authen
ticity.                                             I
           Its lustre was that of the crystals had previously examined. It
occurred    in small   scales, having for the most part the appearance     of crystals
of the    oblique system.        On    measurement,    however,  they  proved   to be
octahedrons in which two parallel faces were much larger than any of the
other faces,    and two other parallel faces were either too small to be observed
 or were altogether wanting.           One of the scales had all the faces of a twin
octahedron.        It appears, then, that there is no reason, founded on a differ
 ence  of form, for separating graphitoidal        from octahedral silicon, the sole
                                                                      c 2

  of the former.
        i                           Graphitoidal Boron.
      The forms of boron have been described by the Commendatore Quintino
  Sella in two papers read before the Royal Academy of Turin on the 4th of
  January and the Nth of June, 1857, and by the Baron Sartorius v. Walters-
  hausen in a paper presented to the Royal Society of Gottingen on the 1st.
  of August of the same year. They found independently that the adaman
  tine boron of Wohler and Deville, containing a variable and not inconsider
  able amount of aluminium and carbon, considered by Sella as possibly a
  definite compound of boron with aluminium and carbon with a mechanical
  mixture of pure boron, crystallizes in forms belonging to the pyramidal
  system.
      Boron containing 2-4 per cent, of carbon, the boro semplice of Sella, is
  described by him as occurring in crystals, the faces of which are not so
  perfect as to admit of a very accurate determination of the angles they
 make with one another.           The angles approximate to some of the angles of
 crystals of the cubic system, but the aspect of the crystals, which are usually
 twins, leads to the supposition that they belong to the oblique system, and
 that the angle between the oblique axes differs but little from 90°.
    The forms observed by Sella, considered              as belonging      to the oblique
 system,   are : —

  Resides the two forms already mentioned, Wohler and Deville obtained
boron in extremely thin scales, which were supposed to be a different modi
fication of boron, and    was accordingly called graphitoidal.          Sella, however,
relying apparently upon the evidence afforded by the lustre              and colour       of
the scales, for he was unable to obtain any measurements,                expresses    his
conviction that they are not different from pure boron.    Some scales of this
substance, for which, as well as a supply of crystals of pure boron, I am in
debted to Dr. Matthiessen, have faces on their edges, but so narrow that
the reflected image of the bright signal is diffracted into a line of consider
able length, and therefore difficult to bisect. For this reason it is not pos
sible to determine the positions of the faces with accuracy.

      All bodies which            of having their form indefinitely altered,
                           are capable
 and which resist the change of form with a force depending on the rate of
 deformation, may be called Viscous Bodies.    Taking tar or treacle as an
 instance in which both the change of form and the resistance opposed to
 it are easily observed, we may pass in one direction through the series of
soft solids up to the materials commonly supposed to be most unyielding,
such as glass and steel, and in the other direction through the series of
liquids of various degrees of mobility to the gases, of which oxygen is the
most viscous, and hydrogen the least.
  The viscosity of elastic solids has been investigated by M. F. Kohl-

                                                    a
seconds,   and the maximum velocity of the edge of the disks was about
'j1^ inch per second.
    The three disks were placed at known intervals on the vertical axis, and
four larger fixed disks were so adjusted above and below them and in the
intervals between      them, that strata of air of known thickness were inter
cepted     between   the surfacesof the moving disks and the fixed disks.
 During the oscillations of the moveable disks, the viscosity of the air in
 these six strata caused    gradual diminution of the amplitude of oscilla

the effect of the wire from that of the air, the arrangement of the disks
was altered, and the three disks, placed in contact, were             made to oscillate
midway between two fixed glass disks, at distances sometimes of          inch,    1
and sometimes of -5 inch.

  1866.]                Mr. Maxwell      on the Viscosity  of Air,  ire.            15
      From these experiments on two strata         of air, combined with three  sets of
 experiments on six strata            of thicknesses *683, -425, and "1847 inches re
spectively,       the  value of the coefficient of viscosity or internal friction was
determined.
     Let two infinite planes be separated by a stratum of air whose thickness
is unity.        Let one of these planes be fixed, while the other moves in its
own plane with a uniform velocity unity ; then, if the air in immediate
contact      with either plane has the same velocity as the plane, every unit of
surface of either plane will experience a tangential force p, where p is the
coefficient of viscosity of the air between the planes.
    The force p is understood to be measured by the velocity which it
would       communicate in unit of time to unit of mass.
    If L, M> T be the          units of length, mass, and time, then the dimensions
ofjiareL-'MT-'.
     In the actual experiment, the motion of the surfaces is rotatory instead
of rectilinear,       oscillatory instead of uniform, and the surfaces are bounded
instead of infinite.          These considerations introduce certain complications
into the      theory, which are separately considered.
     The conclusions which          are drawn from the experiments agree, as far as
they go,       with those of Mr. Graham on the Transpiration of Gases*. They
are as      follows  : —
      1.  The coefficient of viscosity is independent of the density, the tem
perature being constant.             No deviation from this law is observed between
the atmospheric           density and that corresponding      to a pressure of half an
 inch of      mercury.
     This remarkable result was shown by the author in 1860f to be a
 consequence of the Dynamical Theory of Gases.                 It agrees with the con
 clusions of Mr. Graham, deduced from experiments on the transpiration
 of gases     through capillary tubes.        The considerable thickness of the strata
 of air in the         present experiments shows that the property of air, to be
  equally viscous at all densities, is quite independent of any molecular action
  between its particles and those of solid surfaces, such as those of the capil
 lary tubes      employed by Graham.
      2. The coefficient of viscosity increases        with the temperature, and is
  proportional to 1 + *0, where 0 is the temperature and a is the coefficient
  of expansion per degree for air.
      This result cannot        be   considered so well established as the former,
  owing to      the difficulty of maintaining a high temperature constant in so
  large an     apparatus, and measuring it without interfering with the motion.
  Experiments,        in which the temperature ranged from 50° to 185° F., agreed
  wth the theory to         within 0*8 per cent., so that it is exceedingly probable
   that   this is the true relation to the temperature.
      The    experiments of Graham led him to this conclusion also.
       3.  The coefficient of viscosity of hydrogen is much less than that of

  air.    I have   never   succeeded     in filling my apparatus with perfectly pure
  hydrogen, for air leaks into the vacuum during the admission of so large
  a quantity of hydrogen as is required to fill it.         The ratio of the viscosity
  of my hydrogen to that of air was '5156. That obtained by Graham was
  -4855.
      4. The ratio for carbonic acid was found to be '859.               Graham makes
  it -807. It is probable that the comparative results of Graham arc more
  exact than those of this paper, owing to the difficulty of introducing so
  large a volume of gas without letting in any air during the time of filling
  the receiver.      I find also that a very small proportion of air causes a con
  siderable increase in the viscosity of hydrogen.             This result also agrees
  with those of Mr. Graham.
      5. Forty experiments on dry air were investigated to determine whether
  any slipping     takes place between the glass and the air in immediate con
  tact with it.
     The result    was, that   if  there were any slipping,  it is of exceedingly small
 amount     ; and that the evidence        in favour of the indicated amount being
 real is very precarious.
     The results of the hypothesis, that there is no slipping, agree decidedly
 better with the experiments.
     6. The netnal value of the coefficient of viscosity of dry air was deter
 mined, from forty experiments of five different kinds, to be

where the inch, the grain, and the second arc the units, and the tempera
 ture is on Fahrenheit's scale.
     At  62°  this  gives />= -007802.
     Professor Stokes, from the           experiments of Baily on pendulums,        has
found
which, with the average temperature and density of air, would give
                                          ^='00417,

    M. Meyer's value is therefore nearly twice              as  great as that of this
paper,   while that of Professor Stokes is only half         as great.
    In M. Meyer's      experiments,   which   were    with  one  disk at a time in an
open space of air, the influence of the air near the edge of the disk is very
considerable; but M. Meyer (Crelle, 59; Pogg. cxiii. 76) seems to have
arrived at the conclusion that the additional effect of the air at the edge is
proportional to the thickness of the disk.            If the additional force near the
edge is underestimated,        the resulting value of the viscosity will be in
excess.
    7.  Each of the forty experiments on dry air was calculated from the
concluded values of the viscosity of the air and of the wire, and the result
compared with the observed result. In this way the error of mean square of
each observation was determined, and from this the
                                                                 " probable error " of

of the same conditions, but from an agreement between the properties of
air and the theory made use of in the calculations.

     In the first part of this paper the author continues his observations           on
 the spectra   of nebulae and clusters.      The results already presented by him
 to the   Royal Society are confirmed by his new observations, namely, that
 with his apparatus clusters and nebulae give cither a continuous spec
 trum or a spectrum consisting of one, two, or three bright lines.                 The
 positions  in  the spectrum   of these  lines are   the  same  as those  of the bright
 lines of the  nebulae described in his former papers.
    On   account   of the faintness of these objects the author was not able to
 ascertain whether the continuous spectra which some of the nebulae give
 are interrupted by dark lines in a manner similar to the spectra of the
 snn and fixed stars.      Some of these spectra appear irregularly bright in
 some parts    of the  spectrum.

    The  second part      of the paper contains        an account  of  a mode   of deter
mining approximatively the intrinsic brightness of some of the nebulae.
    Analysis by the prisms shows that some of the nebulae consist of lu
minous gas existing in masses, which are probably continuous ; and the
nebulas    in the    telescope    present not points, but surfaces, in some cases,
subtending a considerable angle.              As long as an object remains of sensible
size  in the   telescope    it retains   its  original brightness, except as this may
 be diminished       by a possible power of extinction belonging to celestial
space,   and   by  the   absorptive power of the earth's atmosphere.
    By means of a special apparatus the light of three nebulae was com
pared with the light emitted by a sperm candle, buruing at the rate of
 158 grs. per hour.        The results are that —

The amounts are too small by the unknown corrections for the loss which
the light has sustained in its passage through space and through the

 the gaseous nature of the source of the light, which the spectroscope in

couple of known moment, applied near its ends.                  The amount of bending
produced in the central portion of the rod is measured by means of two

    In like manner, when a twisting couple is applied, the separation or
approach of the images serves to determine the amount of torsion.
    The flexural and torsional rigidities,      / and   t, which are thus found by ex
 periment, lead to the determination of Young's Modulus of Elasticity, M
 (or the resistance to longitudinal extension), and the absolute rigidity, n (or
 resistance to shearing) ; M being equal to
 inertia  of  a circular

   The mode of experimenting is somewhat similar to that by which
Kirchhoff investigated the value of a for steel and brass ; but there are
several points of difference, especially this — that the portion of the glass
rod, whose flexure and torsion are measured, is sufficiently distant from
the places where external forces are applied, to eliminate the local irregu
larities produced by their application.
II. " Note     on the    relative     Chemical Intensities of direct Sunlight
       and  diffuse  Daylight        at different altitudes of the Sun."               j,By

       Received February 8, 1866.
   The method of determining the chemical intensity of daylight described
by one of us* presents a convenient means of experimentally comparing
the intensity of the chemically active rays which reach the earth's hori
zontal surface directly from the sun with that of the same rays reflected
from the atmosphere and constituting diffuse daylight.                   For this purpose
it is only necessary alternately to      expose      pieces    of the standard sensitive
paper, according to the method described in the memoir above mentioned,
to the action of the total light of day, and to the diffuse daylight alone,
which is easily done by cutting off the sun's direct rays from the sensitive
paper, by throwing upon the paper a shadow cast by a small screen, hav
ing an apparent diameter slightly greater than that of the solar disk.                   In
the first case the chemical intensity of the total daylight, in the second
that of the diffuse light is determined ; the difference between these two
observations giving the chemical intensity of the direct sunlight.                 As the
experiments   which   we  have    already    made     in  this  direction   have led us to
conclusions differing altogether from those derived from theoretical con
siderations concerning the relative chemical intensities of direct and diffuse
sunlight, we think that, although this investigation is incomplete, the results
are worthy of the attention of the Society.                No direct photometrical de
terminations of the relative intensity of sun and diffuse light have up to
this time been made    ;   but Clausiust has calculated this relation for vary
ing altitudes of the sun, founding his calculations upon the hypothesis
(generally adopted by meteorologists to explain the red tints of the morn
ing and evening sky) that the diffused light is reflected, not from the par-

    The measurement           of the relative chemical intensities             were made at three
localities :      (1) Owens College, Manchester, 53° 29' N., and 0" 9m0*W. ;
(2) the Observatory, Cheetham Hill, near Manchester; and (3) the
summit of the Konigstuhl, near Heidelberg, 1900 feet above the sea, in
49° 24'     N., and 34m48" E. We are indebted for the latter observations
to   Dr.   Wolkoff, who kindly forwarded us his results through Professor
Bunsen.
    The following experimental numbers, obtained at Owens College, may
serve to illustrate the method adopted ; in most cases several (four or five)
observations          of the intensities of the total and diffuse light were made
 quickly one after the other, and the mean of all the readings taken.

     These numbers show that whilst at 20°           of altitude, according     to theory,
 the relation   of the intensities of diffuse light to direct sunlight is        as 100 to
 49' 1, the experiments         at Heidelberg    give a relation of 100 to 35       ; those
 at  Cheetham    Hill    100 to 19, and those in Manchester 100 to 10.                If we
 compare the      theoretical ratio for higher altitudes, we find that in our
latitudes the ratio even at 35° of altitude is only as 100 for diffuse light to
 26 for snnlight, whereas theory gives the relation as 100 to 169.                     The
Heidelberg observations show indeed a more rapid rise in the intensity of
the direct sun's rays, the ratio reaching 100 to 82 for 35° of altitude.
The great difference between these and the other experimental results must
 doubtless be ascribed to the considerable elevation (1900 feet above                   the
sea) at which these observations were made.
    Even at Heidelberg, however, no less than eight observations show that
at low elevations the chemical action of the sun becomes altogether inap
preciable, whilst that of the diffuse light is still considerable ; and the same
inactive    condition of direct sunlight at low altitudes has             been frequently
observed both at Owens College and Cheetham Hill.                     In  these  cases the
intensity    of the sun's direct visual rays         was considerable,      and a strong
shadow was cast       ; but the more highly refrangible            rays were    altogether
absent,   and the ratio became infinite.

    In some of the experiments made at Cheetham Hill the shadow of a
small disk was thrown on a horizontal surface of white paper, and careful
estimations made       of the relative brightness of the shaded and unshaded
portions of the surface.         A comparison of these results with those obtained
 at the same time for the chemical rays showed that with the sun at a mean

24       On the Relative Intensities    of Sunlight  and Daylight,     £$c.
altitude of 25°  1 6', the mean ratio of the chemical intensities of direct and
diffused light being 0 23, that of the luminous intensities was400, or that
the action of the atmosphere was 1 7'4 times greater on the chemically
active than on the luminous rays of sunlight.          A series of photometrical
experiments    made     afterwards   at Owens College gave       the following re
sults : —
                 Mean altitude of the sun                   1 2°  3'
                 Mean ratio of chemical intensity    ....   0-053
                 Mean ratio of luminous intensity.    . . . 1-400
    It appears therefore that with the sun at an altitude of 12° 3', the action
of the atmosphere was 26-4 greater on the chemical than on the luminous
rays.
   The foregoing experiments appear to prove —
   I. That the effect of the atmosphere upon the highly refrangible and
chemically active solar rays is regulated by totally different laws from
those founded upon the hypothesis of the reflexion by means of hollow
vesicles of water.
   II. That the ratio of the chemical intensity of direct to diffuse sunlight
for a given altitude of the sun at different localities is not constant, vary
ing with the transparency, &c, of the atmosphere.
   III. That this ratio of "chemical" intensity does not in the least cor
respond to the ratio of
                             " visible" intensity as estimated by the eye ; the
action of the atmosphere being 17-4 times greater upon the chemical than
on the luminous      rays when the sun's altitude is about 25° 16', and 26-4
times greater when the sun's altitude is 12° 3'.

    In  the first part   of this paper the authors give the details of the synthe
 tical production    of numerous acids of the lactic family, which have been
 briefly described    in a series of notes already published in these Proceedings
 during the years      1863, 1864, and 1865. In the concluding portion of the
 present paper, they discuss the theoretical          considerations which arise out
 of  these  investigations.     They call attention to the existence of a group of
 elements, to which they give the name oxalyl and the formula (C 0 IIo),

Oxalyl is closely related to cyanogen, the two radicals passing into each
other in a host of reactions ; hence the production of cyanides from the
ammonium- salts of the fatty acids on the one hand, and the synthesis of
acids from certain cyanogen compounds on the other, —a reaction first
pointed out by Kolbe and Frankland*, and which has of late yielded such
important results in the hands of Maxwell Simpson                  f  and of Kolbe and
of Hugo Miiller %.

    The researches of these chemists prove that the introduction of cyanogen
into an organic compound, and its subsequent transformation into oxalyl,
converts that compound into an acid, or, if already an acid, increases its
basicity by unity (for each atom of oxalyl so developed), this result being
 apparently quite independent of the position of the oxalyl in the molecule.
 The atom of oxalyl (as the above molecular formula shows) may be regarded
 as methyl (C H3), in which two atoms of hydrogen have been replaced by
 one   of oxygen, and the third by hydroxyl (Ho).
     It may be objected that the group of elements, which is thus invested
 with radical functions, lacks one of the fundamental characteristics of a
radical by its proneness to change ; but this characteristic is exhibited by
 the commonly received radicals in a very varied degree.               And even methyl
 itself, which certainly possesses it in the most marked manner, readily
 permits of its hydrogen being replaced by chlorine or bromine on the one
 hand, aud by sodium on the other.               All compound radicals, the authors
 remark, are purely conventional groupings of elements intended to simplify
 the expression of chemical change ; and in this respect they believe the
 group oxalyl, entering as it does into the constitution of nearly every
 organic acid, has as valid a claim to a distinct name as the most universally
 recognized radical.       Its admission renders possible the following very
 simple expression of the law governing the basicity of nearly all organic
  acids — an organic acid containing n atoms of o.valyl is n basic.

   A normal acid of the lactic      series may be defined as one in which an
atom   of carbon is united with oxalyl, hydroxyl, and at least one atom of
hydrogen.      In  the above general formula for these acids       R may be either
hydrogen,    or any alcohol hydrogen.
   An etheric normal acid is constituted like a normal acid, but contains a
monatomic organic radical, chlorous or basylous, in the place of the
hydrogen of the hydroxyl.
   A secondary acid is one in which an atom of carbon is united with
oxalyl, hydroxyl, and two atoms of an alcohol radical.
   An etheric secondary acid stands in the same relation to a secondary, as
an etheric normal does to a normal acid.
   A normal olefine acid is one in which the atom of carbon united with
oxalyl is not united   with hydroxyl, and in which the atom of carbon united
with   hydroxyl   is combined    with not less than one atom of hydrogen.         In
this  formula   R  may be either hydrogen or a monatomic alcohol radical, and
the olefine, or diatomic radical of these acids, may belong to either the
ethylene, or the ethylidene series.
   An etheric normal olefine acid differs from a normal olefine acid only          in
                                                                      d2

In   the above formula      11 must be a monatomic alcohol radical.
    An etheric secondary olefine acid is related to the secondary olefine
acids in the same way as the etheric normal olefine acids are related to the
normal olefine acids.
    The numerous      cases    of isomerism in the lactic   series are next examined
and explained      ; and the authors then show how the radicals which are
employed for the production of the synthesized acids may again be sepa
rated, thus affording analytical as well as synthetical proof of the constitu
tion of these acids.
    These investigations have conducted the authors to the following conclu
sions : —
    1.  All acids of  the lactic series are essentially monobasic.
    2. These acids are of four species, viz. normal, secondary, normal ole
fine, and secondary olefine acids ; and each of these species has its own
etheric series of acids, in which the hydrogen of the hydroxyl contained in
the positive or basylous constituent of the acid is replaced by a compound
organic radical, either positive or negative.
    3. The normal acids are derived from oxalic acid by the replacement of
one atom     of oxygen, either by two atoms of hydrogen, or by one atom of
hydrogen     and  one atom of an alcohol radical.
    4. The secondary acids are derived from oxalic acid by the replacement
of one atom of oxygen by two atoms of monatomic alcohol radicals.
    5   The  olefine acids are derived from oxalic        acid by a like substitution
of two monatomic positive radicals for one atom of oxygen, with the addi
tion of a diatomic radical (C, H,„) between the two atoms of oxalyl.
    6. The acids of the lactic series stand in the very simple relation to the
 acids  of the acetic    series first pointed out by     Kolbe, viz. that by the re
placement, by hydrogen, of the hydroxyl,             ethoxyl, &c. contained in the
positive radical of an acid of the lactic series, that acid becomes converted
into a member of the acetic series.
    7.  The acids of the lactic series stand in an almost equally simple rela
 tion to those of the acrylic series, as is seen on comparing the two follow
 ing formulae   : —

              Lieut.-General SABINE, President, in the Chair.
    Mr. Archibald Geikie     was admitted into the Society.
    The following communications were read : —
I. "Note       on a Correspondence between Her Majesty's Government
       and the President and Council of the Royal Society regarding
       Meteorological Observations to be made by Sea and Land."                 By
        Lieutenant-General Sabine, P.R.S. Received March 8, 1866.
     Her Majesty's   Government    having been pleased to consult the Royal
Society on several occasions in the last few years regarding the proper steps
to be taken by this country, under the sanction and authority of its Go
vernment, for the prosecution, in cooperation with the Governments of other
 States in Europe and America, of systematically conducted meteorological
observations by Land and Sea, it may be desirable to offer to the Fellows a
 ritume of the correspondence, and of the suggestions which from time to
 time have been tendered on the part of the Society to the several depart,
 ments    of the State.
     The correspondence commenced by a communication            from the Foreign
 Office in March    1852, transmitting, by direction of the  Earl  of Malmesbury,
 several documents received from foreign governments in reply to a propo
 sition which had been made to them by Her Majesty's Government, for
 their cooperation in establishing a uniform system of recording meteorolo
 gical observations ; and requesting the opinion of the President and Council
 of the Royal Society in reference to these documents, and more especially
 in reference to a communication from the Government of the United States
 of America respecting the manner in which the proposed cooperation might
 be carried out.
     The reply of the President and Council was dated May 10, 1852. It
 recognized fully the importance of well-directed and systematically con
 ducted meteorological observations, not only for their scientific value, but
  also on account of the important bearing which correct climatological know
 ledge has on the welfare and material interests of the people of every
  country.     With reference to a specific proposal for the adoption, by all
  countries, of a uniform plan in respect to instruments and modes of obser
  vation in meteorological researches on land, the President and Council ex
  pressed a doubt whether any practical advantage was      likely to  be gained by
  pressing such a recommendation in the then state of meteorological science.
  Many of the principal Governments of the European Continent had already

 30 General Sabine      — Note  on Meteorological Correspondence.      [Mar. 8,
 organized systematic climatological researches throughout their respective
 States under the superintendence of men eminently qualified by theoretical
 and practical knowledge, and whose previous publications had obtained for
 them a general European reputation.       The instruments employed in each
 country had been constructed under the care of the Superintendents, and
 the instructions for their use drawn up and published by them ; the obser
 vations were also received by them and reduced and coordinated, and were
 in this  state  published periodically by the respective governments.        To
 call on countries so advanced in systematically conducted meteorological
 observations to remodel their instructions and instruments with the view of
 establishing uniformity in these respects, was scarcely likely to be successful,
 especially if the request proceeded from a country which ;had no similarly
 organized system extending over its own area.      Moreover the discussions
 which had taken place at the Magnetical and Meteorological Congress
 assembled at the Cambridge Meeting of the British Association in 1845,
 which was attended by the Superintendents of the different continental
 systems,  had manifested so marked a disposition on the part of the meteo
 rologists of the different countries to adhere to their respective arrange
 ments in regard to instruments, times of observation, and modes of publi
 cation, as to produce a strong conviction that the suitable time for pressing
 a proposal for the substitution of a uniform scheme, however advantageous
 in some respects, had not then arrived.
    But in respect to Marine Meteorology    the case was widely different ; and
 the suggestions which the President and Council felt it their duty to offer
 on that subject had a much more positive character, and were directed to
 immediate action.      An application had been made by the Government of
 the United States to that of our own country to give a greater extension
 and a more systematic direction to meteorological observations made at sea.
 Apart from the important scientific bearing of such researches, the well-
known publications of Lieutenant Maury had given to the Government of
the United States a fair claim to make such an application to that of our
own country,     to whose commercial interests a practical knowledge of the
meteorological statistics of the ocean was not less important than to those
of the United States. Accordingly, in their reply to the Foreign Office,
the President and Council did not fail to express emphatically their hope
that the application for cooperation, thus earnestly addressed by the Go
vernment of the United States, might not be addressed in vain.
    The following extracts from a memoir addressed by Lieutenant Maury
to the Secretary of the United States Navy, printed in " Papers presented
to the House of Lords by command of Her Majesty, pursuant to an address
dated February 21, 18.53," will show that the suggestions thus made by the
President and Council, both in regard to Land and to Sea Meteorological
Observations, were fully concurred in by Lieutenant Maury, on his return
from an official mission to visit and report upon the meteorological esta

is dated November 6, 1852.
    *'
       I would   recommend that the United States should abandon, for the
 present at least,   that part of the * Universal System ' which relates to the
 Land, and that we should direct our efforts mainly to the Sea, where there
 is such a rich harvest to be gathered for navigation and commerce                   I
 am induced to make this recommendation in consequence               of the evident
 reluctance with which Russia, Austria, Bavaria, Belgium, and other powers
seem to regard any change in their systems of meteorological observations
on shore             Each country seems to have adopted a system of its own,
according to which its labourers have been accustomed to work, and to
which its meteorologists are more or less partial.          Any proposition having
in view for these systems a change so radical as to bring them to uniformity,
and reduce them to one for all the world, would,          I  have reason to believe,
be regarded with more or less jealousy by many                     Not so, however,
with regard to the Sea; that proposal meets with decided favour and
warmest support."
    Lieutenant Maury then quotes largely from the Report of the President
and Council of the Royal Society (already referred to), and from the anni
versary address of the President of the British Association at the Belfast
Meeting in 1852, in illustration of the advantages which navigation and
commerce may derive from the extension of maritime researches by the
proposed cooperation of Great Britain and the United States.
    In June 1854 the Board of Trade informed the President and Council
by letter that they were about to submit to Parliament           an estimate   for an
office for the discussion of observations on Meteorology to be made at Sea
in all parts of the globe, in conformity with the recommendation of a con
ference held at Brussels in the preceding year ; and that it was their inten
tion to publish from time to time, and to circulate, such statistical results,
obtained by means of the observations referred to, as might           be considered
most desirable by men versed in the science of meteorology,           in addition to
such other information as might be required for the purposes         of navigation.
To this end, the Board of Trade were desirous of obtaining           the opinion of
the Royal Society as to what were the great desiderata in that science, and
as to the forms which may be best calculated to exhibit the great atmo
spheric laws which it may be most desirable to develope.
    The Board further stated that,       " as it may possibly happen that obser
vations    on land upon an extended scale may hereafter be made and dis
cussed    in the  same office, it is desirable that the reply of the Royal Society
should keep in view and provide for such a contingency."
    In their reply to this communication, dated February 22, 1855, the
President and Council kept carefully in view the relative importance which
the Board of Trade attached to the suggestions which might be offered

32 General Sabine        — Note   on Meteorological Correspondence.      [Mar. 8,
respecting observations to be made at sea, and observations to be made on
land ; the immediate bearing of the one, and the contingent and eventual
bearing of the other.        Their reply consequently bore chiefly on points to
be investigated by marine observations, — under the several heads of baro
metric variations     ; of those of the dry air and of aqueous vapour ; of the
mean temperature of the air ; of the temperature of the sea, and investiga
tions regarding currents ; of storms and gales ; thunderstorms ; auroras
and falling stars ; and charts of the magnetic variation.        (Proc. Roy. Soc,
vol. vii. pp. 342-361.)
   These were treated of in their generality, as subjects of investigation to
be made (in the words of the Board of Trade)
                                                      " at sea in all parts of the
globe." Nor was the contingency of observations to be made on land upon
an extended scale,
                         " which may hereafter be made and discussed in the
same    office,"   overlooked  ; and to enable the Royal Society to be more
                                     "                                 " whenever
fully prepared, and to be ready to provide for the contingency
it should present itself, the President and Council put themselves in com
munication with several of their foreign members who were known as dis
tinguished cultivators of meteorological science, —having always in view
the possibility that, when the occasion should occur, they might be
prepared to offer such suggestions as might facilitate the purpose which
had been deemed so desirable by Her Majesty's Government in the pre
 ceding year.       The chief difficulty which had then presented itself had
 been the desire shown by the meteorologists of the different European
 States to adhere to the instruments, and more particularly to the hours
of observation,     to which they had been accustomed.       The hours had been
selected    partly   on grounds   of convenience,  and  partly in the belief that
they were those best suited to receive the corrections required in different
localities for diurnal and casual variations.     The most hopeful way of sur
mounting the difficulties in question would obviously be the introduc
tion of instruments which should be continuously self-recording ; such in
struments would in addition supply the exact instants of the maxima and
minima of the different phenomena — points greatly required in the discus
sion of the laws of extensive atmospherical disturbances.         At the epoch of
the Cambridge Congress in 1845 it was understood that no perfectly reli
able instruments for continuous record were in use amongst the continental
observers. The self-recording instruments of M. Kreil, employed at the
observatories of Prague, Senftenberg, Vienna, and Munich, and which had
also been in use for many months at the Kew Observatory, were not conti
nuously self-recording, and were also, in the opinion of many, not altogether
free from objections.        The construction of instruments both in magnetism
and meteorology which should serve this important purpose and at the same
time be free from causes of error in other ways, had been a cherished object
 of the Committee of the Kew Observatory from the commencement of that
institution.      The advance which had been accomplished at a very early
period may perhaps best be stated in the following extract from the fourth

1866.^       General Sabine       — Note   on Meteorological Correspondence.       33
leport of Mr. Ronalds, its Director, published in the volume of the British
 Association for 1847, Trans, of Sections, page 30.               "The preliminary
 experiments on the photographic registration of the atmospheric electro
  meter, the thermometer,        the barometer, and the declination-magnet having
  been long since completed and published, and their results having warranted
  the cost and trouble of constructing apparatus of a durable and convenient
  character, a declination-magnet and a barometer have been mounted at Kew
  which scrupulously      fulfil the requisite conditions without the intervention of
  those  friction-rollers, levers, pivots, or other mechanism which have hitherto
 rendered self-registering apparatus so objectionable."          Mr. Ronalds added
 that it was his      " intention to provide during the ensuing year complete
 apparatus on like principles for registering as many of the other meteoro
 logical and magnetical instruments as funds will permit."
     The instruments which would          be required for a complete equipment of a
 meteorological observatory        would   be those which should automatically and
 continuously record (1) the variations of the atmospheric pressure;              (2)
 those   of the dry and wet thermometers ; (3) those of the force and direc
 tion of the wind ; and (4) those of the atmospheric electricity.           Of these,
  Nos.   1 and 2, as has been already said, had been devised at Kew in or
  before 1847.      Dr. Robinson's hemispherical-cup anemometer, of which a
 description    was  published in 1851 in the Transactions of the Royal Irish
 Academy, and which was immediately adopted at Kew, records, in a man
ner which      I believe is universally held to be unexceptionable, the direction
and force of the wind at every instant.             The electrometer to which Mr.
Ronalds referred in his report         of 1847,  though highly ingenious and yield
 ing very instructive results, was not continuously self-recording.               An
 electrometer fulfilling     this  condition   wns consequently a desideratum until
 Professor William Thomson devised, and caused to be constructed under
 his own superintendence at Kew, in the spring of 1861, the self-recording
 electrometer which has been subsequently in successful work at that ob
 servatory    ; thus supplying      the fourth apparatus required for a complete
 meteorological record.         It may be added that the Kew Barograph photo
 graphs its records self-compensated for temperature ; its curves conse
  quently are in immediate readiness for the lithographer or engraver.
     Such was the state of instrumental preparation at the Kew Observatory
  when the untimely death of Admiral FitzRoy, who had been placed by the
  Board of Trade in charge of the meteorological office established in 1 855,
  occasioned a renewal of the communications which had taken place on the
  formation of the office, between the Board of Trade and the Royal Society.
   In a letter dated May 26, 1865, the Board of Trade recalled to the recol
  lection of the Royal Society the recommendations regarding marine meteo
   rology contained in the letter of the President and Council of February
   22, 1855, stating that those recommendations had been adopted by the
   Board as the basis of the proceedings of the meteorological department ;
   and that in conformity therewith instruments and logs had been prepared

   34 General Sabine      — Note  on Meteorological Correspondence.      [Mar. 8,
   and furnished to ships proceeding on distant voyages, and had been returned
   to the office ; and that some progress had been made in carrying into effect
   the original programme of tabulating these in readiness for statistical
   charts.
       It was further stated that "in 1859 or 1860, the French Government
   having adopted a system of telegraphing and publishing the actual state of
   the weather from one place to another, in which Admiral FitzRoy's coopera
  tion had been sanctioned, a considerable part of the vote previously applied
  to obtaining and digesting observations was devoted to these telegrams ;
  and further, that in 1861, Admiral FitzRoy having grafted on this system
  of telegraphic communication a system of forecasting the weather, and, on
  occasions of anticipated storms, the giving of special warnings, communi
  cated by telegraph to the different ports and there made known by       hoisting
  certain signals, — the whole or almost the whole of the funds originally voted
  for the purpose of observations had thus been diverted from their original
  scientific purpose to an object deemed more immediately practical."
      The decease of Admiral FitzRoy afforded, in the judgment of the Board
  of Trade, a fitting opportunity to review the past proceedings and present
  state of the meteorological department, and rendered them desirous of again
  consulting the Royal Society on the constitution and objects of the depart
  ment, and the mode        in which  those objects might    be most effectually
 attained.
     The points on which the opinion of the Royal Society       was specially re
 quested were the following : —
      1. Are the points specified in the letter of the Royal Society of the 22nd
 of February 18.r,5 still deemed as important for the interests of science and
 navigation as they were then considered ?
     2.   To what extent have any of these objects    been answered by what has
 already been done by      the meteorological department .'
     3. What steps should be taken for making use of the observations
 already collected 1
     4. Is it desirable to make any, and what, further observations on any of
 the subjects mentioned in the Royal Society's letter of the 22nd of Febru
 ary 1855 ?
     5. What is the nature of the basis on which the system of daily forecasts
 and storm- warnings established by Admiral FitzRoy rests?             Are they
founded on scientific principles, so that they, or any part of them, may be
carried on satisfactorily notwithstanding Admiral FitzRoy's decease ?
     6. Can the Royal Society suggest any improvement in the form ami
manner of the process pursued in forecasts and storm-warnings ?
     7. Have the Royal Society any general suggestions to make as to the mode,
place, or establishment in, at, or by which the duties of the meteorological
department can best be performed ? it being understood that the Admi
ralty    are willing to undertake to place in the hands of the Hydrographer all
those observations which can properly be used in framing charts for the

exhibition      of the signals.
     The    reply of the President       and Council was dated June 15, 1865.           It
snggested      the continuance,     for the present, of the practice of forecasts and
storm-warnings        as before, and the continued issue of instructions and forms
to such     masters    of vessels  proceeding on distant voyages as might be ex
pected     to make a profitable use of them ; both these duties to be
                                                                               continued
under      Mr. Babington' s superintendence, by whom in effect they had been
carried on for some time previous to Admiral
                                                         FitzRoy's decease.       And it
was     further recommended        that both the system under which the forecasts
and storm-wamings had been hitherto carried on, and the
                                                                       extent and value
of the information        regarding ocean-statistics which had been accumulated
iu the office of the Board of Trade, should be
                                                        subjected to a careful exami
 nation.     These recommendations were adopted ; and a Committee has been
appointed,      of three members, one nominated by the Board of Trade, a second
 by the Admiralty, and a third by the Royal Society, to
                                                                     report on what has
 been done, and to suggest any modifications which
                                                            may appear desirable for
 the future. The report of this Committee is
                                                     expected to appear very shortly.
     With reference to the subject of Land Meteorology, the President and
 Council had been apprized by the Board           of Trade, in February 1855, that
  "observations      on land upon an extended scale might hereafter be made
 trad discussed       in the meteorological department of the Board," and
  had been requested to be "prepared for such a
                                                               contingency."      In the
  more recent correspondence in 1865, the
                                                    subject of land observ ations was
  again brought forward, and the Royal Society was invited to offer
                                                                                 sugges
  tions in reference to it.        Thus appealed to, the President aud Council
  would have failed in their duty if they had not
                                                             replied fully and expli
  citly to a request proceeding from Her Majesty's                Government, — care
   fully restricting themselves, in their reply, to such suggestions as their
  own
          knowledge     enabled them to affirm with confidence could be carried
  mto    practical  operation, and which at the same time enabled them to re
  spond to the more general inquiry in the letter from the Board of the
                                                                                    26th
  of May 1865, viz. "Have the

     The reply   of the President and Council    was as follows    : — " There remain,
  therefore,   to be noticed solely the considerations which relate to ' Meteo
   rology  proper,' i. e. to the Land Meteorology of the British Islands.            We

find that the principal states of the European Continent have almost with
out exception formed establishments for the collection and publication peri
odically of the meteorology of their respective countries.       The arrange
ments consist usually of a central  office, at which instruments and instruc
tions are provided for a number of stations, greater or less, according to the
area which they represent ; at which stations observations are made and
transmitted to the central office, where the results of all are reduced, coor
dinated, and published.   The small extent of the area comprised by the
British Islands in comparison with the territories of many of the European
States may require fewer stations ; but in a matter now so generally at
tended to and provided for,   it
                               seems scarcely fitting that our country should
be behind others.    There  is,moreover,    peculiarity in the meteorological
                                               a
position of the British Islands in respect to Europe generally as its north
western outpost, in consequence  of which an especial duty appears to
devolve upon us.  M. Matteucci, in very recent publication, has already
                                          a
made the important remark that extensive atmospheric disturbances which
first invade Ireland and England are those which, in winter more especially,
extend to and pass the Alps (although somewhat retarded by them), and
spread over    Italy;. and that storms        so telegraphed   from
                                                             England have
actually reached Italy, and have been found to correspond with the accounts
subsequently received from Italian Mediterranean Ports.
  "A few stations — say   six, distributed at nearly equal distances      in

nuous record   of the temperature, pressure, electric and hygrometric state
of the atmosphere, and of the force and direction of the wind — might per
haps be sufficient to supply authoritative knowledge of those peculiarities
in the meteorology of our country which would be viewed as of the most
importance to other countries, and would at the same time form authentic
points of reference for the use of our own meteorologists.      The scientific
progress of meteorology from this time forward requires indeed such con
tinuous records — first, for the sake of the knowledge which they alone can
effectively supply, and, next, for comparison with the results of independent
observation not continuous.     The actual photograms or other mechanical
representations, transmitted weekly       by
                                        post to the central station, would
constitute a lithographed page  for each  day in the year, comprehending
the phenomena at all the six stations, each separate curve admitting of
exact measurement from its own base-line, the precise value of which might
in every case be specified.
  "The President and Council suggest that the observatory of the Briti*h
Association at Kew might with much propriety and public advantage be
adopted as the central meteorological station."
  It   has been already shown,     in   the 'earlier   part of this communication,

1866.]       General Sabine — Note        on  Meteorological Correspondence.      37
that the     Kew Observatory       possesses all the instruments required  in a com
plete system      of continuous   self-recording meteorological observation. These
 are 'well known to the Directors of many meteorological observatories both
 at home and abroad, who in several instauces, after personal examination,
 have applied for and obtained for their own establishments similar instru
 ments prepared         under the Superintendent of the Kew Observatory, Mr.
  Balfour Stewart. Thus, Barographs on the Kew pattern have been sup
  plied to Oxford, St. Petersburgh, and Coimbra ; Anemometers to St. Pe-
  tersburgh, Odessa, Melbourne, Coimbra, Ascension, Madras, Agra, and
  two meteorological        stations established by Admiral FitzRoy; Electro-
  graphs to Lisbon and Coimbra.           There would be no difficulty (as was stated
  in the letter to the Board of Trade) in preparing instruments at Kew for
  affiliated meteorological stations in Britain, and in arranging for their veri
  fication and comparison with the Kew standards, as well as in giving to those
  in whose hands they may be placed such instructions as may ensure unifor
   mity of operation.       Such functions constitute in fact part of the original
   purposes     of the Institution  at Kew, and are in continual exercise both for
   magnetism and for meteorology.
       It is not unreasonable to anticipate that the success of such a system of
   continuous self-recording meteorological        observation, exemplified over the
   limited area of the British Islands, might occasion its wider extension, and
   thus contribute to the virtual fulfilment of the desire expressed by Her
   Majesty's Government in 1852
                                        " for the adoption of a general and uniform
   plan    of making and recording meteorological observations."
       Postscript, March         23. — Since this   "Note"    was  communicated to
   the Royal Society,       I have read with great satisfaction the opinion ex
   pressed     in the                               "
                      following extract from the Report of a Committee assem
    bled at the Board of Trade to consider certain questions relating to the
   Meteorological Department of the Board," pages 52, 53 : —
        " There is no doubt that self-recording instruments are urgently needed
   in the present state of meteorological science, and that they will soon in all
   probability be largely employed both in this country and abroad. Their
    advantages are manifest.        By reason of the continuity of their records, no
    wave or variation of any description in any of the meteorological elements
    can escape notice, and the course of that wave or variation can be tracked
    with certainty from station to station, and its modification at the time of
    reaching each station in succession can be accordingly observed. For the
    same reason one difficulty, now seriously felt, in charting the weather, viz.
    that which arises from observers in different places and countries adopting
     different hours of observation, would wholly disappear; and a further
     difficulty, viz. that which arises from observers being unpunctual to their
     professed hours of observation, would disappear also.            The unvarying
     accuracy of the record is an advantage of still greater importance than
     might be expected by those who have had no experience of the frequent

 38                         Mr.  J. Lilley  on the  Action of           [March 8,
  errors to be found in meteorological registers.          Each error creates con
  siderable confusion    ; it throws doubt on the observations accurately made
 at neighbouring places ; and that doubt cannot be removed except by the
  continuity of the records at those places. This continuity is unattainable
  unless the weather happens to be uniform over a wide district, or unless
 observations are made at many more places than would be needed, if reli
  ance could be placed upon the accuracy of the observers.         Another advan
  tage  of self-recording instruments is that their records are independent of
  particular scales.     Their notation is in lines and curves that can be mea
  sured  with  equal  facility according to any desired scale. The thermometer
 lines could be measured at pleasure according to Fahrenheit's scale, as
 used in England ; to the Centigrade, as in France ; or to Reaumur's, as in
 Germany.       The barometer lines could be measured with equal ease in
 English inches, in millimetres, or in Paris feet.         For the various reasons
 we have mentioned, self-recording instruments are of eminent local and
 international utility. The establishment of a series of them in England
 would confer a wide benefit.          They would give precision and fulness to
 the charts   of  our  own   weather  ;  they would set an example that foreign
 governments would soon follow ; and they would afford material in a very
 acceptable form to meteorologists at home and abroad for the discussion of
 the weather of Europe at large."
 II. " On     the Action of Compasses in Iron Ships." By Mr.                 John
        Lilley.      Communicated by Sir W. Snow Harris, F.R.S.                Re
        ceived February 9, 1866.
     Although many ably-written papers upon this subject have at various
 times appeared, none of them seem to be of that simple practical character
 as to supersede the necessity of any further investigation of the subject, or
 deter the author from submitting to the Royal Society the results of many
years' practical experience in the construction of the mariner's compass, and
 its adjustment in iron ships.          These results are given with a view to ad
 vance our knowledge of        this important and great practical scientific ques
tion, and to add still more to the security of life and property.           In the
 present day, when iron shipbuilding is so widely extending, it is presumed
 that the most humble offering tending to place the directive action of the
compass beyond the reach of disturbing magnetic forces may not be unac
ceptable.
     It is unnecessary here to enter into a mathematical investigation of the
 properties or magnetic condition of iron ships, this part of the subject
  having been already fully treated and developed by many learned men.
 The author rather proposes to confine himself to the consideration of the
 probable causes of the disasters so frequently attendant on the navigation
of iron and other ships, through defective compass guidance ; such disasters,
according to the author's experience, may be traced, in a large majority of
cases, to one or other of the following causes : —

 1866.]                        Compasses in     Iron Ships.                           39
         1.  The improper construction and position of the steering binnacle
            and compass.
        2. The too frequent habit of placing all reliance upon the steering
            binnacle compass.
        3. Allowing      the compasses    to be too long in use without        due  exa
            mination.
        4.  The improper manner in which the compasses have been adjusted.
    1.   The construction of the compass is at all times a matter of great im
portance, but when applied to the case of an iron ship its value is increased
tenfold; it is most essential that the compass should be of the best attainable
description,      and so constructed that its centre and pivot should be subject
to the smallest possible amount        of friction, in order that the needles may be
entirely free to follow the directive force of the earth, and have at the same
time great retentive power.          Some years since the author observed, when
adjusting an iron steamer's compass furnished by him with very powerful
needles, discarded from some previous experiments in magnetism, and
which were only 4 inches in length, that more than usually satisfactory
results were obtained ; the deviations were of a smaller value, and far more
uniform than when using needles of greater length.                He has since adopted
the practice of employing needles          not    exceeding  6  inches in length, even
for cards      of the largest diameter.
    The position of the compass is           also important    ; it is an objectionable
practice of too frequent occurrence,          even   with the ordinary plane spindle
and barrel, to place the binnacle near the steering-wheel ; with the screw
apparatus, arms, and levers the practice becomes extremely dangerous, the
whole mass, from the process of manufacture, being found highly magnetic.
The idea, however, prevails that all this is a matter of indifference, since the
counteracting magnets are supposed to neutralize all magnetic disturbance.
The reverse, however, is the case ; many instances have come under the
author's notice practically in which errors have arisen solely from this
cause,     but which    ceased to exist on the removal    of the binnacle to  a distance
 of 4 feet from the spindle, or twice the original distance.
     It would be far better, in all cases, if the steering-wheel could be placed
 before the mizen-mast of ships, instead of abaft and close to the stern, as is
 generally the case ; compasses        would invariably     act better and be subject
 to smaller changes.
     2.   It  is too frequently the practice to place exclusive reliance upon the
 areeriny-compass ; this may be attended with less trouble to the navigator,
 but is, as regards the safety of the ship, very perilous.            As ships are now
 fitted, the steering-compass is placed very near the stern ; and since in iron
 sbips the magnetic forces are generally concentrated at the two ends of the
 vessel, it must be obvious that it is placed at that spot where the greatest
 variations may be expected. Every iron ship should be furnished with a
 properly constructed standard binnacle not less than 5 feet high above the
 deck, suitably placed, and containing            a compass fitted    in the most con

40     Mr.   J. Lillcy on the Action of Compasses in Iron Ships.       [March 8,
veuient manner for taking observations without the aid of compensating
magnets.       By this compass alone should the ship be navigated ; the
steering-compass is simply the helmsman's guide.          Many iron ships have
been fitted    with two navigating binnacles, the one for steering, and the
other at the fore part of the poop, both furnished with compensating
magnets, and obviously both subject to the same changes incident to the
change of hemisphere ; cases of ships thus fitted have come under the
author's notice, in which many providential escapes from wreck have
occurred on the return passage from India ; in one particular instance, land
was made      on the coast of Ireland when the commander imagined he was
entering    the channel, an error that could not have arisen had the ship been
furnished with an uncompensated standard compass instead of a compen
sated compass.
    In the uncompensated compass, the changes of deviation are far less than
would be found in a compensated compass placed not more than 2 feet
above    iron beams.      Very full directions on this subject will be found in
the   valuable  work   of the late Capt. E. J. Johnson, R.N., and it is much to
be regretted that this work is not more studied by commanders and officers
of iron ships.
    3. Frequent disasters have been found to occur in consequence of allow
ing the compass to be too long in use without due examination, more par
ticularly in steam-vessels going short voyages ; the author is led to this con
clusion from the fact of having readjusted iron vessels' compasses stated to
be largely in error, but subsequently found, on swinging the ship, to have
 a comparatively small error, the supposed error being referable to a
 defective centre and pivot in thecompass itself, which prevented the needle
 from reaching its meridional position.       In such cases an error of 8° or 10°
 has been often observed ; the importance of such an error in narrow
 channels is too obvious to require comment.
    There are valuable and simple appliances which to a very great extent
 remove this difficulty, and which are comparatively inexpensive ; it is to
 be much regretted that       a great indifference to the state   of vessels' com
 passes exists in the minds of those under whose care the compasses are
 often placed, and who, it might be expected, would from experience have
 been more sensitively alive to the absolute necessity of keeping the com
 passes, as far as possible, in a state of efficiency.   If a compass looks clean
 upon its surface, it is believed to be in a perfect state, although it may have
 been stowed away       with the card upon the pivot without any protection,
 thus interfering with the most important of its working parts ; as a conse
 quence, the card, when required for use, will be sluggish upon its pivot, and a
 false indication of the direction of the vessel's head is an unavoidable result.
    4. A defective adjustment of the compass is again a vital source of
 error.     This mainly depends, 1, on the locality in which the vessel is
 swung, which is too often a dock, where other iron vessels lie in dangerous
 proximity ; 2, a want of due precaution on the part of the adjuster, in the

1866.]        Mr.    J.  Lilley  on the Action     of Compasses in Iron Ships.       41
place    selected for the shore-compass. This is a matter of great importance,
far more than is often supposed. As the corrections made on board neces
 sarily depend upon the bearings given from the shore, if these are faulty, the
  ship's compass      cannot be otherwise than incorrect.
     The author has more than once seen a shore-compass within a very short
  distance of an iron shed.          The prevailing practice of swinging a ship in
   the short space of two hours is also very objectionable ; it is utterly im
   possible  to regulate compensating magnets, and to make the requisite ob
   servations for the use of soft iron, in so short a time ; it does not allow the
   vessel to be stayed upon the several points for a sufficient scrutiny of the
   compasses, sometimes three in number, and the results are too often merely
  guessed at, and thus all the advantages         of that admirable system of adjust
  ing   iron vessels'    compasses,    introduced   by the Astronomer Royal, and
  which are invaluable        to our coasting    and   short voyage vessels, are, to a
 great extent, negatived.
     London     is unfortunately    very badly provided with the means of adjusting
 the compasses of iron vessels, aud, as their number is so much increasing,
 this subject is daily becoming more important ; the docks are crowded, and
 it is by mere chance that in the Victoria Dock, the only available dock at
 our command,         a sufficiently   clear space is to be met with.       Greenhithe
 remains as the last resource in this dilemma ; here moorings have been laid
 down by the City authorities for the use of merchant- vessels, but they are
 too near the edge        of the tide. A very strong down current exists ; the
entire space      of slack water in the Reach is occupied by two sets of moorings
for the use of the Royal Navy. It would be a very great boon if one of
these sets of moorings were allowed to be used by the merchant service,
when not required for Her Majesty's Navy.                 It rarely happens that both
sets of moorings are at the same time required for use.             As the swinging a
ship, moreover, at Greenhithe is entirely dependent upon the tide, it must
be    commenced with the flood, added to which, the operation is often much
impeded by the wind, so that in the winter months, when the days are short,
and the seveu hours of ebb occur during nearly the whole of daylight,
much serious delay is the result ; the author has often occupied three days
in   adjusting a ship's compasses.
     The construction of a dock for this purpose would          be very desirable ; the
 expense may be urged against the proposal            ; but surely in London, one of
 the greatest mercantile cities in Europe, such an undertaking should be
 regarded as a national matter, and it is believed that shipowners would not
 object to pay a small rate of charge for the use of such a dock which might
 render it self-supporting.
     An opportunity for constructing such a dock may possibly arise in the
formation of the new docks at Dagenham, where the expense of an entrance
would be saved by simply making a basin from the dock large enough to
 swing a ship 400 feet in length round a dolphin placed in the centre, aud
 well supplied with mooring-posts for ropes to be made fast to, and a suitable

     With the view of deducing         a practical   result from     what    has been
  advanced   in the foregoing remarks, the author would most strongly urge
  the necessity of some official inspection of iron vessels with reference to
  their compass-fittings.    A code of rules and instructions might be laid down
  for this purpose ; this would be essential in the cases of new ships ; old
  ships should be examined at stated times, and certificates of compass
  adjustment he recognized by the appointed officer solely from those who
  can furnish evidence    of having  been properly instructed by competent per
  sons, so that such an important work should          not be allowed to be taken
  up and carried on by any amateur as his fancy may dictate.
     It may be a question how far a Government inspection would be
 cordially received by shipowners or public companies ; it might by some be
  regarded as an undue interference ; the Government also might be indis
  posed to incur the cost    of an extra office, with   all its details ; it might be
 more properly thought a matter for the consideration           of Lloyd's.     It is a
 question assuredly in which underwriters are largely and personally inter
 ested, and they already hold arbitrary powers as concerns the construction
 of the hull of a ship. The simple question of the compass as a means of
 safety is comparatively     disregarded.
     The  above suggestions are offered with     great deference, and the author
 would rather leave the subject in the hands of those more conversant with
 legislation than himself; but he cannot refrain from repeating that the
 results of his own practical experience (which has been of no small amount)
 convince him that an official supervision of the compass-fittings of iron
 ships has become, from various causes, absolutely requisite.
 III. " On    the  Tidal Curredts on the West Coast of Scotland."                  By
        Arcuibald Smith, M.A., F.R.S. Received March 1, 1866.
     The tidal currents  on that part   of the west   coast   of Scotland which is
comprised between the Mull of Canty rc and the Island of Mull run in
 general with great velocity.     Their velocity, direction, and the time of their
change, or of slack water, are therefore matters of great importance to
navigators.     On the other hand, the rise and fall of the tide is so small,
and the depth of water in the channels and the harbours so considerable,
that the times of high and low water are of comparatively small import
ance.
    While the laws of the currents are thus of more importance than the
laws of the rise and fall of the tide, they are also much more simple.            The
times of high and low water are very different at different parts of the

1866.]                             the West Coast               of Scotland.                                      43
coast, while the times of slack water are nearly the same throughout the
whole  regiou in question. In a great part of this regiou the current, which
sets for six hours in one direction, has no distinct title to be considered
either a flood tide or an ebb tide. The consequence is, that to describe
the laws of the currents by reference to the time of high and low water,
introduces great and unnecessary complexity.        The application to the
 currents of the method first applied by Admiral Beechey to the tidal
 stream of the English Channel and German Ocean (Phil. Trans. 1851,
p. 703) introduces at once order and simplicity, and makes that intelligible
which before was only a confused maze.
   In the following paper an attempt is made, from the materials to be
found in the charts of the Admiralty Survey of the west coast of Scotland,
now nearly completed, to obtain a first approximation to a tidal chart of
the west coast of Scotland.                   For this purpose                 I   have, with the kind assis
tance    of Commander Evans, F.R.S., the first Naval                                          Assistant   to      the
Hydrographer of the Navy, deduced from the charts all the information
to be there found as to the direction and times of change of the tidal
streams, as well as the times of high and low water. The latter are indi
cated in the usual way by Roman numerals, which, to avoid confusion, are
always within the land. The times of change and direction of the currents
 are described by a particular                symbol which                 I       have   found convenient for
 the purpose, and which                I   will now describe.
      In the   seas   which we are considering, the stream at any point generally
 flows for six hours      in one direction and for six hours in the opposite direc
 tion.    This may          be conveniently indicated by the following symbol                             :   —
 which indicates a stream flowing from XII. o'clock to VI. towards the cast,
 and from VI. to XII. towards the west.
   In this notation, for simplicity, the interval of the tide is considered as
 12    hours instead,        as   it really       is,   about   12h   2b"1.          The hours    are expressed
 in   Greenwich       mean time.
      The same symbol         is   adapted to the case             offlowing longer in one
                                                                        a      stream
 direction than in the other.                 Thus in the Sound of Sanda the stream at full
 and change may be indicated by
 indicating     that   it   flows seven hours towards the west and five hours to the
 east.
      The velocity of the                           by the length of the figure,
                                   stream may be expressed
 or sometimes more conveniently       separate lines, the terminations of which
                                                        by
 are well marked as            |  the length of the lines indicating either the

                                                                 if   it   is
  whole distance       which       a   particle of water moves in one tide.
                                                                                                 e   2

41                 Mr. A. Smith on     the  Tidal Currents on             [Mar. 8,
    I may observe that an analogous symbol may be used to express the
more complicated tides which occur where different streams meet.              Thus
near the Eddystone the stream may be expressed by a symbol         of this kind :—
                             —^
                        x<T
the bearing and distance of the centre of the diagram from any numeral
indicating the direction and rate of stream at that hour.
     The time of high and low water in the region which we are considering
 may be thus described.       Near the two extremities, viz. tbe Giant's Cause
 way and the Island of Eysdill, the time of high water at full and change is
 nearly V£ Greenwich time, being very nearly that due to the Great Atlantic
 tidal wave propagated from S.W. to N.E., and the same is very nearly
 the hour of high water on the chain of islands of which Isla, Jura and
 Scarba are the chief.     But along the coast of the mainland of Ireland aud
 Scotland the case is very different.       Between these two countries is the
 great opening    into the Liverpool  basin,  in which it is high water about XI.
 The change in the time of high water takes place by         the following   grada
 tions — At Giant's Causeway it is high water about VI., at Ballyeastle VII.,
        :
 Torpoint X., Mull of Cantyre XI., Gigha II., Loch Killispoint IV., Eys
 dill and Scarba V, Jura and Islay V|. But while the hour of high water
 varies, the stream through nearly the whole of the region runs from X. to
 IV.   in one direction and from IV. to X. in the other.
     Between the Mull of Cantyre and the N.E. coast of Ireland, the           X. to
 IV. stream runs to the north.
     The most westerly part turns to the west, and runs through the Sound
 of Rathlin along the north coast of Ireland ; the central part flows to the
 N.W. past the llhynns of Islay ; the easterly part, which has flowed partly
 through the Sound of Sanda, turns sharply round the Mull of Canlyre,
 and flows to the northward, pouring with great velocity through the nar
 row openings in the chain of islands, viz., the Sound of Islay between Islay
 and Jura, the Gulf of Corry Vreckan between Jura and Scarba, the little
 Corry Vreckan between Scarba and Lunga, the Slate Isles and the Cuan
 Sound ; of these the little Corry Vreckan is quite impassable ; and Corry
 Vreckan and the Cuan Sound are seldom attempted except near slack
  ,/ater.
     These channels open into the basin which lies between       Jura and Iona —
 a comparatively tideless sea, owing      apparently to the circumstance of the
 ocean tide from the outside    of Isla rising  to nearly the same height as that

 which ponrs      through   the openings, so that the tidal stream would be     little
 Altered  by building a    dam from     Islay to the Ross of Mull.
    The question may now be asked, Is the great X. to IV. stream which
 has just been described a flood or an ebb tide ?             So far as regards the
 Mnll of Cantyre, Fairhead, and all that lies to the south or east, it is a true
ebb tide.       So far as regards Jura, Scarba, and the coast to the north and
 east, it is a true flood tide ; but as regards a great part of the region in
 question, it cannot be called either a flood or an ebb tide, and much con
fusion is occasioned     in the Charts by attempting so to distinguish it.
    At the south end of Gigha in the Admiralty charts an arrow is laid
down, indicating that the flood tide runs to the northward ; and a few miles
south of this, another arrow is laid down, indicating that the flood tide runs
to the southward.         From these arrows we might expect to find at this
place a   meeting of the tide and a sudden change in the direction of the flood
stream.       But the stream which is indicated by these arrows is nothing more
than the    great X. to IV. northerly current which we have described. The
spot which is treated as a meeting of the tides, is merely that at which it is
high water at I.       North of this, for more than three hours of the X. to IV.
stream, the tide is rising, and it is indicated as a flood tide.           South for
more than      three hours the tide is falling, and it is indicated as an ebb tide.
    On the    south and west coast of Isla the confusion is greater. In some
of the charts, the incoming stream is marked as the flood, in others, and
perhaps with better reason,        the outgoing   tide.  It  is in truth neither the
one nor    the other.
   The extreme complication which arises from describing the time of change
of the stream by reference to the time of high and low water will now
appear; thus we should have to say that in the Sound of Sanda, the ebb
stream    begins two hours before high water ; at the Mull of Cantyre, one
hour before      high water ; a little north of this again two hours before high
water.     At the south of Gigha we might say indifferently, that the flood
tide runs to     the south and begins three hours before low water, or that it
runs to the      north and begins three hours after low water ; in the Sounds
of Islay   and the Gulf of Corry Vreckan that it begins an hour before low
water ;   and in describing the streams along the north coast of Ireland, we
have even      greater complication.
    The direction of the tidal streams on the rest of the west coast of Scot
land is easily described.

                                 The X. to IV. stream, through the course which
I have described, becomes an XL to V. stream at the outside of Isla, and
through the Sound        of Iona.     The stream which sets to the northward up
the  Sound of Jura fills the Linnhe Loch, and causes high water at the south
end   of the Sound of Mull at half-past V., whilst the high water caused by
the   ocean tide at the north end of the Sound of Mull is an hour later;
the consequence,      as may easily be seen, is that nearly the whole flood tide
through      the Sound of Mull runs to the northward, and the nearly whole
ebb tide    runs to the southward.

     The    tides   round the island of Skye arc comparatively simple.          The V.
 to  XI.   tide from the outside of        Mull is gradually retarded to a VI. to XII.
 stream at the outside of Skye, and then as it rounds the north end of Skye,
 it is met hy the tidal stream which has rounded the north end of the island
 of Lewis,     and bends round into the inner Sound         of Skye, where it becomes
 a  VII.   to   I. tide ;  the course of both streams      being nearly the same as if
 there were an embankment from Loch Shell in the island of Lewis to Ru
 Rea on the coast of Ross-shire.            At the same time, another branch of the
 tide which        has rounded the point of Ardnamurchan            flows through the
 Sound of Skye as a XII. to VI. tide, and being an hour earlier than the
 tide which has rounded the north end of Skye, it pours with great Telocity
 through Kyle Rea, but only to fill Loch Alsh and Loch Duich ; the retar
 dation which it meets with in so doing, making the rise inside of the nar
 rows at Kyle Akin so nearly contemporaneous with the rise outside, that
 there is little stream through that narrow opening ; the flood stream, as I
 am informed, sometimes             flowing in one direction and sometimes in the
 other, according to the prevailing winds.
    There are many more minute details in these streams which have features
 of  great interest.       I  have   not, however, ventured in the present imperfect
 state of the data which we possess to enter upon these.               I venture, how
 ever, to express a hope that before the survey is completed, the data             may
 be obtained for showing, and that the charts may show the direction               and
rate   of the    stream at every place and at any time.

    At a time when the causes which have led to climatal changes in various
parts of the globe are the subject of so much discussion, but little apology
is needed for calling the attention of this Society to what possibly may
have been one of these causes, though it has apparently hitherto escaped
observation.
    That great        changes    of climate have taken place, at all events in the
northern hemisphere            of  the globe, is one of the best established facts of
geology, and that corresponding changes have not been noticed to the
same extent in the southern hemisphere may possibly be considered as
due, rather to a more limited amount of geological observation, than to an
absence of the phenomena indicative of such alterations in climatal con
ditions having occurred.

    The evidence      of the extreme refrigeration      of this portion of the earth at
 the Glacial Period is constantly receiving fresh corroboration, and various
 theories have been proposed which           account for this accession of cold in a
more or less satisfactory manner.
    Variations in the distribution of land and water, changes in the direction
of the Gulf-stream, the greater or less eccentricity of the earth's orbit,
the passage of the Solar System through a cold region in space, fluctuations
in the amount of heat radiated by the sun, alternations of heat and cold
in the northern and southern hemispheres, as consequent upon the precession
of the equinoxes, and even changes in the position of the centre of gravity
of the earth and consequent displacements of the polar axis, have all been
adduced as causes calculated to produce the effects observed ; and the
reasoning founded on each of these data is no doubt familiar to all.
   The possibility       of any material change in the axis of rotation of the
earth   has been so      distinctly denied by Laplace* and all succeeding astro
nomers,     that    any theory involving such a change, however tempting as
affording a     solution of certain difficulties, has been rejected by nearly all
geologists as untenable.
   Sir Henry Jamest> however, writing to the ' Athenseum' newspaper in
I860, stated that he had long since arrived at the conclusion that there
was no     possible explanation of some of the geological phenomena testifying
to the    climate at certain spots having greatly varied at different periods,
without the supposition of constant changes in the position of the axis of
the   earth's    rotation.     He then, assuming as an admitted fact that the
earth    is at present a     fluid mass with a hardened crust, showed that slaty
cleavage,     dislocations,    and undulations     in the various     strata arc results
which might be expected            from the crust of the earth having to assume a
new external       form,  if  caused to revolve on a new axis,       and advanced the
theory that       the elevation of mountain-chains of larger extent than at
present    known produced these changes in the position of the poles.
   The subject was discussed in further letters from Sir Henry James, the
Astronomer       Royal, Professors Beete Jukes and Hennessy,             and others, but
throughout       the discussion the principal question at issue seems to have
been   whether any elevation of a mountain-mass could sensibly affect the
position of the axis of rotation of the globe as a whole, and the general
verdict was in the negative.
   At an earlier period (1848) the late Sir John Lubbock, in a short but
                                 '
conclusive      paper in the Quarterly Journal of the Geological Society'!'
pointed out what would have been the effect had the axis of rotation of the
earth not originally corresponded with the axis of figure, and also mentioned
some considerations which             appear to have been absent from Laplace's
calculations.

48              Mr. J. Evans   on Geological Changes in the              [Mar.  15,
    Sir John Lubbock, however, in common with other astronomers, appears
to have regarded the earth as consisting of a solid nucleus with a body of
water distributed over a portion of its surface ; and there can be but little
 doubt that, on this assumption of the solidity of the earth, the usually
received doctrines as to the general persistence of the direction of the
poles are almost unassailable.
    Directly, however, that we argue from the contrary assumption that the
solid portion of the globe consists of a comparatively thin, but to some
extent rigid crust with a fluid nucleus of incandescent mineral matter
within,    and that    this crust,   from various causes,    is liable to changes
disturbing its equilibrium, it becomes apparent that such disturbances may
lead, if not to a change in the position of the general axis of the globe, yet
at all events to a change in the relative positions of the solid crust and the
fluid nucleus, and in consequence       to a change in the axis of rotation, so far
as the former is concerned.
   The    existence  in the centre  of the globe of    a mass  of matter fluid by
heat, though accepted as a fact by many, if not most geologists, has no
doubt been called in question by some, and among them a few of great
eminence. The gradual increase of temperature, however, which is found
to take place as we descend beneath the surface of the earth, and which
has been observed in mines and deep borings all over the world, the
existence of hot springs, some of the temperature of boiling water, and
the traces of volcanic action, either extinct or still in operation, which occur
in all parts of the globe, afford strong arguments in favour of the hypothesis
of central heat.
   And though we are at present unacquainted with the exact law of the
increment of heat at different depths, and though, no doubt, under enormous
pressure the temperature of the fusing-point of all substances may be con
siderably raised, yet the fact of the heat increasing with the depth from
the surface     seems so well established that    it is highly probable that at  a
certain depth such a degree of heat must be attained as would reduce all
mineral matter with which we are acquainted into a state of fusion.          When
once this point was attained,     it seems probable that there would be no very
great variation in the temperature of the internal mass ; but whether the
whole is in one uniform state of fluidity, or whether there is a mass of solid
matter in the centre of the fluid nucleus, are questions which do not affect
the hypothesis about to be considered.
   Those who are inclined to regard the earth as a solid or nearly solid
mass throughout, consider that many volcanic phenomena may be accounted
for on the chemical theory, which has received the support, among others,
of Sir Charles Lyell. But apart from the consideration that such chemical
action must of necessity be limited in its duration, the existence of local
seas of fluid matter, resulting from the heat generated by intense chemical
Action, would hardly account for the increase of heat at great depths in
places remote from volcanic centres ; and the rapid transmission of shocks

of earthquakes   and the enormous amount of upheaval and subsidence as
evidenced by the thickness of the sedimentary strata, seem inconsistent
either with the general solidity of the globe or any very great thickness of
its crust.
   The supposition that the gradual oscillations of the surface of the earth,
of which we have evidence all over the world as having taken place ever
since the formation of the earliest known strata up to the present time, are
due to the      alternate inflation by gas and the subsequent depletion of certain
vast      bladdery cavities in the crust of the earth, can hardly be generally
accepted.
     Those who      wish to see the arguments for and against the theory of there
being      a fluid nucleus within the earth's crust, will find them well and fairly
stated      in Naumann's 'Lehrbuch der Geognosie'*.           My object     not to     is,
discuss     that question, but to point out what, assuming the theory to be
true,     would be some of the effects resulting from such condition of things,
                                                                           a
more   especially as affecting climatal changes. The agreement or disagree

sphere.

 If, however, the equilibrium of the shell or crust be destroyed, as, for
instance, by the addition of a mass of extraneous matter at H, midway
between the pole and the equator, not only would the position of the axis
 of rotation be slightly affected by the alteration in the position of the
centre of gravity of the now irregular sphere, but the centrifugal force of
the excess of matter at H would gradually draw over the shell towards D
 until, by sliding over the nucleus, it attained its greatest possible distance
from the centre of revolution by arriving at the equator.            The resultant
 effect  would  be  that  though   the whole  sphere  continued  to revolve around
 an axis as nearly as possible in the line      F G, yet the position of the pole
of   the  hollow   shell  would   have  been  changed by 45°, as by the passage
 of H to the equator the points I and K would have been brought to the
poles by spirals constantly decreasing in diameter, while A and B, by spirals
 constantly increasing, would have at last come to describe circles midway
between     the poles and the equator.
    The axis of rotation of the hollow sphere and that of its fluid contents
would now again coincide, and would continue to do so perpetually unless
 some fresh disturbance in the equilibrium of the shell took place.
    If  instead of the addition of fresh matter at H we had supposed an
excavation or removal of some portion of the shell, a movement in the axis
of rotation of the shell would also have ensued, since from the diminished
centrifugal force of that portion of the hollow sphere where the excavation
had taken place, it would no longer equipoise the corresponding portion on
the opposite side at I, and the excavated spot would eventually find its
way to the pole.
    In order more clearly to exhibit these effects, I have prepared a model
in accordance with a suggestion of Mr. Francis Galton, F.R.S., in which
a wheel representing a section of a hollow sphere has its axis, upon which
it can freely turn, fixed in a frame, which is itself made to revolve in such
a manner that the axis       of its rotation passes through one of the diameters
of the wheel,     and   coincides with what would be the axis of the sphere of
which the wheel is a section.
    In  the   periphery of the wheel are a number of adjustable screws with
heavy heads, so that, by screwing any         of them in or out, the addition of
matter or its abstraction at any part of the sphere may be represented.
    If by adjusting   these screws the wheel could be brought into perfect equi
librium,   its position upon its own axis would remain unchanged in whatever
position it was originally placed, notwithstanding any amount of rotation
being given to the frame in which it is hung ; but practically it is found
that with a certain given position of the screws a certain part of the wheel
coincides with the axis of the frame, or becomes the pole around which the
sphere revolves. The rim of the wheel is graduated so as to show the
position of the poles in all cases, and generally speaking the wheel always
settles   down after rotation with the pole within three or four degrees of
the same spot, if no alteration has been made in the adjustment of the

screws,    though of course what was the uppermost pole may hecome the
lower one ; and in some cases the wheel may be in equilibrio with a
projecting screw either       above    or below the equator, in which case there
may be     four readings on the circle at the index-point, according as the one
pole or    the other is uppermost, and the projecting screw is above or below
the equator.
     "With the screws on the wheel evenly balanced, a slight alteration in the
adjustment of any of them immediately tells upon the position of what,
for convenience sake, may be called the poles, except, indeed, in such
cases as screwing outwards those already at the equator, or making similar
alterations in the adjustment of two screws at equal distances on either side
of one of the poles. If a screw be turned outwards so as notably to
project at any spot, no matter how near to the pole, it will be found, after
the machine has been a short time in revolution, in the region of the
 equator.      Or again, if one or, better still, two opposite screws at the
 equator be turned inwards, they will be found after a short period of
 revolution at the poles.
      Now let us assume for a moment that, though the crust was partially
 covered by water, the earth, instead of being a spheroid, was a perfect
 sphere, consisting of a hardened crust of moderate thickness supported on
  a fluid nucleus over which the crust could travel freely in any direction,
  but both impressed with the same original rotatory motion, so that without
  some disturbing cause they would continue to revolve for ever upon the
  same axis, and as if they were one homogeneous body.              Let us assume,
  moreover, that this crust, though in perfect equilibrium on its centre of
   rotation, was not evenly spherical externally, but had certain projecting
   portions, such as would be represented in Nature by continents and islands
   rising above the level of the sea.
       It is evident that so long as those continents and islands remained
   unaltered in their condition and extent, the relative position of the crust to
   the enclosed fluid nucleus would remain unaltered also. But supposing
   those projecting masses were either further upheaved from some internal
    cause, or worn down and ground away by the sea or by subaerial agency
    and deposited elsewhere, it seems impossible but that the same effects
    must ensue   as we see   resulting   upon the model from the elevation and
    depression of certain  screws,   and that the axis  of rotation of the crust of
    the sphere would be changed in consequence of its having assumed a fresh
    position upon its fluid nucleus, though the axis of the whole sphere might
    have retained its original direction, or have altered from it only in the
    slightest degree.
       An irregular   accumulation    of  ice at one or both  of the poles, such as
    supposed   by M. Adhemar, would act in the        same manner as an elevation
    of the land ; and even assuming that the whole land had disappeared from
    above   the surface of the sea, yet if by marine currents the shallower
    parts of the universal ocean were deepened and the deeper parts filled up,

 there would, owing to the different specific gravity of the transported soil
 and the displaced water, be a disturbance in the equilibrium of the crust,
 and a consequent change in the position of its axis of rotation.
   Now if all this be true of a sphere, it will also, subject to certain
 modifications, be true of a spheroid so slightly oblate as our globe.
    The main difference in the two                    is,
                                                  sphere the crust may
                                              cases         that in   a
 assume any position upon the nucleus without any alteration in its struc
 ture, while in the case of the movement of     spheroidal crust over a
                                                                a
 similar spheroidal nucleus, every portion of its internal structure must
 be more or less disturbed as the curvature at each point will be slightly
 altered.
    The extent of the resistance to an alteration of position arising from this
cause  will depend upon the oblateness of the spheroid and the thickness
and rigidity of the crust    while the thicker the latter
                                      ;                                   is,
                                                             the less also will
be the proportionate effect of such elevations, subsidences, and denudations
as those with which we are acquainted.      The question of friction upon the
nucleus     also one that would have to be considered, as the internal matter
              is
though fluid might be viscous.
   It will of course be borne in mind that the elevations and depressions of
the surface of the globe are not, on the theory now under consideration,
regarded according to the proportion they bear to the earth's radius, but
according to their relation to the thickness of the earth's crust and that,      ;
even assuming Mr. Hopkins's extreme estimate to be true, yet elevations
or depressions, such as we know to have taken place, of 8000 or 0,000                 1
feet, bear nn appreciable ratio to the 800 or 1000                    miles which he assigns
as the thickness          of the earth's crust.
   It   is,
        however, to be remarked that the extremely ingenious speculations
of Mr. Hopkins are based on the phenomena of precession and nutation,
and that   once the possibility of
              if                    change in the position of the axis of
                                              a
rotation of the earth's crust be admitted,        not improbable that the
                                                            it
                                                            is
value of some of the data upon which the calculations of these movements
are founded may be affected.
   The supposition of the thickness of the crust being so great seems also
not only entirely at variance with observed facts as to the increase of heat
on descending beneath the surface of the earth, but to have been felt by
Mr. Hopkins himself to offer such obstacles    to any communication between
the surface of the globe and its interior, that he has had recourse to an
hypothesis of large spaces in the crust at no great depth from the surface,
and filled with easily-fusible materials, in order to account for volcanic and
other phenomena.
   But though     may be possible to account for volcanoes upon such an
                      it
assumption, yet,     already observed, the phenomena of elevation and
                           as
depression, such as we find to have taken place, and more especially the
existence      of   vast geological faults, cannot without            enormous difficulty be
reconciled with such            a   theory.

  Taking the increment of heat as 1° Fahrenheit for every 55 or 60 feet*
indescent, a temperature of 2400° Fahr. would be reached at about 25 miles,
sufficient to keep in fusion such rocks as basalt, greenstone, and porphyry ;
and such a thickness appears much more consistent with the fluctuations in
level, and the internal contortions and fractures of the crust which are
everywhere to be observed.      Sir William Armstrong, on the assumption of
the temperature of subterranean fusion being 3000° Fahr., considers that
the thickness of the film which separates us from the fiery ocean beneath
would be about 34 miles.
   Even assuming a thickness of 50 miles, so as to make still greater
allowance for the increased difficulty of fusion under heavy pressure, the
thickness of the crust would only form one-eightieth part of the radius of
the earth ; or if we represent the earth by a globe 1 3 feet in diameter,
the crust would be one inch in thickness, while the difference between the
 polar and equatorial diameters would be half an inch.
    In such a case, the elevation or wearing away of continents such as are
 at present in existence, rising, as some of them do, nearly a quarter of a
mile on an average above the mean sea-level, would cause a great dis
turbance in the equilibrium of the crust, sufficient to overcome considerable
resistance in its attempts to regain a state of equilibrium by a movement
 over its fluid nucleus.
    Whether the thickness of the earth's crust was not in early geological
 times less than at present, so as to render it more susceptible of alterations
 in position — whether the spheroid of the fluid mineral nucleus corresponds
 in form with the spheroid of water which gives the general contour of
 the globe — whether or no there are elevations anddepressions upon the
 nucleus corresponding to some extent with the configuration of the outer
 crust, and whether the motion of the crust upon         besides effecting       it,
 cliniatal changes, might not                   also lead to some elevations         and depressions   of
 the land,         and produce some of the other phenomena mentioned by Sir
 Ilenry         James, are questions which will leave for others to discuss.

          if,                                                                                  a

 54      Geological      Changes in Position        of the  Earth's Crust.     [Mar. 22,
    The former       existence of cold in what are now warm latitudes might, and
probably      did  in  part, arise from other causes than a change in the axis of
rotation, but no other hypothesis can well account for the existence of
traces   of  an almost tropical vegetation        within the Arctic circle.
    Of   the    former existence of such a vegetation, the evidence, though
strong,    is  not    conclusive.      But if the fossil plants of Melville Island, in
lat. 7i,° N.#, which appear to agree generically with those from the
English coal-measures, really grew upon the spot where they were now
discovered, they seem to afford conclusive evidence of a change in the
position of the pole since the period at which they grew, as such vegetation
must be considered impossible in so high a latitude.
    The corals and Orthoceratites from Griffiths Island and Cornwallis
Island, and the liassic Ammonites from Point Wilkie, Prince Patrick's
Island, tell the same story of the former existence of something like a sub
tropical climate at places at present well within the Arctic circle.
    To use the words of the Rev. Samuel Haughtont, in describing the fossils
collected by Sir F. L. McCliutock, "The discovery of such fossils in situ,
in 76° N. latitude, is calculated to throw considerable doubt upon the
theories of climate, which would account for all past changes of temperature
by changes in the relative position of land and water on the earth's
surface ;" and I think that all geologists will agree with this remark, and
feel that    if the  possibility of a change in the position of the axis of rotation
of the crust of the earth were once admitted, it would smooth over many
difficulties they now encounter.
   That     some such change is indeed taking place at the present moment
may    not   unreasonably be inferred from the observations of the Astronomer
Royal, who, in his Report to the Board of Visitors for 1861, makes use of
the following        language, though
                                             " only for the sake of embodying his
description of the observed facts," as he refers the discrepancies noticed
to " some peculiarity of the instrument                    The Transit Circle and Colli
mators still present those appearances of agreement between themselves
and   of change with respect         to the stars which seem explicable only on one
of two suppositions — that the ground itself shifts with respect to the
general Earth, or that the Axis of Rotation changes its position."

 L " On        the Action    of Trichloride     of Phosphorus on the Salts of
          the Aromatic Monamines."          By A. W. Hofmann, LL.D., F.R.S.,
          &c.    Received March 3, 1866.
     The starting-point of the following experiments was an accidental obser
 vation.       Whilst investigating the chlorine-, bromine-, and nitro-derivatives
 of aniline, I had prepared a large quantity of phenylacetamide by the action
 of chloride of acetyl on aniline. From the hydrochlorate of aniline, abun
 dantly produced as a by-product in this reaction, the aniline was recovered
 by treating the mother-liquors with hydrate of sodium. During the distil
 lation, after the greater part of the aniline had passed over and collected in
 the receiver, a tenacious oily fluid began to come over, adhering to the tube
 of the condenser and gradually becoming a crystalline mass. It was easily
 purified by washing with cold, and crystallization from hot alcohol.
      Beautiful white leafy crystals were thus obtained, fusible at 137°, and
  volatile without decomposition at a temperature beyond the range of the
  mercury-thermometer.          These crystals are almost insoluble in water, diffi
  cultly soluble in cold, but soluble in hot alcohol, and also soluble in ether.
  The solutions     are neutral.
      In acids the crystals    are also  easily soluble ; an alkali precipitates the
   original substance unaltered from the solutions.            The hydrochloric-acid
   solution yields, with tetrachloride of platinum, a difficultly soluble crystal
  line precipitate.     The new substance thus exhibits the deportment of a
   well-characterized    base.    Its composition   was  readily determined by com
   bustion with oxide of copper, the analytical       results pointing unequivocally
   to the   formula
                                         C7 H, N
   as  the simplest atomic expression for the new body.          But the whole beha
   viour of the substance, and more especially its transformation, by means
   of concentrated sulphuric acid, into aniline and acetic acid, leave no doubt
   that the above expression must be doubled, and that the new base is repre
   sented by the formula
                                       CMHHN,.
   This formula was confirmed by the analysis of the platinum-salt already
   mentioned,     and that of the nitrate which separates from the solution as
   an oily fluid, gradually changing to a beautiful crystalline compound ; the
   former contains
                               2(CHHuN2HCl),Pt*Clt,

       Whence is this body derived ? and how is its formula to be interpreted I
    An answer to these questions was furnished by examining the chloride of
    acetyl employed in preparing the phenylacetamide.              "When on distilling
    the chloride the principal product had passed        over,  the  thermometer gra-

  dually rose from 55° to 78°.          The last portion which came over was pure
 trichloride of phosphorus.          It was obvious that this substance must have
 played    a part  in  the   formation  of the new compound.
     I therefore submitted phenylacctamide to the action of trichloride of
 phosphorus.       The new body was formed, but in very unsatisfactory quan
 tity.    The result of the experiment was essentially different when phenyl-
 acetamide and aniline in varying proportions were jointly submitted to the
 action of trichloride of phosphorus.            The amount of Bubstance obtained
 varied with the composition of the mixture, and appeared greatest when
 the mixture was made in the proportion of one part of trichloride of phos
 phorus, two parts of aniline, and three parts of phenylacetamide.                   Hence
 the reaction had taken place according to the following equation             :
        3 C„ H7   N + 3 C„ II8 NO + PC13 =3 C14 Hu Na + H, POa +3 HC1.
    Perfectly similar results were obtained when a proportionate quantity of
 hydrochlorate of aniline was employed instead of aniline in this expe
 riment.
    The idea naturally presented itself to produce the same result without
 taking the trouble of preparing and purifying the phenylacetamide by in
 cluding its preparation in the very process of forming the new compound.
 For this purpose 6 molecules of aniline were added to 3 molecules of chlo
ride of acetyl, and the dense liquid thus ^obtained mixed with 1 molecule
of trichloride of phosphorus.          The result could not have been better:
        6 C„ H7  N + 3 C, H , OCl + PC13 = 3 Cu       H14  N„ + H, PO:j + 6 HC1    .
A simple additional         step and the true mode        of preparing the substance,
and with it the      general method for the production of an endless variety of
analogous bodies, was found.            Evidently   it was not even necessary to pre
pare the chloride of acetyl separately.              The new body must be as easily
obtained by the direct action of trichloride of phosphorus on aniline and
acetic acid.     The mixture had only to be made in such a manner that, after
transforming the acetic acid into chloride of acetyl, there was a sufficient
amount of trichloride of phosphorus left to perform the rest of the work.
In this case, therefore, 6 molecules of aniline and 3 molecules of acetic acid
had to be added to        2   molecules of trichloride of phosphorus,
       6 C, H7  N + 3 Ca H4 Oa + 2 PC1,= 3C1 H„ Na           + 2 H, PO, + 6 HC1.
    The reaction     is violent, and the operation must be performed with care.
The substances         are mixed according to the above equation.                For this
purpose     three  parts   by   weight  of aniline  are added    to one  part   of   acetic
acid and into     the   mixture   surrounded    by cold water  two parts of trichloride
of phosphorus       are slowly poured    ;  in which proportion the latter compound
is in slight excess.       The tenacious fluid thus obtained is then heated for a
couple of hours to 160°.           On cooling, it solidifies to a hard, friable, trans
lucent, resinous mass of a light-brown colour, which dissolves in boiling
water almost without residue, leaving only traces of an amorphous yellow

substance        containing phosphorus behind.                 The clear filtered solution,
after cooling, yields, on the addition of soda, a white crystalline precipitate,
which requires only to be washed and reerystallized from alcohol.
     The foregoing equations give a pretty clear idea of the qualitative and
quantitative nature of the experiment, but they do not afford us an insight
into the true mechanism of the reaction.                     This, nevertheless, is a very
simple one.         Trichloride of phosphorus           acts  water-generating        and water-
withdrawing.           The oxygen required for this purpose is supplied by the
phenylacetamide ; as, however, the molecule of this compound contains
but one atom of hydrogen belonging to the original ammonia skeleton, a
molecule of aniline is required in addition to supply the second atom of
hydrogen.          In this    manner a diamine is formed, in which two atoms of the
hydrogen        of the    double ammonia type are replaced by two univalent phe-
nyl-residues, and three of the remaining hydrogen atoms by the trivalent
group C, H,, to which the term ethinyl* may for the present be applied.
     The new body would thus become ethenyldipkenyldiamine,                           the forma
tion of which in the most simple form would depend upon the removal of
 1 mol. of water from 1 mol. of phenylacetamide and 1 mol. of aniline.

      I was anxious        to test this assumption by experiment.
     * The term                                      C, H3, which in the new compound functions
                   ethenyl proposed for the group
 with the value     of  3 atoms of hydrogen,  is framed according to a system of nomenclature
 to which I have occasionally resorted, in the boundless confusion of names now prevail
 ing in organic chemistry, as a means of communication with my pupils.                  Perhaps this
 system is    capable of further development.
     It  is a  peculiar feature of the development of modern chemistry that more than ever
 before is felt the necessity of grouping the organic          compounds     round the hydrocar
  bons.     The question therefore may be said to reduce itself to the discovery of a good
  principle of nomenclature for the compounds of hydrogen and carbon.               Many attempts
  hive been made in this direction, as yet without any acceptable results.
      For the purpose of framing my names I fuse the method oiiginally employed by
  Laurent with the principle proposed by Gerhardt, and more or less adopted by his
  successors.
      An example will illustrate my mode of proceeding.        Let us consider the most import
  ant of all  the series of hydrocarbons, the homologues      of marsh-gas.    All the members of
  this series I make terminate in one, distinguishing the order of succession by prefixing the
  first syllable of the Latin numeral corresponding to the number of carbon atoms in
  the molecule.      From this rule the first three members       of the series are conveniently
  excepted,    their names having been so long in use as to render        it desirable to embody
   them in the system.
      By the removal      of 1 atom of hydrogen from the hydrocarbon, the latter ceases to
  be a    mt'irated compound, and the remaining group of atoms becomes univalent.               The
   termination yl now takes the place of one.         A second atom of hydrogen is removed,
   the group becomes bivalent and now terminates in ene; a third hydrogen atom is sepa
   rated, the group is again raised in value by one becoming      in fact trivalent, and acquires
   the termination     enyl.    By the removal of the fourth and fifth atom of hydrogen the

      At  100° iodide        of ethyl    has   no action     on ethenyldiphenyldiamine,             but
  at about 150° the two bodies react                 on   one another.         The mixture,        after
  being heated for five or six hours, yielded, upon cooling, beautiful crystals
  of an iodide.          By treatment with chloride of silver this iodide was converted
  into the corresponding chloride, and then into the platinum-salt.                           Analysis
  of this salt showed that the ethyl group had been once taken up. On
  the addition of caustic soda the corresponding base was separated.                                   It
 is a thick oily fluid, which, when shaken with water, does not impart to it
  the slightest      alkaline reaction.          By renewed treatment with iodide of ethyl
 an iodide,      it  is  true,  was separated,       but it was proved on examination that
 the ethyl group had not been assimilated a second time.                             In the sense of
 the above assumption, this nevertheless ought to have taken place.                                The
 experiment was therefore repeated with iodide of methyl which is well
 known to act much more powerfully than the ethyl-compound.                                This body-
 attacks the ethylated base even at 100°.                    The iodide thus obtained, when
 decomposed by oxide of silver, yielded a strongly                       alkaline liquid, whence

    This is not the place to devclope this subject further. The short notice 1 have given
must    suffice.    A superficial examination of the system shows, however, how large a
number of group- of atoms may be clearly and succinctly expressed in it.
    It appeared      convenient    to submit   the plan   to a provisional test by framing some
of the names required          for the substances    which were furnished by the above expe
riments.
    Bodies containing oxygen may be as simply nominated according to this plan.

responding to elhenic alcohol would be ethoxenic acid (glycolic acid), the second being
ethdioxenic acid (oxalic acid).           We speak of the oxylic, oxenic, and dioxenic acidt of
a series, of the quartane          terie», for instance, and any one would understand          that by
these expressions       are meant butyric, butylactic, and succinic acids.

it was at once    inferred that the methyl group had been added to the ethyl
group already present in the substance.              This conclusion was amply corro
borated by the analysis of the platinum-salt precipitated from the liquid.

phosphorus on a mixture of 3 molecules of phenylbenzamide and 3 molecules

The product is a very weak base crystallizing in line silky needles.                   The
hydrochlorate forms thin brilliant plates difficultly soluble in water, which
upon rc-crystallization lose their acid.         The analysis led to the formula

     The phenyl-com pounds of the acetic and valeric groups above described
 are   naturally linked with a compound which several years ago I procured
  by an essentially different reaction.          This substance, which at the time
  1 described under        the name of formyldiphenyldiaminef, but to which,
  in accordance with my present ideas on nomenclature, I would give the
  name methenyldiphenyldiamine,          is obtained by the action of chloroform on

The result proved that the methenyl-compound can be thus prepared even
more easily than by means of chloroform.
    In conclusion, the relation must be mentioned which the compounds just
described bear to the base obtained by Professor Streckert, when acting
with gaseous hydrochloric           acid on acetamide.           The body thus formed          is
and has been called aeediaminc, for which                    name,    in accordance with the
proposed nomenclature, I would now substitute the term ethenyldiamine.
When compared with the analogous aniline-compound,                               the very slight
stability    of acediamine,     which     splits up   with    the greatest facility into acetic
acid and ammonia, deserves to be noticed.
    A quintenyldiamine, corresponding to the quintenyldiphenyldiamine, has
not as yet been prepared.             Methenyldiamine, on the other hand, is known,
although the compound which I have in view has scarcely been looked
upon as such.         The body in question is no other than cyanide of ammo

II. " Notice of a         Zone of Spots on the         Sun."      By John Phillips,
        M.A., LL.D., F.R.S., Professor of Geology in the University
        of Oxford.       Received March 22, 1866.
    During the latter half of February and the first half of March, spots of
extremely varied character have appeared on the sun, and have been seen
with great distinctness, in good observing weather, through the whole or
parts   of two semi-rotations. On the 13th of February, at I0h 25°', four
spots were    visible on the disk, in the situations marked Z, A, B, C in the dia
gram    No. 1.     In that diagram the apparent course of the sun's equator is
                                     Diagram No. 1.
 marked by the curved line e, and the pole           of rotation  at  P.   Thus the four
 spots   indicated   for observation being all on        the same side of the sun's
 equator,    and  all  within the latitude of 10°,        constitute a zone of spots.
 Since that date a fifth spot, D, still in the same zone, has appeared, fol
 lowing C.       Of these Z was about to disappear ; its reappearance was
 noted, and several remarkable changes              in form were observed while it
 traversed    half the disk, till its contraction to a black speck 1000 miles in
 diameter,    after which it was obliterated.         The spot B had advanced some
  distance on  the disk, and   was followed   till the 2 1 st of February, when it ap
 proached the edge, with indications of being a shallow concavity.                 It was
  not observed to reappear.       The spots A and C require longer notice, both
  on  account   of  their persistence through more than a rotation-period, and
  because of the remarkable changes which they have undergone.
     The spot D is now under observation.
     The spot A, visible from the 4th to the 16th of February, and again
  reappearing early in     March,  was solitary,     and approximately       round, mea
  suring,   on February     10, about   23,000     miles across    the penumbra,      and
  about 8000    across the umbra.
      It had a clear brown tint over the whole penumbra, the body of the sun
   appearing fairly white, and a deeper brown tint over part
                                                                          of the umbin,
   the remaining and larger space of the umbra being           black.    The   penumbral
   space was marked     with the  broken   structure    represented    in  a former  com

munieation*.         The   edges   of the umbra    and penumbra were much broken,
the former running out into a sharp point on the apparent left, and in
cluding a lighter brown space.
   Except in this part, the dark umbra was uniformly and equally distant
from the penumbral border, so that it offered an excellent object, large
enough and distinct enough to be employed with confidence as a test of
the depth of the umbra beneath the luminous photosphere.
   In a former communication I assigned to an umbra of good figure,
carefully observed, a depth of only 300 milesf. Since then M. ChacomacJ
has given the depth        of 400 miles      as an    approach to average, though in
some cases      1 000  miles might be nearer.       That the spots are most frequently
sunk below the photosphere, as Wilson long since asserted, can no longer
be doubted, since Mr. De la Rue, Mr. Stewart, and Mr. Loewy have re
corded, after many measures of photographs taken at Kew, as the general
result that the interior parts of the solar spot are sunk below the general
surface §.
   The spot now under consideration approached the edge of the disk on
the  1 5th of February,        when the umbra seemed nearly bridged across by a
lighter part, and was perceptibly but very slightly nearer to the following,
or left-hand side.
   The reappearance of this spot was anxiously looked for. It came into
view on the morning of March 3, having when observed passed the limb
about 6° 1 6'.       Its appearance was sketched on this occasion, and again on
successive days to the 14th of March.              Its apparent magnitude was dimi
nished, but the main features were less altered than is usual with sun-
spots.     The umbra still appeared in such relation to the penumbral border
as to confirm the opinion of its being but very little depressed below the
photosphere.        Remarkable changes happened between the 7th and 10th of
March.      On the 8th two broad penumbral extensions appeared ; on the 9th
these were separated        into two detached masses, and much altered in figure.

    The great spot, or rather aggregation of spots, marked C, was observed
from the       13th to the 24th of February, as often as good opportunities
occurred in the extremely variable weather.            When fully expanded, about
the 17th,     18th, and 19th of February, it measured about 12° on the surface
of the sun,       and occupied a space about 100,000 miles long, lying not
quite parallel to      his equator, and including forty or more black, dark, and
dusky nmbral tracts, in a complicated penumbral area.                 The definition
was often excellent, so as to show the granular surface of the photosphere
with more than        ordinary distinctness.
   The same fine brown           tint already referred to was observed in the pe
numbral      spaces,     and   there   was every gradation of depth in this tint
observable     in the many specks and spots, till in a few only it seemed to be
black.     The penumbral tracts were plainly broken up into a kind of net
work of granulation ; and the largest spot, chosen for special study, threw
out long black digitations          into the surrounding granulated space of the
penumbra, like slits in a solid substance, 1000 or 2000 miles in length.
   These characters of the largest spot in the group C became very pro
minent on the 1 9th of February, and were accompanied by others of an
unusual character, which seem to deserve special attention in the question
of the nature and history of these black spaces.             In the drawing for this
date these appearances are sketched with a power of 135.               The spot was
somewhat rhoniboidal, the extreme length from angle to angle being about
 15,000   miles, the least breadth about 4500.          On the right the boundary
was   gently convex       ;  parallel to it was a bright facular tract of uniform
breadth ; this was          margined on the right by a nearly continuous very
narrow black band, 17,500 miles long, extending in both directions be
yond the spot, and slightly ramose in the (apparently) upper part.              Pa
rallel to   this again was a curiously interrupted series of black angularly
bent   sharp cuts, ending upwards in a larger subdigitated mass, near which
were    some other small spots, forming broken chains, which turned off in
curves to    the right for about 40,000 miles (PI. II. fig. 7).
   On the    20th of February the appearances had changed to those repre
sented in another sketch (PL II. fig. 8), where the great spot, something
 reduced in magnitude and altered in figure, shows very long digitations
on all    sides  ;  the facular space on the right is broader ; the long very
 narrow black band shows two internal extensions ; the outer crested ridge
 has gathered itself into a shorter figure, 10,000 miles long, and has
                                                                                lost
 the character of angular tegulation which was so remarkable on the 1 9th.
    On the 21st the spot had approached enough toward the limb to un
 dergo some     apparent change of general figure, by contraction perpendicular
 to the   edge ; the facular space on the right was entirely free from the
 narrow curved black divisional band ; and the summit of the outer broader
 band was bent away from the great spot, to which it had been parallel
 (PI.  II.   fig. 9).     The disappearance of the spot amidst large       elevated
 bright faculae     and    depressed   broader shaded  tracts, was sketched on the
   VOL.   XV.                                                           G

 24th of February.     Reappearing with similar splendid companion ridges
of mountainous clouds, but much reduced in size, and altered in every
part, it was observed again from the 12th to the 17th of March, after
 which the weather allowed no further opportunity.       Two sets of drawings
 of this remarkable spot are presented to show its growth, development,
 and decay (PI. II. figs. 7, 8, 9, and 10, 11, 12).    The apparent path on
 the sun's disk is given for each period of appearance — the two paths
 differing by reason of the change in the apparent place of the sun's equator
 (see Diagram   No. 3).
                                 Diagram No. 3.
    But   few examples occur  of such large penumbral tracts grouped about
 so many dark and half-darkened       umbrae.   Ou the sun they occupied, as
 already stated, a tract about 12° in length, not quite parallel to the
 equator ; and may be compared to some of those which are most conspi
 cuous in Mr. Carrington's plates.
    From what has been observed, it appears that, in a given zone of spots,
not only are the aspects of the particular spots much diversified, but
further, that the changes to which they are subject offer much variety.
These circumstances seem to point to particular local conditions as the
cause of the diversity of appearance, though it may be possible to refer to
other influences the frequency of their occurrence, if not the fact of their
occurring at all.
    The five spots now under review lie within an arc of longitude of 20o°,
leaving 155° in which as yet no spot has lately been seen. In 1864, during
the months of March and April, a zone of spots, also five in number, and on
the same side of the equator, was contained within an arc of longitude of
243°, leaving   117°  at that time free from spots.    There was then within
the same arc of 243° a pair of spots in about the same latitude, but in the
opposite hemisphere.      Taking  these into account, the average of the arcs
of longitude between the spots was about 49°. In the case of the spots
lately passing it was 51°.   Twenty-six revolutions would have brought the
middle of that zone of activity of 1864 to nearly the same place on the
sun's disk, as the group now under consideration.
    To whatever cause we day ascribe the fact of the breaking out    of these

   1866.]          Prof. Phillips on     a Zone  of Spots  on the. Sun.            G7
  spots,  there would appear reason for expectation that spots of like cha
  racter may be expected to recur again in the same parts of the sun's
  surface.    In the great work of Mr. Carrington we find several examples
  of the appearance of new spots in nearly the same plnces as those which
 had been so     occupied before.      Those who think with      M. Chacornac that
 sun-spots    are due to volcanic eruptions, and regard their changes of ap
 pearance as effects       of the displacement of solid and gaseous bodies about
 the region    of disturbance, must naturally look for repetitions of      these phe
 nomena in the same parts         of the solar surface.
    The greater frequency of spots between the parallels of 10° and 30°
lat. N. and S., the comparative rarity of them on the equator, and the
almost entire absence of them from the circumpolar regions is well esta
blished.      If  we take the data from     Mr. Carrington's register and     suppose
in all 1000 spots       to be observed, 178 will be found between the parallels of
0°    and   10° from the equator, 450 between 10° and 20°, 324 between
20° and     30°, and 48 above 30°.
    The proportionate numbers for the northern and southern hemispheres
are   450 in North latitude, 550 in South latitude.
    If now   we inquire, by the aid of the same invaluable book, as to the re
lative   frequency of spots in different longitudes, we shall obtain a result of
considerable interest in reference to the question of the place of the
eruptions.        Mr.    Carrington   has registered his observations    through 99
rotations,   and has arranged them iu groups which             can be tabulated for
longitude.       Assuming the rotation-period to be exact enough for fixing
 the longitudes in the course of seven years and 142 days, we may repre
sent the relative frequency of the spots on different meridians as follows : —

 of the sun in three meridional compartments of 120° each, and suppose
  1000   spots  in all,  we shall find

 Bhow that certain tracts of the sun's surface are more liable to eruption
 than other tracts, by reason of local peculiarity only.

68             Prof. Phillips on a Zone of Spots               on the Sun.          [Mar. 22,
                            Luminosity of the Sun.
   Attentive observation shows the light of the sun to be feeblest toward the
edges of the disk, strongest about the centre.    By M. Chacomac's measure
the ratio of the central to the marginal light is 100 to 45.         Looking
directly on the central regions, the light is found to be much the brightest
on the apparent summits of the undulations of the photosphere ("rice-
grains") ; and looking to the limb, it is the faculee which are the brightest
parts.    In each case it is the outermost parts of the photosphere which
are the brightest, and it is the innermost parts which are the darkest.
The depth of shade appears to be in direct proportion to the depth
below the outer surface of the photosphere.       It appears to me that such
appearances   would  follow  naturally from the  hypothesis mentioned in my
first communication on this subject *. The hypothesis is that the lowest
parts of the umbral spaces' yield the least refrangible and least luminous
Tays, such as belong to the space about the red end of the spectrum.
These spaces may not be black, not even very dark, except by comparison
with the brilliant spaces around ; where the rays from them pass into the
photosphere, they heat               it,
                             as the dark rays separated  by sulphuret of
carbon in Tyndall's experiment heat the platinum foil, and other solid
bodies.   Bodies thus heated emit new rays according to their nature the                ;
solar photosphere    of such nature as to send to us the mingled pencils
                         is                a
which we receive     the principal effect of this kind being at
                     ;                                           maximum on    a
the outermost layer.      The effect of this will be to cause streams of the
most luminous rays from the most elevated parts of the photosphere, which
will be seen directly in front, about the sun's centre, while toward the edges
the sides of the undulations               alone will be seen, and the rays which they
yield will     be less luminous         — the only parts which     are there very bright
being the high ridges of the faculse.
  Another view has presented itself to me.                     If
                                                             the depressed
                                                                    we admit
part to be the body of the sun disclosed from below the luminous envelope,
we may suppose its darkness to be due simply to radiation.    For however
hot the sun may be,    its composition be like that of the earth, the fused
                              if
parts would  be cooled   and darkened at the surface where          may be         it
uncovered — very much darkened where the exposure           complete (theis
umbra),  partially so where the envelope     not wholly removed (the pe
                                                        is
numbra).   It might be some test of this view, the hourly changes of the
                                                               if
umbra, immediately after its first appearance, could be accurately noted
in respect of the degree of darkness as well as of the change of form.
The umbra ought to grow darker and darker, never lighter and lighter,
except    by
         the overspreading of photosphere, which would be indicated
independently      by    changes      on the penumbral area.
   From what     I   have seen in the course      of these observations,       I    infer that
the study of the physical condition of the solar spots cannot be regarded
as likely to yield data of sufficient weight,   do not include determiiia-

I. " On Uniform Rotation."                By C. W. Siemens, F.R.S.          Received
                                    March 10, 1866.
                                        (Abstract.)
     The paper sets out with an inquiry into the conditions of the conical
pendulum as a means of obtaining uniform rotation.              This instrument, as
applied by       Watt   to  regulate   the velocity of  his steam-engines, is shown
to be    defective, — first, because the regulated position of the valve depends
upon the angular position of the pendulums, and therefore upon the velocity
 of rotation, which must be permanently changed in order to effect an ad
justment     of the valve; and secondly,    because when the balance between force
 and resistance     of  the engine at a given velocity is disturbed, the angular
 position of the pendulums will not change until a power has been created
 in them, through acceleration of the engine, sufficient to overcome the me
 chanical resistance     of the valve, giving rise to a series of fluctuations before
 a balance    between the power and resistance of the engine is reestablished.
      These defects in Watt's centrifugal governor are shown to be obviated
 in the chronometric governor, an instrument which was proposed by the
 author    of the paper twenty-three years      ago, and which consists   of a conical
 pendulum       proceeding at a uniform angle of rotation, and therefore at
 naiform speed, which is made to act upon the regulating-valve by means
 of a differential motion between itself and the engine to be regulated, which
 latter has to accommodate        itself to the rotations imposed by the indepen
 dent   pendulum.       The differential-motion wheels are taken advantage of
 for imparting independent        driving- or sustaining-power to the pendulum ;
  and a constancy of the angle of rotation, notwithstanding              unavoidable
  fluctuations in the sustaining-power, is secured (within certain limits) by
 calling into play a break, or fluid resistance, at the moment when the angle
  of rotation reaches a maximum, which maximum position is perpetuated by
 increasing the sustaining-power         beyond what is strictly necessary to over
  come the ordinary resistance of the pendulum.
      The chronometric governor is used by the Astronomer Royal to regulate
  the motion of the large equatorial telescope and recording apparatus at
  Greenwich, in which application a very high degree of regularity is at
   tained ; but the instrument proved to be too delicate in its adjustments for
  ordinary steam-engine      use.
       After a short allusion to   M. Foucault's governor, the paper enters upon
    the description  of a new apparatus which the writer has imagined for ob
    taining uniform rotation, notwithstanding great variations in the driving-
    power, and which consists, in the main, of a parabolic cup, open at top and

 bottom and mounted upon a vertical axis, which cup dips with its smaller
 opening into a liquid contained within a casing completely enclosing the
 cup.     It is shown that a certain angular velocity of the cup will raise the
 liquid (entering from below) in a parabolic curve to its upper edge or brim,
 and that a very slight increase of the velocity will cause actual overflow, in
 the form of a sheet of liquid, which, being raised and projected against the
 sides   of the outer chamber,       descends   to the bath below, whence fresh
 liquid continually     enters  the cup.     Without the overflow scarcely any
 power is required to maintain the cup,      with the liquid it contains, in motion ;
 but the moment an overflow ensues,           a considerable amount of power is
 absorbed in raising and projecting          a continuous stream of the liquid,
 whereby further acceleration is prevented, and nearly uniform velocity is
 the result.      When absolute uniformity is required, the cup is not fixed
 upon the rotating axis, but is suspended from it by a spiral spring, which
 not only supports its weight, but also transmits the driving-power by its
 torsional moment.        The cup is guided in the centre upon a helical surface,
 which arrangement has for its result that an          increase  of resistance or of
 driving-power     produces an increased torsional       action of the spring, and
 with it an automatic descent of the cup, sufficient to make up for the
 thickness of overflow required to effect the readjustment between power
 and resistance, without permanent increase of angular velocity.
    It is shown that the density of the liquid exercises no influence upon the
velocity of the cup, which velocity is expressed by the following formula,
                                           2rjr
in which
                n signifies the number of revolutions per second,
                h the height of liquid from the surface to the brim       of cup,
                r the radius of the brim, and
                p the radius of lower orifice of cup   ;
 only the rigidity    of the spring must   be greater when a comparatively dense
liquid   is employed.
    In order to   test the principle of action here involved, Mr. Siemens has
constructed a clock consisting of a galvanic battery, an electro-magnet, and
his gyrometric cup, besides the necessary reducing-wheels and hands upon
a dial face, which proceeds at a uniform rate, although the driving-power
may be varied between wide limits, by the introduction of artificial resis
tances into the electrical circuit.      The instrument appears, therefore, well
calculated for regulating the speed of all kinds of philosophical apparatus,
and also for obtaining synchronous rotations at different places for tele
graphic purposes.        One of its most interesting applications is embodied in
the  "  Gyrometric Governor
                                 " for                   of which an illustration is

considerable force against the sides of the outer vessel, at the expense of                          a
corresponding retarding effect on the cup, increasing its regulating-power.
  The cup-spindle carries at its lower extremity    pinion, which gears into

 the     attainment of several important objects.

    The term fluorescence in the last few years has found     place in physio    a
 logical works because different substances that occur in the body have been
 said to possess the property of fluorescence.   Of these the solution of bile-
  acids    concentrated sulphuric acid, the white of egg when kept for a
            in
                                                                                     H   2

  short    time,   and the urine      sometimes, are        the best-known      fluorescing
   substances.
      But   as long since as 1845, Professor       Briicke, in Muller's ' Archiv,' stated
  that he had found in many and very frequently repeated experiments, that
  the lens absorbed the blue rays of light to a very great extent, and that the
  cornea and the aqueous humour did so to a less extent, but that the lens
  together with these other media absorbed these rays to the greatest de
  gree.     He used the eyes of oxen and of rabbits, and the lens of a pike's
  eye, which last, when dried with care, preserved its transparency, and allowed
  the light to fall on a porcelain plate covered with tincture of guaiacum and
  bleach a portion of the green surface.
      Professor Stokes, in his well-known          paper
                                                           " On  the Change of the Re-
  frangibility of Light," in the Philosophical Transactions for 1852, says
  (p. 512),    "It  is found that the property of change of refrangibility in the
  incident light is extremely common."               '' To make a list of sensitive sub
  stances would be useless work        ;   for it is very rare to meet with a white or
  light-coloured      organic  substance which is not more or less sensitive."
  Among others he mentions horn, bone, ivory, white shells, leather, quills,
  white feathers, white bristles, the skin of the hand, and the nails. And in
  his conclusion (p. 557), he says, " The phenomenon of change of refrangi
  bility proves to      be extremely     common, especially in the case of organic
  substances,    such as those ordinarily met with, in which it is almost always
  manifested to a greater or less degree."
     When speaking of the fluorescence               of sulphate of quinine, he         says
  (p. 541), "When quinine          was dissolved in dilute hydrochloric acid, the
 blue colour was not exhibited, not even when the fluid was held in the
  sunlight and examined by superficial projection."
     In  1855   Helmholtz published    a paper    in PoggendorfFs 'Annalen,' vol.xciv.
 p. 205, in which        he says that, as far as quinine paper showed that the
  spectrum extended, so far the eye could perceive light *.
     He then proposes this question, Does the retina see the rays beyond the
 violet directly as it sees other colours of the spectrum, or does it fluoresce
 under the influence of these rays? and is the blue colour of the rays beyond
 the violet light of less refrangibility which shows itself in the retina only
 under the influence of the violet rays ?
     To determine this question, he says,            I  examined for fluorescence the
retina of the eye of a man who had been dead for eighteen hours. The first
experiment showed that          it  was very feebly fluorescent.        The retina      was
less fluorescent than paper, linen, and ivory, but more than porcelain.
    * In  1853  Prof. Donders, in a paper in Muller's 'Archiv,' p. 471, " On the Action of
the Invisible Rays of high Refrangibility on the Media of the Eye," says that " most,
if not all, the rays of higher refrangibility than the violet reach the retina, and are not
absorbed by the different media through which the light passes ;" and Dr. Kessler, in
'
   Archiv fur Ophthalmologic,' 1854, vol. I. p. 449, says that " the crystalline lens is not
the, causa of the invisibility of the rays of high refrangibility; for when the lens is
removed by operation these rays are not more visible.

     The colour      of the light dispersed through the retina is greenish white,
 very    different from that which the direct perception of these rays usually
gives.
     In   1858,   in the Comptes Kendus des Seances de la Socie'te' de Biologie
pendant le mois de Novembre 1858, pp. 166 & 167, there is a short
notice headed " Analyse et conclusions d'un travail sur la fluorescence des
milieux de Poeil, par M. Jules Ueguauld."
    He used sunlight, and found in man and the mammifera that the cornea
fluoresced in a very slight degree.          In the sheep, dog, cat, and rabbit, the
crystalline lens possessed in the highest degree fluorescent properties.             In
these animals, and also in many birds, the central part of the lens (endo-
phaine of MM. Valenciennes and Fremy), preserved by desiccation at a
low temperature,        retained this property.
    The central       portion of the crystalline    of many aquatic vertebrata and
mollusca       (phaconine of    MM.   Valenciennes    and Fremy) is almost entirely
 without fluorescence.
    The hyaloid body possesses only a very feeble fluorescence, due to the
 hyaline membranes ; for the vitreous humour itself is not fluorescent.
    The retina, as      M. Helmholtz discovered,     possesses a certain fluorescence
 which is not      at all comparable in intensity   to that of the crystalline lens of
 mammifera.
     Finally,    M.  Regnauld concludes that, if we must attribute the accidents
 caused by feebly luminous radiations of the electric light to the phenomena
 of fluorescence, it is above all in the energetic action on the crystalline that
 it is natural to look for an explanation.        The impression which the cornea
 undergoes      must nevertheless not be neglected.
     In 1859, in the ' Archiv fur Ophthalmologic,' vol. v. part 11. p. 205,
 there is a paper by J. Setschenow of Moscow,
                                                        " On the Fluorescence of the
 Transparent Media of the Eyes of Man and some other Animals."                      He
 undertook the       examination   at Professor  Helmholtz's   request, because  it was
  possible that the phenomena of fluorescence observed by Helmholtz might
  have been     modified by a post-mortem change in the eye.
      He experimented on the eyes of oxen and rabbits.               The fresh retina
  showed the same phenomena            as  the  dead   human   retina.   It diffused a
  greenish-white     light, which, examined by    a prism, gives a spectrum in which
  the red    is wanting.
      The vitreous humour in a thin glass vessel showed only traces of fluo
  rescence.      The lens, on the contrary, fluoresced very strongly : the colour of*
  the dispersed light is white-blue, exactly like quinine ; only the quinine was
  a little stronger.     Examined by a prism, the dispersed light gave a spectrum
  in which the red was wanting, and         in which the blue tone predominated.
  The fluorescence      begins, as in quinine solutions, between G and H, and is
  strongest at the outer edge       of the violet rays, and extends into the ultra
  violet   to the same distance in the case of the lens as. in the case of the
  quinine solution.

     When the cornea was cut out, it fluoresced much feebler than the lens           ;
 the aqueous humour did not fluoresce at all.
    The   appearances    in the three last media, he says, can be shown with
 the greatest ease, even in the eye of a living man. When the eye is brought
 into the focus of the ultra-violet rays, immediately the cornea and the lens
 begin to glimmer with a white-blue light. The cornea in the living eye is
 much more strongly fluorescent than when dissected out, probably from
 the loss of transparency consequent on contraction of the texture and from
 evaporation.
    The question how and why our eyes perceive the ultra-violet spectrum
 is still undetermined.       The fluorescence of the lens would be rather a
 hindrance than a help      ; only the general sensibility to the light which the
 ultra-violet rays produce in our eyes can be explained by the fluorescence
 of the media lying before the retina.

 Pfluger, by mixing fresh ox-gall with concentrated sulphuric acid, saw a
 clear dichrotic solution form.       It had a deep red colour by transmitted
 light, and a     beautiful   green colour by reflected light.        This was seen
 very beautifully when dried bile was put into sulphuric acid ; and then the
 dichroism increased by standing.          It is desirable to separate the choles-
 terin and the bile-fats.
    The green fluorescence appeared when only blue or green light fell on
the sulphuric-acid solution of the bile.         On the contrary, it did not appear
when the light was only yellow or red.
    The sulphuric-acid solution of the bile absorbed all the rays of the        spec
 trum except the yellow and the red.
    In the ' Journal fiirPrakt.Chem.' vol. xcii. p. 167, Schonbein has the fol
lowing remarks on the formation of a fluorescing substance in the putrefac
tion of human urine : —
    If urine is left to stand in the air until it becomes covered on the
surface with a thick layer of fungus, the alkaline fluid that filters from
it shows a very strong fluorescence of a greenish colour.             Small quanti
ties  of the stronger organic or inorganic acids take        away this fluorescence,
which,    however, by alkalies can be again reproduced.              This substance
has a    reaction  like esculine,  and, like  this, is the opposite to quinine, the
fluorescence of which is increased by those acids.               The hydrobromic,
^lydriodic, and hydrochloric acids lessen the fluorescence of the solution of
quinine almost to entire removal.            Schonbein also remarked that fresh
urine had a feeble fluorescence, and also that a weak solution of albumen,
by standing long in the air, became fluorescent to a considerable degree.
    This was the state of our knowledge of fluorescence in animals when,
having traced the rate of passage of chloride of lithium and other mineral
substances into and out of the textures by means of the spectrum analysis,
we endeavoured to find some method of determining the rate at which
organic substances passed into and out of the same structures.

    Among all the delicate tests for different organic substances, the fluo
rescence of sulphate of quinine appeared likely to afford good results ; for
the following experiments on the delicacy of this test for sulphate of quinine
show that this method of tracing sulphate of quinine into and out of the
body, though inferior to the spectrum determinations of lithium, was supe
rior in delicacy to the spectrum determinations of many other substances.
   On the Delicacy       of the  Fluorescent Test   of Sulphate of Quinine      when a
                    Ruhmkorf coil was      used as the source of light.
    One grain of sulphate of quinine was dissolved in five ounces of acidified
water, and this was again and again diluted until one grain of quinine-salt
was present in 1,800,000 parts of water.            This, when examined in a quartz
cell by the induction-spark,         showed blue fluorescence distinctly in twenty
grains    of solution.
    Another grain, dissolved in a litre and diluted until one grain of salt was
present in 1,440,000 parts of water, when acidified, also showed the fluo
rescence distinctly in twenty grains of solution.
    The same quantity, dissolved in one litre of water, was diluted to 5 1 2
litres.    This was equal to one part in 7,200,000 parts of water ; as the
 fluorescence     could be seen in twenty grains of this solution,          36o'01M>
                                                                                     of  a
grain    of sulphate of quinine gives the fluorescence.
    In another experiment,        ~jj   of sulphate of quinine, in fifty minims of
water acidified,       showed the fluorescence strongly,       and even     ^j-^ of      a
grain    of sulphate of quinine in fifty minims of water showed the fluores
cence    feebly.     As the fluorescence could be seen in twenty grains of this
solution,

                     of a grain  of sulphate of quinine gives the fluorescence.
    In the last two     sets  of experiments the light of   a bright induction-spark
was   concentrated by a small quartz lens.
    One grain of disulphate of quinine, dissolved in 256 litres of water acidu
lated   with one-eighth of sulphuric acid (1 to 8), shows      fluorescence   feebly in
a  quartz cell containing twelve grains of the solution.           Hence 330-^ grain
 gives the fluorescence feebly.
    If  one grain    of disulphate of quinine is dissolved in a thousand litres, or
 one part of quinine to 15,440,000 of water, the fluorescence is still percep
 tible in one ounce of the solution.
    On the   Existence     of an  extractable Fluorescent   Substance in Animals
                                         and Man.
    Immediately on trying to apply this reaction to test the different tex
tures   of guineapigs, after and before they had taken quinine, we found that
in health no part of any of the tissues of the guineapig was free from blue
fluorescence.       It  became desirable, therefore, to separate     the fluorescence
produced      by  some    fluorescing substance normally present in the tissues
from that      produced after quinine was given.          After very many attempts
to extract these substances separately from the tissues, and many more to
separate them when they were conjointly extracted, all of which proved

78                Messrs. Jones and Dupre on a Substance,                  [Apr. 12,
unsuccessful, we resorted to the plan of determining the amount of natural
fluorescence by comparing it with standard solutions of sulphate of quinine ;
and by the same means we measured the increase that occurred in the
amount of fluorescence from the same organs after quinine had been taken.
    The following plan was adopted for the extraction of the fluorescent sub
stance from the textures, both before and after quinine was taken.
    The part to   be examined was       treated on a water-bath      with very dilute
sulphuric acid, either directly or after previous drying in a water-oven.
This extraction was repeated again and again. The acid extracts were
mixed, filtered after cooling, neutralized with caustic soda, and repeatedly
shaken up with their own bulk of ether.              The residue left after evapora
tion of the ether was taken up by dilute sulphuric acid, filtered, and
tested for the amount of fluorescence after having been made up to a cer
tain bulk, generally twenty-five minims.
    When a large quantity of material, as two or three pounds of liver, was
 employed, the acid extract was a second time neutralized and treated with
 ether  ; the residue from the second        ethereal solution was then taken up
with dilute sulphuric acid and tested.
    In very dilute solutions the    fluorescence    of the animal substance cannot
be distinguished    from that produced by quinine ; if the solution is more
 concentrated, the fluorescence of the animal substance is confined much
 more to the surface, the fluorescence in a solution of quinine passing much
 further into the liquid ; and in still more concentrated solutions, the colour
 of the light given out is of a decidedly greenish hue. The fluorescence
 also of the animal substance begins to appear somewhat nearer to the red
 end of the spectrum than is the case with quinine; but both extend to the
 same distance beyond the violet end.
    From two   to three pounds    of liver, only about fifty minimsof       a solution
 was   obtained showing a fluorescence equal to that produced by two or
 three grains of quinine to the litre of water ; and when slightly acidified,
 the following reactions were obtained with the solution.            It gives a preci
 pitate with solution of iodine, with a solution of iodide of mercury in iodide
 of potassium, and also with phosphomolybdic acid, bichloride of platinum,
 and terchloride of gold : this last precipitate is soluble in alcohol, like that
 produced in solutions of quinine.
    A weak solution of quinine interposed in a quartz cell before the solu
 tion of the natural fluorescing substance, did not stop the fluorescence of
 this latter substance entirely ; but when the solution of animal substance
 was placed before the solution of quinine, no fluorescence whatever could
 be perceived in the quinine.        Ether    is unable to extract the animal sub
 stance from an acid solution     ;   the acid solution may be shaken up several
 times with ether ; but the ethereal solution on evaporation yields a residue
 which, when taken up by dilute sulphuric acid, gives no blue fluorescence
 whatever.
    The fluorescence of this animal        substance  is much less strong in hydro
 chloric acid solutions by the light of    the coil-spark, and it is almost destroyed

by alkalies.    The substance            does not lose  its fluorescence when treated
with   dilute sulphuric acid on          a water-bath, nor even on the addition of a
dilate solution        of   permanganate of potash.            In     an alkaline solution   with
permanganate          of potash it   is immediately destroyed.                Quinine behaves  in
a preciselysimilar way.
  Parts of the brain, kidney, liver, and heart, and the crystalline lens of a
human subject dead for many hours, were boiled with dilute sulphuric acid,
neutralized      with carbonate of       soda, and extracted with ether.       The ethereal
residue,  dissolved in dilute sulphuric acid, was                 examined by the spark of
the Ruhmkorf coil for fluorescence. From every part the extract fluoresced
distinctly but very feebly.    The fluorescence closely resembled that caused
by  a very  weak  solution of quinine.
   The lenses from sheep's, bullocks', pikes', eagles' eyes, gave a distinctly
fluorescent      substance,and the extract from the sheep's liver fluoresced
very strongly.     Cod-liver oil also fluoresced very distinctly. The so-called
pills of cod-liver  oil gave no fluorescence.
   The fluorescent substance could be extracted by treating the finely
divided substance   with alcohol, and the residue of the alcohol solution by
ether, and finally dissolving the ethereal residue in water acidulated with
sulphuric acid.
   It follows from these experiments that there exists in the body of man
and animals, fishes, and birds a substance which can be extracted from any
of the tissues by the same process as quinine when present can be extracted.
This substance has the same reactions with chemical agents as quinine has,
and the      action   of light upon this substance is almost, although not alto
gether,  identical with its action on quinine.
    This substance is visible in the lens of the human eye during life. It                       is,
 from its mode of separation and reactions, an alkaloid bearing       close re         a
 semblance in its properties to quinine.
   For the present we shall call this animal quinoidine.    It the cause of       is
 the blue fluorescence of weak  acid  extracts from any  of the tissues of the
 body of men and animals.    When concentrated, the fluorescent substance
 is   bluish green.

      The solution of egg-albumen, exposed to the air, gradually after some
   days showed a strong green fluorescence, which, like esculine, disappeared
   on the addition of an acid, but was not destroyed by alkalies.        The fluo
   rescence gradually disappeared when the albumen began to putrefy.
                                         Part II.
   On the Increase    of Fluorescence in the Texture* of Animals and Man after
                                Quinine had been taken.
      Having proved that in all the different textures of an animal       a natural
  alkaloid fluorescent substance was present when no quinine had been takeu,
  and as no menus could be found for separating the natural fluorescent
  substance from the quinine when it passed into the textures, it became
  necessary to make our analyses quantitative instead of qualitative.
      For this purpose it was necessary to determine, by means of standard
  solutions of quinine, what was the greatest amount of naturally fluorescent
  substance that usually occurred and could be extracted from the tissues.
  Deducting this from the amount of fluorescence that could be extracted
  after quinine was given, we were enabled to measure the rapidity of pas
  sage of the quinine into or out of the tissues, the animals being destroyed
  at different periods after different quantities of sulphate of quinine       had
  been taken.
      So also by determining the amount of natural fluorescent substance in the
 textures, lenses, and urine of man before quinine was taken, and deducting
 this from the amount obtained after quinine was takeu, we were enabled
 to show that quinine does pass into the textures and lenses, and how
 quickly it appeared in the urine and reached its maximum and began to
 disappear and entirely vanished.
     First. Examinations of different textures of guineapigs when no quinine
 was taken, and comparison of the amount of natural fluorescent substance
 with standard solutions of sulphate of quinine.         The amount of the dif
 ferent parts examined was as nearly as possible always the same : —
     1 . A guineapig that had taken no quinine was killed ; the extract of the
brain and nerves only was measured.           The fluorescence of the nerves was
very     feeble, and  about  equal  to   one-twentieth of a grain of sulphate of
 quinine in a litre of water. The extract of the brain was exceedingly feeble,
and it was less than one-thirtieth of a grain of sulphate of quinine in a litre
of water.
     2.  In another guineapig the    lenses and the nerves were dried, and  boiled
three times with dilute sulphuric acid.          The acid solution was rendered
alkaline by caustic potass, and        it was then shaken up with ether three
times.      The ethereal solution was'evaporated, and the residue dissolved in
dilute sulphuric acid.        The acid solution was made up to twenty-five
minims.        The solutions of the lenses and of the nerves showed some
fluorescence.
    These acid solutions were now again rendered alkaline and were shaken
up with ether, and the ethereal solutiou was evaporated and the residue

 1866.]                    resembling Quinine, in Animals, fyc.                     81
dissolved      in acetic acid,    and the excess  of the acid evaporated in a water-
bath ;     the residue    was dissolved   in  a little water, and the solutions were
divided into        two   parts.    The half   of the solution from the lenses and
nerves,     when tested with a solution        of iodine and a solution of iodide of
mercury, remained           perfectly clear.   The bile, brain, and liver, tested in
the same       way, gave no precipitates with these reagents, although they also
gave slight fluorescence.
     The different parts of this pig were compared with the corresponding
parts of two other pigs, one of which took sixteen grains of sulphate of
quinine      in nine    doses   in four  days,   and the other twenty-six grains in
fourteen      doses  in six days.
     3. Another      guineapig had the different organs treated in exactly the
same      way; the liver, lenses, kidneys, urine, blood, brain, nerves, and
muscle gave a fluorescence which varied from about one-twentieth to one-
tbirty-second part of a grain of quinine in a litre of water.            This pig was
bought      at the same time and place, and fed         in the same way as two other
pigs (18 and 23), that were given six grains of sulphate of quinine in three
doses with twenty minutes' interval.            One pig was killed between five and
hi hours after the quinine, and the other in twenty-four hours.
     4. Another pig was also treated in the same way, for comparison with
three other pigs which took five grains of quinine, and were killed four
 hours, eight hours, and thirty-two hours afterwards. The lenses, humours,
 brain,    blood, nerves, and muscle gave a fluorescence varying from one-
twenty-fifth to one-fiftieth of a grain of quinine in a litre of water.
     j. Another pig had taken no quinine. The brain gave a fluorescence
 equal to     one-thirtieth of a grain of quinine, and the nerves fluoresced equal
 to  one-twentieth     of a grain of quinine.
     6.  Another guineapig had equal quantities of the liver, bile, kidney,
 urine,    brain, lenses, humours,       nerves, blood, and muscle treated in the
 same    way.     The   fluorescence obtained from the liver was from one-thirty-
 second to       one-sixteenth     part of a grain of quinine.       The fluorescence
 of all other parts was less than one-thirty-second part of a grain of quinine.
  The fluorescence of the humours was least of all.
      7. Another guineapig was given no quinine.              Equal quantities of dry
  liver,  blood, bile, kidney, brain, nerves, lenses, muscle, and humours were
  taken.    Of the bile and humours, which         were taken entire, rather less than
  half a grain,    of the other parts half a grain was used ; the liver fluoresced
  equal to   one-sixteenth of a grain of quinine.      The bile, blood, kidney, brain,
  nerves, lens, and muscle showed somewhat less than one-sixty-fourth part of
   a grain to a litre ; the humours of the, eye rather more than
                                                                            one-sixty-
   fourth  part.
      8.  Another pig, bought at the same time and place as 1 7, was given
   no quinine ; and the fluorescence of every part was less than one-sixty-
   fourth of a grain of quinine in a litre of water.         The fluorescence of each
   solution was rendered still less by the addition of common salt.

     Secondly. On the increase of fluorescence that was observed when dif
 ferent quantities of sulphate of quinine were given to animals at different
 periods before they were killed : —
     9.  A  guineapig was given sixteen grains of sulphate of quinine, in nine
 doses, in the course of four days.           It was found dead more than twelve
 hours after the last dose.           Its fluorescence was compared with pig 2,
 which had taken no quinine ; the lenses and the nerves, treated the same
 way, showed much more fluorescence in the pig that had taken quinine
 than in the other which had had no quinine.             The solutions of the lenses
 and the nerves also gave a distinct precipitate, which was least         in the  solu
 tion of the lenses with solutions of iodine and of iodide of mercury ; whilst
 the solutions of the lenses and the nerves of the pig that had taken no
 quinine remained clear.         The bile and the brain fluoresced brightly. The
 solution   of  the  liver, when   diluted even to one hundred minims, fluoresced
 distinctly in daylight, and very strongly in the light of the spark.              The
 brain-solution     gave a distinct precipitate with iodine and iodide   of mercury.
 The bile    gave a very faint    turbidity.    The liver gave an abundant preci
 pitate, and moreover gave Herapath's test for quinine very distinctly.
    10. Another pig took twenty-six grains of quinine, in fourteen doses,
 during six days. It was killed nineteen hours after the last dose, being ap
 parently partially paralyzed.          The solutions of the different organs were
prepared in the same way as 9 and 2, and they were examined at the same
time.      The lenses showed the fluorescence very strongly when a cone of
sunlight was thrown into them with a quartz lens. The humours showed no
fluorescence at all in this manner.          The solutions of the bile, brain, urine,
nerves, lenses, spinal marrow, liver, gave more or less distinct fluores
cence.      The solution of the brain gave no precipitate with iodine or
iodide of mercury ; nor did the bile give a precipitate, but the liver gave
a slight precipitate with both reagents.
    Having thus satisfied ourselves that quinine does pass into the vascular
and non-vascular tissues, we proceeded to determine how quickly four, five,
or six grains of sulphate of quinine given to guineapigs could be detected
in the different textures of their bodies.
    1 1 . A guineapig was given four grains of sulphate of quinine, and it was
killed in one quarter of an hour ; all the extracts from the different parts
of the body were mixed with one-eighth of their bulk of dilute sulphuric
acid, and were made up to twenty-five minims. The amount of fluorescence
was compared with the fluorescence obtained in pig 6,            and with standard
solutions of sulphate of quinine with one-eighth           of dilute sulphuric  acid,
containing one grain, three-quarters, half,         one-eighth,  one-sixteenth,  and
one-thirty-second of a grain of sulphate of quinine.            The solutions of the
extracts   of  pigs 9, 22, 25, and 26, which had taken four grains of sulphate
                     1
of quinine and were killed six hours, twenty-four hours, forty-eight hours,
and seventy-two hours after the quinine was taken, were examined at              the
same time.

  1866.]                  resembling Quinine, in Animals,       §c.                83
    The urine and         the blood   gave a fluorescence equal to     half a grain of
 quinine    to a  litre of water ; the extract of the kidney and the liver gave a
fluorescence equal to three-fourths of a grain of quinine ; the extract of the
muscle gave a fluorescence between half a grain and one-fourth of a grain.
The extract of the bile and the brain gave a fluorescence nearly equal to
one-eighth of a grain of quinine to a litre.            The nerves gave rather more
fluorescence      than one-sixteenth of a grain of quinine, and the lenses gave
between one-sixteenth          and one-thirty-second of a grain.
    Comparing these numbers with pig 6, in which the fluorescence of the
liver was greatest, amounting to from one-thirty-second to one-sixteenth of
a grain of quinine to a litre of water, whilst in all other parts, urine, blood,
kidney, muscle, bile, brain, nerves, and lenses, the natural fluorescence
was less than one-thirty-second         of a grain, it is evident that in a quarter of
an   hour sulphate        of quinine  passes  into all the vascular and non-vascular
structures    of the body.
    12. Another guineapig was given four grains of sulphate of quinine, and
it was killed in half an hour ; the nerves and brain were compared with pig
1, which had taken no quinine.           The extract of the liver and kidneys gave
a fluorescence equal         to two-fifths of a grain of sulphate of quinine in a
litre ; the blood, the bile, and the muscle gave a fluorescence equal to one-
fifth ; the    urine gave a fluorescence between one-fifth and one-tenth ; the
brain    between one-tenth and one-twentieth ; the humours of the eye fluo
resced    feebly, but a little more than the lenses, about one-twentieth ; the
lenses    and the nerves less than one-twentieth of a grain of quinine.
    13.   Another guineapig took four grains of sulphate of quinine, and was
killed one     hour afterwards.       The blood, the kidney, and the urine gave a
fluorescence       equal to, or rather more than, one-fifth of a grain of quinine
to a litre ; the liver fluoresced equal to between one-fifth and two-fifths
of a grain of quinine ; the bile and the muscles gave a fluorescence equal
to one-twentieth, of a grain of quinine ; the brain fluoresced between one-
twentieth and one-thirtieth ; the humours fluoresced rather more than the
lenses ; and      the nerves gave the slightest fluorescence.
     14.  Another guineapig was given four grains of sulphate of quinine ; after
 three   hours   it was killed. It had been strongly affected, and the brain was
 much congested.           The liver, kidney, blood, urine, bile, brain, and muscle
 gave very strong       fluorescence,  equal to between one and two grains of qui
 nine in a litre of water ; the nerves gave a fluorescence equal to one-six
 teenth of a grain of quinine ; the humours gave a fluorescence between
 one-sixteenth and one-thirty-second          part of a grain ; the lenses less than
 one-thirty-second part of a grain of quinine to a litre of water.
     15. Another guineapig was given four grains of sulphate of quinine; after
  three hours it was killed. Of every part half of the dry substance was taken,
 except the aqueous humour, bile, and urine, of which the whole was taken ;
  but when dry each of these was less than half a grain.             Ilalf the muscle
  gave a fluorescence equal nearly to one-sixteenth         of a grain of quinine in a
  Vitie ;  half the      brain fluoresced a little    more than one-thirty-second    ;

84                Messrs. Jones and Dupre on a Substance,                [Apr.  12,
half the kidney one-eighth to onc-fourtli of a grain; all the urine one-
eighth ; half the blood fluoresced one-sixty-fourth         to one-thirty-second ;
 half the liver a little more than one-sixteenth ; all the bile a little less
than one-fourth ; half the lenses a little less than one-sixty-fourth ; all
the humours a little more than one-sixteenth ; half the nerves one-sixty-
fourth to one-thirty-second of a grain of quinine to a litre of water.
    1 6. Another guineapig was killed four hours after five grains of sulphate
of quinine, in two doses, with half an hour's interval.        The fluorescence of
the different extracts of the tissues was compared with that of pig 4, that
had tajcen no quinine, and with pigs 21 and 24, that were killed after
taking a dose of five grains eight and thirty-two hours previously.            The
liver, the kidney, the brain, and the muscle gave a fluorescence about        equal
to one   grain of quinine in a litre of water  ; the blood rather less ; the nerves
rather more than the blood        ;  the lenses and the humours      less than  the
blood.
    1 7. Another pig was killed four hours and a half after four grains of
quinine.     The whole of each organ was taken ; the muscle gave a fluores
cence equalling from one-half to one grain of quinine to a litre of water ; the
brain one-sixteenth to one-eighth of a grain ; the kidney fluoresced nearly
equal to one grain ; the urine rather more than one grain ; the blood          one-
eighth to one-fourth ; the liver nearly one ; the bile a little more than      one-
eighth ;   the lenses,  humours,      and nerves  fluoresced less than one-sixty-
fourth of a grain of quinine to a litre of water.
    This pig was compared with one which was given no quinine.
    18.  Another pig was killed five hours and a half after six grains of sul

 was very much affected.        The extract of its tissues was compared with
 pig 3, which had taken no quinine ; the liver, kidney, and muscle fluoresced
 very strongly ; the brain fluoresced strongly ; the blood fluoresced between
 one-fifth and two-fifths of a grain to a litre of water     ; the nerves and the
 lenses fluoresced much less.

 one-eighth to one-quarter;         the blood fluoresced about one-eighth, the

  This pig was with young when killed, and the fluorescence of the foetus

 1866.]                 resembling Quinine, in Animals, i$c.                     87
    From these experiments       it is seen that the fluorescent substance which
exists   naturally in the tissues, at the very highest reaches to (i grains in
 100 litres of water, and usually is between 4 and l£ grains of quinine
dissolved in this quantity of water.
    When quinine has been taken, even in a quarter of an hour the fluo
rescence    may become equal to 75 grains of quinine in 100 litres of water.
It is found to be in greatest quantity in the liver and the kidney, and
somewhat less in the blood, urine, and muscles ; still less in the brain,
nerves,   and bile ; and the increase is slightly perceptible even in the lenses.
In three hours the maximum effect of the quinine may be reached, the
fluorescence being then from 1 00 to 200 grains of quinine in 1 00 litres of
water.     This amount was found in the liver, kidney, urine, bile, blood,
brain, and muscles.        The increase was much less perceptible in the nerves
and   in the aqueous humour, and was least in the lenses.
    In six hours the amount of fluorescence was rather less than in three
hours ; in twenty-four hours it was considerably less than half as much as
in three honrs ;     in forty-eight hours there was but little more fluorescent
substance than naturally exists in the textures, except in the liver and the
blood ; and in seventy-two hours there was no increase except in the liver.
Hence, in gnineapigs, in fifteen minutes the quinine has passed to all the
vascular and      probably to the extravascular textures.        In three hours the
amount of quinine in        the  textures may be at the      maximum,   and for six
hours it remains in excess ; in twenty-four hours the quinine is much
diminished, and in forty-eight hours it is scarcely perceptible anywhere.
    In order, if possible, to obtain very decisive proof that quinine passed
into the non-vascular texture of the lens, we gave two pigs three grains of
 sulphate of quinine, and half an hour afterwards three grains more ; the
 animals were killed five hours after the first dose.         One lens of each pig
 was put into glycerine, to be compared with the lenses of two other pigs
 bought at the      same time and place, to which no quinine was given.           In
 the   electric light there was no apparent difference, either in the colour
 or in the brightness of the fluorescence, between         the pigs that had taken
 quinine    and  those   that had   taken  none.    Examined   by the spark of the
 coil, the fluorescence    of all four lenses was less than one-sixty-fourth of a
 grain of quinine in a litre of water ; and scarcely any difference was per
 ceptible, though the fluorescence of the lenses of the pigs that had taken
 quinine was slightly the strongest.         In all, the fluorescence was rendered
 less strong by the addition of a strong solution of common Ealt to the
  solution.
     Two pigs were both given fifteen grains of sulphate of quinine in five
  doses  of three grains each, with the interval of one hour between each dose.
  They were killed one hour after the last dose, being, however, almost dead
  from the effects    of the quinine.    One lens of each animal was examined in
  the usual   way. The fluorescence in both was equal to one-thirty-second
  of a grain  of quinine in a litre of water, or three grains per 100 litres.

      Professor Donders has carefully investigated the time in which atropine
  and Old Calabar bean begin and cease to act on the iris in man.
     A solution of atropine dropped upon the cornea began to act in fifteen
  minutes, and attained its maximum in from twenty to twenty-five minutes.
  In forty-two hours the pupil was rather smaller; and even after thirteen days
  the pupil had not returned to its natural size.
     The solution of Calabar bean began to act in from five to ten minutes.
  It attained its maximum in from thirty to forty minutes. At the end of
  three hours it began to diminish, and its effect disappeared entirely in from
  two to four days.
     After continued applications of belladonna to the eye of a rabbit, it was
  thoroughly washed by a full current of water. The aqueous humour was
  then evacuated and brought into contact for a long time with the eye of a
  dog (De Graefe injected the aqueous humour into the anterior chamber) ;
  then a notable dilatation of the pupil was observed. As one part in
  1 20,000 of water acts very energetically,        the quantity must be very little
  that produced the dilatation of the pupil.
     When belladonna used internally produces the dilatation, the aqueous
  humour which is taken from the anterior chamber is inactive.
      Thirdly. The fluorescence that naturally occurs in different parts of the
  human body when no quinine had been taken before death was determined,
  in order that the effect of quinine on the fluorescence in the same parts
  might be estimated : —
     The different parts were dried in a water-bath, and equal quantities of
  the dried substance were taken, amounting to 0-6 grain, that being the
  weight of the dry lens. The same method of extraction was followed.
  The solution     was in all cases made up to twenty-five grains.

   Hence in fifteen minutes quinine is detectable in the urine, and in three
hours the maximum quantity is present in the urine.                    In eight hours it
begins   to  decrease   ; in forty-eight  hours    it  is    much     decreased    ; and in
seventy-two hours it has entirely disappeared.
                                   Conclusions.
                                        Part I.
   From every texture of man and of              some   animals a fluorescent              sub
stance can be extracted, which is identical         with the fluorescent. substance
that for some years has been known           to   exist in the lenses of man and
animals.
   This fluorescent substance, when extracted, has a very close optical and
chemical resemblance to quinine, and when mixed with quinine it cannot
be separated from it ; we have therefore called it " animal quinoidine."
                                       Part II.
   By quantitative determinations of the amount of fluorescent substances
naturally existing in the textures, we were able to determine the rate and
time of increase of fluorescent substance in the vascular and non-vas

cular textures      of animals, and in the urine of man after quinine had been
taken.        By this means we have shown that in guineapigs, in fifteen mi
nutes, the quinine has certainly passed into all the vascular, and most pro
bably    into the extra-vascular textures. In three hours the amount of qui
nine in the textures may be at the maximum ; and for six hours it does
not much diminish.           In twenty-four hours the quinine sinks very consider
ably, and in forty-eight hours it is scarcely perceptible anywhere.
     By similar experiments on cataracts in man, it appears that in two hours
and a quarter traces of quinine may be found in the lens.
     After quinine has been taken, it begins to appear in the urine in from
ten to twenty minutes ; in from two to three hours it has reached its
maximum ; in from three or four, or at longest eight hours, it begins to
decrease ;      in twenty-four hours it has very much decreased ; in forty-
eight    honrs its presence is still detectable ; but in seventy-two hours not a
trace    of it can be found.

 intérêt à la découverte nouvelle d'un mammouth avec sa peau et ses poils

 cette communication.
      Déjà en 1864 ce mammouth a été trouvé par un Samoïùde dans les
  environs de la baie du Tas, bras oriental du grand golfe de l'Obi.            Ce n'est

  l'extérieur de l'animal, mais aussi de sa nourriture par la dissection de
   l'estomac.     Ce serait la première fois qu'un naturaliste soit venu à temps
   pour ces recherches, car Adams, comme            on sait, est arrivé trop tard.  Il a

                           honour to submit to the Society some observa
tions which         I
              have made on the Bursa Fabricii — an organ respecting the
function of which so little has yet been determined with any certainty,

of fishes.
   For the sake of order and to save some repetition, before entering into
particulars    may not be amiss to state briefly that this peculiar organ, in
                  it
every instance       met with,
                         it   is   found to lie low in the cavity of the pelvis,

side of    it ;     that     it    is   covered anteriorly            by the reflected peritoneum      ;   is
composed mainly of two                       coats, one an outer muscular, the other an               inner

vular fold,'affording some, but not perfect, security against the entrance into
its cavity of fecal matter whilst passing in the act of expulsion.
     What   remarkable in this organ, giving rise to much of the obscurity
              is
adverted to,    the different aspects which

      I.   Common      Fowl (Gallus domesticus). — I begin with this bird,           as I have
had the best          opportunity of examining it at different ages.
      1.   Of a chicken four days old, the bursa was about the                 size of a small
pea; it communicated with the cloaca, and was empty.
      2. Of another chicken, seventeen                days old, found dead      on the 10th
of March          from cold, the bursa measured '3 by "2 inch ; it was distinctly
plicated internally ; it was empty.
      3. Of a young cock, eleven weeks old, examined on the 16th of June,
the bursa, of a globular form, was l'l iuch in diameter; it communicated
with the cloaca by a narrow neck about '15 inch in width; internally it
 was strongly plicated ; the projecting                laminae were of a crescentic form,
 about twenty in number, and their width, where widest, was about "4 inch.
 It contained         some turbid        fluid, in which were numerous mucus-like cor
 puscles and a        few well-defined spermatozoa. The testes were large ; besides
 sperm-cells,        they contained some spermatozoa.
      4. Of another cock, hatched in July, examined when nineteen weeks
 and six days old, the bursa, 1*2 inch in diameter, weighed 74 grs. ; it
 was similar to the preceding in structure, and was empty.
       5. Of a third male, hatched on the 1 9th of September, examined when
  twenty-one weeks and one day old, weighing six pounds, the bursa was                      I "5
  inch in      diameter     ;  its plicae like the preceding, its opening into the cloaca
  large     ; many spermatozoa were found in the little turbid fluid with which
  they      were moistened.         The testes were large; the left weighed 144 grs.,
   the    right 130 grs.      ;  the vasa deferentia were small.
       6.    Of  a  fourth, hatched on the 18th of October, examined on the 20th
   of  March, when seventeen weeks and seven days old, weight five pounds,
   the bursa,      compared with the preceding, was of diminished size ; its dia
   meter only "6 inch, its plicae few, short and thick, and bloodshot ; its
   opening      into the cloaca large and exposed, without any valvular protection.
   It contaiued a little thick mucus, in which there was commingled an ap
    pearance of spermatozoa.               The testes were largp, and abounded in sperm-
    cells   and spermatozoa ; and the vasa             deferentia were well developed,      and
    contained      a cream-like      fluid rich in delicate spermatozoa*.

    7. In a fifth, a cock of about six years old, weighing four pounds and a
half, no traces of a bursa could be found.            The vasa deferentia were large,
and were distended with a cream-like fluid abounding in spermatozoa.
They terminated well apart in the cloaca, and had neither of them a visible
papilla*. The right testis weighed 93-7 grs., the left 119-7 grs.
    8. Of a young hen, hatched on the 1 7th of May, examined when eleven
weeks old, the bursa was more flask-like than globular ; it measured lv
by 1'5 inch.       Its plicae were large, and their glandular structure so well
developed     that  the orifices of the follicles, as puncta, were seen with the
naked eye.       The bursa was empty, merely moistened with mucous fluid.
    9. Of a hen hatched on the 17th of March, examined when seventeen
weeks and five days old, the bursa was about the same size and form as
that of the preceding; it contained a small quantity of turbid mucous
fluid, in which were seen delicate filaments bearing a resemblance to
spermatozoa.
    10. Of another, hatched in May, and which, like the preceding, had
never laid, examined when nineteen weeks old, the bursa, which was empty,
measured      T7 by   1*5  inch.
    11.  Of   a fourth, hatched on the       1 9th  of September, said to have laid
and known to have been trod, examined when twenty-four weeks old, the
bursa was of shrunken appearance ; it was *5 inch in diameter ; its parietes
thick ("2 inch thick) ; there were no plicae ; it communicated freely
with the    cloaca,  and contained a little mucous fluid in which              were seen
filaments like spermatozoa, but not unmistakeably such.               There was a large
ovum nearly ready to be detached from the ovary.                  A very few tolerably
distinct spermatozoa were found in the oviduct, which was well deve
loped.

and five days old, after having laid about twenty-five eggs, no vestige of
a bursa could be detected f.
    13.  Of another, about eight months old, examined            on the 1 7th of March,
after having laid three or four eggs, the bursa was of a tubular form, -9 inch
          •
long by 1 wide ; its walls were exceedingly thin, and it did not communi
cate with the cloaca.       In the little turbid mucous fluid it contained, a single
spermatozoon was detected.           There was a fully formed esg in the oviduct,
the incrustation of which had begun.                Nearest the infundibulum many
spermatozoa      were  found.
    14. In a laying hen about three years old the bursa was reduced to a
small hard mass, hardly equal to a pea in size.                 It contained a minute
cavity without an opening into the cloaca.
   * After immersion    in water for forty-eight hours, then from distention the papillae
appeared,  each about -24 inch in length.
   f This was a clacking hen, and the day before had been trod.      The ova in the ovary
were small, the largest '2 inch in diameter.    There was no egg in the oviduct ; sperma
tozoa were found in different parts of it.

      15.  In another,       about three years and a half old, no traces of a bursa
could be detected.            Its cloaca and oviduct were very large, as were also
those of the preceding.
     II. Pheasant (Phasianus colchicus). — In ten examined (seven males,
three     females),    with the exception of three (inferred to be old birds), the
organ in question was found.               It resembled in structure that of the com
mon fowl of from four to eight months old.                In each instance it was empty,
merely wet with mucous fluid.              These birds were shot in November, Decem
ber, January, and February.              Not knowing their precise age, but supposing
them to      have been hatched in the spring, their bursa as to size was some
what less      than that of the common fowl.             The smallest, that of a hen shot
in February, measured -3 inch by '2 ; it retained its plicated structure, and
freely    communicated         with the cloaca.
     III. Partridge        (Perdix cinerea).
                                                — Of    this bird three specimens have
been     examined.        In  one, apparently old, no trace could be found     of a bursa.
 In the other two, in which it occurred, it resembled in form and structure
 that of the common fowl; it measured -4 inch by -3.                   These were young
 birds    which had taken wing.
     IV. Turkey (Meleagris gallopavo). — In three instances of this bird, all
 hatched      in spring, one examined in October, one in December, one in
 January, the bursa was found similar to that of the common fowl, and in
  each nearly      of the same size, about 1*5 inch by "7.
      V. Grouse (Tetrao scoticus). — In a young bird, not fully fledged, just
  capable of a short flight, shot in the island of Lewis on the 12th of August,
  expressly     for the purpose of examination, the bursa was fouud small, about
  the size of a pea.        Air was found in its humeri, but only partially in its
  femora.       In two, both from Scotland, later in the season, no bursa could
  be detected.       Their femora contained air as well as their humeri.
      VI. Pigeon (Columba domestica). — Iu two full-grown males examined
  in September, no trace was found of a bursa ; in other two (these younger
  birds) the bursa was pretty large.
      VII. Buzzard (Falco buteo). — Of             a young    one taken from its nest on
   the 9th   of June, when about         a fortnight old, the bursa was globular and
   comparatively      large, about    "8 inch in diameter, non-plicated, and empty.
   This nestling weighed 5193 grs. ;           it was covered, except at the umbilicus,
   where    bare,   with plush-like yellow feathers, thick, very closely set, equal
   in weight     to 647 grs.
      VIII.    Sparrow-hawk        (Falco nisus).
                                                    —  Of a young bird, examined on
   the 31st of July, just capable of flight, weighing 3686 grs., its sternum
   still cartilaginous, its humeri only partially filled with air, the bursa was
    small.    In another, a male, apparently an old bird, shot on the 8th of
    March, no traces of bursa were found.             It weighed 2836 grs.
       IX. Tawny Owl (Strix stridula).          —  Of a young one taken from its nest
    on the 2 1 st of June, when well fledged, bnt its quill-feathers not fully formed,
    'eight 4496 grs., the bursa was globular and comparatively large,               7 inch

in diameter. It contained a good deal of turbid urinary fluid abounding in
lithate of ammonia.           It had no air in any of its bones.
    In an old bird, the parent of the preceding, no bursa was found.
    X. Cuckoo (Cuculus canorus). — Of              a young      one shot on the 25th       of
August, weight 1310 grs. (judging from its plumage, a bird of this season),
the bursa was very small.            In another, a male*, an older bird, shot on the
6th of June, weight 1 768 grs., no traces could be found of a bursa.
    XI.    Common      Goose.   — Of   one  hatched in the spring, examined when
about six months old, the bursa, of an ovoid form, measured 1-2 by -7 inch.
It was plicated, like that of the common fowl. Of two others, one four
months old, one of about eight months, the bursa was about the same size
as the preceding.
    XII.     Common Duck.        — Of  one, a male hatched in       March, the bursa    was
of cylindrical form, 1-6 inch long by -4 inch wide. Its lining membrane
     a
was without plicce ; the apertures of the mucous follicles were conspicuous,
and arranged in parallel lines.              It contained     some    dark faecal    matter
similar to that in the intestine.
    Of another     male, about three months old, the bursa was             of a  flask-like
form, 2-6 inches in length, -6 inch in width where widest ; in structure
like the preceding.           It contained a turbid greyish fluid, in which were
suspended granules and small globules.               It was coagulated by nitric acid.
    Of   a female,    about a month older, of the same brood, the bursa resem
bled the last.
    Of another       female, a little more than a year old, the bursa was very
small    ; its cavity was not quite obliterated, nor was its opening into the
cloaca closed.
    Of a male about two years old, no traces remained of a bursa.
    XIII.     Water-hen      (Gallinula chloropus). — Of      a male shot   in November,
the bursa, of a flask-like form, was -6 inch by '4            j  its cavity was small and
without plicae.
    XIV.      Common Coot       (Fulica atra).
                                               — In   a male shot on the 8th      of March
no bursa was found.
    XV.     Common      Gull (Larus canus). — The same remark applies to one
examined in January.
    XVI. Woodcock (Scolopax rusticola). — In two examined, one in De
cember, the other in February, no traces of a bursa were found.
    XVII. Rook (Corvus frugilegus). — Of this bird thirteen specimens have
been examined.           In eight no traces of a bursa were detected ; from their
appearance and the quality of their bones, it was inferred that they were a
year or more old.           In the remaining five a bursa was met with ; three
were examined in May, two in August ; all had the marks of young birds.
Of   one, which weighed 6132 grs., caught when not quite capable                  of flight,
   *   One testis weighed -7 gr., and measured -24 inch by 26 ; the other 1 gr., and mea
sured '28 by -20 inch ; they were of a rich yellow colour, and contained sperm-cells and
spermatozoa,    the latter of uniform thickness,'about -002 inch in length, nowise spiral.

 the bursa was       nearly globular   and about -7 by -6 inch      ;  it was  distended,
as was    also the cloaca, with a turbid       fluid abounding in lithate of ammonia.
Its inner surface was not plicated, but slightly pitted.              Of the others, the
bursa differed little from the last ; it was somewhat smaller.               In the bursa
of one of these some flakes were found, consisting chiefly of lithate of
ammonia.
    XVIII. Carrion-crow (C.           corone).
                                                — Of a young male shot on the 21st
of June the bursa was globular, very like that of the rook, about '7 inch
in diameter ; it contained some flakes of lithate of ammonia.
    Of another, shot on the 30th of June, weight 6163 grs., the bursa was
somewhat different in form ; it was broadest at its base ; it measured -9
by -8 inch.
     Of one killed on the 16th of           July, weight 5653 grs., the bursa         was
smaller ;     it contained some flakes of lithate of ammonia.
     Of a fourth, killed in February, which, judging from the smallness of the
oviduct, was not an old bird, the bursa, had it not been for its opening
 into the cloaca, might have escaped observation, not on account of its
 smallness, for it was little less than that of the preceding, but from the ex
 treme thinness of its coats and adherence to the adjoining tissues.
     XIX. Jackdaw (C. monedula). —Three specimens                 have    been examined.
 Two of these were         old ;  in neither of them was there a bursa : one was
 young ; it was shot on the 1 1th of July, and was fully fledged ; its bursa was
 pretty large, similar to that of the rook, and empty.
     XX. Jay (C. glaudarius). — Of one, judging from the state of its bones,
 hatched    in spring, the bursa was comparatively large, heart-shaped, mea
 suring -6 by -4 inch.           Its cavity was small ; its inner surface smooth,
  without plicse.
     XXI. Blackbird (Turdus merula). — Six different specimens have been
  examined.        In  an old bird shot in March, a male, no trace of a bursa was
  found.
     In an   unfledged nestling, weighing 112 grs., found dead, the bursa was
  so thin as to be translucent ; it was proportionally large, and contained some
  flakes of lithate of ammonia.
     In the others, which were examined between the middle of June arid
  the beginning       of October, none of them, it      was   inferred, more than five
  months     old, the bursa, nearly globular,       was from about "4 to "5 inch in
  diameter ;     its lining membrane was smooth         ;  its parietes proportionally
  thick.     In each instance it was empty.
      XXII. Song-thrush (T. musicus). — In an old male examined on                    the
   23th  of June no bursa was found.
      Of two young ones obtained on the 1 5th of the same month, the bursa
   was about the size of a
                                 large pea ; one was empty, the other contained
   x>me  lithate    of ammonia.
      XXIII.       Water-ousel   (T.  cinclus).
                                                 — In one, a male, probably a young
   °ae, a email     bursa was found.       It was shot on the 11th of November.

 In another,     an older bird    (judging from its appearance), shot at the same
 time, there was no       trace of a bursa* ; and the same remark applies to a
 third examined in January.
     XXIV.     Common      Starling (Sturuus vulgaris). — Of a young one shot ou
 the 29th of June, the bursa was about the size of that of the young thrush. In
 two old birds shot on the 7th of March, not a trace of the organ was found.
     XXV. Skylark (Alauda arvensis). — In two examined in January there
was the like deficiency.
     XXVI. Chiffchaff (Trochilus minor).— Of                 one,   a young     bird, exa
mined on the 14th of July, the bursa, of moderate size, contained a little
faecal matter.        In another, an older bird, shot in March no bursa could
be found.
     XXVII.     Robin (Sylvia rubecula). — Of a young one found dead on the
 1 6th of June, still warm, weight 25.5 grs., the bursa was of moderate size.
    Of another, nearly fully fledged, found dead on the 25th of June, weight
285 grs., the bursa was comparatively large, exceeding a little in size that
of the preceding.
     XXVIII. Yellow Ammer (Emberiza citrinella). — In one, a male, its testes
abounding in spermatozoa, examined on the 16th of June, there was no
trace of a bursa.
    XXIX.      Blue   Tit (Parus cseruleus). — Of two young            ones examined on
the 8th of June, when just able to fly, one weighing 1 77'5 grs., the other
 162 grs., the bursa was comparatively large ; in each it was empty.
    XXX. Cole Tit (P. ater) . — In one examined in February no trace of the
organ could be found.
    XXXI. Martin          (Hirundo urbica). — Of three young ones taken from
the nest on the 10th of July, the bursa was comparatively large; in each
it was empty. One nestling weighed 414 grs., another 398 grs., the third
423-5 grs. The parent birds were both found of less weight ; that of the
male was 263 grs., of the female 287'4 grs.               In the latter a distinct bursa
was found, little less than that of the young birds.               Search was made for
spermatozoa, but none were found in it. Of the male, the pelvis was so in
jured by shot that it was useless for examination.                 In a male shot on the
 1st of August, the testes of which contained spermatozoa, no trace of a
bursa was found.
     From the preceding          results   may not the        following    conclusions     be
drawn     ? —
     1st. That in some birds, as in the common fowl, and
                                                                       probably in all the
 gallinaceous family, and that of the Anatidie, the bursa increases in size
 and in completeness of organization up to a certain
                                                                   age, beyond which it
 gradually diminishes equally in both sexes, and eventually disappears.
     2nd. That in other birds, those of
                                                  rapid growth, which take wing as
    »  It was shot near the river Brathy, in which charr were then
                                                                      spawning.   In its gta-
 zard and oesophagus nine ova of this fish were
                                                   found ; they were transparent when ex
 tracted, hut immersed in water they toon
                                             became opaque.

  soon    aa  they are capable        of flight, the bursa is comparatively large whilst
 they are      nestlings, does not increase conspicuously, if at all, with their
growth,       but rather diminishes, and after a certain age disappears, and pro
bably     sooner than in the first mentioned.              The buzzard and owl are ex
amples, and        probably all birds of the same family, all of the Corvinse, all
of the thrash kind, and all the smaller birds, with the exception perhaps of
the female       martin.
     Of the uses       of the organ, I venture to conjecture, founding my conjec
tures on      what   I have observed, that they may be provisional and various                 j
that in some        birds, whilst nestlings, it may act the part of a urinary blad
der, as     witnessed     in the instance of the young owl, and in some of the young
rooks, crows,       and thrushes, thereby tending to prevent the fouling of the
nests ;    that in others it may serve as a seminal reservoir at an early period,
and     in both male and female in the instances mentioned, in which it haa
been     found most        completely formed before the attainment of full size —
in the male         before the vasa deferentia are fully developed, in the female
so   long as the oviduct is still small and unexpanded ; and that generally,
as    the organ is more or less amply supplied with mucous follicles, it may
serve,    by the secretion        it yields,   to lubricate   the cloaca    with which it is
connected, and         to aid in its functions.
     These    conjectures, or inferences, if deserving of being so considered, might
 be supported by what we know of the structure of the
                                                                        part and its position
 in relation to the termination of the ureters, of the
                                                                     spermatic vessels, and
  of the oviduct ;       but  1  think it better to rest them on the facts         observed  —
 the    urinary matter detected          in the organ in some instances, the spermatozoa
 in others*,      and the mucous fluid generally.
      But granting even that the bursa may be useful, and in the female as well
  as in the male, in aid of fecundation, as Fabricius
                                                                  supposed, yet his extreme
  view   that that aid,     in  the stored-up spermatic fluid in the bursa          of the hen
 bird, might       suffice for a year, as stated in the subjoined passagef, for which
  and for    other extracts      I am indebted to the kindness of Professor Sharpey,
  u both
             highly improbable, and is opposed by the fact of the decrease of the
  bursa with the
                        advancing age of the fowl, and the enlargement of the ovi-
      *
        As in no instance   I have yet found unquestionable spermatozoa in the bursa of the
  young hen,    I cannot fairly infer that the bursa in the female is a receptaculum seminis j
  "it M in two instances there were detected in it filaments which were very like these
  bodies, and in one a single pretty distinct spermatozoon,     and further, as the bursa seems
  to diminijh
                rapidly as the oviduct becomes developed and not till then, is it not probable
                                                    assigned, as conjectured above .' It need
   'tat for a short time it may perform the part
  hardly be remarked that the mucous secretion of the bursa adds to the difficulty of de
  monstrating the presence of spermatozoa.

duct and of the vasa deferentia.        Harvey, who was opposed to the notion
of Fabricius, expresses the opinion that an intercourse once or twice repeated
might suffice to impregnate a whole bunch of yelks, he having found that
an egg laid on the 20th day of seclusion of a hen produced a chick*.           This
fact is an interesting one, however explained.           It might be adduced in
favour of the opinion of Fabricius ; but inasmuch as the passage of the
fully-formed egg in the act of expulsion does not necessarily secure the
expulsion of any spermatozoa previously received into the oviduct, it is of
little value in the argument : and here I may mention that I have detected
spermatozoa in the oviduct, even in that portion in which the egg was re
ceiving its calcareous incrustation.
III. " Researches       on Gun-cotton.   — Memoir I. Manufacture and Com
       position of Gun-cotton."           By F. A. Abel, F.R.S., V.P.C.S.
       Received    April 10, 1866.
                                     (Abstract.)
    A review of the researches   on the production, properties, and composition
of gun-cotton hitherto      published, and a brief examination into the pro
bable causes of the discrepancies exhibited        between    the results and   con
clusions of different experimenters, are followed in this paper by a criti
cism of the several steps in the system of manufacture of gun-cotton, as
prescribed by Baron v. Lenk.
    The conclusions arrived    at on this    subject are founded upon carefully
 conducted    laboratory-experiments,     and upon extensive manufacturing
 operations  carried  on during the last three years at the Royal Gunpowder
Works, Waltham Abbey.           In some of these operations v. Lenk's system
of manufacture, as originally communicated to the English Government
by that of Austria, was strictly followed ; in others, various modifications
were introduced in different stages of the manufacture — such as in the
 composition of the acids used, in the proportion borne by the cotton to
 the acids in which it remained immersed, in the duration of the treat
 ment of cotton with the acids, and in the methods of purification to which
 the gun-cotton was submitted.
    Exception is taken to one or two points in the general system of manu
 facture, and directions are indicated in which they may be advantageously
 modified ; but the general conclusion arrived at is that, although Baron
 v. Lenk cannot be said to have initiated any new principle as applied to
 the production of gun-cotton, he has succeeded in so greatly perfecting
 the process of converting cotton into the most explosive form of pyroxyline
 or gun-cotton, and also the methods of purification, as to render a simple
 attention to his clear and definite regulations alone necessary to ensure the

 manufacture      of very uniform products, which         are unquestionably    much
 more   perfect in their nature than those obtained in the earlier days of the
 history of gun-cotton.         Great stress is laid upon the fact that deviations
 from the prescribed process, which at first sight may appear trivial (such
 as a slight modification in the strength of the acids used, the neglect of
proper cooling-arrangements),         are certain to lead to variations in the pro
ducts   of manufacture, affecting their explosive characters, or their perma
nence, or both.        A considerable deviation from the normal composition,
due evidently to some accidental irregularities         in the course of manufac
ture    pursued, has been exhibited occasionally by gun-cotton              obtained
from   the manufactories at Hirtenberg and Stowmarket.
   The composition        of gun-cotton has been made the subject of a very
extensive series     of experiments, both analytical and synthetical.      The ma
terial employed in the analytical researches consisted of ordinary products
of manufacture, prepared at Waltham Abbey, and obtained from Hirten
berg and Stowmarket.           The general analytical results are as follows : —
   Air-dry gun-cotton contains very uniformly about two per cent, of
water, which proportion         it reabsorbs rapidly from the atmosphere after
desiccation.      If exposed to a moist confined atmosphere, it will gradually
absorb as much as six per cent, of water ; but it rarely retains more than
two per cent, upon re-exposure to open air.
   The    mineral constituents of gun-cotton vary according to the quality
of the water employed in its purification.          The average proportion of ash
furnished by gun-cotton prepared at Waltham Abbey, where the water
used   is hard, amounts to one per cent.          It should be observed that the
process   of "  silicating"   the gun-cotton,    which is prescribed by Von Lenk,
but the value       of which is not admitted, has been applied at Waltham
Abbey only     in  special experimental operations.       Its use naturally adds to
the mineral constituents contained in the finished products.
    The proportions of matters soluble in alcohol alone, and in mixtures of
alcohol and ether, were found to be remarkably uniform in products of
manufacture obtained by strictly following Von Lenk's directions.             In the
ordinary products from Waltham Abbey, the matter extractable by alcohol
amounted     to between     075 and      1 per cent., and consisted of a yellowish
nitrogenized substance possessed of acid characters, and evidently produced
from matters foreign to cellulose (which are retained by cotton fibre after
its purification), and the products of oxidation which escape complete
removal when the gun-cotton is submitted to purification in an alkaline
bath.    The  average     proportion of matter extractable by ether and alcohol
after the alcoholic treatment is from 1 to 1*5 per cent.            This consists of
one or more of the lower products obtained by the action of nitric acid
upon cotton-wool,      the existence of which was established by Hadow. The
causes of the invariable production of small proportions of these substances
in the ordinary manufacturing operations, and of their existence in larger
quantities in exceptional instances, have been carefully examined into.

Their absolute removal from specimens of gun-cotton, purified          for analy
tical purposes, was found to be almost impossible.
    The methods employed for determining the proportions of carbon, hy
drogen, and nitrogen in gun-cotton, and the relative proportions of carbonic
acid and nitrogen furnished by its combustion, have been very carefully tested.
Four different methods of determining the carbon were employed, and
forty-nine successful estimations of that element have been accomplished
in a variety of products of manufacture. A number of very concordant hy
drogen-determinations, and eighteen direct estimations of the volumes of
nitrogen furnished by the complete oxidation of gun-cotton, have been
made.       The individual as well as the mean results obtained in these
 analytical   experiments   correspond    mucb   more closely to the require
ments of the formula C„       H,  N3

or Gla Hu07, 3N20„ trinitric cellulose) than to the formula recently as
signed for gun-cotton by Pelouze and Maury, C2, H38 Ou, 5 N2 Os.              The
determinations of the comparative volumes of carbonic acid and nitrogen
have furnished results closely in accordance with those of the direct de
termination of nitrogen.
    Since the specimens of gun-cotton analyzed always retained small quan
tities of the products soluble in ether and alcohol, it was to be expected
that the proportion of nitrogen found would be slightly below, and con
sequently that the carbon-results would be somewhat above, those which
the chemically pure substance should furnish. The variations exhibited
 by the analytical results do not exceed such as are ascribable to the above
 cause.
    A number of experiments were instituted with Hadow's method of de
 termining the composition of gun-cotton, which consists in reducing the
 latter to cotton by means of potassic sulphydride.      The results show that,
 although the method is useful for controlling the results obtained, by de
 termining the increase of weight which cotton sustains by treatment with
 nitric acid, it does not afford sufficiently definite and trustworthy data to
 render it applicable as a method of ascertaining the degree of perfection of
 manufacturing products, i. e. the extent of freedom of a specimen of the
 most explosive gun-cotton from admixture with the soluble varieties.
    The treatment of cotton with nitric and sulphuric acids has been varied
 in many ways in laboratory experiments, with the view to examine fully
 into the increase   in weight sustained by the former, upon its conversion
 into the most explosive gun-cotton, and to determine what circumstances
 may exert an influence upon the amount of increase, — an acid mixture of
 uniform strength being employed throughout the experiments (3 parts
 by weight of sulphuric acid of spec. grav. 1 -84, and 1 part of nitric acid
 of spec. grav. l-52). The results arrived at may be briefly summed up
 as follows : — -

of weight Tarying    between 81*8 and 82-5 upon 100 parts of cotton, if
submitted for 24-48 hours to treatment with a very considerable excess
(about 50 parts to 1 of cotton) of the acid mixture. Similar results may also
be obtained  by repeatedly treating the same sample of cotton for compara
tively brief periods with fresh quantities of acid, provided this treatment
be not too greatly prolonged.      Lower results (somewhat above or below
 78 upon 100 parts of cotton) are obtained if the cotton be submitted to
treatment with a large excess of acid for only brief or for very protracted
periods, or if it be left for about 2-1 hours in contact with a comparatively
limited proportion of acid (10 or 15 to 1 of cotton).        The increase of
weight which 100 parts of pure cellulose should sustain by complete con
version into a substance of the formula G8 H7 N3 Gu, is 83-3 ; if converted
completely into a substance of the composition Gal H36 0le, 5 N2 05, it
should sustain an increase in weight of 77' 78.
     There is strong evidence that the differences between the highest results
furnished    by carefully purified cotton-wool, and the number 83*3, are to
be  principally ascribed to the small proportions of foreign matter still ex
isting in the fibre at the time of its conversion.
   The maximum increase of weight sustained by cotton of ordinary quality,
such as is used in gun-cotton-manufacture,           is,
                                                   as might have been antici
pated,    below the result obtained, under similar         conditions, with cotton           of
finer quality    and more thoroughly purified.     The highest numbers ob
tained    by treatment of such cotton, in small quantities, with considerable
                                                                         a
excess    of acid, were somewhat below 181, from 100 of cotton.       The in
crease                  this quality of cotton sustains

generally about 78 per cent.
  Experiments are quoted which show that the attainment of lower results
with cotton of ordinary quality     ascribable to the existence of higher
                                       is
proportions       of foreign matters in the cotton under treatment.
     Some quantitative     manufacturing    experiments yielded results consider
ably below those obtained with          some  of the same cotton in laboratory
operations (171 and 176 of gun-cotton having been produced from 100                          of
cotton).  The causes of these differences are investigated and explained.

     The fossil remains of the genus Rhinoceros found iu Pleistocene de
 posits in Great Britain indicate four well-defined species.         Of these the
 II. tichorhinus, or the common fossil species, ranged throughout France,
 Germany, and Northern Russia, and, like its congener the Mammoth, was
 defended from the intense winter cold by a thick clothing of hair and
 wool.     Its southern limit in the Europa20-Asiatic continent was a line
 passing through the Pyrenees, the Alps, the northern shore of the Caspian,
  and the Altai Mountains.         It has not yet been proved to have existed in
  Europe anterior to the deposit of the Boulder Clay. The second species,
 'the R. megarhinus of M. de Christol, characterized by its slender limbs
  and the absence of the
                                " cloison," has been determined
                                                                    by the author
  among remains from         the  brick-earths occupying the lower part of the
  Thames valley, and from the Preglacial forest- bed of Cromer. The species
  ranged from the Norfolk shore southwards through Central France into
  Italy. In France and Italy it characterizes the Pliocene deposits, being
  found in the former country in association with Mastodon brevirostris and
  Halitherium Serresii, in the latter with M. Arvernensis.               From its
  southern range we may infer that the megarhinc species was fitted to in
  habit the warm and temperate zones of Europe, just as the tichorhine was
  peculiarly fitted for the endurance of an Arctic winter.
     The third species is the R. etruscus of Dr. Falconer, confined to the
  forest-bed of the Norfolk shore, and, like the R. megarhinus, found in the
  Pliocenes of France and Italy ; it ranged across the Pyrenees as far as Ma
  laga, and is the only species known to occur in Spain.
     The fourth, the R. leptorhinus of Professor Owen, is the equivalent         of

 1866.]      Mr. Wilde — Researches in Magnetism             and Electricity.       107
the   R. hemitaechus      of Dr. Falconer.     It  is defined as  " R.  a narines demi-
cloisonnees," and is probably not the same animal as the R. leptorhinua
or " R. A narinea non-cloisonnees
                                           " of Baron Cuvier, the evidence as to
the absence or presence of the cloison in the type of the species being of
the most conflicting nature.           In Central France it is identical with R. me-
sotropus and      R.  r el annus   of M. Aymard, the R. Aymardi of M. Pomel,
and the R. leptorhinus (du Puy) of M. Gervaise.                Its dentition is charac
terized by the presence of the third costa in the upper molar series,
coupled with the stoutness of the cingulum, the suppression of the ante
rior combing plate, the smoothness of the enamel, and the extent to which
 the upper molars overhang the lower, which causes the enamel on the
outer side of the latter to be worn obliquely.              The lower molars can be
determined by the flattening of the anterior area, coupled with the fine
 sculpturing of the enamel-surface.               In common with the other fossil
 British Rhinoceroses, it possessed a molar series of six only on either side,
 and was bicorn.         It ranged through England, from the Hysena-den of
 Kirkdale     in Yorkshire in the north,      as far south as the plains      of Somer
 setshire, and    as far to the West as Pembrokeshire.             It is very generally
 found in     association     with   Elephas antiquus and Hippopotamus major,
 both species which lived in Pliocene times.               The association in Wookey
  Hole Hyaena-den with Elephas primigenius and R. tichorhinus and other
  characteristic Postglacial mammals proves that it coexisted with the"
  tichorhine species, to which it probably bore the same geographical rela
  tion as the Elk does to the Reindeer in the high northern latitudes.              The
  sum of the evidence proves that it was coeval with the Mammoth and
  tichorhine Rhinoceros,        and does not characterize deposits of an earlier
  epoch   in the  Pleistocene.      It has not as yet been found in Preglacial for
  mations.     The R. leptorhinus is more closely allied to the bicorn Rhino
  ceros  of Sumatra than to any other living species.

      This paper is divided into two sections, — the first being on some new
   and paradoxical phenomena in electro-magnetic induction, and its relation to
   the principle of the conservation of physical force ; the second on a new and
   powerful generator      of dynamic electricity.
      The author defines the principle of the conservation of force to be the
   definite quantitative relation existing between all phenomena whatsoever ;
   and  in-the particular application of the principle          to the advancement of
   physical science and the mechanical arts, certain problems are pointed out
   which, in their solution,      bring out results as surprising as they arc para
   doxical.    Although, when rightly interpreted, the results obtained are in

 108     Mr. Wilde — Researches in Magnetism and Electricity      .  [Apr. 26,
strict accordance with the principle of conservation, yet they are, at the
 same time, contrary to the inferences which are generally drawn from
 analogical reasonings, and to some of those maxims which philosophers
propound for the consideration of others.
    The author directs attention to some new and paradoxical        phenomena
 arising out of Faraday's important discovery of magneto-electric induction,
 the close consideration of which has resulted in the discovery of a means of
 producing dynamic electricity in quantities unattainable by any apparatus
 hitherto constructed.     He has found that an indefinitely small amount of
 magnetism, or of dynamic electricity, is capable of inducing an indefinitely
large amount of magnetism, — and again, that an indefinitely small amount
 of dynamic electricity, or of magnetism, is capable of evolving an in
 definitely large amount of dynamic electricity.
    The apparatus with which the experiments were made consisted of a
 compound hollow cylinder of brass and iron, termed by the author a
 magnet-cylinder, the internal diameter of which was        If inch. On this
 cylinder could be placed, at pleasure, one or more permanent horseshoe
 magnets.     Each of these permanent magnets weighed about 1 lb., and
 would sustain a weight of about 10 lbs.    An armature was made to revolve
 rapidly in the interior of the cylinder, in close proximity to its sides, but
 without touching.      Around this armature 163 feet of insulated copper
 wire was coiled, 0-03 of an inch in diameter, and the free ends of the wire
 were connected with a commutator fixed upon the armature-axis, for the
 purpose of taking the alternating waves of electricity from the machine in
 one direction only.    The direct current of electricity was then transmitted
 through the coils of a tangent galvanometer ; and as each additional magnet
 was placed upon the magnet-cylinder, it was found that the quantity of
electricity generated in the coils of the armature was very nearly in direct
proportion to the number of magnets on the cylinder.
    Experiments were then made for the purpose of ascertaining what rela
tion existed between the sustnining-power of the permanent magnets on the
magnet-cylinder, and that of an electro-magnet excited by the electricity
derived from the armature.
    When four permanent magnets capable of sustaining collectively a
weight of 40 lbs. were placed upon the cylinder, and when the submagnet
was placed in metallic contact with the poles of the electro-magnet, a
weight of 1 78 lbs. was required to separate them. With a larger electro
magnet a weight of not less than 1080 lbs. was required to overcome the
attractive force of the electro-magnet, or twenty-seven times the weight
which the four permanent magnets used in exciting it were collectively
able to sustain.    It was  further found that this great difference between
the power of    a permanent magnet and that      of an electro-magnet excited
through its agency might be indefinitely increased.
    Experiments were then made with electro- magnets of various sizes, for
the purpose of ascertaining the cause of these paradoxical results.

   When the wires forming                          the polar terminals        of the magneto-electric
machine were connected for a short time with those                             of a very large electro
magnet,    bright spark could be obtained from the electro-helices twenty-
               a
five seconds  after all connexion with the magneto-electric machine had
been broken.     Hence it is inferred that an electro-magnet possesses the
power  of accumulating and retaining a charge of electricity in a manner
analogous to, but not identical with, that in which it is retained in in
sulated submarine cables, and in the Leyden jar.    It was also found that
the electro-helices offered a temporary resistance to the passage of the
current from the magneto-electric machine.       When four magnets were
placedon the cylinder, the current from the machine did not attain a per
manent degree of intensity until an interval of fifteen seconds had elapsed ;
but when             powerful machine was used for exciting the electro-
                    a more
helices, the current attained a permanent  degree of intensity after an
interval of four seconds had elapsed.
  The general conclusion                         which is drawn by the author from a considera
tion    of these experiments                 is,  that when an electro-magnet   excited through
                                                                                      is

                                                 (but more particularly iron)
possess of accumulating and retaining      temporary charge of electricity, or

of  magnetism,   or of both  together (according to the mode in which these
forces are          viewed by physicists), giving rise to the paradoxical phenomena
which form            the subject of this part of the investigation.
  Having established the fact that    large amount of magnetism can be
                                                            a
developed in an electro-magnet by means of    permanent magnet of mucha
smaller power,   appeared reasonable to the author to suppose that large
                          it                                                                       a
electro-magnet    excited by means of     small magneto-electric machine
                                                                 a
could,       by
           suitable arrangements, be made instrumental in evolving a pro
portionately large amount of dynamic electricity.
     Two magnet-cylinders                   were therefore made, having     bore of
                                                                                  a          2-^   inches,
and    a   length of          1
                                  2\   inches or five times the diameter of the bore.
     As frequent mention                    is   made    of the different-sized machines employed
in     these       investigations, they are             distinguished by the calibre, or bore of the
 magnet-cylinders.
       Each cylinder was                fitted with an armature, round which was coiled an
 insulated strand  of copper wire 67 feet      length, and 0* 15 of an inch in
                                                                 in
 diameter.    Upon one of the magnet-cylinders sixteen permanent magnets
 were fixed.and to the sides of the other magnet-cylinder was bolted an electro
 magnet formed of two rectangular pieces of boiler-plate enveloped with
 coils of insulated copper wire.      The armatures of the 2£-inch magneto-
  electric         and    electro-magnetic machines were driven simultaneously at an

 110     Mr. Wilde — Researches in Magnetism and Electricity.         [Apr. 26,
 equal velocity of 2500 revolutions per minute.   When the electricity from
 the magneto-electric machine was transmitted through a piece of No. 20
 iron wire 0'04 of an inch in diameter, a length of 3 inches of this wire was
 made red-hot.   When the direct current from the magneto-electric machine
 was transmitted through the coils of the electro-magnet of the electro
 magnetic machine, the electricity from the latter melted 8 inches of the
 same-sized iron wire as was used in the preceding experiment, and a length
 of 24 inches was made red-hot.
    When the electro-magnet of a 5-inch machine was excited by the 2i-inch
 magneto-electric machine, the electricity from the 5-inch electro-magnetic
 machine melted 15 inches of No. 15 iron wire 0-075 of an inch in diameter.
   The author having found that        an   increase in the dimensions   of the
 machines was accompanied by a       proportionate and satisfactory increase of
 the magnetic and electric forces, a 10-inchelectro-magnetic machine was
constructed : the weight of its electro-magnet is nearly 3 tons, and the
total weight of the machine is about 4^ tons.    The machine is furnished
with two armatures — one for the production of "intensity"-, and the other
for the production of " quantity"-effects.
   The intensity armature is coiled with an insulated conductor consisting
of a bundle of thirteen No. 1 1 copper wires, each 0' 1 25 of an inch in dia
meter.    The coil is 376   feet in length, and weighs 232 lbs.
   The quantity armature   is enveloped with the folds of an insulated copper
plate conductor  67 feet in  length, the weight of which is 344 lbs.    These
armatures are driven at a uniform velocity of 1 500 revolutions per minute,
by means of a broad leather belt of the strongest description.
   When the direct current from the ljj-inch   magneto-electric machine,
having   on itscylinder  six permanent magnets, was transmitted through
the coils of the electro-magnet of the 5-inch electro-magnetic machine,
and when the direct current from the latter was simultaneously, and in like
manner, transmitted through the coils of the electro-magnet of the 1 0-inch
machine, an amount of magnetic force was developed in the large electro
magnet far exceeding anything which has hitherto been produced, accom
panied by the evolution of an amount of dynamic electricity from the
quantity armature so enormous as to melt pieces of cylindrical iron rod
15 inches in length, and fully one-quarter of an inch in diameter. With
the same arrangement, the electricity from the quantity armature also
melted    15 inches of No. 11 copper wire 0'125 of an inch in diameter.
   When the intensity armature was placed in the magnet cylinder, the
electricity from it melted 7 feet of No. 1 6 iron wire 0-065 of an inch in
diameter, and made a length of 21 feet of the same wire red-hot.
   The illuminating power of the electricity from the intensity armature     is,
as might be expected, of the most splendid description.      When au electric
lamp, furnished with rods of gas- carbon half an inch square, was placed at
the top of a   lofty building, the light evolved from  itwas sufficient to cast
the shadows from the flames of the street-lamps    a  quarter of mile distant
                                                                  a

 upon the    neighbouring walls. When viewed from that distance, the rays
 proceeding from the reflector have all the rich effulgence of sunshine.
    A piece of the ordinary sensitized paper, such as is used for photographic
 printing, when exposed to the action of the light for twenty seconds, at a
 distance of 2 feet from the reflector, was darkened to the same degree as
was a piece of the same sheet of paper when exposed for a period of one
minute to the direct rays of the sun, at noon, on a very clear day in the
month of March.
    The extraordinary     calorific and illuminating powers of the 10-inch
machine are all the more remarkable from the fact that they have their
origin in six small permanent magnets, weighing only 1 lb. each, and only
capable, at most, of sustaining collectively a weight of 60 lbs. ; while the
electricity from the magneto-electric machine employed in exciting the
electro-magnet    was of itself incapable of heating to redness the shortest
length   of iron wire of the smallest size manufactured.
    The production of so large an amount of electricity was only obtained
(as   might have been anticipated by the physicist) by a correspondingly
large amount of mechanical force ; for it was found that the large elect ro-
magnet could be excited to such a degree that the strong leather belt was
scarcely able to drive the machine.
    When the electro-magnet of the 10-inch machine was excited by means
of the 2^-inch magneto-electric machine alone, about two-thirds of the
 maximum amount of power from the 10-inch machine was obtained.
    From a consideration of the combined action of the magneto-electric
 and  electro-magnetic machines, the author points out a remarkable analogy,
 subsisting   between the operation of the static forces of magnetism and
 of cohesion in modifying dynamical phenomena, which throws additional
 light upon the nature of the magnetic force.
     On reviewing and comparing the whole of the analogous phenomena
 manifested in the operation of the magnetic and cohesive forces under the
 varied conditions to which the author invites attention, it appears to him
 that magnetism is a mode       of the force of cohesion, or is, if the term be
 allowed, polar cohesion acting at sensible distances, the equivalent of
 magnetic force being obtained at the expense of an equivalent of ordinary
  cohesive force (in an axial direction) so long as the iron continues to be
  magnetized.

porarily accorded to me by the Bombay Government, by my appointment
to the superintendence of this Observatory. The confirmation of my pre
sent appointment will probably depend upon the sanction of the scheme
of improvements for the Observatory which               I
                                                  have just sent in for the
consideration  of  Government.    Meanwhile  I  have arranged the working
power of the establishment so as to take up the reduction of the old obser
vations, and I am sure you will be interested to learn that there is a pro
bability of their turning out trustworthy and valuable. The separation of
seven years of declination-disturbances has already been effected, with the
results shown in the enclosed Tables and Curves                ;   but as the whole    series
of observations (from 1845 to 1865) will include two complete cycles of
the decennial period, and as the reductions have already been so long
delayed,     I
            propose completing the twenty-one years before discussing the
connected questions and publishing the whole ; it      however,      is,
                                                                    little         a
doubtful  whether the opportunity of doing this will be afforded me, as
the Indian Government, in sanctioning my appointment, have limited its
duration to the end of next month   and though
                                       ;         am hopeful that, partly

the wide scope for usefulness that         is   open   to me here,         and of what   has
been effected and has been engaged    upon        my arrival six months

ago, they may be induced to extend their approval of the appointment
until the improvements suggested in my Report shall have been consi
dered, yet   seems right, as there are some interesting points about the
                 it
results already arrived at, that should inform you of them whilst may,

Government, you will,     Ibelieve, consider them good grounds upon which
to recommend the continuance       of the reductions of the twenty-one con
secutive  years of the Bombay observations.
   Referring to page 283 of your paper in the Philosophical Transactions,
 1863,   will be seen that these results supply the required knowledge of the
        it
laws of the disturbances at station intermediate in longitude between Kew
                               a
and Nertschinsk.    The general characteristics of the westerly disturbance-
diurnal-variation curve are the same as you describe for Pekin and Nerts
chinsk.    The curve     remarkably regular, and the ordinates between
                          is
8  p.m. and     a.m. have scarcely appreciable values, being in the latter
                  4
respect like the westerly curve for Hobarton, and the easterly for Ken
and St. Helena.     The maximum occurs at          a.m., which corresponds

corresponding hours of maximum at the other two eastern stations (Pekin
and Nertschinsk),     rather slow propagation of the disturbing action from
                      a
north to south of the eastern part of the northern hemisphere.     The other
curve (of easterly disturbance) presents    less systematic appearance

the ratios are at no part of the day smaller than 0-64, or greater than

    The Table    of   aggregate     values of disturbance         in the several years points
very distinctly      to a minimum         as occurring early in 1864, thus adding
another to the determinations of this turning-point in three former cycles

were made for him (in 1863-64), at the request of Admiral Irminger of
the Royal Danish Navy, by Missionary Asboe, at Frederiksdal, near Cape

when placed in          a square, according           to an arrangement           to be explained
below.
   Itappears to me probable that these properties arc connected with (if,
indeed, they be not actually some form of) the mysterious properties of
numbers, to which Fermat alludes in the announcement of his theorem (as
furnishing the proof of    for in point of fact these properties give
                                  it)

method by which every odd number can be divided into four square num
bers, and every number (odd or even) can be divided into not exceeding
three triangular numbers.
 I   am not prepared to say whether or not the method affords   demon                       a
stration, and proves that  can always be done

the cause of its  success may be distinctly shown.    The properties    allude          I
to are scarcely less interesting and curious than the theorem itself, and pre
sent results for which        can find no name more appropriate than the

numbers in the square, which relations are not founded on any arithmetical
connexion between them, but on the positions they respectively occupy in

in the diagonal from 1 6 1 may be the first term of a similar series.
   The diagonal from 163 will give all the other first terms of the third set
of series.
   In order to explain the indices which appear in the diagram No.                1, and
to show in what manner the series are connected with, and pass into each
other, it is necessary to point out the properties of the two series which
compose     the square, and of the third series, which is a necessary result.
   All of them     have this property in common, — that if you can discover the
roots of the squares which compose any term of the series with reference
to the nature of the series, and the order in the series of that term, then
you know the roots of every term in the series, both before and after that
term.     The first  series increases     by 4, 8, 12, &c.     The indices of the  terms
of  a series so increasing    I  have made 1, 3, 5, 7,        &c, and they  are put at
the top as being common to all the series that arc horizontal.
   For this reason, if two numbers differ by 1, as n, n+1, and the larger
be increased by 1, and the smaller be diminished by 1, and the process be
continued, the result will be

     Having explained the construction         of the square and the indices which
belong to the       series of which it is composed, I propose to point out the
properties        which  discover the roots of the squares into which the odd
numbers (which are found in the different parts of the square) may be
divided.
    If the    first odd number in the square be of the form (4p + 2) . n+ 1 (or
2»+l,        6 n+1, 10 n+1, 14 n+1, &c), n being of any value whatever,
       (n— 2>)th term will be          —                                        the roots

                                         0»+i)»— p>      ».          these  are
(the    number itself would be 2       n2 + 2 p* + 2 p + 1) ; and as the index of the
nth     term     is n+(n— 1),     or  2n-   1, the index of the (n— j>)th will be
2 s— (2p+l), and the algebraic sum of the roots may be made equal to
the index; it is therefore a term in a diagonal series [that the (n—p)lh
term is 2      n' + 2p' + 2p+l, will appear by finding in the usual way the
(a— p)th term of a series whose first term is (4 p + 2). n+ 1, and the
terms of which increase by 4, 8, 12,                16, &c. . . . 4 n] ; but as two
of the roots are equal, n, n, it is the first term of a vertical series descend
ing, thus:                         p+l,p,n,n
                                  P+l,P, (»— I). »+l
                                  P+l.p, (n-2), n+2
                                  p + hp, (n-3), (n+3).
     I  call this term     (A)* and indicate it by that letter, and from this term
 the    roots of many others may be derived (which are indicated by other
 letters connected with A in an invariable manner), whose squares will
 compose the number            that belongs to that term.          For example, counting
 2p+l squares backwards from A is a term I have distinguished as "VY ;
 the roots of the number belonging to it are
                                P+l,P,    (»—   4p + 2),    n
 These roots         may, of course, be either positive or negative ; arranging
 them thus, — />+ 1, —p, n, — 4p + 2, n, we have the algebraic sum of their
  roots equal to 2      n— 6p + 3, which is the index of the square in which W
  is found     going backwards from A, the index of which is 2 n— 2p + l (as
  already stated) ; immediately adjoining          W    are two squares      which  I have
  called M and N respectively.
      M   is the term next before     W, and   is composed       of the roots
                          n-2p + 2, n-2p + 2, 3p + 2,p+l
   N   is the   term next after W, and consists of the roots
                                 »— 2 p, n—2p,     3p+      1, p
   Each    of   these  will traverse the   square   diagonally,      the algebraic sums of

their roots being equal to the index                         ;    the roots        of W may also           be obtained
from A by taking its roots down                                  vertically,        making n, n            successively
n—    1,   n+l,
             n—2, ii + 2, &c, until the square is reached, in which the
index is 2 n+2 p+l, and 2 n+2 p + 1 being the arithmetical sum of all
the roots of A ; A here becomes a term in a series which moves diagonally,
and on being carried up towards the left will give the roots of W. When
the indices of the squares through which this vertical series passes equal
2 n   +    1, by making      p+    1,   p,
                                        and the other negative, the term
                                                one positive
becomes a term in another series which moves diagonally upwards towards
the left. This must occur both when the index equals 2 n — 1 and when
it equals 2 n+l ; and as the indices increase downwards uniformly by 2,
it follows that 2 n— 1 and 2 n+l will be the indices of contiguous terms
of the vertical series, and therefore two contiguous terms will become
terms of series moving diagonally upwards to the left ; and as these two
series are contiguous to each other, their terms found in the first series

 The first      of these going up gives the roots of N, the second gives those of
 M,    an J   these roots are identical with those obtained from AM and AN.
    The index         of A is      2 n—2p +       1, therefore when     n in moving down
wards      becomes n+1,           n + 2, n+3,

p+1, p being two of the roots of each term in this series ; by adding
p+1 to the first-mentioned root and p to the other, these two terms will
be found to be terms in two horizontal series, of which the first terms
are in the first vertical series, and these terms both of them make the
diagonal index, and therefore are terms in a diagonal series which, rising
towards the right, give the roots of W.
    A. descends diagonally            to the left, and on each side of the line which
leads to W changes to cross diagonals which lead to M and N.                        W leads
diagonally       to  the    left  to  R  and  S,  and  where   it crosses  AT   changes and
goes up to A.            M goes down into R, and then diagonally to where it meets
the    horizontal       series from      T;  its roots there correspond with the series
from T ; it returns to T and up to A.                      In like manner N goes down
through       S  to  the  line   from   V,  and  so to  V and   up to A.    It and S go each
of them across to the vertical line from A, and so up to A : every term
through       which these lines pass has the four roots indicated whose squares
would make the term.
    The number of terms in the whole square, whose four roots may be ex
 pressed in term of p and n, is very considerable ; and it may be well now
to present some skeleton diagrams of the many ways in which certain
 members of the square are invariably connected.
    I propose to exhibit several (to avoid confusion, which would arise from
 putting all in one diagram) ; these do not by any means include all the
 connexions that exist ; but whatever may be the value of n or p, a number
 of the form (4p +
                             2). »+ 1. whether it be 2n+l, 6n+l, 10»+1, &c,
 and whatever          be the value of n, gives the following results.              See dia
 gram No. 2.           At the (n— p)th         term   there  will  be   A,  which  descends
 vertically till the index is 2n— 1, then 2n + 1, and from these rise up in
 diagonals      AN     and   AM,     as already mentioned.        A  then further  descends
 till the index is equal to 2n + 2p + 1, when             it rises in a diagonal to  \V.
     Diagram       No.   3   shows certain connexions         between    AM    and AN    and
  other terms       in the square.          AM    is always — 2 j> +    1, 0, n—2p + 2, n,
 AN     is always     —  2p + 1, 0, n     — 2p, n.
     If the series in which AM is a term be carried down diagonally till 0
 becomes 2p+l (that is 2p+l places), it becomes a term in a diagonal
  scries  that intesccts      it and rises to the top, then goes down to the hori
  zontal   series from R, where it becomes a term in that series and passes to
  where    it is below M and rises vertically up to it.             AN does the same with
  respect    to the series     from S, and rises up to      N.

               Sir F. Tollock              " Mysteries
 122                              on the                   of Numbers"         [Apr. 19,
    If the term    Ail   descends  till n— 2p + 2 =2p+l, it rises to the left in
another diagonal series      and goes on till it crosses M, where it is found that
the roots are always the same         as those which arise from M, descending by
means    of its two equal roots.       The term AN does the same with respect
to  N.
    If AM descend       to the margin at am, and one step         further   into an, and
AN    descends    to an, they will be found to have the same roots, and they
will  be
                                   from   AM
                               -2p+T,      1,  n-2p+l,      n
                                   from   AN
                              -2p+f, -\,n-2j+T,              n
The only difference being that in the          one case   1 is positive, in the other it
is negative ; but whatever be the value of p          or n, in this portion or term
of the square 1 is always one of the roots.
    In crossing the two horizontal series from II and S, it will always be
found that at the points of intersection the roots of AM correspond with
the roots of the series from R, and the roots from AN correspond with
those from S.
    Diagram No. 4 exhibits the way in which B, C, P, and Q are connected
together. The roots of A at the (n— p)th square will always be — (p+ 1 ),
 —p, n, n, and p+ l,2p must be one of them odd, the other even ; therefore,
whether n be odd or even, an odd number will be formed by — (p+ 1 ), n,
or — p, n. The series from A descending diagonally has the roots n, n
decreasing, but the negative roots increasing.              The differences will con
tinue the same ; and when the series arrives under that index which cor
responds to the odd number —            Q'+   1) n, or — p, n, it becomes a term in
a horizontal     series   which   goes   to P, two terms of which are            always
p, p+1.       "W,  in descending diagonally, has its index          on reaching   PB  1.
When     A   has descended so as to reach the even number of the two,
(— (»+l), n, —p, n), it rises in a vertical series to Q; and the three
series,   WR, BP, CQ, always intersect in the same point or small
square,  H.
    The paper then exhibits in a Diagram (No. 5) all the roots which
arise from applying the method to the odd No. 161, and shows that the
roots
               of A would be                           3,    2,   16,    16

diagram larger than could conveniently be put into a publication of the
size of the Proceedings. The roots 10, 0, 5, 6, if arranged thus, —10, 0,
5, 6, have 1 for their sum ; but it was proved in the former paper
                                                                     (see
p. 410, Trans. Roy. Soc. for 1861) that if the algebraic sum of the roots
be 1, then the number is the double + 1 of a number composed of 3 tri
angular numbers, 161 = 80x2+1, and 80 is composed of the 3 triangular
numbers 55, 15, 10.                         If therefore

an odd         number w ill            be obtained, to which the same process may be applied
as    is here   applied to 161.
     I    hare stated that the cause of the                               success      of   "   the    method" (though it
does       not at present amount to a demonstration)                                        may be easily shown.                              It
arises,        first,   from "     the method" requiring every odd number that is a term
in any         of the series        to be represented by the roots of the square numbers
that compose               it ;   and secondly, and more particularly, from every series
being connected with at least six others of a different kind which intersect
it,each of which   again connected with at least five others, so that when
                                  is
the whole             network has       been pursued, and the roots which in succession
form every term                   have been recorded,  will be found that many different
                                                                          it
modes           of dividing each term into four squares or less will be discovered,
i.   e.   if   the numbers be large.      propose to show the manner in which the

and the number cannot in any case be less than 6. A series of the second
kind gives rise to other series crossing it in the same manner mutatis mu

upon it.      A      series   of the third kind            has all the differences             of its roots the

and 5—3=2, it furnishes two vertical                            series   ; at the tenth row it furnishes
two more     ;   at the twelfth           row two more.                  When it gets into the column
whose index is 1 1 and then 9, before it reaches the margin or outer edge,
it furnishes two horizontal series ; and after it has passed the margin at 9 and
11   it furnishes two more, and      it furnishes another.
                                               at 21        Here are six new
vertical and five new horizontal series ; besides which it furnishes at least
two other diagonal series which cross it.
   Having stated the properties which belong to the square, if the first odd
number in it be of the form (4p + 2).n + 1, and that whether it be 2n + I,
6n+l, 10m+1, &c., or whatever be the value of n, certain squares maybe
found which I distinguish as A, B, C, H, P, Q, W, M, N, AM, AN, R, S,
T, V, &c, which are connected together by a community of roots where
the series cross each other in a manner that is invariable.
  The Diagram No. 3 is another example of the manner in which certain
of           in the different series communicate with each other, by the
     the terms
roots being common   to both, at the point where they cross.  AM passes
diagonally to am, down to an, and up to AN.     AN, in like manner, goes
down to an and up to am and AM. If the first term of the square be an
odd number of the form (4^j + 2) n+l, the roots from AM are in an
-(2p + l),           1,   (n-2p+l),           n.        The roots from          AN       are   -(2p      +   l), -1,

 I. " Report      on the Levelling    from the Mediterranean        to the Dead
         Sea."    By Colonel Sir Henry James, R.E., F.R.S.              Received
        April 5, 1866.
     The instructions for levelling from the Mediterranean      to the Dead Sea
having      been  received  after the party had arrived at Jerusalem, it was
thought best      to level in the first place from Jerusalem to the Dead Sea
during the cool months, and to complete the line to the Mediterranean at
 Jaffa, when the party were on their way home.
     But in describing the line levelled, we may assume that it was made
 direct from Jaffa to the Dead Sea.
    The line selected was that which runs across the maritime plain direct
from Jaffa to Lydda, three miles beyond which, on the road to Beth Horon,
the line turns to the right by Jimsu, Birfileeah, and Beit Sira ; and from
thence up the Wady Suleiman to El Jib, where it again joins the old
Roman Road from Lydda, by Beth Horon to Jerusalem.                  But at about
 11    mile on the north road from the Damascus Gate, the line tums to the
eastward over Mount Scopus, where it reached the altitude of 2724 feet,
the height of the top of the large cairn on it.      This was the highest point
crossed between the Mediterranean and the Dead Sea.
    From Mount Scopus the line follows the high ground to the Mount
of Olives, and thence takes the road down to Bethany, and, following
the road by Khan Hadhur to near Jericho, the line turns to the right
within about a mile of the latter place, and was carried thence across

the level of the Mediterranean                 was crossed, and from thence towards the
Dead Sea the levels are marked with the negative sign.
   On the 12th of March, 1865, the party reached the Dead Sea, when its
level was found to be 292 feet below the level of the Mediterranean

from an examination of the drift wood on the shore,    was ascertained that     it
at some time of the year, probably after the winter freshets, the water rises
21    feet higher, which would make the least depression                             1   289-5.

       From inquiry amongst the Bedouins and European residents in Palestine,
   it was ascertained that during the early summer the level of the sea fulls
   at least 6 feet below the level at which     it stood on the day the levelling    was
   taken,  which would make the depression           1298 feet;   and we may conclude
   tbat the maximum          depression   at no time exceeds 1300 feet.           Lieut.
   Symonds,     R.E., in 1841,    made the depression 1312*2 feet.
      The soundings in the Dead Sea by Lieut. Vignes of the French Navy,
   gave a maximum        depth of 1 148 feet, making the depression of the bottom
   of the Dead Sea 2446 feet below the level of the Mediterranean.                   The
   soundings in the Mediterranean, midway between Malta and Candia, by
   Captain Spratt, R.N., gave a depth of 13,020 feet, or a depression of the
   bottom five times greater than that of the bottom of the Dead Sea.
      The levelling was executed by two independent observers, and from a
   comparison of the two sets of levelling, it is certain that the levels have
  been obtained with absolute accuracy to within 3 or 4 inches.
      The establishment of a chain of levels across the country with bench
  marks cut on so many points, cannot but prove of the utmost importance
  for any future investigations, or for any more extended surveys in Palestine,
  such as are contemplated by the Society which has been formed since this
  survey was made,
                          " for the accurate and systematic investigation of the
  archaeology, the topography, the geology, and physical geography, &c. of
  the   Holy Land, for Biblical illustration."
      For the survey of Jerusalem itself, it was of the utmost importance,            as
 it enabled us     to connect all the levels   in and about the city with the level
 of the Mediterranean,        and to harmonize, so to speak, all the levels which
  have been taken.

     In   a former communication       I  have shown that the hydride of heptyl
 obtained     from petroleum has a higher specific gravity than its isomers
 ethyl-amyl, and hydride of heptyl from azelaic acid. The same is the
case    with their derivatives, and some of these isomeric compounds also
 show considerable differences in their boiling-points *.             I could not com
pare     the  different   heptyl-compounds      which      I  prepared with those of
heptyl-alcohol formed by fermentation, as the latter substance is very little
known, and I therefore considered it interesting to compare the amyl-
compounds from fusel-oil with those obtained from petroleum.                  From the
latter substance I prepared a considerable quantity of pure hydride of
amyl, which boiled constantly at 33°-35° C. ; and I did not succeed in
lowering     the boiling-point any further.         From this hydride other amyl-
compounds were obtained in exactly the same way as the heptyl-com-
                             * Proc. Boy. Soc. vol. xiv. p. 401.

   It appears from this Table that the boiling-points of the same com
pounds agree perfectly, and that the specific gravities show only very small
differences, those of the substances obtained from petroleum being a little
higher.    This is easily accounted for by an admixture of higher boiling
compounds, which towards the end of the distillation raise the boiling-
points a little, and which cannot be removed completely, even by long-
continued rectifications.       The amyl-compounds from petroleum and those
from fusel-oil are therefore identical.
III. "   On    a   New Series     of Hydrocarbons derived from Coal-tar."
       By C. Schorlemmer.                Communicated by Professor Roscoe.
       Received April 26, 1866.
   The light oils obtained by the destructive distillation of Cannel-coal
at a low temperature, contain, besides the hydrocarbons of the marsh-gas
and benzol series, other substances, which are attacked by concentrated
sulphuric acid.        If the oil, which has been repeatedly shaken with
this acid, be subjected to distillation, the hydrocarbons which are un
acted upon volatilize first, and a black tarry liquid, equal in bulk to
about half the crude oil, remains behind f. On heating this residue more
strongly, a brown oil, having an unpleasant smell, comes over at about
200° C; the temperature rises gradually up to 300° C, and at last a black
                                             Even after repeated rectifications            the
pitchy mass is left in the retort.
oil always leaves a solid black residue behind, and it was only by                       con
tinued fractional distillations over solid caustic potash and metallic sodium,
that  I  succeeded in isolating substances possessing nearly a constant
boiling-point and volatilizing almost completely.                The compounds which
I thus obtained     from Cannel-coal oil, boiling below 120°C, are hydrocarbons
of the general formula (C„ H„                  as the following analyses and deter
minations of the vapour-densities show : —

    These    hydrocarbons are colourless, oily, strongly refracting liquids,
lighter than water, and possessing a faint peculiar smell, resembling that of
the roots of Daucus carota or Pattinaca saliva.               I have obtained them
in small quantities only, and could study their reactions therefore only
incompletely.        They combine with bromine with a hissing noise, and if
the reaction is not moderated, the liquid blackens and hydrobromic acid
is evolved    ;  but by keeping the substance well cooled, and by adding
the bromine very carefully, nearly colourless, heavy, oily, sweet-smelling
 bromine-compounds are obtained, without the formation of hydrobromic
 acid.    These are very easily decomposed by heating ; charry matter sepa
 rates out, and hydrobromic          acid is given off even below the boiling-point
 of water.      From the hydrocarbon Cu H2, alone            I  obtained a sufficient
 quantity of the bromide for analysis.

     As it  was impossible       to  purify the small quantity of bromide, the dif-
 erence between      the found aud calculated quantities is easily accounted for.
     Concentrated nitric acid dissolves these hydrocarbons, much heat being
 evolved ; on diluting the acid solution with water, yellow, heavy, thick
 oily nitro-compounds separate, which have a faint but peculiarly unpleasant
 smell.     By heating these nitro-compounds with tin aud hydrochloric acid,
 a portion is converted into a black tarry mass, and the solution contains a
 considerable quantity of chloride of ammonium, and a small quantity of a
 hydrochlorate, which can be obtained as a crystalline deliquescent mass
 by evaporating in vacuo.           On concentrating the solution in the air, decom
 position takes place, a violet substance being formed.            By adding caustic
potash to the solution of the hydrochlorate, a dark oily base separates,
 which quickly oxidizes into a black tarry mass. Platiuic chloride produces
 at first no precipitate in the concentrated solution of the hydrochlorate,
 but after a few minutes a dark violet tar separates.
     1 could not succeed in obtaining crystallized double chlorides           of tin or
 zinc.
     If these  hydrocarbons are heated with a concentrated solution of bichro
 mate    of potassium and sulphuric acid, carbonic acid is evolved, a strongly
 acid liquid, on which an oily layer swims, distils over, a resinous sub
 stance remaining in the retort.              As I did not obtain any of the pure
 hydrocarbons      in  sufficient quantity to study their separate products of oxi
  dation, I took all that remained, together with the intermediate distillates,
 and the oil boiling above 280° C, which had been previously well purified
 by rectification over sodium. After oxidation, the distillate was neutralized
 with carbonate of sodium, the oil being left undissolved.               This neutral
  oil, which has an ethereal smell, and boils between 200° and 300° C, gave
  on analysis 84-9 per cent. C and 118 per ceut.          II  ; it consists, therefore,

   of non-oxidized      hydrocarbons, containing a small quantity of an oxygen-
    compound.       The solution of the sodium-salt was evaporated on the water-
   bath, the residue distilled with diluted sulphuric acid, and the distillate
   rectified.    It smelt strongly of acetic acid, and also slightly of butyric acid.
   By neutralization with carbonate of sodium, a crop of crystals of acetate of
  sodium was obtained, which were converted into the crystallized silver-
  salt.
      0-1335   of this salt  gave 0 861    of silver.

      The   syrupy mother-liquor of the sodium-salt gave, with nitrate of
  silver, a white precipitate, which, on boiling the liquid, decomposed with
  effervescence and separation of metallic silver, showing the presence of
 formic     acid ; from the filtered liquid small warty crystals of a silver-salt
 separated.
      01314 of this salt gave 0-842 of silver, or 64-1 per cent. Ag.
     The mother-liquor gave on evaporation again crystals of acetate of silver.
      0-219G gave 01418 silver, or 64-56 percent.
      The volatile acids produced by the oxidation of the hydrocarbons are
 therefore carbonic acid, acetic acid, formic acid, and perhaps a trace of an
 acid richer in carbon.
     The resinous substance left in the retort is an acid which dissolves in
 caustic potash, and is precipitated        from this solution      as a brown greasy
 substance, easily soluble in alcohol.           The alcoholic solution, neutralized
 with ammonia, gave, with nitrate of silver, a white flocculent precipitate of
 a   silver-salt, which dried into a brown resinous mass, not fit for analysis.
      As these hydrocarbons were obtained by the action of sulphuric acid on
 coal-tar oils boiling below 120°, and as they differ by Ca H4, it appears to
 me almost certain that they are polymers of the hydrocarbons of the
 acetylene series, C„H2„-2,            formed in the same way as diamylene is
formed, by treating amylene with sulphuric acid.                The products of oxida
tion are also in accordance with this view.

two isomers C„ H]0, namely, diallyl and hexoylene.                 By acting with sul
phuric acid on these compounds, I obtained, besides large quantities of
tarry matter, polymeric modifications boiling above 200°, having a smell
similar to the hydrocarbons described               above,  giving  also similar nitro
compounds ; but the quantities which              I  got were not large enough    for a
more exact examination.
     The sulphuric acid which was used to purify the coal-tar oils contains
 an organic substance       in solution, which can be isolated by neutralizing the
 acid liquid with carbonate of calcium, filtering, evaporating to dryness in
 the water-bath, extracting the residue with alcohol, and evaporating the
 alcoholic solution.       It forms  a yellow amorphous       mass, which   has a faint,

         Bart., F.R.S., Professor of Chemistry in the University of
         Oxford. Received April 25, 1866.
                                          (Abstract.)
  In chemical transformations the absolute weight of matter is unaltered,
and every chemical change, as regards weight, is a change in its arrange
ment and distribution.    Now this distribution of weight is subject to
numerical laws, and the object of the present method is to facilitate                      the
study of these laws, by the aid of symbolic processes. The data of                         the
chemical calculus, as indeed of every other application of symbols to                      the
investigation of natural phenomena, are supplied by observation and                        ex
periment    and its aim is simply to deduce from these data the various
            ;
consequences which may be inferred from them.     The province of such
a method commences where that of experiment terminates.
   This part comprises the consideration of the fundamental                      principles of
symbolic expression in chemistry, and also the application of the method
to the solution of perhaps the most important of all chemical problems,
namely, the question of the true composition, as regards weight, of the                 units
of chemical substances.
   Section I. In the first section certain definitions are given of those weights
and relations of weight, of which the symbols are subsequently considered.
It may be regarded as containing an analysis of the subject of chemical
investigation. The definitions are of "achemjcal substance," "a weight,"
"a single weight,"
                   " a group of weights," " identical weights," "a com
pound weight," "a simple weight," and "an integral compound weight."
  The unit of a chemical substance is defined as that weight of the sub
stance which at 0° Centigrade, and 760 millims. pressure and in the con
dition of a perfect gas, occupies the volume of 1000 cubic centimetres.
This volume is termed the unit of space.
  Section       II.   The   second section treats    of symbolic expression in chemistry.
A "chemical operation" isjlefined             as    an operation of which the result is »
weight.   These operations are symbolized by letters, x, y, &c. An inter
pretation is assigned to the symbols -f and — , as the symbols of aggregation
and" segregation, that         is,
                         of the mental operations by which groups are formed.
The symbol =          is    selected as the symbol    of chemical identity   ;   the symbol

 0 as  the symbol     of the   absence     of a weight, this   symbol being identical
with x— x.        The symbol (x+x) is the symbol of two weights collectively
considered, and as constituting a whole.
   The symbols xy and        - are   selected as the symbols     of compound weights,
and   it is proved that with this interpretation        these   symbols are subject to
the commutative        and distributive    laws,
                                        xy=yx,
and also    to the index law,
   Section    III.  treats of the properties and interpretation of the chemical
symbol     1, which   is selected as the symbol of the subject of chemical opera
tions, namely, the unit of space.            With this interpretation the chemical
symbol 1 has the property of the numerical symbol 1 given in the equa
tion x\ —tc.
   Section IV. Chemical symbols are here shown to be subject to a special
symbolic law, given in the equation
                                         xy=x+y.
This property, by which            chemical    symbols are distinguished from the
symbols employed in other symbolic methods, is termed the
                                                                        " logarithmic "
property of these symbols.           A consequence of this property is that 0= 1,
and that any number of numerical symbols may be added to a chemical
function without affecting its interpretation as regards weight.
   Section V. relates to the special properties of the symbols of simple
weights, which are termed prime factors, from their analogy to the prime
factors of numbers.        These symbols differ, however, from these factors in
that, like the numerical symbol 1, they are incapable of partition as well
as of division, which is a consequence of the condition xy=x+y.
    The symbol of the unit of a chemical substance, expressed as a function
of the simple weights of which it consists, is identical with the symbol of a
whole number expressed by means of its prime factor, a", bn>, c*a.             ...    A
general     method     is given  for   discovering   the  prime    factors  of chemical
 symbols.
    Section   VI.   is on the construction of chemical equations from experi
 mental data.
    Section    VII.    On the expression of chemical symbols by means of
prime factors in the actual system of chemical equations.                 The object of
 this section   is to  prove  that  the  units  of weight  of chemical   substances  are
integral compound weights, and to discover the simplest expression for the
symbols which is consistent with this assumption.
    Such an expression cannot be effected unless some one symbol be de
 termined from external considerations.            The unit of hydrogen, therefore,
is assnmed to consist of one simple weight, its symbol being expressed by
 one prime factor, a, which is termed the modulus of the symbolic system.

This assertion is the expression of      a hypothesis     which    may be proved or
disproved by facts, and the consequences       of which are here traced.
   The symbols of the elements are considered in three groups.                   1. The
symbols of the elements of which the density in the gaseous condition can
be experimentally     determined, and which      form with one another          gaseous
combinations.      2. The symbols of carbon, boron, and silicon.                3. The
 Eymbols of other elements,     which  are determined     with  a certain probability
by the aid of the law of Dulong.
   For the method of constructing these symbols, which depends upon                  the
solution in whole numbers of certain simple indeterminate equations,                  we
must refer to the memoir itself.

                                        (Abstract.)
     The nature      of the present brief memoir will       be best conveyed by my
 giving a    succinct account of the principal results which it embodies, in the
 order in which they occur.           The direct solution, in its present form, of the
 important problem         of the   motion  of n rigid body acted on by no external
 forces,   originating in the admirable labours of Euler, has received the last
 degree    of finish and completeness of which it is susceptible from the powerful
analysis of Jacobi ; in one sense, therefore, it may be said that the discussion
 is closed   and the question at an end.       Notwithstanding this, in the mode of
 conceiving      and representing the general character of the motion, there are
 certain    circumstances which merit attention, and which may be expressed
 without reference to the formulae         in which the analytical solution is con
tained.
     Poinsot's     method of representing the motion by means of his so-called
"central ellipsoid" has passed into the every-day language of geometers,
and may be assumed to be familiar to all.             The centre of this ellipsoid is
supposed       to be stationary at the point round which any given solid body
is   turning ; its form is determined when the principal moments of inertia
of that body are given, and it is supposed accurately to roll without sliding
on a fixed plane whose position depends on the initial circumstances of the
motion.         The  associated   free body is conceived as being carried along by
the    ellipsoid, so that its path in space, its continuous succession of changes
of position, is thereby completely represented ; but no image is thus pre
sented to the mind of the time in which the change of position is effected.
1   show how this defect in the representation may be remedied, and the time,
 like the law of displacement, reduced to observation by a slight modification
 of the apparatus of the central ellipsoid or representative nucleus, as it will
 for the moment be more convenient to call it.            To steady the ideas, imagine
  the fixed invariable plane       of contact with the nucleus to be horizontal and
  situated under      it ; now conceive a portion of its upper surface, say the upper

 half, to be pared away until it assumes the form of a semiellipsoid confocal
 to the original surface, and that an indefinitely rough plate always remaining
 horizontal, but capable of turning in its own plane round a vertical axis,
 which,    if produced, would pass through the centre of the ellipsoid, is
 placed in contact with this upper portion ; as the nucleus is made to roll
with the under part of its surface upon the fixed plane below, the friction
between the upper surface and the plate will cause the latter to rotate
round its axis, for the nucleus will not only roll upon the plate above, but
at the same time have a swinging motion round the vertical, which will be
communicated to the plate.         I prove, by an easy application of the theory
of confocal ellipsoids, that the time of the free body passing from one posi
tion to another will be in a constant ratio to this motion of rotation, which
may be measnred off upon an absolutely fixed dial face immediately over
the rotating-plate ; and furthermore I show that the relation between the
angular divisions of this dial and the time depends only upon the spinning
force which may be supposed to set the free body originally in motion, so
that it will hold the same, at whatever distance, by a preliminary adjustment,
the rotating-plate may be supposed to be set from the fixed horizontal plane.
    Thus, then, we may realize a complete kinematical image of all the cir
cumstances of the motion of a free rotating body, and reduce to a purely
mechanical measurement the determination of an element hitherto unrepre
sented,   but in reality the most important of all, viz. the time.
    I then proceed to point out a very singular and hitherto unnoticed
dynamical relation between the free rotating body and the ellipsoidal top, as
I  shall now prefer to call Poinsot's central ellipsoid, because     I  imagine it
set spinning     like a top upon the invariable plane in contact with it and
left to roll of its own accord, the friction between it and the plane being
supposed adequate to prevent all sliding.         I start with supposing that the
density of the top follows any law whatever, and call its principal moments
of inertia A, B, C, its semiaxes       a, b, c, the relations  between   these  six
quantities being left arbitrary.
    It is easy to establish that, if a rotating body be acted on by any forces
which always meet the axis about which it is at any instant turning, the
vis viva will remain unaffected by their action ; this will be the case in the
present instance with the pressure and friction of the invariable plane, the
only forces concerned, as we may either leave gravity out of account alto
gether or suppose the centre of gravity of the top to be at the centre of the
ellipsoid, which will come to the same thing.            By aid of this principle,
conjoined with the two conditions to which the angular velocities of the
associated free body are known to be subject, it is easy to infer that the
velocities of this body and its representative top will, throughout the
motion, remain in a constant ratio, or, if we please, equal to one another,
provided that

where X is an           arbitrary constant. If, now, we revert to the natural supposi
tion of the           top being of uniform density, it is well known that
                                A : B : C : : 6'+ca : e'+a2 : a*+b\
and these            ratios may be identified with those above (although this would
not at the            first blush be supposed to be the case) by giving a suitable value
to the arbitrary constant X.
   Thus, then, Poinsot's central ellipsoid supposed of uniform density and
set spinning upon a roughened invariable plane will represent the motion
of a free rotating solid, not in space only but also in time ; the body and
the top     may be conceived as continually moving round the same axis and
at    the same rate at each moment of time4'.
     The problem         of the top is completed in the memoir by applying the
general         Eulerian equations to determine the friction and pressure, a process
which involves                some rather operose          but successfully executed       algebraical
calculations.

blished at the outset of the memoir, and in doing so am necessarily led to
give greater completeness to                    it,
                                 and at the same time an extension to the
existing theory of confocal surfaces of the second order, by introducing the
complementary motion of surfaces that        call contrafocal to one another
                                                             I                                            :
confocal ellipsoids are those the differences between the squares of whose
corresponding principal arcs are all three the same    contrafocal ellipsoids
                                                                            ;
Idefine to be those the sums of the squares of whose corresponding arcs
are the         same.          Any two bodies whose central ellipsoids are either confocal
or contrafocal            I    term related — correlated in the one case, contrarelatcd in
the      other, and        I                  construction in question
                               show that the kinematical                only                       is
another rendering of the first of the propositions herein subjoined concern
ing bodies so related.
      1st.      If   two correlated bodies            be placed   with their principal    axes respec
tively parallel                      by the same impulsive couple, they
                              and be set spinning
will move so that the corresponding  axes of the one and the other body
will continue always equally inclined to the axis of the couple, and their
original parallelism at any instant may be restored by turning one of the
bodies  about this last-named axis through an angle proportional to the time
 elapsed since the commencement of the motion.       Virtually, this amounts
 tosaying that the difference between the displacement of two correlated
 bodiessubject to the same initial impulse    equivalent to   simple uniform
                                                                  is               a
 motion about the invariable line.
  2nd. So, in like manner,      the bodies be contrarelated, the sum of their
                                              if
 displacements               is   equivalent to   a   simple uniform motion about such line.
                                  we conceive any body as lying wholly in the interior of the ellipsoidal
      *
          Accordingly,       if
 top, which          is   its kinematical exponent,  such body will move precisely as    if   were free,
                                                                                              it
 and consequently             its density may be uniformly increased or diminished in any ratio, or       it
 nay be entirely removed                without affecting the law of the motion of the surrounding
 crust     in   relation to space ur time.

 112                   Prof.   J. J.   Sylvester on a Rigid Body                      [May 17,
   3rd. In cither case alike, the difference between the squared angular
 velocities of the related bodies is constant throughout the motion.
   From these propositions it follows that for all practical intents and pur
 poses the motion   of any body is sufficiently represented by the motiou of
 any other one correlated or contrarelated to it.   To a spectator on the in
 variable plane  the  apparent motion   of one  rotating body may be made
 identical with that of any other related one by merely making the plane
on which he stands turn uniformly round a perpendicular axis. It becomes
natural, then, to ascertain whether there is not always some one or more
simplest form or forms which may be selected out of the whole couple of
infinite series of related bodies, which may conveniently be adopted as the
exemplar or type of all the rest. Obviously, the best suited for such pur
pose will be a body reduced to only two dimensions, in other words an
indefinitely flattened disk, provided that it be possible in all cases to find a
disk correlated or contrarelated to any given solid*.
   The algebraical investigation for ascertaining the existence of such disk
is the same whichever species of relation is made the subject of inquiry, nnd
leads to the construction of three quadratic equations corresponding to the
respective suppositions of the original body becoming indefinitely flattened
in the direction of each of its three principal axes in turn ; so that for a
moment it might be supposed that the number of disks fulfilling the required
condition could, according to circumstances, be zero, two, four, or six.
But on closer examination, and bearing in mind that negative equally with
imaginary     moments of inertia are inadmissible,  it turns out that there
are always two such disks, and no more (except in the case of two of the mo
ments of inertia being equal when the solution becomes unique).     Of these
two disks, one will be correlated and the other contrarelated to the given
body, and they will be respectively perpendicular to the axes of greatest and
least moments of inertia.   We have thus the choice between two methods of
reduction to the type form, and this choice is not a matter of unimportance
(in nature nothing exists in vain) ; for by means thereof the motion of
any given body subject to any initial conditions can be made to depend
upon either at will of the two comprehensive cases (Legendre's 1st and
3rd) to which the motion of a free rotating body is usually referred, so
that the distinction      between    two cases (corresponding to the two
                                       these
species of Polhodes on either side of the "Dividing Polhode," according
to Poinsot's method of exposition) is virtually abrogated.
   From the preceding theory, it follows (as also may be made to appear
alike from an attentive synoptic view of the commonly received analytical
formula: as from Poinsot's theory of the associated " sliding and rolling

its own plane with a  variable velocity, the rate at whichit turns about itself   is   constant,

 and subject      to whatever initial conditions one pleases, there enter but two
 arbitrary parameters.             Calling A, B, A+B the three moments of inertia
 of one or the other equivalent disks, L the magnitude of the impulsive
couple,    M    the vi* viva, these two parameters (say p, q) will be                   ;  if

may be,     from an       intrinsic epoch    as explained   in the memoir), all other   ele

ever   they may       be,   selected to determine the position of the rotating body
become known functions of these three quantities, p, q, t, and may be re
duced to tables of triple entry, or be graphically                   represented by a' few
charts    of curves      ;  and it should     be noticed that    p, the smaller of the two
parameters       p, q, will be always necessarily included between o and 1, and
that  the other parameter q may, by a due choice of the species of reduction
adopted, be forcibly retained within the same limits.                   The five quantities
°>h     q> 1,        gr will then form an ascending series of magnitudes subject
only to the liability of the middle term q to become equal to 1 on the one
hand, or to p on the other : q becoming unity corresponds to the case of the
so-called "Dividing Polhode,"                  Legendre's      2nd case ("cat trhs re-
 marquable") ; and q becoming equal to p is of course the case of the body
itself,  or its    " central    ellipsoid," becoming a figure of revolution, in which
 case  the motion is practically the same as that of a uniform circular plate.
    Besides these two exceptional cases, the only singular                cases properly so
 called, the     quinary     scale  of magnitudes just exhibited serves to indicate all
 the more       remarkable        cases (requiring    or inviting particular methods of
 treatment)      which can present themselves in the theory. These may be dis
 tinguished      into special cases, which arise from any two consecutive terms
 becoming       (to use Prof. De Morgan's expressive term) subequal, i. e. dif
 fering   from one another by a quantity whose square may be neglected, and
 double    special cases, which arise when any three consecutive terms become
 subequal     ;  all of which, together with peculiar         subcases appertaining   to the
 double    special class, perhaps deserve more thorough              examination than may
 have been      hitherto accorded to them. I           conclude the memoir with pointing
  out the   place which this problem of Rotation appears to                me to occupy    in
  dynamical theory, as belonging to a natural and perfectly well defined group
  of questions,     of which     the motion   of a body attracted  to two fixed centres and
  the renowned       problem of three bodies acted on by their mutual attractions
  are conspicuous instances.              This group is characterized by the feature
  that, as regards them, equations of motion admit of being constructed, from
  which not     only the element of time, as in ordinary mechanical problems, but
  also an   element of absolute space is shut out ; supposing the equations thus
  reduced by two in the number of the variables to have been integrated,

 system of differential equations.        It is from the study of one of these allied
hut more difficult questions that the present memoir has taken its rise           as a
 collateral inquiry and elucidatory digression.
 II. " On    Appold's Apparatus for regulating Temperature and keeping
       the Air in a Building at any desired degree of Moisture."                   By
       J. P. Gassiot, Esq., V.P.R.S. Received May 3, 1866.
    Those Fellows of the Royal Society who were acquainted with the late Mr.
 John George Appold, have often expressed their admiration at the various
scientific arrangements which he from time to time adapted to his dwelling-
house in Wilson Street, Finsbury Square.              However intense might be the
frost of winter or the heat of summer, or the brilliancy of the gas with
which his rooms were lighted, when once under his hospitable roof you
enjoyed a pure and refreshing atmosphere.             Much of this was undoubtedly
due to the steam-power he always had at command connected with his
business premises immediately adjacent to his dwelling-house, by which he
could at any time force a current of fresh air at a given temperature into
any of his rooms ; indeed Mr. Appold always contended that houses could
not be made thoroughly comfortable as habitations without the aid of
steam-power.       But among the many of his arrangements to obtain equable
temperature in rooms, there were also those that do not require the aid of
steam-power, so seldom applicable in private dwellings, and which, being
easy  of adaptation, might     be used in private houses   with much   advantage    as
regards the health and comfort of the inmates.            I allude to his Automatic
Temperature      regulator,   and  to  his  Automatic   Hygrometer   ; and these in
struments,    as   originally constructed by her late husband, and used for
many years    in  their house, but now repaired and placed in perfect working
order by Mr. Browning, Mrs. Appold has requested me to offer in her name
to the President and Council of the Royal Society.               She desires me to
express a hope that they will oblige her by retaining them among the other
scientific apparatus belonging to the Royal Society, as a mark of respect to
the memory of one who always highly esteemed the honour he received
when he was elected into that body in June 1853.
    I annex a description and drawing of both instruments (Plate           VII).
       Appold's apparatus      for  regulating    the temperature  of buildings
                                     automatically.
    This instrument consists of      a glass tube having bulbs at each end.      The

tube is      filled, as also about half of each bulb,              with mercury ; the lower
bulb  containing ether to the depth of half an                     inch, which floats on the
mercury.    The tube is secured to a plate of boxwood, aud supported on
knife-edges, on which it turns freely.  At the end of the plate, underneath
the highest bulb, is a lever, to which a string is attached.  This string is
carried,     by means     of bell-cranks, to the supply-valve of               a gas-stove,     or the
damper       of a furnace.
     The instrumentacts in the following manner : — Supposing the stove to
be lighted and to have  raised the temperature more than is required, the
heat will convert a portion of the ether in the lower bulb into vapour.
The expansion of this vapour drives a quantity of the mercury out of the
bulb     underneath      it through
                          the tube into the upper bulb.      The end to
which the mercury has been driven being thus rendered the heaviest falls,
and motion being communicated by the lever to the string, this closes the
nipply-valve  or damper of the stove or fumace.     Of course, if this should
be   carried beyond the required extent the reverse action will take place.
   A weight in the centre of the plate, the position of which is regulated by
a milled-head screw shown at the side, serves to alter the centre of gravity
of the whole apparatus.     The value of the motion of this weight being
carefully ascertained, a scale is engraved upon it.  By moving this weight,
according to a scale engraved on                 it,   may be set so as to

     This instrument,both in principle and construction,     very similar to    is
the automatic regulator just described.    The acting portion consists also
of   tube with a bulb
     a                 at each end.  This  tube contains mercury to about
half the height of each bulb, and    portion of ether floating on the mer
                                                 a

  Yesterday, May the 1 6th, one of us received a note from Mr. John Bir
mingham of Tuam, stating that he had observed on the night of May 12
a new star in the constellation            of Corona Borealis.
                                                       He describes the star
as  " very brilliant, of about the 2nd magnitude."    Also Mr. Baxendell of
Manchester wrote to one of us giving the observations which follow of the
new star, as seen by him on the night of the 15th instant.
   " A new star has suddenly burst forth in Corona. It is somewhat less
than a degree distant from e of that constellation in a south-easterly direc
tion, and last night was fully equal in brilliancy to /3 Serpentis or v Her-
culis, both stars of about the 3rd magnitude."
   Last night, May 16, we observed this remarkable object.          The Star
appeared to us considerably below the 3rd magnitude, but brighter than t
Coronse. In the telescope it was surrounded with a faint nebulous haze,
extending to a considerable distance, and gradually fading away at the
boundary f. A comparative examination of neighbouring stars showed

that this star will turn out to be a variable of long or irregular period, and it may be
conveniently at once designated T Coronas." Sir John Herschel informs one of us that
on Juno    1),
             1642, he saw    star of the 6th magnitude in Corona very nearly in the

   that this   nebulosity really existed       about the star.      When the spectroscope
  was    placed on the telescope,      the   light of this    new star formed a spectrum
  unlike that     of any celestial body which we have hitherto examined. The
  light   of the star is compound, and has emanated from two different sources.
  Each light forms its own spectrum.              In the instrument these spectra appear
  superposed.       The principal spectrum is analogous to that of the sun, and is
  evidently formed by the light of an incandescent solid or liquid photosphere,
  which has suffered absorption by the vapours of an envelope cooler than
  itself.    The second spectrum consists of a few bright lines, which indicate
  that the light by which it is formed was emitted by matter in the state of
  luminous gas *.        These spectra are represented with considerable approxi
  mative accuracy      in a diagram which accompanies this paper.

     Description     of   the spectrum of absorption. — In the red a little more
 refrangible than Fraunhofer's C are two strong dark lines.                      The interval
 between these and a line a little less refrangible than D is shaded by a num
 ber   of fine lines very near each other.           A   less strongly marked line is seen
about the       place of solar D.         Between D and a portion of the spectrum
about the       place    of  6 of  the  solar    spectrum, the lines of absorption are
numerous,       but very thin and faint.           A little beyond 6 commences a series
of close groups       of strong lines   ;  these follow each other at small intervals, as
far as the     spectrum can be traced.
     Description of the gaseous spectrum. — A bright line, much more bril
liant than the part of the continuous spectrum upon which it falls, occupies
a    position    which     several  measures       make to be coincident with Fraun
 hofer's     Ft.      At rather     more than one-fourth of the distance which
    * The
             position of the groups  of dark lines   shows   that the light of the photosphere,
after passing    through the absorbent    atmosphere,   is yellow. The light, however, of the
green and blue bright lines makes up to some extent for the green and blue rays
                                                                                             (of
other refrangibilities) which have been stopped         by absorption.    To the eye, therefore,
the star appears nearly white.       However, as the star flickers, there may be noticed an
occasional preponderance of yellow or blue.          Mr. Baxendell, without knowing the re
sults of   prismatic analysis, describes the impression he received to be " as if the yellow
of the star were seen through an overlying film of a blue tint."
    t. On the 17th, the lines of hydrogen, produced by taking the induction-spark through
the vapour of water, were compared in the instrument simultaneously with the bright

separates     F  from   G, a second and less brilliant line was seen.                   Both
these lines were       narrow and sharply defined.             Beyond     these  lines,   and
at a distance a little more than one-third of that which separates the
second bright line from the strongest bright one, a third bright line
was observed.         The appearance of this line suggested that it              was   either
double or undefined          at  the edges.         In the more refrangible part of
 the spectrum, probably not far from G of the solar spectrum, glimpses were
obtained of a fourth and faint bright line.                 At the extreme end of the
visible part of the less refrangible end of the spectrum, about C, appeared
 a line    brighter   than the normal relative brilliancy of this part of the
 spectrum. The brightness of this line, however, was not nearly so marked
 in proportion to that of the part of the spectrum where it occurs, as
 was that    of the lines in the     greeu and blue     *.
     General Conclusions.      — It    is difficult  to imagine the present physical
 constitution of this remarkable object.              There must be a photosphere of
 matter in the solid or liquid state emitting light of all refrangibilities.             Sur
 rounding this must exist also an atmosphere of cooler vapours, which give
 rise by absorption to the groups of dark lines.
     Besides this constitution, which        it possesses   in common with the sun and
 the stars, there must exist the source of the gaseous spectrum.                   That this
 is not produced by the faint nebulosity seen about the star is evident by
 the brightness of the lines, and the circumstance that they do not extend
 in the instrument beyond the boundaries of the continuous spectrum. The
 gaseous mass from which this light emanates must be at a much higher
 temperature than the photosphere of the star ; otherwise it would appear
 impossible to explain the great brilliancy of the lines compared with the
 corresponding parts of the continuous spectrum of the photosphere.                       The
 position of two of the bright lines suggests that this gas may consist
 chiefly of hydrogen.
     If, however, hydrogen       be really the source of some of the bright lines,
 the conditions under which the gas emits the light must be different from
 those to which it has been submitted in terrestrial observations ; for it is
 well known that the line of hydrogen in the green is always fainter and
  more expanded than the brilliant red line which characterizes the spectrum
  of this  gas.    On the other hand, the strong absorption indicated by                   the
 end of the spectrum, when the amount of dispersion necessary for these observations was
 employed, the exact coincidence of the line in this part of the spectrum with the red line
 of hydrogen, though extremely probable, was not determined with equal certainty.
     * The spectra of the star were observed again on the 17th, the 19th, the 21st, and the
  23rd. On these evenings no important alteration had taken place. On the 17th and suc
  ceeding evenings, though the spectrum of the waning star was fainter than on the 16tb,
  the red bright line appeared a little brighter relatively to the green and blue bright lines.
  On the 19th and 21st the absorption lines about b were stronger than on the 16th. From
  the 16th the continuous spectrum diminished in brightness more rapidly than the
  gaseous spectrum, so that on the 23rd, though the spectrum as a whole was faint, tbe
 bright lines were brilliant when compared with the continuous spectrum.

 line  F of  the solar spectrum, and the still stronger corresponding lines in
 some stars, would indicate that under suitable conditions hydrogen may
 emit a   strong luminous radiation of this refrangibility *.
    The character of the spectrum of this star, taken together with its sudden
outburst in brilliancy and its rapid decline in brightness, suggest to us the
rather bold speculation that, in consequence                of some vast convulsion
taking place in this object, large quantities of gas have been evolved from
it, that the hydrogen present is burning by combination with some other
element and furnishes the light represented by the bright lines, also that
the flaming gas has heated to vivid incandescence the solid matter of the
photosphere.         As the hydrogen becomes exhausted, all the phenomena di
minish in intensity, and the star rapidly wanes.
     In connexion with this star, the observations which we made upon the
spectra of a Ononis and /3 Pegasi, that they contain no absorption lines of
hydrogen, appear to have some new interest. The spectra of these stars
agree in their general characters with the absorption spectrum of the new
star. The whole class of white stars are distinguished by having hydrogen
lines of extraordinary force. It may also be mentioned here that we have
found that the spectra of several of the more remarkable of the variable
stars, namely those distinguished by an orange or ruddy tint, possess a close
general accordance with those of a Orionis, /3 Pegasi, and the absorption
spectrum of the remarkable object described in this paper.                   The purely
 speculative idea presents itself from these observations, that hydrogen pro
 bably plays an important part in the differences of physical constitution
 which apparently separate the stars into groups, and possibly also in the
 changes by which these differences may be brought about f.

   If it   be proposed to solve        a set   of      n simultaneous linear equations,   not
being all homogeneous, involving n unknowns, or to test their compatibility
when all are homogeneous, by the method of determinants, in these, as
well as in other cases of common occurrence, it is necessary to compute
the arithmetical values of one or more determinants — such, for example, as
                                            1,3,-2

  Now the only method,             so far as       I   am aware,     that has been hitherto
employed for such a purpose, is that of multiplying each term of the first
row or column by the determinant of its complemental minor, and affecting
the products with the signs + and — alternately, the determinants re
quired in the process being, in their turn, broken up in the same manner
until determinants are finally arrived at sufficiently small for mental i

  This process, in the above instance, would run thus : —

  But such     a     process, when the block consists of 16, 25, or more terms,               is

                                       transposing rows or columns, or by
adding to certain rows the several terms of other rows multiplied by
certain multipliers.

  terms.    These values will constitute a second            block, consisting  of n — 1
 rows   and n — 1 columns.
     (3) Condense    this second block in the same manner, dividing each term,
 when    found, by the corresponding term in the interior of the first block.
     (4) Repeat this process as often as may be necessary (observing that in
 condensing any block of the series, the rth for example, the terms so found
 must    be divided   by the corresponding terms in the interior of the r— 1th
 block),   until the block is condensed to a single term, which will be the
required value.
    As an instance    of the foregoing rules, let us take the block
                                    -2 -1 -1 -4

    By rule  (2) this is condensed into         -1       -5        8    this, again, by
                                                    1      1    -4
rule  (3), is condensed into         8    -2     ;   and this, by rule (4), into —8,
                                  -4        6
which is the    required value.
    The simplest    method of working this rule appears to           be to arrange the
series  of blocks one under another, as here exhibited ; it will then be found
very   easy to pick out the divisors required in rules (3) and
                                                                       (4).

    This process cannot be continued when ciphers occur in the interior of
»ny one of the blocks, since infinite values would be introduced by em
ploying them as divisors.        When they occur in the given block itself, it
may be    rearranged as has been already mentioned ; but this cannot be done
when    they occur in any one of the derived blocks ; in such a case the
given   block must be rearranged as circumstances require, and the operation
commenced anew.
   The best way     of doing this is as follows   : —
    Suppose a cipher to occur in the Ath row and Ath column             of  one of the
derived blocks (reckoning both row and column from the nearest corner
of the block) ; find the term in the Ath row and Ath column of the given

block (reckoning from the corresponding corner), and transpose rows or
columns cyclically until it is left in an outside row or column.     When the
necessary alterations have been made in the    derived blocks, it will be found
that the cipher now occurs in an outside row or column, and therefore
need no longer be used as a divisor.
  The advantage of cyclical transposition  that most of the terms in the
                                                              is,
new blocks        will      have been computed already, and need only be copied                                    ;   in
no case will        it   be necessary           to compute more than one new row or column
for each block of the series.
     In                        will be seen that in the first series of blocks
          the following instance                it
a cipher occurs in the interior of the third. We therefore abandon the
process at that point and begin again, rearranging the given block by
transferring the top row to the bottom    and the cipher, when
                                                          ;       occurs,                            it                is
now found in an exterior row.     It will be observed that in each block                                               of
the new series, there  only one new row to be computed

are simply copied from the work already done.

     The fact that, whenever ciphers occur in the interior of                              a    derived block,

coefficient which, in R, multiplies the determinant of the corresponding

converted into an equation for *„    multiplying the first of them by by

alternately over the several columns, beginning with the last, and the sign
which occurs over the column containing xl      the sign with which xl    to        is                                              is

     When the            value    of xi has           been thus found,               it    may be substituted in the
first n — equations, and the same operation repeated on the new block,
               1
which will now consist of n — rows and      columns.   But in calculating
                                                        1                       n
the second series of blocks, will be found that most of the work has been
                                                  it
already done          ;     in fact, of the
                                determinants required in the new block, one
                                                      2
has been already computed correctly, and the other so nearly so that                                                                     it
only requires the last column in each of the derived blocks to be corrected.
   In the example given opposite, after writing + and — alternately over
the columns, beginning with the last, we first condense the whole block, and
thus obtain the    terms 36 and — 72. Observing that the x-column has
                             2
the sign — placed over       we multiply the 36 it,  — x, and so form the                     by
equation — 36a:  = —  72, which gives x=2.
   Hence the ar-terms in the first four equations become respectively
2,   2,and4,    adding these values to the constant terms in the same equa
                     2  ;

 discovery of the galvanometer to forget the static, and to think only
 current phenomena of animal electricity.               Nor is this altogether to be
 wondered at ; for it must be allowed that the facilities for detecting the
 current phenomena of animal electricity are far, very far greater than those
 for detecting the static phenomena of this agent. Be this as it may, how
 ever, my own experience amounts to this — that I found it difficult to

  detect these   latter phenomena easily and satisfactorily until I hit upon the
  method     of investigation employed in the experiments about to be de
 scribed — a method which dispenses with the use of the condenser, which
 appears to be as delicate as it is certain and simple, and which I uow pro
 ceed to describe without any further preamble.
    I. An    account   of the method of experimenting employed in the expe
                    riments which have to be related presently.
    In order to carry out this method of experimenting, the instruments
necessary are two small electroscopes, two insulating stands upon which
to fix these electroscopes, and a conducting rod with an insulating handle.
Each electroscope is provided         in the usual way with a pair of gold leaves,
and   with slips   of   tinfoil in the interior of the glass bell of the instrument,
and   it has,  in addition,    an opening underneath      the wooden base, by which
it may be screwed on the top of the insulating               stand.  Each insulating
stand is a piece of glass rod 9 or 10 inches in length, fixed by its lower
end into a suitable foot, and having at the upper end a screw which fits
into the    opening underneath the wooden base of the electroscope. In one
stand (for reasons which will appear presently) the glass stem is varnished ;
in the other it is left unvarnished.           The conducting rod may be of any
form.      For the rest, all that need now be said is that, in order to avoid the
chance of electricity being developed by the friction of lackered surfaces,
the caps of the electroscopes,         and the end of the conducting rod which
has to be brought into contact with the caps at certain times, are left
unlackered, and that, in order to secure as good insulation as possible, the
exterior of the electroscopes are well varnished whenever practicable.
    In preparing for an experiment, the electroscopes are screwed on the
insulating stands, and then charged in a particular way with free electricity —
the one with free positive electricity, the other with free negative electricity.
This charge is obtained by gently rubbing the glass stem of the insulating
stands between        the finger and thumb — the positive electricity from the
unvarnished glass stem, the negative from that which is varnished.               The
electricity    thus   obtained    is communicated,    not   to  the cap, which  is  in
direct communication with the gold leaves, but through the wooden base
 to the   tinfoil slips which run halfway up the interior of the glass bell of
the electroscope ; and thus, instead of being charged directly, the gold
 leaves become charged inductively with the opposite kind of electricity to
 that which is communicated to the tinfoil slips.            The result of doing this
is that the gold leaves take up a given degree of divergence, and that they
 remain divergent so long as the tinfoil slips retain their charge of electricity.
 Charged in this manner, in fact, the gold leaves cannot be brought
 together by placing a conductor between the cap of the electroscope and
 the earth ; indeed, so far from this being possible, the effect of placing a
 conductor in this position, under        these circumstances, is (as may easily be
 understood)     to increase   the divergence of the gold leaves.

 158                   Dr. C. B. Radcliffe on Electroscopic                [May 31,
    Now what has to be done in preparing for an experiment is to get the
 gold leaves in that second position of divergence into which they pass when
 the discharging rod is applied to the cap of the charged electroscope.
 First of all, the gold  leaves are made to diverge to a given degree by
 charging the electroscope in the manner which has been described ; then
 the conducting rod is placed in position and the gold leaves are made to
 take up the full degree of divergence by so doing ; and when this is done
 the electroscopes   are ready for use.
   The electroscopes being "     set
                                       " in
                                       this manner, the experiment which
has to be performed consists in bringing the body, whose electrical con
dition has to be examined, to the cap of each electroscope in turn, and in
noting the movements of the gold leaves.     The experiment is simple, and
the results are these.  When the body is electrified positively, it causes
increased divergence of the gold leaves in the electroscope in which these
leaves   are electrifiedwith positive electricity ; and vice versd, when the
body is electrified negatively, it causes increased divergence of the gold
leaves in the electroscope in which these leaves are electrified with negative
electricity, and diminished divergence in the electroscope in which these
leaves are electrified with positive electricity.  These are, as will be easily
understood, the movements   of the gold leaves which must take place under
these circumstances.  Moreover the charge of electricity in the electroscope
reacts upon the body which is brought to the cap of the instrument, and
produces, in a way which is intelligible enough, a certain small amount of
increased divergence of the gold leaves of both electroscopes. Now this
slightly increased divergence of the gold leaves in both electroscopes is of
little or no moment when bodies electrified with comparatively large
amounts of free electricity are made to act upon the caps of the instruments,
but it is of great moment when these bodies are electrified with minute
amounts of free electricity ; for in this case the movements of the gold
leaves arising from the action of the free electricity will be exaggerated or
masked according as they happen to be in the same direction or in the
opposite direction to the movements produced by the reaction of the
charge in the electroscopes.  Thus, if the degree of increased divergence
in the gold leaves of both electroscopes arising from the reaction of the
charge in the instruments be = 2, and if the alteration in the divergence
of the gold   leaves produced by the action   of   free electricity be   of the   same
value, that is =2, the result of this latter action will be, not increased
divergence of the gold leaves =2 in one electroscope, and diminished
divergence of these leaves =2 in the other instrument, but increased
divergence =4, in the electroscope in which it causes increased divergence
(for in this case it is the action of the free electricity plus that of the
reaction of the charge in the instrument, 2+2=4), and no alteration of
divergence in the electroscope in which it causes diminished divergence
(for in this case it is the converging action of the free electricity minus that
of the diverging action of the charge in the instrument, that        is,
                                                                      2—2=0),

  1866.]                   Indications of Animal Electricity.                           159
 — and    so also  in similar cases, the movement of increased divergence of the
 gold leaves    in both electroscopes arising from the reaction of the charge in
 the instrument being added to or subtracted from the movement of the
 gold leaves produced by the action of free electricity, according as these
 movements happen           to be in the same or in opposite directions.
    These,    then,    being      the facts,   it is   easy  to  see how, by using two
electroscopes,      it is possible        to eliminate    the reaction of the charge of
electricity in the instruments upon the gold leaves, and to make this
reaction tell in making more obvious the action of very minute quantities
of electricity.      It is easy    to eliminate the reaction of the charge of electricity
in the electroscopes upon the divergence of the gold leaves ; for this reaction
causes slightly increased divergence of these leaves in both instruments.
It is easy to make the reaction of the charge of electricity in the electro
scopes   upon the divergence of the gold leaves tell in making more obvious
the  action of free electricity upon the divergence of these leaves ; for it is
plain that in the electroscope in which the action of positive electricity
causes increased divergence of the gold leaves, this movement will be aided
by the increased divergence of these leaves arising from the reaction of the
charge     of electricity in the electroscopes, and, vice vertd, that in the
electroscope in which negative electricity causes increased divergence of
the  gold leaves this movement will be aided by the increased divergence
of these leaves arising from the reaction of the electricity in the instrument.
Nor does it follow that one of the electroscopes is in reality superfluous.
A priori, indeed,        it might be supposed that one electroscope would be
sufficient.      It  might appear enough to take the movements of increased
divergence cf the gold leaves as evidence of the action of one kind of
electricity, and the movements of diminished divergence as evidence of the
other kind of electricity.               But when dealing with minute quantities of
electricity,    it  is  found      practically that the movements of diminished
divergence are not so easily produced as those of increased divergence,
 and that there are impediments to free movement in this direction, arising
from the clashing of the movement of diminished divergence due to the
 action of free electricity with the movement of increased divergence due to
 the reaction of the charge of electricity in the electroscope.                    In short,
 the plain truth appears to be, not only that the two electroscopes act as a
 check upon each other, and show the same thing from two different points
 of view, but that they furnish evidence which in itself is far more con
 clusive, when dealing with minute quantities of electricity, than can be
 got  from either instrument singly.
    In the description of the experiments upon which                   I am now about to
 enter,  it  is  necessary     to   be  able to  distinguish   the  two   electroscopes the
 one from the other ; and I propose, therefore, to speak of the instrument
 in which the gold leaves are charged with positive electricity, and in which
 positive electricity causes increased divergence           of these leaves, as the Positive
  Electroscope, and       of the instrument in which the gold leaves are charged

 with negative electricity, and in which negative electricity produces increased
 divergence of these leaves, as the Negative Electroscope.
 II.   An account   of experiments in some of which electroscopic indications
     of animal  electricity were detected by the method of experimenting which
     has just been descr ibed.
     In this account the     degree  of movement of the gold     leaves is indicated
 by arbitrary figures.      It is assumed also that the increased divergence of
 the gold leaves in both electroscopes, which movement has been seen to
 arise from the reaction of the charge of electricity in the electroscope, is
  = 2; and in each experiment this figure is added to the movement pro
 duced by the action of free electricity in the case where this action causes
 increased divergence of the gold leaves, and subtracted in the case where
 this action causes diminished divergence of these leaves.            Thus, in the
 case where the movement          of the gold   leaves arising from the action of
 free electricity is =3, the actual movement of the gold leaves in the
 instrument in which there is increased divergence of these leaves will be
 = 5, for   3+  2=5, and in the instrument in which there is diminished
 divergence    of these leaves will be =1, for 3 — 2=1.            Or, in the case
where the movement due to free electricity is =1, there will be a different
 degree of increased divergence of the gold leaves in both electroscopes ;
for in the instrument in which the action of the free electricity causes
increased divergence, the aetual movement of the gold leaves will be =3,
for 1 + 2=3 ; and in the instrument in which this action tends to cause
diminished divergence, this tendency will be overpowered by the increased
divergence due to the reaction of the charge of electricity in the electro
scope, and the actual movement which results will be one of increased
divergence =1 ; for the movement of increased divergence arising from
the reaction of the charge in the electroscope, = 2, minus the movement
of diminished divergence, = 1 , arising from the action of the free electricity,
must be increased divergence =1, for 2 — 1 = 1.
    In the account of these experiments, also, certain abbreviations are
made use of : thus i. d. stands for increased divergence of the gold leaves,
d. d. for diminished divergence of those leaves.
    For the rest, I have only to add that these experiments, which I leave
to tell their own story, with the aid only of a few short comments at the
end of each series, supply the first electroscopic indications of electricity in
living blood and in living nerve-tissue, and that, to say the least, they
clear up all uncertainty as to the presence in the living human body and
in living muscular tissue of electricity capable of supplying like indications.
   First Series. — Experiments which furnish electroscopic indications of
                       electricity  in the living human body.
    In the first four of   these experiments all that was done was to apply the
palm of my hand or the tips of my fingers to the cap of each electroscope

  in turn,   and to note the movements of the gold leaves produced bv so
  doing.     In the fifth experiment, the part experimented upon was brought
 to the caps    of the electroscopes by taking hold of a loop of silk braid which
 had been     previously attached     to it.
     Exp. I. — In this case the result was d. d.=4 in the negative electroscope,
and i. d.=8 in the positive electroscope, — a result showing, as has been
already explained,         that   the electroscopes    were  acted  upon by positive
electricity    =6.
    Exp.   2. — Here    the movements of the gold leaves indicated the action of
positive electricity =2, the facts being — no alteration of the divergence of
the gold leaves in the negative electroscope, and i. d.=4 in the positive
electroscope.
    Exp. 3. — In this case there was i. d. = 2 in both electroscopes — a state of
things showing that the hand was electrically neutral at the time, seeing
that the movements of the gold leaves were only those which were due to
tbe reaction of the charge of electricity in the electroscopes.
    Exp. 4. — Here there was no alteration of the divergence of the gold leaves
in the positive electroscope, and i. d. =4 in the negative electroscope — a
state of things (the reverse of what happened in Exp. 2) signifying that
the   electroscopes were being acted upon by negative electricity =2.
    Exp. 5. — A part of a foot which had been removed by amputation from
a   patient in the Westminster Hospital twenty-four hours previously was
the part experimented         upon in this instance ; and the result was the same
as in Exp. 3, namely, i. d.=2, in both electroscopes equally — the result
which is brought about when a body which is electrically neutral is brought
to the    caps  of  the electroscopes.
    %•     I  have performed experiments like the first four many hundred
times, and      I have repeatedly tested in the same way the electrical condi
tion of other persons.          In the great majority of instances the electroscopic
indications were those of positive electricity.           Only now and then all elec
troscopic indications were absent.           I have also on several occasions repeated
the experiment on portions of the dead body, and always without finding
 any signs of electricity.          More than once, on the same occasion, I have
 found strong indications of positive electricity in one person, and very
 feeble indications, or no indications whatever, in another person.              More
 than once also      I have been able to detect electricity in my own body, or in
 the bodies of other persons at an elevation of some feet above the ground,
 when it was impossible to do so on the ground itself.                  In fact I have
  obtained proof of the existence of great variations in the electricity of my
 self and     others at various times and under various circumstances, and I
 have    begun a systematic series of observations with a view to ascertain the
  electrical  condition of the human body at different times and under differ
  ent  circumstances as to health and disease.            I have already in this way
  arrived at some curious results, and         I have certainly seen enough to make
  me   hope that a knowledge of the electrical changes in human bodies may

shed much light upon the changes which are continually taking place in
the vital condition of the human body, especially when the electrical
changes within the body are taken in connexion with electrical and other
changes without the body.
  Second Series. — Experiments which furnish electroscopic indications        of
                           electricity in living blood.
    The blood used in this series of experiments was collected in a wide-
mouthed glass bottle capable of holding about 2 oz. Immersed in the
blood aud projecting to a convenient distance from the neck of the bottle,
was a piece of platinum wire.        The bottle was provided with a loop of silk
braid, which loop was fastened in such a way as to allow the bottle to be
lifted up by it without spilling the contents ; and the necessary communi
cation with each electroscope in turn was made by taking hold of the loop
and by bringing the platinum wire projecting from the mouth of the vessel
into connexion with the cap of the instrument.
    Exp. 6. — In this case the blood used was from the internal jugular Tein
of a donkey, and the electroscopic indications obtained were those of negative
electricity = 6, — the actual movements of the gold leaves being d. d. = 4 in
the positive electroscope, and i. d. = 8 in the negative electroscope.
    Exp.  7. — Here   the blood was from the internal carotid artery of the
same donkey which had furnished the venous blood used in the last expe
riment ; and the result was also the same, namely, d. d. = 4 in the posi
tive electroscope, and i. d. = 8 in the negative electroscope, — a result
denoting the action of negative electricity = 6 upon the instruments.
    Exp. 8. — In this experiment blood from the carotid artery of a sheep
was examined     ; and the movements of the gold leaves were those of positive
electricity = 2, there being no alteration of the divergence of the gold leaves
in the negative electroscope, and i. d. = 4 in the positive electroscope.
    Exp. 9. — Here the blood used was from the carotid artery of a dog.
The examination was made without loss of time, and the animal seemed to
be in good health ; but all signs of electricity in the blood were absent, the
 movements of the gold leaves being those of i. d. = 2 in both electroscopes
equally.
    Exp.   10. — The blood   experimented upon in this case was that which
had been already used in Exp. 6, an interval of an hour and a half having
elapsed between the two experiments.          In the former experiment the blood
 gave electroscopic indications    of negative electricity = 6 ; in this instance
 these indications   had disappeared altogether, for there was i. d = 2 in
 both electroscopes   equally.
    %* I    have repeated  experiments like these many times upon the blood
of various animals — oxen,     sheep, dogs, rabbits, and so on — sometimes upon
pure arterial blood, sometimes upon pure venous blood, mo e frequently
upon the mixed stream which follows the knife of the butcher in the
ordinary process of slaughtering sheep and oxen. As a rule, I have found

                              Indications       of Animal Electricity.                                 163
 decided   electroscopic indications of negative electricity indifferently in
arterial, venous, or mixed blood ; not unfrequently I have failed to find any
such signs.     Now and then I have found comparatively feeble signs of
positive     electricity.  In every case also where I have examined blood after
an    interval  of an hour or so from the time when it had flowed fresh from
the    vessel,     I
                  failed to detect any sign of electricity, negative or positive.
These   experiments no doubt leave much to be discovered in the same
direction, but this at least they do, — they furnish the first electroscopic
proof of the presence of electricity in living blood. Nay, it is perhaps not
too much          to say that they supply the first unequivocal proof of electricity
in blood,         for the current electricity recently obtained from blood by M.
Scoutteten         and Dr. Shettle may in reality be nothing more than the result
of chemical            and   other changes produced by the blood upon the terminal
wire   of the galvanometer             used    in   these experiments.
  Third Series.         — Experiments          which       furnish electroscopic indications of
                                 electricity    in living nerve-tissue.
     The plan adopted in this series of experiments was to tie a loop of silk
braid to the part to be experimented on, and to use this loop as the means
for bringing this part to the cap of each electroscope in tum.
   £ip. 11. — The medulla oblongata of an ox obtained a few minutes after
the animal   had been killed in the ordinary way in the shambles, was the
part used  in this experiment.    At one time the cut surface exposing the
transverse section of the fibres and the internal grey matter was brought to
the caps of the electroscopes ; at another time the uncut surface corre
sponding to the longitudinal surface of the fibres was treated in this man
ner; and in each case the movements of the gold leaves were indicative of
the action of positive electricity = 6, or thereabouts, the only difference
perceptible being a slight one of degree.   The average movements obtained
"ere those of d. d. = 4 in the negative electroscope, and i. d. = 8 in the
positive      electroscope.
     Exp. 12.    —The brachial enlargement of the spinal cord of an ox,
token out     of the canal when the carcass was being split into two lateral
halves     at the usual time, that                  is,
                                      about half an hour from the moment
when      the animal had been felled with the pole-axe, was used in this
experiment, and the result was d.                     d.   =   4   in the negative     electroscope,   and
i-   d.   =   8   in the positive electroscope.                It   was found also      that this result
fas the same, except             trifling difference in degree, in the case where
                                 in   some
the transverse   sectional surface of the fibres was brought to the caps of
the electroscopes,  and in the case where the longitudinal surface of these
fibres, natural or artificial, was examined in this manner.
   Exp. 13. — Here the part examined was the posterior lobe of the cere
brum of a sheep which had been killed in the usual way               few minutes         a
previously in the shambles.       No time was lost in making the necessary
preparations,          but not   the slightest indications            of electricity   were obtainable,

    Exp. 14. — The cerebellum of a sheep was examined in this experiment,
and the result was — no alteration in the divergence of the gold leaves in
the negative electroscopes, and i. d. = 4 in the positive electroscopes, a
state of things indicating the action of positive electricity = 2 upon the
instruments.      It was ascertained also that all parts of the cerebellum in
differently  behaved   in the same manner.
              —
    Exp. 15. In this experiment the brain of a donkey just killed by loss
of blood was examined, and it was found that all parts of the surface indif
ferently, natural or artificial, gave similar indications of negative electricity
 = 4, there being d. d. = 2 in the positive electroscope, and i. d. = 6 in
the negative electroscope.
    Exp. 16. — The brain of the donkey used in the last experiment was used
also in this instance, an interval of an hour, or thereabouts, having elapsed
between the two experiments.          When first examined this organ gave indi
cations of negative electricity = 4 ; now it was found to have lost all traces
of electrical activity everywhere, for the movements of the gold leaves were
simply those of i. d. = 2 in both electroscopes equally.
                                   I
    %* These experiments, as believe, bring to light a new fact, inasmuch
as they furnish the first electroscopic     proof of the presence of electricity in
living nerve-tissue. Judging       from   these and several other experiments of
the same kind, in which dogs and rabbits, as well as oxen, sheep, and don
keys, were put under contribution, it would seem that living nerve-tissue,
as a rule, furnishes electroscopic signs     of electricity, sometimes positive and
sometimes negative in character, and that these signs are always absent
when the nerve-tissue may be supposed to have lost all traces of vitality.
And this     also would   seem   to be a conclusion       deducible from the same
evidence   — that all parts of the nerve-tissue present signs of the same
kind of electricity.     It would seem, in fact, as if these experiments sug
gested    a conclusion which    is at variance with a conclusion drawn by Pro
fessor Du Bois Reymond from some of his experiments.                  Watching the
direction of the " nerve-current" which passes through the galvanometer
between    the longitudinal surface, natural or artificial, of the nerve-fibres,
and the transverse sectional surface of these fibres, Professor Du Bois
Reymond comes to the conclusion that these two surfaces are in oppo
site electrical conditions, the one being positive, the other negative.
Because the current passes in a particular direction, he infers that these
 surfaces   must be electrified with different kinds of electricity.            But
 it is plain that the current might pass between parts electrified with
 different degrees of the same electricity; and indeed M. Du Bois Rey
mond himself explains the current passing between two points of the same
 surface in this manner ; and therefore, even on his own showing, there is
 no necessity to suppose that the longitudinal surface of the nerve-fibres is
 electrified with one kind of electricity and the transverse sectional surface

   of the fibres   with the other kind.         At any rate, the facts     revealed by the
   electroscope do not      appear   to be   of doubtful      significance, and the only
  inference   which I    can deduce from them is that every part of the sur
  face of living nerve-tissue, natural or artificial, furnishes signs of the same
  kind of electricity, and that the only electrical differences between one part
 and another are nothing more than differences of degree.
   Fourth Series.    — Experiments       which   furnish electroscopic indications of
                         electricity in living muscular tissue.
     In this series   of experiments the mode of proceeding was the same as
that adopted in the last series.
     Exp. 1 7. — The piece of muscle examined in this experiment was cut out
of the stemo-niastoid        of  an ox a few moments after the animal had been
killed in the shambles,         and every part of the surface was tested in turn,
and, except in some trifling difference in degree, the movements of the gold
leaves were in all cases indicative of the action of positive electricity = 6,
these movements being those of d. d. = 4 in the negative electroscope, and
those    of i. d.  = 8 in the positive electroscope.
     Exp.   18. —  Here the sterno-mastoid of a sheep just killed          in the ordinary
way    in  the  shambles,   furnished the material for experiment, and the result
was— no alteration in the divergence of the gold leaves in the negative
electroscope,      and i. d. =    4 in the positive electroscope — a result showing
the action     of positive electricity =     2 upon the electroscopes.
    Exp.    19. — In this   instance the portion of muscle examined was taken
from the glutseus maximus of a donkey which had just been killed by
haemorrhage, and it was found that all parts of the surface indifferently
supplied indications of negative electricity = 1, the movements of the gold
leaves    being those    of i. d. =     1 in the positive electroscope, and i. d.=        3
in the    negative electroscope.
     Exp. 20. — A piece of the left ventricle of the heart of a dog just dead
from haemorrhage was examined in this instance, and the only movements
of the gold leaves were those         which    are produced by the action        of a body
electrically neutral, namely, i. d.       =   2  in both electroscopes equally.
     Exp. 21. — Here the piece of muscle experimented upon was that used
 in Exp. 17.       Twelve hours had elapsed between the two experiments, and
 rigor mortis had now fully set in, and the result showed that the positive
 electricity   which   was present formerly was        no longer present, the move
 ments    of the gold leaves being simply those of i. d. = 2 in both electro
 scopes equally.

1G6           On Electroscopic Indications      of Animal Electricity.       [May 31,
the muscles, living and dead, of various animals, oxen, sheep, donkeys,
dogs, and rabbits, and I have found in the great majority of instances that
all parts of the surface of living muscle furnished indications of the same
kind of electricity, that this electricity was sometimes positive, sometimes
negative, and that these signs were invariably absent in muscle which had
passed into the state of rigor mortis.     These experiments, moreover, make
it difficult to agree with Professor Du Bois Reymond in thinking that the
longitudinal surface, natural or artificial, of the muscular fibres, and the
transverse sectional surface of these fibres, are electrified with different kinds
of electricity. With respect to the electricity of muscular tissue, indeed, it
seems to he precisely as   it is with respect to the electricity of nerve-tissue,
namely this, that all parts of the surface are electrified with the same kind
of electricity, positive or negative, as the case may be, the only difference
between one part and another being one of degree ; and the comments
upon M. Du Bois Reymond' s conclusions, when speaking upon the condi
tion of nerve-tissue as to electricity, are equally applicable to the present
case,   if only   the words muscular tissue and muscular current be substituted
for nerve-tissue and nerve-current.
   In conclusion, it only remains for       me to direct attention to one bearing
of the facts recorded in this paper. These facts, one and all, exhibit ani
mal electricity, not in the form of a feeble nerve-current, or of a feeble
muscular current, or of the still feebler currents of less definite character,
but as endowed with a considerable amount of tension.          They bring to
light   a propertyof animal electricity which is more intelligible on the sup
position  that the primary condition of this electricity is not current but
statical.  It is easy to account for these phenomena of tension if the pri
mary condition of animal electricity be statical, for tension is the character
istic property of statical electricity ; it is by no means easy to account for
these phenomena of tension if the primary condition            of animal electricity
be that of the current revealed by the galvanometer,            for the currents so
revealed are far too feeble to allow one to suppose thatthey can he endowed
with an appreciable amount of tension. In a word,       with the phenomena
of tension to account for which are revealed in the experiments recorded
in this paper, the natural inference, as it seems to me, is that the primary
condition of animal electricity      is,
                                    not current, but statical, and that the
currents made known by the galvanometer to which so much attention
has been paid of late— the muscular current, the nerve-current, and the
rest— are secondary phenomena developed accidentally by placing the ends
of the coil of the galvanometer so as to include points in which the elec
tricity  isdifferent in degree. Nay,  would seem that these currents may

      Gases in this theory are supposed to consist                  of molecules in motion,   act
  ing   on one    another with forces which are insensible, except at distances
 which       are small in comparison with the average distance of the molecules.
 The path              of each molecule    therefore sensibly rectilinear, except when

sensibly rectilinear as soon as the molecules have separated beyond the dis
tance of mutual action.
   Each molecule     supposed to be
                                 is    small body consisting in general of
                                                          a

other, such as rotation, oscillation, or vibration, the amount of energy

 existing                                      a
form of the agitation of the molecules among each other.
  The mass of     molecule   adifferent in different gases, but in the same
                                          is
gas     all the molecules are equal.
  The pressure            of the gas    on this theory due to the impact of the mole-
                                          is
ctdes    on       the sides of the vessel, and the temperature of the gas depends on
the velocity            of   the molecules.
  The theory as thus stated                is    that which has been conceived, with various
degrees  of clearness, by D. Bernoulli, Le Sage and Prevost, Herapath,
Joule, and Kronig, and which owes its principal developments to Professor
Clausius.   The action of the molecules on each other has been generally
assimilated to that of hard elastic bodies, and have given some applica-

tion of this form of the theory to the phenomena of viscosity, diffusion, and
conduction of heat in the Philosophical Magazine for 1860. M. Clausius
has since pointed out several errors in the part relating to conduction of
heat, and the part relating to diffusion also contains errors.  The dynami
cal theory  of viscosity in this form   has heen reinvestigated by M. O. E.
Meyer, whose experimental researches on the viscosity of fluids have been
very extensive.
   In the present paper the action between the molecules is supposed to be
that of bodies repelling each other at a distance, rather than of hard elastic
bodies acting by impact ; and the law of force is deduced from experiments
on the viscosity of gases to be that of the inverse fifth power of the dis
tance, any other law of force being at variance with the observed fact that
the viscosity is proportional to the absolute temperature.  In the mathe
matical application of the theory, it appears that the assumption of this
law of force leads to a great simplification of the results, so that the whole
subject can be treated in a more general way than has hitherto been done.
     I   have therefore begun by considering, first, the mutual action of two
molecules     ; next that of two systems of molecules, the motion of all the
molecules in each system being originally the same.    In this way I have
determined the rate of variation of the mean values of the following func
tions of the velocity of molecules of the first system : —
      a, the resolved part of the velocity in a given direction.
         the square of this resolved velocity.

isthen considered, and the following conclusions are arrived at.
   (a) 1st. In mixture of gases left to itself for sufficient time under the
                    a                                           a
action of gravity, the density of each gas at any point will be the same as
ifthe other gases had not been present.
     2nd. "When this condition             is not fulfilled, the gases will pass through
each other        by   diffusion.      When the composition of the mixed gases varies
slowly from one point to              another, the velocity of each gas will be so small
that the effects due to inertia may be neglected. In the quiet diffusion                   of
two gases, the volume of either gas diffused through unit of area in unit

  of time is equal    to the   rate of diminntion of pressure of that    gas as we pass
  in the   direction  of the normal to      the plane, multiplied   by a certain coeffi
  cient,  called the coefficient of interdiffusion      of these two gases. This co
 efficient must be determined           experimentally for each pair of gases.         It
 varies   directly as   the  square  of  the  absolute  temperature, and inversely as
 the total pressure of the mixture.           Its value for carbonic acid and air, as
 deduced      from experiments given by Mr. Graham in his paper on the
Mobility of Gases, * is
                                       D=0-0235,
the    inch, the grain, and the second being units.              Since, however, air is
itself a mixture, this result cannot be considered as final, and we have no
experiments       from which the coefficient of interdiffusion of two pure        gases
can be    found.
    3rd.   When two gases are separated by a thin plate containing a small
hole, the rate at which the composition of the mixture varies in and near
the hole will depend on the thickness of the plate and the size of the hole.
As the thickness of the plate and the diameter of the hole are diminished,
the rate of variation will increase, and the effect of the mutual action of
the molecules of the gases in impeding each other's motion will diminish
relatively to the moving force due to the variation of pressure.                 In the
limit, when the dimensions of the hole are indefinitely small, the velocity
 of either gas     will be the same as    if the other gas were absent.      Hence the
volumes diffused under equal pressures will be inversely as the square roots
 of the specific gravities of the gases, as was first established by Graham          f  ;
and the quantity of a gas which passes through a thin plug into another
 gas  will be nearly the same as that which passes into a vacuum in the same
 time.
     (fi) By considering the variation of the total energy of motion of the
 molecules, it is shown that,
     1st. In a mixture of two gases the mean energy of translation will be
 come the same for a molecule of either gas.             From this follows the law of
 Equivalent      Volumes, discovered by Gay-Lussac from chemical considera
 tions ;  namely, that equal volumes of two gases at equal pressures and tem
 peratures     contain equal numbers of molecules.
     2nd.   The law of cooling by expansion is determined.
     3rd.  The specific heats at constant volume and at constant pressure           are
 determined and compared.            This  is done merely to determine the value      of
 a  constant    in the dynamical theory for the agreement between theory and
 experiment      with respect to the values of the two specific heats, and their
 ratio is  a consequence of the general theory of thermodynamics, and does
 not depend      on the mechanical theory which we adopt.

   gases is exactly neutralized by the cooling      of  each  gas as it passes from  a
   dense to a rare state  in its progress through the mixture.
      5th.  By considering the variation of the difference of pressures in dif
  ferent directions, the coefficient of viscosity or internal friction is determined,
  and the equations of motion of the gas are formed.            These aTe of the same
  form as those obtained by Poisson by conceiving an elastic solid the strain
  on which is continually relaxed at a rate proportional to the strain itself.
      As an illustration of this view of the theory, it is shown that any
  strain existing in air at rest would diminish according to the values of an
  exponential term the modulus of which is .                        second, an exces-
  sively small time, so that the equations are applicable, even to the case of
  the most acute audible sounds, without any modification on account of the
  rapid change of motion.
     This relaxation is due to the mutual deflection of the molecules from
  their paths. It is then shown that if the displacements are instantaneous,
  so that no time is allowed for the relaxation, the gas would have an elasti
  city of form, or   " rigidity,"  whose coefficient is equal to the pressure.
     It is also shown that if the molecules were mere points, not having any
 mutual action, there would be no such relaxation, and that the equations of
 motion would be those of an elastic solid, in which the coefficient of cubical
 and linear elasticity have the same ratio as that deduced by Poisson from
 the theory of molecules at rest acting by central forces on one another.
 This coincidence of the results of two theories        so opposite in their assump
 tions is remarkable.
     6th. The coefficient of viscosity of a mixture of two gases is then
 deduced from the viscosity of the pure gases, and the coefficient of inter-
 diffusion of the two gases.       The latter quantity has not as yet been ascer
tained for any pair of pure gases, but it is shown that sufficiently probable
values may be assumed, which being inserted in the formula agree very
well with some of the most remarkable of Mr. Graham's experiments on
the Transpiration of Mixed Gases*.            The remarkable experimental result
that the viscosity is independent of the pressure and proportional to the
absolute temperature is a necessary consequence of the theory.
    (y) The rate of conduction of heat is next determined, and it is shown
    1st. That the final state of a quantity of gas in a vessel will be such
that the temperature will increase according to a certain law from the bot
tom to the top. The atmosphere, as we know, is colder above. This state
would be produced by winds alone, and is no doubt greatly increased by the
effects of radiation.     A perfectly calm and sunless atmosphere would be
coldest below.
    2nd. The conductivity      of a gas  for heat is then deduced from its visco
sity, and found to be

 It will be shown immediately that the length does not increase the quan

    The expression for the current due to the electric induction will be
similar to this, so far as having the factor F and the exponential.                     If, as
is not unlikely, the relation of dE to dt be the same as for the magnetism,
they would only differ in the values of y. and c.
    The quantity F is the current which would be produced were it not for
the inductive reaction of the current on itself.                 It is as P directly and r
inversely.     The   first of these,   P,  is  as  n the number     of spires in the helix *
multiplied by a rather complex function of its length and diameter, which
is constant when they are given.              The second, r, may be assumed propor
tional to the length and section of the wire of the helix, for in general the
other resistances of the circuit are comparatively small. Hence it follows that
    If two equipotential helices equally excited be placed in series, the ten
sion will be doubled ; but the current will be intermediate between that of
                   2P

collaterally (their homonymous terminals connected), P remains unchanged,
and therefore the currents of the helices are simply added.                    If there be an
 external resistance, allowance must be made for it. This may be extended
to any number       of helices   ;  for calling the external resistance p, we find
                T^^JjJt                         r-^-                                       (4
 The constant c must be a small fraction, for in any ordinary work of the
 indnctorium      the residual magnetism of the core is very feeble.                        As
 it=e~i*, fit must be large ; and as t for wire cores does not exceed a few
 hundredths     of a   second  t,  /u must be very large.

    tI  have been informed that with the inductorium which Mr. Whitehouse constructed
 for the first Atlantic telegraph, the cores of which were massive iron cylinders, the
 discharge lasted some seconds.       If it be still in eiistenoe, it would be interesting to
  ciamine the spectra whioh it would give.

      The potential II is as n1 multiplied by another function of the length and
   diameters of the helix (see Maxwell's valuable paper

   netic Field," Phil. Trans. 1865) ; and the term b is always less than unity.
   When helices are consecutive their n's are added, not when collateral.
      From this it follows that      -^-j

   unity ; and that the difference between      F  and *  increases   as b diminishes.
      When equal helices are consecutive, b     as well as  F are unchanged ; there
  fore so is   *.
     When they      are collateral,   each separate b remains unchanged (unless
  they be so close that they react on each other) ; and therefore, as with F,
  the resultant * is the sum of its components.
     If the resistance of the wire be diminished by increasing its section with
 out making much change in the dimensions of the helix, b is diminished,
 and therefore the coefficient of F.       It is evident from the form of equation
  (c) that * has a maximum for r, and that beyond this there is actual loss
 of power in increasing the thickness of the wire.
     It remained to test these views by experiment, but the task has some
 difficulties.    A single discharge of inductive electricity is usually deter
 mined by the swing which it causes in a galvanometer needle ; but it is
 scarcely possible to get two discharges exactly equal.          The slightest varia
 tion in the manner of breaking the circuit, the least oxidation or roughen
 ing of the surfaces where the break is made, change the result ; and there
 fore  it seemed best to take the actual working      of the inductorium, in      hopes
 that the average of some thousand discharges must be near the real value
 of the current.
     The rheometer which      I used   is Weber's (for the use of which        I am in
 debted to the kindness of       Mr. Gassiot), and it showed an amount of fluc
tuation even greater than        I  expected.   With every precaution as to the
action of the rheotome, the mirror of the Weber never becomes stationary,
and the oscillations are irregular ; twelve of them were taken for each set,
of course read     at each end and reduced by the usual formula         ; yet the sets
 differ so much, that     I only  offer their results as tolerable approximations.
Two facts illustrating this uncertainty may be mentioned. With a me
 chanical rheotome driven at a uniform speed, and its acting surfaces plati
num, the ratios of the current were —
     When set so that the point rises hut little from the anvil          . . 1 -0000
     Rise greater                                                            W894
     Rise still greater, tension of spring greater                           1-9685
     Rise still greater, tension further increased                           1-8371
     Here a slight change of the adjustment nearly doubles the action of            the
inductorium.
     Another cause of uncertainty is the variable speed of the rheotome. In
general it is worked by the primary current, and therefore is affected by
fluctuation of the battery and the extra current of the primary.              The me

   No. 10 was taken with a mercurial              rheotome    ; and the remaining three
with a spring one, such as          Mr. Ladd applies to his inductoria*.
   This decrease of power is due to the core requiring time to be mag
netized.      Suppose the current =A-fB/, A being that caused by the elec
tric induction,      B by the magnetic,         I  get from the above by minimum
squares    A=OO802; B=4-1713; j=508                      ;  which values represent the
observations     pretty fairly, the probable error being +0 0491.                Three cells
were used      here  : on another trial with five         I had         1 29,  confirming  a
previous     remark that the electric induction increases faster than the mag
netic.     Hence much power is lost by working at too high a speed.
    The inductorium which I use consists of a strong oak table, on which
are fixed vertically four primary helices, their axes being 12 and 18 inches
apart ; at which distance the mutual action of the secondary helices is
scarcely sensible in the Weber.              I denote these primaries by P', P", &c.
Their wire is No. 12 ; P' and P" are 12-5 inches long ; they have, in four
layers, the first 383 spires, the second 343f.                 Their cores of iron wire,
No. 18, are 1-12 diameter.            P'" and P" are 13-5 inches long; they have
 each 181 spires in two layers, and their cores are 1-60 diameter.                 They are
 all insulated by strong glass jars, and their connectors are so arranged that
 the current can be sent through any one separately, or through all at once.
 The normal arrangement is that the battery-current passes through P'",
 then through P' and P" collateral, and lastly through P".                  Thus the ¥ or
 exciting power       of  each   primary    is nearly   the  same.      On    a shelf below

     The first six were made by Mr. Ladd, who also determined for me the
 length and number of layers.                   The thickness of the wires was measured
 by me with a fiihlhebel             which    read    to 0-0001 : each is a mean of ten mea
 sures at different places, for no wire that I have ever tried is quite uniform.
 The two last are experimental, their wire not being lapped, but merely in
 sulated by a varnish of wax and rosin, as proposed by the late Dr. Callan :
 this plan does well for quantity, but cannot be trusted for any high tension.
     The potentials were computed, supposing the helices at the middle of
 tke primary P'" (where they are a maximum).                           For G I computed them
 in four other positions, and had the curiosity also to measure the currents.

 cell and a     tangent rheometer of 950 spires, first the helix 6, then that to
 be   determined, and         lastly the sum of it and G. Assuming G = 1, we have
 three equations to determine — the r of the helix in question, the remaining
 r of the circuit, and the electromotive force of the cell.                   In deducing the
 currents, the term involving sin*fl was used with a coefficient obtained by
integrating       through the length and breadth of the rheometer's coil ; and
as   its mean       diameter is 6*4 times the length of its needle, and 0 never
passed     54°,   I  think the numbers of the Table are true to the last decimal.
     For brevity       I   symbolize the combinations, when in series, as a sum,
G+H ; when collateral, as a product G.H; and for a reason which will
soon appear, when two are on the same primary I denote them by a new
letter, as V= G + 1.               At first I used I and G on F" ; K and H on P". To
prevent disruptive discharge, they were kept 1 '5 inch asunder by disks of
baked wood.           The results are given in

      F  is computed         with    a correction    for the place of the helix on the pri
 mary, and with a resistance which includes that of the Weber =0'00779.
  The Weber must have a considerable II of its own ; but as I did not know
  its constants, and as this n must vary with the deflection, I did not com
  pute it.      Possibly some of the discrepancies may be owing to this. The
  sparks show the difference of tension ; they were taken with platinum
  points, and when the machine was excited by four Groves.                          The column,
  sum    of components, gives for the collateral combinations the values which
  arise from adding the * of each helix, taking into account the Weber's re
  sistance.

   must be  greater   than   its <S>,here assumed as unity. As, however, it belongs to all, its

  current is only 2-5. This is at once explained by its 6 being so much less.
  So also the ratio of the theoretic to the effective current is nearly unity
 in G + H, while it is only 0-73 in V-4-V, and for the same reason. In
 G    . H . (I+K)         the ratio is still smaller       ;   but  I  shall recur to this.
       I  now used the four primaries I + K= L on PlT, single helices on the
 others.        I had some doubt whether the difference of the cores might not
 influence the results, and tried this with P', P'", and one P', whose core
  =    1-90   inch in diameter and         15-5 inches long.           It  has 349 spires   of No.  15
 in two layers.             G was put on each of them, and currents transmitted,
 which made          their y's nearly equal.

     It   follows from this that the least of these cores is large enough for the
 excitation produced by four cells : the size does seem to increase the spark,

other      (but merely a state of tension), their n is not changed.                        When,
however, they           are connected collaterally, the currents react on each other,
their    II's   are increased      : the *'s      are thus diminished,     and therefore their
resultant is        the sum     of quantities      less than those used in the computation.
The     i's in this      case become— for         G 0-94289, for H 079885, and for          1 + K
0-34588,        which are quite sufficient to account for the difference.
   3.    As with        I  in Table II., so here it will be observed that N has less
relative power          than either I or K ; its actual power is even less, though its
theoretical        force exceeds theirs in the proportion of 5 : 4. This is explnined
by its b      being so much smaller ; but it gives this important information,
that, at least        in helices of these dimensions, nothing is gained by using wire
thicker than that of I, or
                                        ^ of an inch*.
    4. The effect of L is far less than that of 1 + K.                  In the first the helices
are on       the same primary,            in the other on      separate  ones.   In the former
esse the       II  is larger, for    it  is the sum     of the  n of  each on itself, and those
of each on          the other    ;  b   therefore is less.      Besides, the potential of the
core on       the helices is less than when each             of them is central on it.
    The difference is even more remarkable in O as compared to its elements
M+N, its effect being only 0*7 of the other, and 0 3 of the theoretic
power.         The same disparity of course prevails in their combinations ; O . L
giving only 3'46, while the same four helices arranged on separate prima
ries give 8- 19. The combinations G . H
                                                         (I + K) and G . L . H have the same
helices j but in the first two were on the same primaries.                         As, however,
they were P5 inch instead of 0*5 apart, the II was not so much increased
as in     the other cases, and therefore there is not quite so great a decrease
of power.
    The following practical              maxims may be deduced from the experiments
 and    reasoning        which I have related.
     The attention of instrument-makers has been chiefly directed towards
 increasing the length of spark given by these machines, and in this they
 have     succeeded         to a surprising degree ; but in doing so they have not
 added      to    the quantity of electricity which is produced by them.                    This,
 however,        is by far the most important object ; for in most applications of

  180                     Rev.T. R. Robinson on increasing             the           [May         31,
  the inductorium         all tension above what is necessary        to force the necessary
  quantity of current through the circuit is useless, nay sometimes injurious*.
  I am inclined to think that a tension which gives sparks of 4 inches will
  be found quite sufficient in ordinary cases, and this will be given by about
  20,000 spires j all beyond only adding to the weight of the instrument,
  its cost, and the difficulty of insuring its insulation.   It must be kept in
  mind   that  the mere   quantity is independent    of the length of wire : I
  actually found it the same for a flat spiral of 21 spires and for a helix of
  13,655.
     It   is not,     I
                 believe, ascertained what is the best proportion of height
 and diameter   for   a secondary helix of a given number of spires.    It is
 generally made   as  long as its primary, though perhaps not on any definite
 principle.  The magnetic potential P is in this form a little greater than
 in that whleh I used, but so also is II : the length of wire is less, which
 increases F, but also decreases b ; and a priori it is not easy to decide
 which way the balance inclines.    The II is something less if the spires be
 in separate sections than if they be in one continuous coil.
    The dimensions of the core do not seem to be of importance as to quan
 tity within the limits which         I   tried   ;   their length seems to increase              the
 tension.
   The quantity is greatly diminished when the rheotome works                          rapidly          ;
 and in spectral work the probable limit of its slowness is that                        the im
 pression on the eye shall be continuous.
   The quantity increases with the diameter of the wire up to a maximum,
 which is attained when this is about the sixty-fifth of an inch.
   Helices may be eombined either for tension or quantity without much
loss of these respective powersf.
     If for
         the first, they are combined in series ; the general tension is the
sum of the individual ones, and in this way we can obtain sparks of a
length limited only by the strength of the insulator which is interposed
between   the primary and secondary helices.                   If
                                                     the latter be all of the
same wire, the quantity remains unchanged ; if they differ in this respect,
it will be intermediate between the weakest and strongest.
   If they are combined for quantity, they must be set collaterally, t.                      »'.
all their positive terminals connected, and nil their negative. The result
ing current will be the sum of all the separate ones, but the tension                              is
not increased the sparks seem even
                      ;               few hundredths of an inch shorter,

but are much denser, and in the higher combinations approach to the
character of   jar discharge.
                  a           Hence there    no risk to the apparatus

extending this mode of combination to any extent.
   It   deserves    notice that the helices need not be equal in tension or                   re
sistance    ;   thus the arrangement     . K gives little less than the sum of
                                          G                                                       its

 components,          though    K  has only  half as many spires as     G and but   a tenth
 of its resistance.
     In combining these instruments, the primaries should not be consecutive
if of large numbers, for so the action of their extra-current would be very
destructive to the rheotome;              with P' + P" containing 726 spires in series
the    spark in the mercurial            one is almost explosive, but when they are
collateral       it works quietly.       Were, however, ten or twelve to be so com
bined,     it would require a battery of very large cells to maintain the cur
rent, and it is better to have a separate battery for each pair of primaries.
In this I find no difficulty ; the negative * poles of all the batteries are
connected         with the mercury of the rheotome ; from its platinum point,
separate wires          go to the entering bind-screw of each primary, other wires
go   from their exit bind-screws to the positive poles of their respective bat
teries,    and thus       their action is perfectly simultaneous.      Of course, if many
batteries were         used, the current in the rheotome might be too powerful,
but    then there       would be no difficulty in having separate rheotomes worked
by    one     electromagnet, and (at least with the mercurial form)               adjusting
them      by a revolving mirror to perfect synchronism.
    In this way         I  feel sure that we can attain an amount        of electric power
which has         not yet been approached by the inductorium, and which may
be expected to be a most
                                     powerful means of research in those inquiries to
 which I referred at the commencement of this paper.                      At the head of
these     stands the palmary         discovery of  Mr. Huggins, that there      are nebulte
 and comets        whose matter possesses spectral attributes not corresponding
 to that     of the sun, the stars, or our own earthly elements.             Is that differ
 ence    an indication of some body sui generis, or a mere result of peculiar
temperature          or other molecular conditions      ?   Is, for instance, the bright
line,
         corresponding to one of nitrogen, which occurs, we may say, normally,
produced         by nitrogen as such ?         If so, what has blotted out the other
 bright     lines    of that magnificent spectrum?           Is it due to an element of
 nitrogen,       dissociated by some enormous temperature from other elements,
 perhaps       from hydrogen, one line of which is also present ? And the third
 line, elsewhere         unknown   — is it the herald of a new body, or merely a deri
 vative from        another spectrum ? We cannot even hope for an answer to
 these    questions till the spectra of at least those elements which seem cos-
 towal have been           examined through a range of temperature extending from
  'be lowest       that developes in them luminous lines, to the highest that is
 excited      by the most potent electric discharges which we can produce and
  control.       Now, to obtain such a graduated range, the plan of combination
  which     I  have been describing seems well fitted.           It, of course, cannot be
  expected to
                     equal, under any extension, the wonderful voltaic battery of

   The few writers who have attempted to treat the subject of the Equili
brium of Domes mathematically, have entirely failed to obtain results that
are of any practical use to the architect. Their failure has arisen from
taking   too theoretical view of the subject, and endeavouring by mathe
          a
matical reasoning to find the form which      dome ought to have        order
                                                                            a                                 in

in   a condition of stability              ?
     The object, therefore, of this paper                             is   to find   a   solution to the following
problem —      :

in order       to     insure

 I       take the case of the dome
                                 having   spherical section, as being the  a
form  most commonly used      but the same method of investigation will

 1866.]               Mr. Tarn on       the   Stability  of Domes*                 183
    This method is adopted by Venturoli in treating on the equilibrium of
    Fig. 1 represents a rib of the form above described cut out of the dome,
 and the corresponding part of the
                                             " drum" which sustains it. The arch
 will have a tendency to fall in at the crown C D, and open outwards at the
 haunches   £ F,  causing the joint C D to open at D, and that at          E F to open
 at F.
   We may therefore      suppose     that N, the thrust of the corresponding rib
on the opposite    side, acts at C.
   We shall now find     the effect of the force N upon a given joint EF. Let
P  be the weight of the portion of rib above EF ; x the perpendicular dis
tance from E of a vertical from the centre of gravity of P ; y the vertical
distance of CN from E. Then the moments of these forces about E are
Par and  Ny   ; and in order that there may be equilibrium,           we must have    N
equal to   the greatest value    of P     . -.                                     -

multiply N6 by the          coefficient          of stability, which                   we may take as 2.              The
equation from which to find the value of t then becomes

and equating to the value of N6 as found from (1) and (2), form the
equation for equilibrium (3), which will be a cubic equation in respect of
t.   We shall thence find the value of t necessary to produce equilibrium
in the structure, and, by equating the same quantities to 2N6, form the
equation for stability (4), from which we get the value of t necessary to
produce stability in the structure.

be applied, and the use which the practical architect may make                     of them.

 instead of being built on a circular " drum," this drum is made to cover a
                                           "
 square chamber by means of pendentives," which are so arranged as to
 throw the thrust principally on the angles of the building, where the values
 of a and c will become very great, and it is only at the centre of each of
 the four sides that the above equations can be employed to compare the
 thrust of the dome with the strength of the walls.                     At these four points
 the walls are about 1 1 ft. thick, so as to be considerably more than suf
 ficient to produce equilibrium              ;  and the coefficient of stability at these
 points is 1 -374 instead of 2.                 Had the dome therefore been built on a
 circular drum of           1 1 feet thickness, in all probability the edifice would not
 have stood for any length of time.
     Much of the thrust of a dome may be counteracted by menus of an iron
 belt placed round it at the point where the thrust is greatest.                  This point
 I have shown to be at 70° from the crown, or 20° from the springing.

     1.  The Fovea centralis is a minute circular pit in the inner surface of
 the retina,   made by the radial divergence of the cone-fibres from a central
 point, by the thinning    and the outward curving of the inner retinal layers
 towards this point, and by the peripheral location of the outer granules
 belonging to the central cones.
     2. The inner surface of the retina declines in a rapid uniform curve from
 the edge   to the centre of the fovea, and very gradually from the edge to
 wards the ora retinae ; so that the edge of the fovea is the most raised part
 in the macula lutea, where the retina is thickest, and the centre of the
 fovea the   most depressed part in the macula, where the retina is thinnest.
     3. At the centre of the fovea, proceeding from the outer to the inner
 surface of the retina, we meet with the following structures in succession : — -
 the bacillary layer and    the outer limiting membrane, a small quantity of
 finely areolated connective tissue, the inner granule-layer and the ganglionic
 layer very attenuated, a thin granular band containing optic nerve-fibres,
 and the mcmbrana limitans interna.

      190        Mr. llulke  on the Anatomy    of the Fovea centralit.     [June 14,
         4. The bacillary layer contains only cones in the fovea, but rods in ad
     dition towards the periphery of the macula lutea.
         5. The cones and rods in the macula are longer and more slender than
     at a distance from it.    Although the greater slenderness is more apparent
     in the cones, yet the most slender cones are stouter than the rods.
         6. In both cones and rods an inner and an outer segment are discernible,
     and both segments     cousist of a sheathing membrane and contents.       In the
    outer segment the contents do not exhibit any indication of structure.
    The inner segment, where its dimensions permit, contains an " outer
    granule," and is always produced in the form of a fibre, which connects
    the cones and rods with the inner layers.           These I have called the
    primitive cone- and rod-fibres, collectively primitive bacillary fibre*.
        (Kolliker, in the last edition of his ' Handbuch der Gewebelehre,' re
    stricts to these    the term " Mailer's fibre*," which was originally exclu
    sively, and is still very geuerally given to the vertically radial connective-
    tissue fibres first described by H. Muller.)
        7.   An outer granule is intercalated in each primitive bacillary fibre, 1st,
    where the inner bacillary segment is too slender to include the granule,
    and, 2nd, where the segment is associated with a distant granule.            This
   kind of connexion always obtains with the rods, and with the cones at the
   centre of the fovea.
        The outer granules which belong to the rods are not distinguished from
   those which belong to the cones by any constant characters.
        8. The primitive bacillary fibres run obliquely from the outer towards
   the inner surface of the retina, and radially from the centre of the fovea
   towards the periphery of the macula lutea.
       9. They form a very conspicuous obliquely fibrillated band, lying be
  tween the outer and the inner granule-layers, in which the primitive fibres
  combine in bundles which have a plexiform arrangement.             This band cor
  responds to that band which in the chameleon's retina I called the cone-
  fibre plexus.      Muller and Kolliker call it the intergranule-layer.
       10. Between the inner surface of this layer and the inner granule- layer,
  there is a thin granular band of finely areolated connective tissue, through
  which the bacillary fibres pass into the inner granule-layer.        It is in part
  derived from the terminal divisions of the vertically radial connective-tissue
 fibres, and it answers to the band which in the chameleon I termed the
 intergranule-layer.
       1 1 . In the inner
                          granule-layer two kinds of granules are distinguishable,
 nuclei and nucleated cells. Both are in connexion with the oblique bacil
 lary fibres, which in this situation are exceedingly delicate, and require a
 high magnifying power and a good section for their demonstration.
       12. The connective-tissue fibres
                                            (generally known as M filler's radial
fibres), which traverse the retina in a vertically radial direction from the
membrana limitans interna towards the outer surface, are very
                                                                        conspicuous
in the inner layers, where in sections transverse to the
                                                                   direction of the

  optic     nerve-fibres they are arranged in arcades, which contain the last-
  named fibres and the ganglion-cells imbedded in a granular matrix of
  finely woven connective tissue.        They are less visible in the outer layers,
  apparently because many of their terminal divisions lose themselves in the
  (connective tissue) intergranule-layer ; aud hence the decussation of the ob
 lique bacillary and the vertically radial connective-tissue fibres within the
 cone-fibre plexus, so conspicuous in the chameleon, is scarcely noticeable in
 the human retina.
                                       Deduction*.
      1.   Since the total of the effects of light upon living tissue will be greater
 as the     extent of tissue traversed by it is greater, and since the relative
 common sensitiveness of a surface varies with the number of distinct sen
 tient elements it contains, it follows that the greater length of the cones
 and     rods, and their greater slenderness,     which   allows a larger number of
 them to the superficial unit, are in harmony with            the greater sensitiveness
 of the retina at the macula lutea.        Inasmuch, however, as the foveal cones
 are   stouter than the rods, a superficial unit at the centre of the fovea con
 tains fewer sentient (i.e. percipient) elements than the same unit near the
 periphery of the macula lutea ; and on this ground the sensitiveness of the
 retina at the fovea should be less than that of the retina near the periphery
 of the macula.        On the other hand, the extreme thinness of the inner
 layers of the retina at the centre of the fovea, places the bacillary layer
 here     most favourably for receiving incident light.
     2. The division of the rods and cones into an outer and an inner seg
ment is natural.         The facts in support of this are, the presence of the di
vision     in perfectly fresh specimens ; its sharpness and constant occurrence
at a     definite place j the constantly rectilinear figure of the outer, and the
curvilinear figure of the inner segment ; the different refractive powers of
the segments ; and their different behaviour towards staining and chemical
solutions.
     3.   From   these structural differences   it is  a fair inference that the    seg
ments have different physiological        meanings.
     The higher refractive power, straight sides, and slender cylindrical or
prismatic figure of the outer segment may be adaptations for confining
within the segment light incident upon its ends, and for preventing the
lateral escape of light through the sides of the segment into neighbouring
cones and rods.          These considerations    incline   me   to adopt the opinion
that this segment has an optical function, an opinion which derives further
support from the fact that, in those animals in which the segment is so
 wide a cylinder that a ray might be incident upon the inner surface of its
sides at a small enough angle not to be reflected but to pass out, the seg
ment is insulated by a sheath of black pigment.
     The inner      segments  of the cones and rods       are   the specially modified
peripheral terminations of the optic nerve-fibres        ;  and at their junction with

192                    Mr. A.     J. Ellis   on  Plane Stigmatics.            [June 14,
the outer segment        the conversion of light into            nerve-force   may   take
place.
    4. The outer grannies heing the nuclei of the inner cone- and rod-seg
ments, probably maintain the integrity of these as living tissues, and are
not directly concerned      in their specific functions as organs of perception.
    5. The primitive bacillary fibres are the link by which the cones and
rods communicate through the inner granules and ganglion-cells with the
optic nerve-fibres.
    6. The smaller inner granules are nuclei of the oblique bacillary fibres
in the inner granule-layer ; or they may be small bipolar ganglion-cells, and
act specifically on the       forces transmitted       through the oblique fibres from
the cones and rods. The larger inner granules not being distinguishable
by any definite structural characters from the smaller cells of the ganglionic
layer, may agree with these latter cells in function.
    7. Since the ganglion-cells (of the ganglionic layer) are fewer than the
inner granules, and much fewer than the cones and rods, and since it is
probable that these       latter communicate with           the optic  nerve-fibres only
through     the ganglion-cells,     it follows that one ganglion-cell probably is in
correspondence with more           than one inner granule and with several cones
and rods.       From this it is not an improbable conjecture that the cones and
rods are disposed in groups, each of which is represented by one or more
ganglion-cells thef unction of which is to connect or coordinate the indi
vidual action of the separate bacillary elements in their groups in a manner
 analogous to that attributed to the ganglion-cells of the spinal cord by Van
 der  Kolk*.
    8. There is a close general resemblance between               the  human fovea and
 that of the chameleon      f .

     Let there   be two groups      of points upon      a plane, termed, for distinction,
 indices    and stigmata respectively, hearing such relations to each other
 that any one index determines the position of n stigmata, and any one
 stigma determines the position of m indices.                 The theory of these rela
 tions between indices and stigmata constitutes plane stigmatics.                    Each
 related pair of index X and stigma Y constitutes a stigmatic point, hence
 forth written    "the   s. point    {xg)."     The straight lines joining any index
 with each of its corresponding           stigmata are termed ordinates.         If, when

the index moves upon a straight line, the ordinate remains parallel to some
other straight line, the relation between index and stigma is that expressed
by the relation between abscissa and ordinate in the coordinate geometry of
Descartes.          When only one index corresponds to one stigma and con-
Tersely, and both indices and stigmata lie always on one and the same
straight line, or the indices upon one and the stigmata upon another, the
relations between indices and stigmata are those between homologous points
in the homographic           geometry of Chasles.
     The general expression of the stigmatic relation is obtained by a gene
ralization of Chasles's fundamental lemma in his theory of characteristics
 (Comptes Rendus, June 27. 1864, vol. lviii. p. 1175), clinants being sub
stituted for scalars*.          It results that in certain forms of the law of coordi

nation, which coordinates
                                       " the stigmata with the indices, there
                                                                                        may be
solitary indices which have no corresponding stigmata, and solitary stig
mata which have no corresponding indices, and also double points in which
 the index coincides with its stigma (76)t.                  The particular case in which
 one index corresponds          to  one   stigma   and  conversely, and no solitary index
 or stigma occurs, is termed a stigmatic line (henceforth written "s. line"),
 because the Cartesian case is that of a Cartesian straight line in ordinary
 coordinate       geometry, but in the general s. line the figures described by
 index and stigma may be any directly similar plane figures (77).                         Tie
 investigation of this particular case occupies almost the whole of the In
 troductory Memoir.             When one index corresponds to one stigma acd
 conversely,       but there is one solitary index and one solitary stigma, we have
 s. homography, provided the solitary index is distinct                    from the solitary
 stigma (79), and s. involution when the solitary index coincides with tl e
 solitary     stigma (78), so called because they generalize the relations treated
 of    under   these names by Chasles.
      When the relations between index and stigma are expressed by an equa
 tion of the second order, the s. curves are termed s. conies, because they
 include ('artesian conies as a particular case (80).               Generally two stigmata
  correspond       to each index, and two indices to each stigma, and there is no
 solitary index or stigma.
      Two s. curves intersect when they have a common ordinate, and there-
     *  If 01 be any fiieil axis of reference, and AB any line upon a fixed plane passing
 through     OI, we may consider that a line equal in magnitude and direction to AB can
 be formed from 01 by the operation of turning 01 through the L (01, AB), and altering
  its length in the ratio of the length of 01 to that of AB.       When all such lines AB lie
  npon the tame plane, this operation is termed a clinant and represented by ab to distin
  guish it from the line AB.      If the lines AB lay on different planes, the operation would
 be in general a quaternion.        But if AB is parallel to 01, whatever be the plane on
 which it lies, the operation ab is termed a scalar.      Clinants and scalars obey the laws
  of ordinary commutative algebra.         Quaternions do not.

    fore a common s. point.          They touch when a slight alteration in the con
    stants of one equation will make one of their common s. points into several,
    having their stigmata very near.           When they have no common ordinate
    or s. point, they are parallel or asymptotic, according as the distances
    between the stigmata corresponding to a common index remain unchanged
    or, under certain circumstances, diminish infinitely (81).
       It   has been     shown in the Introductory Memoir that a s. line can be
    determined by two stigmata corresponding to known indices, or by two
   points called the direction-point and original stigma*.                  Taking either the
   two first-named or the two last-named points as the index and stigma in
   a stigmatic relation, we are able to make its expression denote a linear rela
   tion, which leads to the conception of enveloped s. curves, and therefore of
   classes of s. curves (82, 83).
       In the above relations two ordinary geometrical points ("g. points") in
   a plane form the index and stigma.             If we now take two s. points (that is,
   two relations of index to stigma), terming one primary and the other secon
   dary, we are able, by means of two equations, to express a relation between
   these s. points, so that one primary shall correspond to n secondaries,                  and
   one secondary to m primaries.            This is the bipunctual relation (84), and
  includes the whole subject of related s. curves, of which related Cartesian
  curves form a particular case.            The most important and elementary cases
  are,   first,   those in which    the  related  s. points lie respectively on known 8.
  lines, s. involutions, s. homographies, or s. circles, and there is a stigmatic
  relation between the stigmata considered as forming two groups, oue of
  indices and one of stigmata ; and secondly, those in which one primary s.
  point corresponds to one secondary and conversely.                    In the latter case the
  relations between one index and stigma may be inferred from known rela
  tions between another index and stigma, or from the same index and a new
 stigma, or, as is most usual, from the same stigma and a new index. Hence
 follows the general theory of change of coordination (85).                      Homographic
 and homologic s. figures (86) are another example, in which one primary
 corresponds to one secondary s. point and conversely ; but there is gene
 rally one solitary s. line in each s. figure such that no s. point taken upon
 it will have any corresponding s. point in the other figure.
      Corresponding to the bipunctual relatiou there is a bilinear relation
 (87) in which one primary s. line corresponds to several secondary s. lines,
 and one secondary to several primaries, by means of the elements chosen
 to represent linear relations.         To this belongs the biradial relation (87 b),
 where two pencils of s. rays, being drawn from known s. points, are deter
mined generally by s. points having a bipunctual relation, and exceptionally
     * The original stigma is the stigma of which the origin is the index. If through the
>. point (fi) (that is, a s. point of which both index and stigma are the point I at the
further extremity of the axis of reference 01) a s. line be drawn s. parallel to any
given s. line, the original stigma of this parallel s. line is the direction-point of the given
s. line. Direction-points are of great use in explaining

expressed by a stigmatic relation between                                       the direction-points considered
as indices and stigmata.   "When this s. relation                                               between           the direction-
points is a s. homography, we have pencils of homographic s. rays.        The
reciprocal relation, in which a s. point corresponds to several s. lines, and
a s. line to several s. points, follows immediately (88).
   Finally, the multindicial relation (89) shows how several indices may
be made to correspond as one group to a single stigma or a group of stig
mata, and thus leads to the geometrical expression of the algebraical theo
ries of several independent variables.      The means by which a theory of
solid stigmatics, where the indices and stigmata are taken anywhere in space,

their corresponding four stigmata, and the anharmonic ratio of any three
indices and stigma is the same as that of the corresponding three stigmata
and index in a s. involution. If the index move on the characteristic circle
whose centre is S and radius SE, the corresponding stigma moves in the
opposite segment of the same circle, and in an opposite direction of rotation.
Generally if the index move on any circle passing through E, F, the stigma
moves on the segment of the same circle lying on the other side of EF, and
in the opposite direction of rotation.                              If
                                             the index moves on a straight
line passing through S, the stigma moves on another straight line also pass
ing through S.    If the index move on a straight line not passing through
S, the stigma moves on a circle passing through S and conversely.     If the
index moves on a circle not passing through S, the stigma moves on another
circle also not passing through S, and in an opposite direction of rotation.
    If the
         whole group of stigmata be removed without disturbing their
mutual relations, and so that the solitary index S no longer corresponds
with the solitary stigma Z', a s. homography results (93), in which the
relations of index and stigma may be deduced from those in a s. involution.
These relations are expressed by the equation sx . z'y = sa . z'a', where (xy),
(aa) are s. points in the s. homography.    When three s. points are given,
the solitary index S, and solitary stigma 71, and double stigmata E, F can
be determined by an elementary geometrical construction in all cases.
These double stigmata possess important angular properties with respect
to the indices and stigmata of the system (94).                                    Let {aa'), (66'),        (ee)      be

two lines      AB, A'B' may be so placed that the s. homography has only one
double stigma O coinciding with the middle point of SZ', and O will then
be the centre of a circle of which AB, A'B' are tangents ; the ordinates of
the s. points in the s. homography (each of which contains an index and
a    stigma) will then be tangents to the circle of which the centre (being a
 double stigma) will also contain an index and stigma.                        Hence is imme
 diately obtained the relation in G. S. 664, and an explanation of the remark
 there made, that             "le   centre du cercle     tient lieu en quelque sorte      d'une
 tangente."
      The tangent of the          angle subtended by an ordinate at the double stigma
 may be constantly            zero, that is, the ordinates may converge to the double
 stigma.        Then,     if   through any point E two straight lines be drawn, and
 through any other point F rays be drawn intersecting the first line in a
 series of indices A, B, C, and the second in a series of stigmata A', B', C
  respectively,       the    resulting s. points (aa'), (bb'), (cc') will form part of a
  s. homography of which E, F are the double stigmata.                        This shows the
  nature of the points of issue and intersection in the fundamental proposition
  of anharmonic ratios, G. S. 14, and completes it so far as "real" rays are
  concerned.         It will be further generalized hereafter.
      Hence ABBA' is a quadrilateral, of which E, F are the intersections of
   opposite sides. Consequently if A, B' and A', B are opposite vertices of
   a quadrilateral, and E, F the intersections of the opposite sides (ah), (a'b),
   (ef ) are s. points in a s. involution.           This completes G. S. 350, for " real"
   rays *.
       The above considerations determine all the relations of s. homography,
   but do not suffice to give an explanation of those " imaginary
                                                                                 "

   play    so important       a  part in  Cliasles's  geometry.     The    requisite theory is
   very simply obtained by considering the direction-points of two sets of
   (primary and secondary) s. rays as indices and stigmata in a s. homo
   graphy or s. involution (95).              In particular it is shown that     if the s. tan
   gent of the s. angle between two primary s. rays is equal to that between
   the   two corresponding secondary s. rays, there are two pairs of parallel
   s.  rays, which are parallel to the asymptotes of a s. circle ; and all the
   other relations for pencils of ordinary homographic rays are similarly gene
   ralized.      In this case, if the direction-points of all the rays lie upon the
   same straight        line passing through the origin, the s. rays correspond to
   those usually termed
                                  " real ;" and if any do not, the s. rays
                                                                                 belong to the
   class    usually    termed      " imaginary," and were supposed not to have any
   geometrical existence.
       When the two s. points of issue             of the two pencils are distinct, there
    will  be generally two primary           rays which are parallel to their secondaries ;
       *  Some of these results of s. involution and s. homography      have been previously ob
   tained by Mobius       (cited in the Introductory Memoir, 59 /) j but his method and con
    ception are perfectly different, and do not admit of the extension which the present pro
   positions immediately receive, to include the case of
                                                              " imaginary" rays, a subject never
    previously  treated as strictly geometrical.

198                             Mr. A.    J. Ellis   on   Plane Stigmatics.           [June 14,
and   if the      two s. points of issue coincide (96), these parallel rays will
become double rays.           Both are found by finding the double points of the
homography              of direction-points.   When the double rays               are s. perpen
dicular*,         the   sum or difference of the s. tangents of the two           s. angles made
by the primary and its corresponding secondary with the double rays will
be zero.  If the direction-points form a s. involution, the s. rays form
an involution,  and there will be always two s. rays s. perpendicular and
easily constructed.
  The stigmata of the s. points in which the primary and secondtiry s. rays
of two pencils, making the s. tangent of the s. angle between such rays
constant, intersect two given s. lines, are indices and stigmata respectively
of s. points in a s. homography, of which the stigma of the point of issue
is a double stigma (97).   Whence it follows that, in any s. homography,                       if
the indices be considered as the stigmata of s. points on a known s. line,
and the stigmata as the stigmata of s. points on some other known s. line,
and a second index be given to one of the double stigmata so as to form a
s.point which shall lie upon neither of those given s. lines, and pairs of 9.
rays be drawn from the s. point thus formed to pairs of corresponding s.
points in         the two s. lines, the         s. tangent    of the   s. angle between   any two
corresponding rays               will   be constant.
     Supposing each primary                s. ray to coincide with its secondary, and 01 to
be the axis         of   reference      (98), the stigma
                                              of the s. point of issue of a pencil
of s. rays, and the stigmata of                    of these s. rays with a given
                                              the intersection
s. line, form the indices, and the extremity I of the axis of reference 01, and
the direction-points of the same s. rays, respectively form the stigmata of a
series of s. points in a s. homography.      Whence it follows that the enhar
monic ratio of any four stigmata of   intersection is the same as that of the four
corresponding direction-points. This completely generalizes the fundamental
proposition of anharmonic ratios, including the case where all the lines are
" imaginary," and can be made the starting-point of a series of propositions
precisely analogous to those in G. S., but with a much wider signification.
Thus the property of the complete quadrilateral shows, on being generalized,
that if E, A, B, C, D, E', A', B' be any eight points upon a plane, and two
other points        C, D'                the triangles E'A'C, E'B'D' shall be
                                be assumed so that
 directly similar to the triangles    EAC,   EBD respectively, and then two
additional points F', F be determined so that the triangles F'A'B', F'C'D'
shall be directly similar to tlie triangles FAB, FCD, the point F will be
constant, if the first five points E, A, B, C, D remain unchanged, whatever
the next three, E', A', B', may be, and will lie so that if SM be drawn bisect
ing the angles ASD, BSC and in length a mean proportional between the
lengths of SA, SD, and also of SB, SC, then SM will also bisect the
angle ESF, and be in length a mean proportional between SE and SF.
  * If A and B are the
                       direction-points of two s. lines, the latter are somatically per
pendicular when oa.ob=l, and the direction-points are then harmonically situate with
respect to   I,   I',   where   OI'=IO.

   When pairs of                separate           s. rays cutting              one s. line are considered,              it is
shown (99) that             if from               any point         pairs of ordinary rays           be   drawn which
are the two limbs                of   a       constant             angle   cutting any straight           line in points
forming the indices and stigmata of s. points in a s. homography of which
 the point of issue is a double stigma, and we furnish all the points lying on
the given straight   line, and the point of issue, with Cartesian indices, and
hence consider all the s. rays as Cartesian, they will form part of an homo
graphy of s. rays, of which the double rays drawn from the Cartesian point
of issue will be two non-Cartesian s. lines parallel to the asymptotes of a s.
circle, and therefore independent of the magnitude of the constant angle.
This furnishes a complete geometrical explanation of G. S. 171, 172, 181,
651, S.C. 293, &c.
   Generally the whole of the propositions in G. S. respecting the homo
graphy of ordinary points and rays may be transferred to the homography
of the stigmata of s. points and of s. rays, forming a series of propositions
of much greater generality, in which all the s. points and s. rays will be
perfectly real, and can be constructed by means of elementary geometry.
   The last division of this memoir is devoted to s. conies, which embrace
the ordinary Cartesian conies as particular cases, together with all their
so-called "imaginary" points and lines.     The general equation is assumed
(100)  in the  form
           o% .   ox2+2o(i .ox            .   oy+oy . oy3+2oc ,ox+2oe . oy+o£ = 0                             ;     .     (cr)
and    it is shown that if o/3a
                                = oa..oy the equation may represent a single
S. line, or two parallel s. lines, or a s. acentric, which, by changing the
origin and index, may be made to depend on the equation x'y' = 4s'o . o'x';
but    if o/32 is    not    =o«. oy, the equation may represent two intersecting s.
lines, or a s. centric — that                     is,  a   s. curve which when cut by any s. line passing
through       a      point (the
                   given s.                                           of that

 ptotes are    I, I'.       But  if both   oa.  and      become   =0, the   s. cyclic is a  s-
  homography or s. involution.
     The general homographic properties of all s. conies are then deduced
  (101).   First, a s. conic is the locus of the s. jtoints of intersection                 of
  the primary and secondary s. rays of two pencils of homographic s. rays
 with different s. points of issue, and passes through these points, which,
 with slight modifications, holds when a band of parallel s. lines is sub
 stituted for either or both of the pencils. Secondly, the anharmonic ratio                 of
four s. chords in a s. conic drawn from a variable s. point to four fixed s.
points, bears a constant ratio to the anharmonic ratio of the stigmata                      of
  those four fixed s. points; and this constant ratio is one of equality when
  the s. conic is a s. circle.          In order to establish the latter part of this pro
 position,  it  is   shown    that   in  a s. circle, the s. tangent of the s. angle formed
  by any two s. rays drawn from a variable s. point to any two fixed s. points
 in the s. circle is constant (which is a generalization of Euc. iii. 21),
 whence is deduced the condition that four s. points should lie upon a s.
 circle.   The classification of s. centrics is founded (102) on the first of the
 equations (b).          After showing how the two stigmata can be generally found
 from the index, the name of the s. centric is made to depend on the name
 of the locus of the stigma when the index describes the principal diameter
 in whole or in part. This locus is called the characteristic curve. Accord
ing as o'e'+o'g'' is a negative scalar, — 1, a positive scalar, +1, or any
 clinant, the s. centric is a s. ellipse, circle, hyperbola, equiradial (equila
 teral hyperbola), or hyperellipse (for which the characteristic is a confocal
 ellipse and hyperbola).             The mode of finding the two indices correspond
ing to each stigma is then given (103), and the circumstances under which
a s. line and a s. centric may have common points investigated (104). The
mode of determining s. points of intersection, when there is no intersection
in Cartesian geometry ("imaginary" intersections) is illustrated, and
shown to lead to the same results as the homographic method.
     The radical axis (105) is shown to be the Cartesian portion of a s. line
which is the common s. chord of a series of s. circles, so situated that the
extremities      of their principal        diameters are the indices and stigmata       of  a
s. involution,       of which the "real" and "imaginary" circles of Chasles are
two particular cases.
    The properties of asymptotes, and the nature of those in a s. ellipse, are
then considered (106), and their geometrical properties examined. Conju
gate Diametrics and their relations to the asymptotes are next investigated,
(107). In especial it is shown that if (u'e), (v'g) are two of the s. points
in which two conjugate diametrics intersect a s. centric, and if the s. line
drawn from (u'e') s. perpendicular to the diametric connecting (o'o')and
(v'g') meet the latter in a s. point whose stigma is D, we shall have

     From these relations, which         are much more general than any hitherto
 enunciated,       the ordinary relations in Cartesian geometry respecting the
 lengths    of   conjugate diameters and the areas they contain are readily de
 duced.
    By- referring s. centrics to conjugate diametrics as new coordinate axes
 (108), a simple general method for constructing the intersections of a
s.  line with     a s. centric, and for drawing       two s. tangents (109) from any
s. point (except the s. centre) is obtained.               This is illustrated by actual
                  constructions                     to  "              " cases in Carte
geometrical                        corresponding          imaginary
sian geometry.           It is also shown how the chord of contact or polar may
have a Cartesian          portion when both the s. points of contact are non-Car
 tesian and hence " imaginary."
    It  is now possible (110) to demonstrate the fundamental anharmonic
properties     of tangents      and  asymptotes to a s. centric.          If through four
s. point* in a s. centric, four tangents be drawn, intersecting any fifth
 tangent, and also four s. chords meeting in any fifth s. point in the s. cen
 tric, the anharmonic ratio         of the four stigmata of the s. jtoints of inter
 section  of   the   four tangents with the fifth will be equal to the anharmonic
 ratio of the four s. chords (which generalizes S. C. 2, 5, the demonstra
 tion being here direct and therefore widely differing from Chasles's),
 whence,    if  two fixed tangents are cut by a moveable tangent the stigmata
 of its s. points of intersection with them will be the indices and stigmata
 of s. points in a s. homography.          It is now possible to generalize the whole
 of Chasles's S.       C,   and  make the theories applicable, mutatis mutandis,
 to s. conies.
    The *. foci of     a s. centric (111) are defined as the s. points of intersection
 of any    two   tangents which are parallel to the asymptotes of a s. circle.
 Hence it is shown that there are four s. foci to a s. centric ; so that if
 o's'1=o'e'i+o'g'3=oz>,       the two principal    s. foci are («*)   (zz), and the two
 transverse s. foci are (o's), (o'z).       When the s. centric         is Cartesian, the
 two principal      s. foci are those usually recognized,     and  the   only two recog
 nized by Chasles, S. C. 275, 294.           The other two transverse s. foci have,
                                     "            " foci
however, been recognized as            imaginary           by Pliicker (System der a.
 Geometrie, p. 106, 1. 6), and by Salmon (Conies, 4th ed. p. 242).
    Besides the usual properties of the focal stigmata in Cartesian curves, the
following entirely new correlative properties of the principal and transverse
s. foci are demonstrated.            Let there be two conjugate diametrics, and
 through any s. point in one draw a s. line parallel to the other, and let
the stigmata
                   of the s. points of intersection of the conjugate diametrics
and the chord, with the s. centric, be respectively E', F' ; G', H' ; Ylf Y2.
From E', F' draw straight lines          parallel      to the bisectors    of the angles
Y,SY,, Y,ZY, respectively, forming two sides of a triangle of which
E'F is the base. Then the lengths of these sides will be mean propor
tionals between the lengths of SY„ SY2, and ZY„ ZY2 respectively.                   This
is a generalization of the usual property that the sum or difference of the
                                                                            s2

  focal distances is the axis major in the ellipse or hyperbola.       Preserving
  the same notation, take X' the middle point ofX^i,^ set o^'X'X3 = X1X'
  = 0'S, and make X3Y"=YaX3, and X^'" =Y2Xt. From the extremi
  ties G',H' of the diameter conjugate to that used in the last propo
  sition, draw straight lines perpendicular to the bisectors of the angles
  Y"SYa,Y"'ZYa respectively, forming the two sides of a triangle of which
  G'H' is the base. Then the lengths of these sides will be mean propor
  tionals between the lengths o/SY", SY3 and ZY'", ZY2 respectively.          This
  is the correlative property  of the transverse s. foci, which has  no Cartesian
  analogue.     The deduction   and expression of these properties   is extremely
  simple, and they are illustrated by a geometrical construction.      Finally, the
  s. tangent of the s. angle  which  the s. rays drawn  from any  s. point in a s.
  centric to the two principal or the two transverse s.foci make with the s.
 normal at the s. point are equal and opposite, which is a generalization, for
  both pairs of s. foci, of the property from which the ordinary foci derived
 their name.
     The following problems are then solved (112). First. Given two con
jugate radii O'E', O'G' to find the principal and transverse axes of the
  Cartesian centric. The focal stigmata S, Z are found from (e) thus : from
 E' draw E'M, E'M' perpendicular to O'G', and equal to it in length ;
 join O'M, O'M', bisect the angle MO'M' by O'S, O'Z, which are in length
 mean proportionals between O'M, O'M'.          Then there are three solutions,
 giving   an ellipse  or two hyperbolas, according as both or only one of the
 conjugate radii meet the characteristic curve of the Cartesian centric.
 Second. Given any three s. points representing the s. centre, and the s.
points of intersection of two conjugate diametrics with the s. centric, to
find its principal and transverse axes. Third. Given three s. points, to
find the axis of a s. circle passing through them.        Fourth. Given any five
 s. points, to determine whether they lie on a s. centric ; and if so, to
                                                                           find its
principal and transverse s. axes.
     Equation (e) is then applied (113) to obtain a more general conception
 of confocal s. centrics, and Carnot's theory of transversals (as generalized
in the Introductory Memoir) is applied to finding a new expression for the
 s. radius of curvature, applicable for any s. point of contact.    The ordinary
 expression gives length and not direction, and applies only to Cartesian
 points.     Similar investigations are very briefly given for s. acentrics
 (115-118).
     In these memoirs on Plane Stigmatics, the writer has endeavoured to
 confine himself strictly to such a development of his theory as would suffice
 to establish, with geometrical severity, the following results, which he be
lieves to be entirely new, and of great scientific importance to mathematics.
     First. The problem of the geometrical signification of imaginaries in
plane geometry is completely solved ; so that the terms " real " and " ima
          " are no
ginary              longer required, and an unbroken agreement exists between
plane geometry and ordinary commutative algebra.

 1866.]               Mr. A.   J. Ellis    on   Plane Sligmalics.                       203
   Imaginaries arise whenever an algebra is used which is more general
than the geometry to which it is referred.    Ordinary commutative algebra
is an algebra of clinants, which corresponds to a geometry where not only
the relative lengths, but the relative angular positions of straight lines are
regarded.    Now the geometry hitherto associated with it has been scalar,
that is, has considered relative lengths, but only identity or opposition of
direction.   Thus in Cartesian geometry the abscissae and ordinates were
necessarily supposed to be parallel to given lines ; and in homographic geo
metry, where the ordinates were not taken into account, their extremities
were supposed to lie on one or two given lines.      But the algebra employed
in either case took no notice of these restrictions, and hence led to results
which could not be interpreted — that           is,
                                           "imaginaries."      The solution of
the problem   of imaginaries has, therefore, consisted in that stigmatic con
ception  which  removes these restrictions, freely introduces relative angular
position, and makes the geometry coextensive with the algebra.          In the
course of these memoirs every fundamental case in which imaginaries occur
has been separately examined and shown to be               fully explained    by   this con
ception.
  Second.  The coordinate geometry of Descartes, and the homographic
geometry of Chasles, are only particular cases of the writer's stigmatic
geometry, identical in nature, and expressible                by
                                                    identical equations                   ;
for   both Cartesian and homographic geometry consist in the relation of
index   to stigma with various restrictions, which may or may not be re
garded  in stigmatic geometry.
   Third. The general theories of plane curves, as treated               by
                                                               ordinary co
ordinate geometry,    bythe systems of coordination introduced by Plucker,
or the modes of investigation more recently developed              by
                                                           Chasles, and all
the theories   derivable from these, hold,            in their integrity, for          stig
matic curves   alone.
   For in all these theories clinant algebra  associated with scalar geome
                                                      is
try, for which the stigmatic conception enables us to substitute that clinant
geometry which perfectly agrees with the algebra employed and the fun    ;
damental propositions of these theories have been extended accordingly                    in
the course of these memoirs.
   The instrument by which the writer has been enabled to bring these in
vestigations to  successful issue, has proved so serviceable and manageable,
                  a
embracing old and new properties in        single equation, often rendering
                                                a                                         a
general investigation  more   easy  to conduct   than the former special re
searches, and keeping the geometrical operations indicated clearly before
the mind,  that he would add as   subsidiary result of his theory —
                                       a                                      :
   Fourth. A calculus and     notation have been invented and developed,
                               a
which enable magnitude and direction upon     plane to be expressed by a
                                                       a
single symbol, obeying the laws of ordinary algebra, closely resembling in
appearance {not in theory) the notation employed              by
                                                     Chasles to represent
magnitude and direction upon       a   straight line, and    as easy   of manipulation.

   Being encouraged by the friendly interestexpressed by English geome
tricians,   I
          have resumed my    former researches,  which had been entirely
abandoned by me since 1846. While the details had escaped from my
memory, two leading questions have remained dormant in my mind.     The
first question was to introduce right lines as elements of space, instead                                 of
points and planes, hitherto employed ; the second question, to connect,                                   in
mechanics, both translatory and rotatory movements by a principle                                         in
geometry analogous to that of reciprocity.                              I
                                                 proposed a solutiou of the
first question in the geometrical paper presented to the Royal Society.                                      I
met a solution of the second question, which in vain I sought for in
Poinsot's ingenious theory of coupled forces, by pursuing the geometrical
way.  The indications regarding complexes of forces, given at the end of
the "Additional Notes," involves it.                       I
                                        now take the liberty of presenting
a new paper, intended to give to these   indications the developments they
demand, reserving for another communication a succinct abstract of the
curious properties of complexes of right lines represented by equations of
the second degree, and the simple analytical way of deriving them.

  three of which are taken amongst (9), three amongst (10) — and expand
  these equations in the analytical way, starting either from the consideration
  of ordinary     or rotatory forces.       The interpretation of these equations
  immediately gives the following two theorems. In the case of equilibrium —
     I. The centre of gravity of the points acted upon by the forces coincides
 with the centre      of gravity of the second points, by meant of which the
forces   are  determined (No. 1).
     II. The central plane of the planes acted upon by the rotatory forces
 coincides with the central plane of the second planes, by means of which
  the rotatory forces are determined (No. 2)*.
     If we introduce the notion of masses, both theorems hold good, only the
 definition of both kinds of forces and therefore their unity is changed. The
 points acted upon become centres of gravity corresponding to masses ; the
 planes acted upon, central planes corresponding to moments of inertia.
     If equilibrium does not exist, we get, in the general case, one resulting
 force, determined by the two centres of gravity, and one resulting rotatory
 force determined by the two central planes.               We easily obtain the six
 differential equations of the movement produced.
     I shall think it suitable further to develope the principles merely indi
 cated in the paper presented.         A Treatise on Mechanics, reconstructed ou
 them, will assume quite a new aspect.
     4. In making' use, within a plane, of point- or line-coordinates, we repre
 sent, by means of an equation between the two coordinates, a plane curve
 described by a point, or enveloped by a right line.                In making use, in
 space,  of point- or plane-coordinates, by       means  of an equation between the
 three coordinates, a      surface is represented which may be regarded as a

introduced the right line, depending on four constants, as the element of
space.  An equation between these constants, if regarded as variables, re
presents a complex of lines. Each line of the complex maybe regarded either
as a ray described by a point, or as an axis enveloped by planes. In order
to render the developments symmetrical, I adopted as coordinates of the
right line the     same expressions (1) and (4) (connected by an equation of
condition)     made use of in the determination of ordinary and rotatory forces.
At the same time, general equations between the six coordinates were re
placed by homogeneous ones.   In doing so, A, B, C, D, E, F denoting any

a complex of rays as well as a complex of axes.
   When general equations between the same six coordinates are admitted,
the complex of rays becomes a complex of ordinary forces, the complex of
axes a complex of rotations or rotatory forces, both ordinary and rotatory
forces depending upon five constants.     Here we meet a reciprocity be
tween both kind of forces corresponding to the reciprocity between point
and plane.
     Finally, in omitting the equation of condition hitherto                   made use of, we
pass from forces to dynames, depending upon the six independent constants
                               X,      Y,       Z,   L,     M,    N,                      (14)

A complex of dynames           is   represented by an equation between six variables.
Here again, as in the case of right lines, the same complex may be repre
sented in  double way by means of the two sets of coordinates.

locus of the second points, by means of which the forces of the complex are
determined.      Hence in      linear complex there are acting on each point of
                                        a
space   forces in all directions,  the intensity of each force being the segment on
its direction between the point acted upon and its corresponding plane (16).
    Hence we derive the following theorem —                  :
     In   a   complex of rotatory forces any given plane of space     acted upon         is
by   an infinite number     of forces, each line within the plane being an axis of
rotation.          The rotations round all            axes   are determined         by second planes
passing through               a   fixed point,    the position of which            depends upon the
given point.

or rotatory, may be developed in   similar way.   a

these denominations,   the following results are immediately obtained.
     Ina linear congruency of ordinary or rotatory forces, the directions of all
ordinary, or the axes of all rotatory forces, constitute     linear complex of a
lines.   All ordinary forces acting on any given point of space are confined
within the             the intensity of each force
                   same plane       ;               equal to the distance is
between the point acted upon and the point where its direction meets                                      a
fixed line within the mentioned plane.    The axes of all rotatory forces,
acting upon any given plane of space, meet in      fixed point within that
                                                                      a

                         is

the second planes of all forces turn when their axes turn round the fixed
point in the given plane acted upon.
   In    double congruency of ordinary forces there
          a                                           one force of given   is
direction and intensity acting upon any point of space, as there    in                          is        a
double congruency of rotatory forces one force acting upon any given plane.

fold congruency of rotatory forces the axes of all forces constitute one of
the two generations of hyperboloid. a
   These few indications may be sufficient here but before concluding;                                    I
must, in referring to the original paper, make last remark.    Forces acting
                                                                 a

          a          line may  either be regarded as the same, whatever may
be the point        of the line
                         acted upon, or they may be regarded as varying in
intensity according  to the  position of the point. There    an analogous           is
distinction to be made with regard to rotatory forces.    Accordingly two
different kinds of complexes must be distinguished.

IV. " Contributions       to Terrestrial Magnetism. — No. X." By Lieut.-
        General Edward Sabine, R.A., President of the Royal Society.
        Received June 7, 1866.
                                    (Abstract.)
    In this number of   the Contributions   to Terrestrial Magnetism the author
resumes the discussion      of the results obtained  in the Magnetic Survey of
the Southern Ocean by the Expedition under Sir James Clark Ross, R.N.,
and Captain Francis Rawdon Crozier, R.N., between the years 1839 and
  1843.   The proceedings during the two first years of this Survey have
been the subjects of two preceding numbers of the Contributions, viz. of
 Nos. V. and VI., in the Philosophical Transactions for 1843 and 1844.
 The present number contains a similarly detailed exposition of the
 operations of the third year of the Survey, comprehending the Southern
 Atlantic between Cape Horn and the Cape of Good Hope, and completing
 the circumnavigation of the southern hemisphere, from the departure of
 the expedition from the Cape of Good Hope in March 1840, to the return
 to the same station in April 1843.        In a subsequent memoir, which will
he presented    to the Royal Society early in the ensuing Session, the author
 proposes   to connect and thoroughly coordinate the three portions of the
 Survey, and to supply from them the numerical data at equidistant points
 on each of the three parallels of 50°, 60°, and 70° of south latitude, of
 the three magnetic elements,     which will be required for a revision of the
   AJlgemeine Theorie des Erdmagnetismus' of M. Gauss — the 40th parallel
 '
 having been the most southern available at the epoch of the publication of
 the original  work.
    The instruments employed in this Survey, as well as the methods of
 employing them, and of eliminating the disturbing influence of the iron in
 the equipment of the vessels, having been in a great measure of a novel
 character, a discussion of considerable length bearing on all such points is
 prefixed to a full detail of the observations themselves, arranged in Tables,
 showing in every instance both the immediate results of the observations,
 and the corrections which have been applied in conformity with the prin
 ciples contained in the preliminary discussion.      Tabular abstracts are also
 furnished, exhibiting the results of the determinations of each day, with the
  appropriate geographical positions.

  an ethylene, but containing          O C„ H3 and O H in place of hydrogen.              Some
  of  the reasons for assigning these formulae were given in the communica
  tion made to the Bath Meeting.
      The relationship between rosaniline and rosolic acid is very well brought
 out by the facts which will presently be brought forward.
     Griess has shown that aniline and nitrous acid yield water and diazobenzol:             —
                      Aniline.                          Diazobenzol.
                   C0H5NHa +          HNOa        =       CCH4NS + 2HaO.
     Diazobenzol is a      most remarkable compound, forming salts which              are  very
 explosive, and which undergo certain very interesting transformations under
 the influence of reagents.           It is moreover the representative of a nume
 rous class of compounds derived similarly by the action of nitrous acid on
 different bases, and for the most part resembling itself in the explosive
 character of the salts.          One of the most remarkable reactions presented by
 diazobenzol is that with water, wherein the whole of the nitrogen of the
 diazobenzol is evolved, and its place supplied by an atom of water : —
      Nitrate of diazobenzol.                       Carbolic acid.
       C„H1N2nN03                 + H20        =       C8H0O       + HN03 + N2.
     This elegant     form    of  reaction appears     to  be characteristic of the class to
which diazobenzol belongs ; and Griess has resorted to a measurement of
the quantity of nitrogen set free during the reaction, as a means of arriving
at the composition of the azo-compounds.
     Hofmann showed, some years ago, that rosaniline, after treatment with
nitrous acid, is capable of forming a platinum compound endowed with ex
plosive properties, but appears not to have followed the investigation further.
     Paraf has recently shown that rosaniline salts              are  converted by nitrous
acid into a dye,         which he considered to be rosolic acid.               We have also
investigated the action of nitrous acid on rosaniline, and arrive at the fol
lowing results : —

18GG.]                       Rosaniline   to  Rosolic Acid.                     211
    When    an acid solution    of a salt of rosaniline is mixed with nitrous acid,
it forms an azo-compound, which corresponds very closely in character to
diazobenzol. Like diazobenzol this compound forms explosive salts ; like
diazobenzol it decomposes with evolution of nitrogen gas when it is boiled
with acids. In adding the nitrous acid to the solution of rosaniline to
form the compound, it is easy to observe the exact point at which the so
lution    ceases  to contain unaltered rosaniline.         It  thus becomes easy to
determine the amount of nitrous acid consumed in the conversion of a given
weight of rosaniline into the azo-compound.              We have done this by the
employment       of   a  method   which   gives  excellent   results when applied to
aniline and toluidine, and the details of which will shortly be published by
one of us. "We obtain as the result of our experiments, that one molecule
of rosaniline consumes three equivalents of nitrous acid ; and the equation
representing the reaction will be
              Rosaniline.                    Azo-compound.
             CMH18N3+3HNOa                =    CMH10Na        +     6H,0.
    On boiling   this azo-compound with hydrochloric acid, there is evolution
 of nitrogen   gas.     The volume of nitrogen was measured. The result was
 that one molecule of rosaniline, after conversion into the azo-compound,
 yields six equivalents of nitrogen.
                  Azo-compound.
                     C30HUN„ + 3II3O=CMH10O3                    + N,.
    These changes in composition are accompanied by striking physical
 effects.   The deep-red solution of the salt of rosaniline becomes brown
 on the addition of excess of hydrochloric acid, then yellow as the nitrous
 acid is added; then there is much froth, and as the solution is boiled it
 gradually becomes red yellow, and a large quantity of a deep-coloured solid
 with cantharides-like lustre      separates  out.
    Seeing that this solid is produced by treating rosaniline with three equi
 valents of nitrous acid, and that six equivalents of nitrogen are evolved, it
 must be a non-nitrogenous substance. A careful comparison of its pro
 perties and reactions with those of the rosolic acid described by Kolbe
 and Schmitt, and now made largely as an article of commerce, leads to the
 conclusion that it is identical with rosolic acid.
    The following characters are common to it and to the rosolic acid of
 Kolbe and Schmitt.
     1. A yellowish-red      solid with cantharides-like lustre, only sparingly
 soluble in water, soluble in ether and alcohol.
     2. Easily soluble in ammonia, and in alkalies generally, forming red
 solutions of very great colouring-power.          Addition of acids to these solu
 tions decolorizes them, precipitating the colouring-matter in the form of a
 yellowish precipitate, which varies much in tint.
    3. When boiled with aniline and a little benzoic acid, it forms a blue
  dye, there being no evolution of ammonia.            The blue dye is very soluble

   Thus rosolic acid appears as an ethyl-hydride,             and its generation in the
 Griess process       applied to rosaniline is obvious.      To the formula
 which is    derived from rosaniline by the straightforward           action of nitrous
 acid and    water, we have to add Ha O, and we get

       Dhurmsalla Meteoric Stone."            By the llev. Samuel Haughton,
       M.D., F.R.S., Fellow of Trinity College, Dublin. Received June
       6, 1866.
    On the 14th     July 1860, at 2.15 p.m., a remarkable         meteoric stone fell
at Dhurmsalla,     in the Punjab ; a small specimen of which was forwarded
to the Geological Museum of Trinity College, which             I have analyzed with
the results contained in the following paper.
   The direction of the motion of      the meteorite was ascertained to be from
N.N.W. to S.S.E.
   The cold of the fragments that fell was so intense as to benumb the
hands of the coolies who picked them up but who were obliged, in conse
quence of their coldness, instantly to drop them.
   The specific gravity of the Trinity College specimen was found as
follows   : —
          Weight in air                                           3335-4 grs.

   The    stone is grey, close-grained, and splintery      in fracture, and presents
fewer specks of metallic iron and magnetic pyrites than usual, and was
coated with the ordinary black pellicle on its outer side.
    From 100 grs. acted on with iodine, which dissolved the alloy of iron
and nickel, there were obtained, of peroxide of iron 9-85 grs., and of
protoxide of nickel T96 gr.
    The portion insoluble in iodine was next acted on by dilute muriatic
acid and evaporated to dryness at 212°, then moistened with muriatic
acid and filtered,     by which process it was divided into a soluble and
insoluble portion ; the portion left on the filter was boiled with carbonate
of soda, so as to dissolve the free silica, which was found to be 18- 95 grs.
This   was added to the portion     originally soluble in muriatic acid,      so as to
give the following results    :—

niacal   solution of sulphate of copper, so as to form a black precipitate of
sulphuret of copper, there were found by the usual methods 14-8 grs. of
Bolphate   of barytes.
   There were    left, after treatment with iodiue, muriatic acid, and carbonate
of soda, 38-3 grs. of the 100 grs. originally acted upon.

III. " On       the Preparation of Ethylamine."              By  J. Alfred     Wanklyn,
         and   Ernest     T. Chapman.            Communicated by        Dr. Frankland.
         Received    June 8, 1866.
     Having recently had occasion to prepare                a considerable      quantity of
ethylamine, we have made the observation that this base may be obtained
with much greater facility than is usually believed.
     "We digested together equal volumes of iodide of ethyl, strong alcohol,
and aqueous ammonia.              The digestion was carried on at a very moderate
temperature, certainly not exceeding 80°, but the tubes were constantly
agitated.       In this manner the reaction is completed in about half an hour.
The mixed iodides thus obtained were evaporated to expel excess of am
monia, introduced into a retort ; enough potash was added to neutralize
of the iodine present, and the mixture was distilled into dilute hydrochloric
acid.       The receiver    was then changed, the same          quantity of potash again
added,       and the products collected as before.             Then six times as much
potash was added, and the products collected.                  The remaining two-tenths
of the potash were added separately.
     Portions of each of these fractions were converted into platinum salts,
and the amount of platinum was determined by ignition.                     Each of the first
four fractions corresponding to -fo of the total bases obtained, gave more
platinum than corresponds even to pure ethylamine, and therefore con
tained ethylamine and ammonia.                  Only, the last fraction, corresponding to
 -j1^  of  the  entire  bases,   gave   a  lower   percentage of platinum than corre
 sponds to ethylamine, and therefore contained the di- and tri-bases.
      Subjoined are the platinum determinations in this last fraction : —

From which it will be seen that even the last tenth of the bases did not
contain much di- and tri-bases.
     The former          gave, as aforesaid, rather more platinum than ethylamine
salt yields, and therefore contained ammonia.
     In order to make out whether there          was any   di- and tri-base along with
the ethylamine         in these former fractions, we      took No. 3 (corresponding
to         and made a platinum-fractionation as follows : —
     No. 3 gave 40-62 and 40-13 percent, of platinum.                 No. 3, after some
pure chloride of ammonium had crystallized out (the crystals were analyzed
and    proved to be quite pure chloride of ammonium), was converted into a
platinum-salt, and that platinum-salt fractionated so as to leave the portion
 richest in the high bases.          This salt, which would be rich in the di- and
 tri-bases    if any  had been present in No. 3, gave this result       : —
          -7666 grm. gave -3090 grm. of platinum = Pt per cent. 40-03.
 From which       it is manifest that di- and tri-bases were absent.
     From the foregoing we concluded that all the higher bases were concen
 trated in the last fraction, but that ammonia passed over during the whole
 distillation.     The objection might therefore       be made that mixtures     of am
 monia and di-         and   tri-ethylamines would give the same numbers8             Iu
 order to deprive this objection         of its force we made the following experi
ments.       Iodide of ethyl, alcohol, and ammonia       were digested as before, and
 the   mixed iodides so obtained distilled        from excess of potash, the vapour
 thus obtained absorbed by dilute sulphuric           acid, care being taken that the
 acid was     not in excess.       The fluid so obtained was rendered very slightly
 acid   with the same acid, and then evaporated on the water-bath.                  The
 semisolid residue was treated with strong alcohol, and allowed to stand one
 night.      It  was then filtered, the filtrate measured,     and the amount    of sul
 phuric acid determined in a measured portion.               Enough K H O was then
  added to    the alcoholic liquid to liberate    ^  of the bases present. The pot
  ash was     added in solution in water.         The liquid was then distilled, the
  distillate   being received in dilute hydrochloric acid.            A portion of this
  liquid was then evaporated to dryness and placed over sulphuric acid. Its
  percentage of chlorine was then determined :
                             '3826 of salt gave -6696 Ag CI      ;
                            V   43-29 per cent. CI.    Theory 43-55.
   From these numbers         it is obvious that the substance must     have been pure
   ethylamine.      It could have contained     no  ammonia,   or  at most only minute
   traces, and therefore the above objection is completely disposed of.
      A portion of this pure hydrochlorate of ethylamine was then treated
   with aqueous ammonia in insufficient         quantity to combine with the whole
   of the hydrochloric         acid present.    We distilled this liquid into dilute
   hydrochloric    acid, evaporated it to dryness, and determined the amount of
   chlorine present in the residue.        The result was : —

    From    these numbers      it appears that ammonia     is capable of partially ex
pelling ethylamine from its compounds, and thus we have an explanation
of the apparent anomaly of the appearance of ammonia with the ethylamine
in the above-described experiments.            It appears therefore that pure ethyl
amine may be readily obtained in the following manner.                 Equal volumes
of iodide of ethyl, strong alcohol and ammonia are to be digested together
for about half an hour, at         a temperature somewhat below that of boiling
water, with       continual   shaking ; the product of this operation boiled to
expel excess of ammonia, and then distilled from potash — the distillate
being received into dilute sulphuric acid, the ammonia separated by means
of alcohol, and the alcoholic solution of the mixed sulphates treated with
sufficient potash to liberate about -fo of the bases present. On distilling
this mixture, pure ethylamine, accompanied with alcohol and water, are
the sole products found in the distillate.

     From the     above the following               conclusion               is   drawn — namely, that just as
it may be said that the specific gravity of an alloy approximately equal                    is
to the mean specific gravities of the component metals, so also from the
foregoing we may deduce that the volume which an alloy will occupy at
any temperature between 0° and 100° us approximately equal to the mean of
the volumes of the component metals at the same temperature, or, in other
words, the cubical or linear coefficients of expansion  heat of an alloy                         by
between 0° and 100° are approximately equal to the mean of the cubical
or linear coefficients         of expansion               by     heat        of the        component    metals.

     It        that a thin film of caoutchouc, such as is furnished by var
          appears
nished silk or the transparent little balloons of india-rubber, has no poro
sity, and is really impervious to air as gas. But the same film is capable of
liquefying      the individual   of which air is composed, while oxygen and
                                    gases
nitrogen, in the liquid form, are capable of penetrating the substance of the
membrane    (as ether or naphtha do), and may again evaporate into a

more interesting  from   the fact that  the gases are unequally absorbed and
condensed by rubber, oxygen        times more abundantly than nitrogen, and
that they penetrate  the rubber in  the same proportion.   Hence the rubber-
film may        be used as a dialytic       sieve for atmospheric air, and allows very
constantly      41*6 per cent,
                           of oxygen to pass through, instead of the 21 per
cent, usually present in air.  The septum keeps back, in fact, one-half of
the nitrogen, and allows the other half to pass through with all the oxygen.
This dialysed air rekindles wood burning without   flame, and      in fact,             is,
exactly  intermediate between air and pure oxygen gas  in relation to com
bustion.
   One side of the rubber-film must be freely exposed to the atmosphere,
and the other side be under the influence of   vacuum at the same time.

reduced    ;   but foil of fused palladium, for which     I am indebted to Mr. G.
Matthey, still absorbed 63 volumes of gas.            A certain degree of porosity
may be admitted to exist in these metals, and to the greatest extent in
their hammered condition.           It is believed that such metallic pores, and
indeed all fine pores, are more accessible to liquids than to gases, and in
particular to liquid hydrogen.         Hence a peculiar dialytic action may reside
in certain metallic septa, like a plate of platinum, enabling them to sepa
rate hydrogen from other gases.
    In the form of sponge, platinum            absorbed 1"48 times its volume of
hydrogen and palladium 90 volumes.              The former of these metals, in the
peculiar condition of platinum-black, is already known to take up several
hundred volumes of the same gas.             The assumed liquefaction of hydrogen
in such circumstances appears to be the primary condition of its oxidation
at a low temperature.         A repellent property possessed by gaseous mole
cules appears to resist chemical combination,         as well as to establish a limit
to their power to enter the minuter pores of solid bodies.
    Carbonic oxide is taken up more largely than hydrogen by soft iron.
Such an occlusion of carbonic oxide by iron, at a low red heat, appears to
be the first and a necessary        step   in the process of acieration.     The gas
appears      to abandon half its carbon to the iron, when the temperature is
 afterwards raised to     a considerably higher degree.
    Silver has a similar relation to oxygen, of which metal the sponge, fritted
but not fused, was found to hold in one case so much as 7'49 volumes of
 oxygen.       A plate or wire of the fused metal retains the same property, but
much reduced in intensity, as with plates of fused platinum and palladium
in their relation to hydrogen.

        Hydatids, with some Observations on the Anatomy of the
        Adult Worm." By Edward Nettleship, Mem. Royal Agric.
        Coll.     Communicated by T. Spencer Cobbold, M.D.                        Re
        ceived May 24, 1866.
    On March 28th, 1866,          I  obtained from Clare Market the liver and
lungs of a sheep containing numerous Echinococcus hydatids ; in some
 the outer cyst was partly calcified, but all the hydatids contained clear
fluid, and great numbers of scolices attached to the endocyst. Within two
hours of the death of the sheep to which the organs belonged, I gave two
or three of the smaller hydatids to a young dog, about six months old ;
first puncturing the hydatid and administering the collapsed cyst, and then
making him drink the fluid of the cyst, in which some Echinococci were
floating.
    The next day I gave him a second feeding of the remaining hydatids ;
this second batch he threw up within half an hour of the feeding.'.but he
afterwards swallowed the broken membranes again, and did not afterwards

 Tomit.      I was careful to administer the hydatids         from both calcined and
 non-calcified    cysts.
     The animal remained perfectly healthy, and became very much fatter ;
he was fed for the most part on cooked kitchen refuse, but                  I cannot be
 positive   that he  never   obtained any raw food.
     On May 15th (the forty-seventh             day after the first feeding) I     killed
the    animal,  and  examined the intestines.        In the first ten inches of    bowel
 below the pylorus there were no Taeniae ; at that distance a single              Tcenia
 echinococcus appeared, moving actively ; for the next two or three               inches
there were none, but at about fourteen inches below the pylorus several
more appeared, and immediately after this they became so numerous as to
present almost the appearance of distended lacteals ; this continued for
 about a foot in extent, and then they gradually became less numerous,
 and ceased at about three feet from the pyloric orifice.
     There were also four specimens of T. marginata, varying from two to
 three feet in length, and two of T. cucumerina.
     The part of the intestine containing T. echinococcus was immediately
 put into dilute carbolic acid, and the worms not examined until two days
 subsequently ; after that interval they were still tolerably adherent to the
 mucous membrane, though a good many had fallen off. On detaching
 them with needles, or examining those which had fallen off, nearly all were
 found to be quite destitute of hooks ; but one (from which the outline
sketch, Plate VIII. fig. 1, was taken) had a tolerably complete double row ;
in this specimen, however, the hooks and proboscis were inverted, while in
most specimens the latter part was protruded.
     In fig. 2 is a single hook of T. echinococcus, probably from the pos
terior circlet, magnified more highly.
     Fig. 3 shows at o, a hook of the posterior circlet, and at 6, one from
the anterior circlet of an Echinococcus-scolex            from an ox.      There seems
very little difference      between    corresponding     hooks of the scolex and of
the adult tapeworm, unless the latter be rather stouter and have                  larger
processes.
     On      th of a square inch, where the worms were thickest,              I counted
twenty-five     of them   ; by   calculation   there were    about   twenty-two square
inches of intestine covered in this way, allowing for the more thinly scat
tered parts at each         end   of the infected part ; this gives a total of 8800
specimens of T. echinococcus in this dog's bowel.
     I have examined carefully numerous specimens of these worms with
the microscope, with especial reference to the arrangement of the sexual
organs ; the great majority are sexually mature, and contain a greater or
less number of eggs.          It is not easy to make out accurately the arrange
ment and connexions of the ovary, yelk-forming glands, and uterus, as
described by Leuckart*, but fig. 4 gives a tolerably correct representation,
in the 3rd (immature) segment.

     At a is the vagina, continued as an indistinct tube to 6, which           I suppose
 to be the seminal vesicle ; immediately beyond this is a dark mass (o) con
 taining spherical, highly refractive bodies ; this is the ovary.             On either
 side and in front of this are the yelk-forming             glands (e), two somewhat
 indefinite    lobular organs apparently communicating with the vagina in

 into the uterus (it, fig. 5), but       I  think that the hinder part continues
 tubular, and probably constitutes the " wide cavity

 to uterus, described by Leuckart.           In fig. 5 there is some appearance of
 this tube continued      backwards   from   u (a, fig. 5), but I cannot follow it to
 any communication with the vagina (ira.). The same is true in this specimen
 of the ovary (pv.)   and seminal pouch (s. p.). The vitelligene glands (e, fig. 4)
 have disappeared in fig. 5, and the ovary has become less distinct, but the
 seminal pouch has developed somewhat, while in fig. 6, taken from a
 sexually mature segment, the latter organ is still plainer ; the canal of the
vagina has elongated, and shows besides the seminal pouch a smaller dila
tation (a, fig. 6) nearer the orifice.           In none of the mature segments
have    I  been  able to make   out  any   communication      between the vagina and
uterus, either in front of or behind the seminal pouch.

    The importance of this creature in its pathological relations, and the
desideratum of more information as to its anatomy, have induced me to
place the foregoing facts on record.            In conducting the investigation I
have taken every precaution to prevent the escape and distribution                of the

       June 21, 1866.
                                      (Abstract.)
    In this paper the author has communicated the details of observations
of which the principal results      were stated in a short paper published        in the

 1866.]       Dr. W. H. Ransom on         the Ovum    of Osseous Fishes.         227
 Proceedings of the Royal Society in 1854, and of further researches on the
structure and properties of the egg in several species of osseous fishes.
The methods employed in determining the functions of the micropyle,
and in conducting the various inquiries entered upon are described.              The
development of the ovarian ovum is traced in two species of Gatterosteus,
and the yelk-sac is shown to increase by interstitial growth, and not by
apposition of layers on either surface. A minute description of the ger
minal    vesicle and its contents is given, and the germinal spots are shown to
be drops    of   a thick fluid substance,   so apt to change their normally round
form,   and to vacuolate in their interior, that no perfectly indifferent medium
was found in which to examine them. The primitive yelk first formed
around the germinal vesicle is shown to differ in some of its chemical and
physical properties from that of the ripe ovum ; it is solid, and does not
consist of two distinguishable portions.         On its surface a yelk-sac was found
in very early ova, but in the smallest eggs examined it could not be sepa
rated.
    The reactions of    a variety  of albumen allied to myosin, which the author
has found in variable proportions in the yelk of all the fishes, amphibia,
and birds which he has examined, are described, the yelk of the salmon
being selected for experiment. This substance, to which the name albumen
C. is given provisionally,     is remarkable, in addition to its being easily pre-
cipitable by water in excess, for forming under certain conditions a solution
in dilute nitric acid not coagulable by boiling.
    Some account is rendered of the reactions of an acid compound of phos
phoric acid with      an organic substance also met with in the yelk       of various
animals.
    The phenomena which follow impregnation prior to the commencement
of   cleavage   are described, and are shown to be chiefly due to the influence
upon the yelk of water which has passed through the yelk-sac.
    Some variations which occur in this respect in different species of
osseous fishes are described, and the ova of Gasterosteus are shown to be
remarkable in having a viscid mucoid covering derived from the oviduct,
which prevents the imbibition of water through the yelk-sac, so that it
only then enters and forms a breathing-chamber after impregnation, when
it passes through the aperture in the apex of the micropyle ; whereas in
the eggs of salmon and in those of most other fishes, unimpregnated ova
rapidly absorb water by the whole surface of the yelk-sac, the yelk con
 tracting at the same time to form the breathing-chamber.
    The concentration of the formative yelk, originally forming a thin layer
 over the whole yelk-ball, at the germinal pole is also proved to be due to
 the action    of water, of which it requires a free supply sufficient to distend
 the yelk-sac, and to be independent        of fecundation.
    The contractions of the yelk are shown to be also independent of the
 action of the spermatozoids, and to be reactions following the entrance of
 water into the breathing-chamber       ;  and this not only as regards the rhythmia

tractility of the formative yelk, by virtue of which it cleaves into irregular
and unsymmetrical masses, and which the author conceives to be regu
lated only by the influence of the seminal particles.
   The cortical layer of the food-yelk or inner sac, which is shown to resist
in a remarkable manner osmosis, is found to be the rhythmically contractile
part, although requiring for its manifestation                         the presence           of acid food-
yelk upon its inner surface.
   Evidence is given to show that the contractile property of the yelk of
both kinds requires, as an essential condition of its manifestation, the pre
sence of oxygen in the surrounding medium, and that the food-yelk, while
the rhythmic waves are passing over                   it,
                                         consumes less than does the forma

  Proofs are also given that    certain moderate rise of temperature in
                                              a
creases the activity of these contractions.   Experiments are related which
show the extreme limits the yelk will bear without destroying them, and the
temperature at which commencing chemical change prevents further con
traction.
   The reactions of the substance of the yelk under the stimulus of gal
vanism are recorded, and evidence afforded that the food-yelk and the
cortical layer alone are excited to contraction       attempts made to in  by   it,
duce fissile or other contractions of the formative yelk resulting in elec
trolysis of that highly unstable substance.

stances on the contractions of the yelk are recorded, and the general fact

IX. "Variations            in Human      Myology observed during the Winter
          Session     of 1865-66      at King's College, London."                By John
          Wood, P.R.C.S., Demonstrator of Anatomy.                  Communicated by
          Dr. Sharpey.         Received May 3, 1866.
     In the present paper       are given the results   of observations,    made with the
 greatest possible accuracy and care, of the muscular anatomy of thirty-four
 subjects, chiefly of the male sex, with an especial view to the study of the
 combinations         of these abnormalities, and the directions in which they
 chiefly tend.         To enable the reader more readily to comprehend these re
 sults, the author has tabulated them in the sheet appended to the paper.
 In the Table the names of the muscles placed at the head of each column
 refer to those in which more than one variety has been observed in the
 session.        They will be found to correspond very closely with those given
 in the former papers by the author.             In columns 4, 21, and 27 are placed
  those     of which only    one example has been met       with.    Some     of these, how
  ever, are      of much importance.
      To explain the nature of the abnormality more precisely than could be
  done in the Table, a word or two will be necessary on such of the specimens
  as   may be considered novel or typical.
       Four columns are occupied by variations of the head and neck, the ex
                                                                                some of the
   amples of which amount in the aggregate to twenty-two
                                                                            ;
   muscles in these may, however, strictly           be  considered    as  muscles      also of
   the upper extremity, especially those in col. 3, which I have denominated
   cleido-occipital.
       Col.    1 . Platysina myoides. —The first of the two varieties noted (in
   subject 20) was connected with the inner side of the lower end of
                                                                                     the nor
   mal muscle, the fibres passing in a broad band downwards                    and inwards,
    over the origin of the       sterno-cleido-mastoid,   the  clavicle,  and   upper fibres
    of the pectoralis major to be inserted into the fascia covering the sternum
    as  far down as the third costal cartilage.
        The second (subject 29) was connected internally with the sternal fascia
    between the second and third costal cartilages, and crossing obliquely out
    wards and downwards over the lower fibres of the pectoralis major and
                                                                                    dorsi, ex
    axillary cavity, became attached to the tendon of the latissimus
     actly   as we find its homologue, the panniculus carnosus, to do in the lower
     animals.       This variety of the Platysma     does not appear to have been pre
     viously recorded.

  sated with its fellow on the opposite side,          and each became      attached to a
  part of the digastric fossa on the opposite half of the mandible, as given in
  the author's first paper, and described by Henle and other anatomists.
      3. Cleido-occipital. —The author has ventured to bestow this name upon
  a muscle which proved, when looked after, to be so common that not less
  than eleven specimens were found out of the thirty-four subjects.                 It will
  be best understood by reference          to fig. 7 a, in the subject of which it was
  found in conjunction with a sternoclavicular muscle.                 It is placed along
  the hinder border of the sterno-cleido-mastoideus, usually separated, how
  ever, by a distinct areolar interval from both the sternal and clavicular
  fibres of this muscle.          It is attached below to the junction of the inner
  and middle thirds of the upper border of the clavicle, and above to the
  superior curved line of the occipital bone, close to the origin of the trapezius
  muscle.       It is described by Meckel (Handbuch der mensch. Anatomie,
  1816, p. 474) as an accessory to the sterno-cleido-mastoid sometimes met
  with.     It  may be considered       as a lateral extension and separation of part
  of the clavicular fibres of the sterno-cleido-mastoid,           which, in the normal
  arrangement, are crossed          and entirely covered at the upper part by the
  sternal portion, and do not extend at their insertion beyond the mastoid
  portion of the temporal bone. The author has found that in the Guinea-
 pig and some other Rodents it constitutes a separate muscle, entirely distinct
 from the sterno-mastoid, carrying with it the whole of the clavicular fibres
 of the sterno-cleido-mastoideus.            In the Dog and Cat, and probably in the
 other Carnivora, it forms part of the long muscle, the cephalo-humeral.
 In    these    animals the cleido-mastoid         is a distinct  muscle, joining with
 the cephalo-humeral at the rudimentary clavicle. In the Hedgehog, on the
 other hand, the cleido-mastoid is blended with the sterno-mastoid, while the
 cleido-occipital is placed as a distinct muscle behind it.             In the Apes and
 Monkeys       it is  always   present,  but continuous   with the  hinder  border of the
 true   sterno-cleido-mastoid,      with a more or less distinct intermuscular space*.
 The above peculiarities of its comparative anatomy, and the fact of its separate
 attachment to the occipital bone, instead of the mastoid portion of the tem
 poral bone, have induced the author to propose the name here given to it.
     4. Of the single specimens in this column the levator claviculce was in
 most respects the counterpart to that given in the author's last paper ;
but it was found only on the left side, arising from the three upper cervical
 transverse processes in front of the levator anguli scapulae, and inserted
into the outer half of the clavicle, behind the anterior fibres of the trape
zius.      On the opposite side it was not found, but a very distinct cleido-
occipital was present. This again was not found on the left side, but
appeared to supply the place of the levator claviculce. The costo-fascialis
cervicalis, of subject 28, was in every respect like those described in the
    * Meckel    describes, in the Marmot, the Squirrel, and some other Rodents, and in
some Marsupials, two cleido-mastoids,      of which the hinder corresponds entirely to the
muscle here called cleido-occipiial (Anatomie Compar. 1829-30, vol. vi. p. 163).

1866.]       .   Mr.   J. Wood on Variations in Human Myology.                     231
author's two last papers. The sternalis brutorum was a small development
on the right side only, reaching from the third to the sixth costal cartilage.
The rest of the muscles in this column scarcely need a more extended de
scription than      is there found.
    No less than seventeen out of the twenty-seven columns denoting the
different kinds of variety are occupied by those of the arm, of which there
are seventy-one examples.
     5. Epigastric slips of the pectoralis major presented various degrees of
development of the so-called chondro-epitrochlear muscle of the Apes and
Monkeys, but reaching only as far as the insertion of the rest of that
muscle into the bicipital ridge, and terminating distinctly from it. None
of them were so complete in their development as those described in the
author's first paper. One specimen is seen in fig. 1 a, in significant com
bination with the ape-like variation placed in the next column.
     6. The developments of the pectoralis minor given in this column are
such as may easily be overlooked, but when closely sought for, as in the
last session, have yielded no less than five specimens out of thirty-four
 subjects.     The variety consists in the prolongation of the tendon of inser
 tion as a flat tendinous slip, sometimes connected with a large portion of
 the muscular fibres, over the upper surface of the coracoid process, which
 is grooved distinctly for its reception.         This tendon then joins that of the
 svpraspinatus       muscle,  and blending    with  it and the capsular ligament, is
 implanted into the upper facet of the greater tuberosity of the humerus
 (see fig.   1
               b).    In   the subject of the sketch (a female) another tendinous
 slip was directed upwards and outwards, and lost upon the coraco-acromial
 ligament.      The insertion of the pectoralis minor into the shoulder-joint cap
 sule is mentioned by Meckel           (o/>. cit. p. 467), giving    Gantzer as his au
 thority*.      This prolongation of the tendon to the humerus reaches to a
  greater extent in the Monkeys in proportion to the diminution in size of the
  coracoid process.       In the Carnivora it is entirely inserted into the greater
  tuberosity, and blends more or less intimately with the pectoralis major.
  In subject 22 the upward direction of the insertion of the pectoralis minor
  becomes    more marked as an insertion of the upper muscular fibres into the
  costo-coracoid membrane and the clavicle itself. The origin of the muscle
  was in this case higher than usual, reaching to the first intercostal aponeurosis.
  This upward development of the pectoralis minor is an approximation to the
  condition of its insertion in the Rodents, and, as the author believes, is a for
  mation identical with the sternoclavicular          muscle, and found in subject 27,
  column    21  (fig. 7).
      7. In this column       are given two opposite        tendencies of development
  of the latissimus        dorsi.    Of   the first are those not uncommon slips
  of communication        between  this muscle and the insertion of the pectoralis
   major, passing in front of the axillary vessels and nerves (see fig. 1 c),
  described by Meckel, Langer, and Gruber (Achselbogen).                 The author re-
     * De Souza describes a case in which the whole of the pectoralis minor was inserted
  into the capsule of the shouldor-joint (Gazette Me'dicalc, 1865, No. 12).

gards these as imperfect developments of the so-called dorsi-epitrochlear
muscle of the lower animals. None have been found this session extensively
developed, and these only in three subjects, of which the last (No. 32)
was one remarkable for the number of its muscular abnormalities.
   The other varieties        found   were  two   specimens     of  the  remarkable
offset   sent  from    the lalissimus   upwards towards the coracoid process,
which     the author     described  in his paper read two years ago to the
Society, under the name of the chondro-coracoid muscle. It arises with
the upper costal fibres of the latiisimus from the ninth and tenth rib-carti
lages, ascending so as to cross the axillary cavity obliquely outwards.            In
the specimen figured in the author's first series it was inserted with the
pectoralis minor into the tip of the coracoid process. In subject 10 (fig. 2)
it is inserted partly into the lower surface of that process (a), and partly
into the capsular ligament of the shoulder with the tendon of the supra-
spinatus (b).      It will be observed to pass between the trunks of the axillary
plexus, separating the posterior from the lateral cords. The latter and the
vessels are cut to show the muscle.         In subject    28 this  muscle was con
nected with the origin      of the coraco-brachialis, and passed with it to the
tip of the coracoid.       A similar slip of muscle, passing from the 5th, 6th,
and 7th ribs to the muscles connected with the coracoid process, was ob
served by Theile (Jourdans Translation, p. 204).              In all the specimens
the unvarying origin of this curious slip, and its relation to the one
which joins with the insertion of the pectoralis major, and to the chondro-
epitrochlear muscle of the lower animals, show it to be the result of an
upward displacement of the same typical structure, ranging from the in
sertion of the pectoralis major to that of the pectoralis minor.
   8. The increased number of the heads of the biceps in the two subjects
in this column were of the more usual kind described by Meckel and others,
arising from the fibres of the brachialis anticus and from the greater tu
berosity of the humerus.
    9.  In subjects   14 and   17 the brachialis   anticus presented    a continuity
of  a large portion   of its outer fibres of origin into    those  of the supinator
longus, which is not uncommon, although not, as far as the author is aware,
previously noted in the human subject.          It is a very common arrangement
in the Apes and Monkeys, assisting them very materially in climbing and
twisting the body while hanging by the anterior extremities.              In subject
30 there was a brachio-fascialis or quasi-third head of the biceps, similar
to that described in former papers. On the opposite arm was found a
curious fusiform muscle, springing high up from the brachialis anticus, and
connected below with the pronator radii teres towards its insertion.
    10. The Jlexor sublimis digitorum in subjects 5 and 13 gave off on thi
outer side of its coronoid origin a separate slender tendon, which becam
the sole origin of a jirst lumbricalis muscle.         In both, another Jirst lum
bricalis was given off Irom the usual place on the indicial tendon of th
perforans.      In No.   13 also a curious division   of the abnormal lumbricah

  18G6.]        Mr.   J. Wood     on Variations in Human Myology.                   235
  occurred, into two parts, of which the innermost was implanted upon the
  tendon of the perforatus, near its division within the sheath of the index
  finger ; while the outermost joined the normal lumbricalis near its usual
  place of insertion.     Higher up in the arm another muscular slip connected
  the redundant tendon from the sublimit with the indicial tendon of the
 profundus.      In subject 9 was a muscular connexion of the flexor sublimis
  with  the origin of the flexor longus pollicis, like that described in the last
  paper.
     ] 1. The variations of the flexor profundus digitorum in three subjects
  consisted merely in a not uncommon distinct and superficial muscular
  origin from the coronoid process along with the fibres of the sublimis, such
  as is frequently met with in the lower animals.            In subject 8 was found a
  tendon connecting     the  indicial  part  of  the flexor profundus with the tendon
  of the flexor longus pollicis. In subject 20 this arrangement was reversed,
  the tendon going from the flexor pollicis above to the flexor profundus
  below.    This variety is found in the next column.
     12. In addition to the variety just mentioned the flexor pollicis longus
  gives, in subject 2, a tendon to the first lumbricalis on both sides.
     13.  The lumbricales have been found irregular in three other subjects
  besides those just mentioned, in which the first was seen to arise from the
Jlexor sublimis and flexor longus pollicis. In subject 5 the third lumbricalis
  on the right arm was bifurcated, one half going to the ulnar side of the
  middle finger and the other to the radial side of the ring finger.               Both
  sides of the long finger were thus provided with this muscle, an arrangement
  which was repeated in both the hands of the 22nd subject. On the right arm
  of the 32nd subject the whole of the third lumbricalis (see fig. 3 c) was in
  serted into the inner side of the long finger, while the fourth was entirely
  absent. This was also the case with the left arm of subject 5.
     14. The name at the head of this column — flexor carpi radialis brevis
 —I    have applied to a muscle which          is given in fig. 3 a, drawn from sub
 ject 32.    This subject    was>   fr°m the number and character of its varieties,
 the most remarkable of the whole.              In this case the muscle arises from
 the   middle third  of  the  front  surface of   the radius, between the flexor longus
 pollicis above (d) and the pronator quadratus (c) below. Passing under
 the annular ligament as a distiuct rounded tendon, close to the carpal
 bones, inside of and parallel with the sheath of the tendon of the
flexor carpi radialis (f), it is inserted partly into the os magnum, but
 chiefly into the base of the middle metacarpal bone, where it gave attach
 ment to some fibres of the flexor brevis pollicis muscle.            It is evidently a
 flexor of the third metacarpal bone, corresponding to the flexor carpi radi
 alis of the   second   metacarpal.       During the last session a precisely similar
 muscle was described by Dr. Norton, of St. Mary's Hospital, and exhibited
 by him at a meeting of the Zoological Society.              The subject of figure 3 is
further remarkable for a distinct slip of tendon from the flexor carpi ulnaris
(g) to the base of the fourth metacarpal bone (seen at b). In this arm we

236          Mr.   J. Wood       on Variations in Human Myology.                    [June 21,
have, therefore, a flexor for each           of the metacarpal bones, reckoning the
opponens     as one.      But    further   than   this, the outer fibres of the extensor
ossis metacarpi pollicis in the same arm (see fig. 6 c) are separated from
the rest by a cellular interval, and arise partly from the fascia covering the
radial extensors and supinator longus.                They are connected with a distinct
tendon,    which   is implanted      into  the  front   part of the outer border of the
base of the first metacarpal bone.             Traction upon this tendon showed that
its action was rather of the nature of flexion with abduction than of exten
sion. This peculiarity of origin is noticed by Henle (Muskellehre).                         The
arm from      which    figs.  3   and  6  were   taken    is now   in  the    custody    of  the
Curator of the Hunterian Museum.                   In fig. 3 is seen also the abnormal
insertion   of  the  third   lumbricalis     (c), the absence of the fourth, and at h
the first palmar interosseus of the thumb, described by Henle.                        In fig. 6
the   additional   special   extensors    of  the   third and  fourth   fingers   are  given.
    In subjects 13 and 31 were found muscles which are entirely .homologous
with the flexor carpi radialis brevis just described. They had exactly
similar origins, were of the same shape and with like tendons, but were
inserted into the inner side of the base of the second instead of the third
metacarpal bones, one of them passing, with the tendon of the flexor carpi
radialis, through the groove in the trapezium and annular ligament, but
the other going outside of that sheath.
    In subject   6 was   found a large fusiform muscle, having its origin from
the radius outside of that of the flexor longus pollicis, and reaching as high
up as the oblique line below the flexor sublimis.                     Ending in a distinct,
strong, and rounded tendon, it was implanted into that deeper portion of
the annular ligament which separates the groove for the                   flexor carpi radi
alis   tendon,   and with      this into the       trapezoid, magnum, and base of the
middle metacarpal bones.              A muscle precisely similar to this was described
by the author in his last paper (subject 1 ). Its resemblance in appearance,
position, connexions, and influence upon the carpus, have induced him to
class it with the foregoing_/?e.ror         carpi radialis brevis as a variation of the
same type of muscle, the flexor of the middle metacarpal bone.
    15.  The variations of      the  radial extensors found in this column are of two
kinds, which appear to be           closely allied. The first kind mentioned are the
interchanging muscles frequently seen and recorded by anatomists. These,
arising with one of the twin muscles, pass as distinct tendons over to
the other, and become inserted with it.                 Of these, three were found. In
the absence of a name the author has ventured to distinguish this form of
muscle by that of the extensor carpi radialis intermedius.                      Of the other
kind is found only one example. It is the extensor carpi radialis acces-
sorius first recorded, named and described by the author in his former
papers*.       It has been chosen as the subject of fig. 4, taken from the right
arm of subject No. 23, because of its coexistence with the intermediate form
of the radial extensors, which was not the case in any of the specimens
   * This muscle seems to be
                                  present in about the proportion of    1  in 35 subject*.

before found.         It  arises from the condyloid        ridge of the humerus, below
the extensor carpi radialis longior (/), lies between that muscle and the
extensor intermedius (c), which separates it from the extensor carpi radi
alis brevior (d).          It has a distinct tendon of considerable size, which,
crossing that of the longior, goes through the sheath of the extensors of
the metacarpus and first phalanx of the thumb, and divides into two slips,
one to be implanted into the base of the
                                                     first metacarpal, and the other to
give part origin to a double abductor poll ids (A).                       The tendon of the
intermedius (c) can be seen to be implanted upon the second metacarpal
with that of the longior.           In the left arm of the same subject only the
intermediate form was found.              The close relation of these two forms is
well seen in the figure.          The accessorius has an origin somewhat similar to
the intermedius,         while its insertion and connexion with the short abductor
is precisely similar to that often found in the tendon of extensor ossis
metacarpi pollicis, with which the radial extensors have usually so close a
connexion at its origin, as before alluded to in describing the redundancy of
that muscle in subject 32 (fig. 6 c).             If we suppose the germ of an extensor
intermedius to become blended with that of the upper and outer portion of a
double extensor ossis metacarpi pollicis, the result would be the extensor
 accessorius here described * .
      16.  The extensor carpi ulnaris in two subjects              sent, in both arms, ten
 dinous slips to the little finger, which were                 blended     with the common
 extensor aponeurosis (fig. 5 a) . This variety is mentioned by Meckel. Henle
 considers it as homologous with that of the peroneus quinti in the foot.
 In both subjects the arrangement of the slip was strikingly similar
 to   that of the last-named abnormality, but in neither of them was the
peroneus quinti found in the foot.               In the same arms the extensor minimi
 diffiti (6) was found provided with            two  tendons, both inserted, with a slip
 from the common extensor, into the dorsal aponeurosis of the fifth digit (c).
      * On looking    over Meckel's description of the extensor ossis metacarpi pollicis, in
 reference   to this subject, the author finds that he mentions the rare occurrence           of a
 double-bellied long abductor of the thumb, arising from the outer condyle of the hume
 rus,   and inserted into the base of the first phalanx of the thumb (op. cit. Muskellehre,
  p. 517).    This has evidently been the extensor carpi radialis accessorius of the author,
                                                                             brevis, without any
  passing entirely into the outer head of a double abductor pollicis
  insertion into the metacarpal bone, as found in one         of  the specimens figured in the
  author's first series.
     In many of the lower animals,' and occasionally in the human subject (Henle), the
  radial extensors are represented by one large muscle, which gives off two tendons to the
  second and third metacarpal bones respectively.         This original connexion seems to be
  represented by the   intermediate  form  of muscle  just described.    In the Anteater is found
  a muscle arising   from   the humerus   above  the long   supinator,  and   inserted cither into
  the ensiform bone or into the muscular substance of the palm (Meckel, Anatomie
   Compar., 1829-30, pp. 327-8, vol. vi.). In the Echidna and Ornithorhyncus a small
  muscle is found under the common extensor of the 2nd and 3rd metacarpal bones, which
   is considered   by Meckel (Se Ornithorhynco)        to be a supinator     longus.   These  may
   probably be the homologues of this muscle.

  1 7. In three other subjects, besides the two last mentioned, the extensor
minimi digiti was found to have a double tendon.     In one the muscle also
was doubled.
   In subjects   and 32 the outermost of the tendons of this double muscle
                        5
was inserted into the extensor aponeurosis of the ring finger, thus forming
a special extensor of this digit (fig. 6 a), joining, before reaching with                       it,
                                                                                                         it, a
slip from the               common extensor,           which        directly     afterwards again left
carrying         of its fibres to join the little finger. This arrangement was
               some
described by the author in his first paper, and has been also noticed                                    by
Vesalius, Meckel, and Hallett in Man, and by Church in the Apes.
   18. In this column are found two specimens             of that differentiation
of the extensor indicis muscle which results in proper extensor of the       a
middle finger. In fig.       (taken from the extensor aspect of the same arm

the flexor side (including       whole set of flexors for the five metacarpal
                                           a

arm. In subject 13, the extensor medii digiti was found in both arms, and,
what     significant,
         is                was associated in both with the flexor carpi ra-
                                  it

last papers, fewer examples   than  usual have been found, none of them
very complete.    In subject 32 single slip to the middle finger

tensor, in one other subject last session. It may be taken as further proof                a
of the specializing tendency in the middle finger in this subject.
   20. Of the interossei, five specimens of differentiation are noted, chiefly
belonging to the first, or abductor indicis.    Two specimens of      palmar                    a
interosseus of the thumb are found in Nos.          and 32, both presenting
                                                                         5
numerous other variations.
   21. Among the miscellaneous muscles of the arm the most noteworthy
specimen    that of sternoclavicular muscle, similar to that described
               is              a                                                                         by
Haller, and more recently by Mr. Berkeley Hill. This muscle (given in
fig.7 c, from subject 27) arises        thin tendon from the front of the
                                                       by   a
manubrium sterni, just below the origin of the sterno-mastoid.    Spreading

nearly as far outwards  as the origin of the deltoid.

      This muscle has been found in Birds, Bats, and Moles.        The author has
   also found it remarkably well-developed in the Guiueapig and some
   others of the Rodentia.      He believes it to be closely allied to the upward
   extension of the pectoralis minor, before alluded to, and to result from a
   differentiation of such an upward extension.     In the subject of the sketch
  it was associated with a cleido-occipital (a), and with an increase iu the
  number of tendons to the little finger.
      In subject   26 was a curious muscular slip extending behind the axillary
  vessels   and nerves, from the insertion of the subscapular muscle to the
  fascia covering the long head of the triceps, and derived from the tendon of
  the latissimus dorsi.     Apparently this is an imperfect form of development
  of a short coraco-brachialis muscle, such as that described in a former paper.
      In subject 13 was a high fascial origin of the abductor minimi digiti,
  from the lower third of the forearm, like that described and figured in the
  author's first series.    This has been observed by Gunther (Chirurgische
  Muskellehre, Taf. xx. Fig. V. 18).
      A  double abductor pollicis brevis was found in three cases, besides that
  in which it was connected with a slip from the extensor carpi radialis acces-
  sorius (given in fig. 4). In subject 23, and also in 32, was a double extensor
  ossis metacarpi pollicis, the tendon of one being inserted entirely into the
  annular ligament and origin of the abductor pollicis.
      The rest of this column scarcely needs further description.
      The six remaining columns are occupied by abnormalities of the muscles
 of the leg, of which there are thirty-nine examples.
      22. Peroneus tertius. — Two out of five anomalies in this column result
 from the total absence of this characteristically human muscle, giving a
 very ape-like appearance to the foot.      In No. 7 it was absent on the right
 side only (see fig. 8), in No. 16 on both sides.       In subjects 11 and 32 a
 distinct tendinous slip from it was implanted into the base of the fourth
 metatarsal.      In another, the tendon   was  doubled, though both were in
 serted into the fifth metatarsal, spreading towards the fourth.
     23. Peroneus quinti. — In three out of five specimens found, this ten
 dinous slip from the peroneus brevis to the extensor aponeurosis of the
 little toe was perfect, as described and figured in the last paper. In the
 remaining two, the tendinous slip from the brevis, instead of reaching the
 toe, became implanted upon the upper border        of its metatarsal bone, near
 the front end (fig. 8 a).     In both cases this slip supplied the place of the
peroneus tertius, which was totally wanting, except in the left foot of
 subject 7, in which both the slip and the. muscle was present, though
small.     In the subject of the figure the peroneus brevis tendon gives also a
slip of origin to a bundle of muscular fibres which join the abductor minimi
digiti as a separate muscle (b) on the outer side. This is a somewhat
similar arrangement to that of a specimen given in the author's first series,
in which the peroneus quinti was provided with a separate muscular belly
on the outer border of the foot.

    24. The extensor         longus primi internodii hallucis, described in the
author's first paper, was found in no less than ten out of the thirty-four
subjects, in all, except one, in both legs.          In seven the muscles and tendons
were fully developed and distinct from the fibres of the extensor propriua
hallucis, generally arising above, but sometimes below this muscle.                   In
the remaining three (Nos. 11, 19, and 21) the abnormal muscle was repre
sented by a tendon given from the extensor proprius near the ankle.                   In
Bubject     2 1 this  tendon  was  also,   on   the right  side, contributed  to  by one
from the extensor longus digitorum.              In all the tendon was attached to the
base of the first phalanx of the great toe, close to the joint, either distinct
from or in union with that from the extensor brevis digitorum pedis.
    25. Flexor longus accessorius. — The high origin of this muscle, by an
additional head from the lower third of the fibula, or from the fascia
covering the flexor longus hallucis, has been observed in three cases.
In all it was provided with a distinct tendon, which joined separately
 in the union of the long flexor tendons in the middle of the sole.                   In
 subject 26 the flexor accessorius was made up of four distinct heads.
 1 . The long head as above           described ; 2, another tapering fleshy belly
 from the upper part of the os calcis and insertion of the plantaris ten
 don, in front of the tendo Achillis,             and   ending in a distinct tendon      ;
3, the usual        " massa   carnea"    from the hollow surface of the os calcis       ;
and 4, the outer tendinous slip from the long plantar ligament.                    These
all uniting, joined with a large slip from the tendon of the flexor longus
pollicis, to form a distinct deep or third set of flexor tendons passing to
the four outer toes.        Each of these joined that of the perforans in the in
side of the sheath, about the first joint.
    26. Abductor ossis metatarsi quinti. — This muscle, as described and
figured by the author in former papers, was found only in seven subjects
this session, in all in both feet.          This is much less than the proportion
found last session.        In two out of the five females dissected, they were
found well developed, of a fusiform shape, arising from the outer tubercle
of the os calcis, and inserted by a distinct rounded tendon into the
base of the fifth metacarpal bone.            In five males only, out of the twenty-
nine dissected, were they found as muscles distinct from the fibres of the
abductor minimi digiti.
    In the previous session the proportion of female subjects to males was
very much greater than in the last.              The specimens of this muscle found
were also much more numerous, so much so as to be estimated by the
author at nearly half the number of subjects. Whether this remarkable
difference depends upon the sex, or is accidental, must be decided by future
observations.
     27.   In the miscellaneous column         we have nine single specimens,    as com
 pared with       eleven or twelve    in the arms, and six or seven in the head
and neck.

gluteus minimus forming a scansorius muscle, like that described in a
former paper.   In subject 30 the perforatus tendon of the little toe was
derived from the flexor accessorius, as seen also last session. In subject 7,
the   same tendon is derived from the fifth tendon                   of the perforans,         as   found
in the Apes and Monkeys.       The two last appear to be, respectively, the
imperfect or transitional, and the complete stages of this significant change.
Two varieties, which I have not found' recorded by any anatomical writer,
were noticed in subjects 12 and 26.    In the former the abductor hallucis,
and in the latter the flexor brevis hallucis sent a considerable muscular
slip to the base of the first phalanx of the second toe. In the former the
slip passed deeper than the transversus pedis muscle, and iu the latter
superficial to        it.
     In
      subject 25 the third lumbricalis took origin from the tendon of the
perforatus instead of the perforans, presenting an analogue to the origin
of the first lumbricalis in the hand from a tendon of the flexor sublimis
perforatus in subjects           5     and 13.
     In subject       2 the fourth     plantar   interosseus      arose from a slip    of the tendon
of the peroneus longus, as in the instance described and figured in the author's
last paper.   In subject 16 was a curious double origin of the adductor
longus femoris, the abnormal head arising with the fibres of the pectineus.
   In reference to the combinations of the above muscular variations an in
spection of the Table will show the following points :—
   First, that only in two subjects out of the thirty-four examined were no
muscular abnormalities found ; i. e. no deviations from the ordinary type
sufficiently striking to be recorded.                  It   is,
                                                 indeed, highly probable that
variabilities of every kind are limited   only by the possibilities, of the per
mutations        and combinations of the whole of the structures of the human
body.       It will    be observed       also that the great majority       of the abnormalities
were symmetrical, or found on both sides.
   Secondly, that of the total number of muscular variations, 132 (not
reckoning both sides when alike), 71, or more than one half, are found in
the arms.         If we
                   reckon with these those muscles which, though found in
the neck, act chiefly upon the clavicle,     bone of the upper extremity, viz.
                                                        a
the cUido-occipital and the levator clavicul<e, we shall have    more to add       1   2
to the 71, increasing the proportion of the arm muscles, and diminishing
those proper to the head and neck to 10.     The number of abnormalities
in    the legs    amount to 39, or rather more than half the number of those
in the arms       ; while in the abdomen and lower part of the trunk not
one    is   recorded, though, of course, some may have escaped observation.
      Thirdly.    The       greatest    number of abnormalities          combined in the same
individual       (in subject 32), a very muscular male, in whom the pro
                 is   14
portions are 10 in the muscles of the aims (including the cleido-occipital)                               ;
3 in those of the legs, and   only   the head and neck.

which all except 7 were found in the arms (including the levator clavicuta),
5 in the legs, and 2 in the head and neck.                 With the exception of the le
vator claviculte,costo-fascialis,a,ndL      supra-costal! s, found in the last-mentioned
subject,    but   not   in  No.    32,  the  correspondence (especially in the arms)
between     the different lines of abnormal departure also is sufficiently close
to become       significant, as the reader will have gathered in going through
the preceding pages.             In subject 4 of the Table, which presented the
only specimen of the levator clavicular found this session, only one other
abnormality was found, viz. the abductor of the fifth metatarsal bone.
This    was also found associated with             it in last year's subject, which pre
sents otherwise a        marked contrast in the number of its abnormalities.
     In Nos.    5  and 7, the one a male and the other a female, there are
nine variations respectively, of which, ta No. 5, there is but one which
is not in the arm ; and in No. 7, four in the legs and three in the arms.
In No.      2 are eight abnormalities,         of which six     are in the arms and the
rest in the legs.          In No. 26 are found seven, of which three are in
muscles belonging to the upper extremity, and four in the legs. In
No. 13 are six, all in the arms. In thirteen subjects none were found
in the legs; and in four they were found in the legs only, to the ex
tent, in one case, of four examples ; and in all four subjects highly cha
racteristic.      None were found in the head, neck, or trunk only*.
    The extent of correspondence in combination of varieties in the subjects ar
ranged in theTable (taken in the horizontal lines) cannotbesaid to be striking.
The variations seem to crop out here and there without much reference to
each other.       This may, however, be partly owing to the comparatively small
number reviewed, and we should scarcely be safe in drawing deductions from
it  before a much greater number of subjects are treated in a similar way.
     The correspondence seems to be the greatest in the arm and hand, which
here also assume a prominence over the rest of the frame.                  This, however,
may be due to the greater number of instances found in the upper extremity.
    * In  estimating the proportion of the abnormalities contained in the Table, the
numbers and names at the head of the columns, together with those down the miscel
laneous columns, must be compared with the total number of the muscles in the cor
responding parts of the human body. Thus, taking the number of the voluntary
muscles of the head, neck, trunk, and perineum, excluding those of the back, internal
ear, larynx, and the intercostals (as subject to minor irregularities which have not been
noted), wo have about 72. Comparing these with the kinds of variety in the Table,
viz. 10, we have a proportion of about 1 in 7. In the upper extremity we have 60
muscles ; of lines of variation we have 26, or nearly half. In the lower extremity we
have 61 muscles ;     of varieties 14, or not quite one-fourth.
    The varieties classed in the Table include the greater number of those that have been
previously observed by the author and others.          Ten only, which have been mentioned
in former papers as being subject to other irregularities than duplication and de
ficiency, arc absent from this list.
    This clearly shows that notable departures from the ordinary type of the muscular
structures run in definite grooves or directions, which must be taken to indicate some
unknown factor, of much importance to a comprehensive            knowledge of general and
scientific anatomy.

muscular fibres of the bladder, contrary to the received opinion, are spiral
fibres, and with few exceptions form figure-of-8 loops.      The loops are
variously shaped, according as they are superficial or deep, the more super

vertical fibres, the deeper ones being flattened from above downwards, and
resembling circular fibres.
    These loops are directed towards the apex and base, and are arranged in
four sets  ; an anterior and a posterior set which are largely developed,    and a
right and left lateral set which are accessory and less fully developed. The
bladder is consequently bilaterally symmetrical.
    The superficial loops are confined principally to the anterior, posterior or
lateral aspects, but the deeper ones radiate and expand towards the apex
and base, so that they come to embrace the entire circumference of the
bladder in these directions.       The expansion of the fibres is greatest towards
the apex, and the aggregation of the terminal loops of the anterior and
posterior fibres at the cervix (assisted by the lateral fibres) form a well-
marked sphincter vesicae in this situation.        The fibres pursue definite but
varying courses, those which are longitudinal        or vertical at one point be
coming slightly oblique at a second, oblique at a third, and very oblique or
transverse at a fourth.       The fibres consequently change their direction and
position   on the  vesical  parietes gradually and according to a fixed principle.
The principle involved is readily explained.        The most external and most
 internal fibres are always the most vertical and most feebly developed ; those
which succeed or follow becoming more and more oblique and stronger and
 stronger.    The fibres from this circumstance are divisible into two orders,
viz., an external and an internal, and these, as has been stated, are grouped
in two principal and two subsidiary sets.        The two principal sets occur on
 the anterior and posterior aspects of the viscus, and are so arranged that
 the terminal or transverse portions of the anterior set intersect the more
 vertical portions of the posterior set nearly at right angles and the reverse.
 Similar remarks apply to the subsidiary sets.       Between what may be called
 the vertical or longitudinal and the circular or transverse fibres, other fibres
 having different degrees of obliquity occur.         These consist for the most
 part of the deeper anterior and posterior spiral fibres, and of the subsidiary
 spiral fibres from the sides.      There is consequently no part of the vesical
 parietes in which longitudinal, slightly oblique, oblique, and very oblique
 external and internal fibres may not be found.          The additional strength
 secured by this arrangement cannot well be estimated.
    The external and internal fibres     are similarly  disposed on the anterior,
posterior, and lateral aspects, and if the dissection be conducted from with
 out inwards, the fibres first removed are the mesial, vertical, or longitudinal
 fibres ; then the slightly oblique fibres inclined on either side, and crossing
 at acute angles as in an attenuated figure of 8 ; then the oblique fibres,
 crossing at wider vertical angles as in the more perfect figure of 8. Lastly,
 the very oblique fibres, crossing at such obtuse angles as to have been, up
 to the present, regarded as circular fibres. The fibres which are still deeper
 and which constitute the proper internal fibres, have a precisely similar
 arrangement, but are rudimentary, and consequently not so readily traced.
 The external and internal fibres, as will be seen from this description, be

 246                   Dr. Pettigvew     on the  Muscular Fibres            [June 21,
 come more and more oblique, both             from without    and from within, or in
 proportion as the centre of the vesical parietes is reached, the deepest or
most oblique external and internal sets forming, by the blending of their ter
minal or transverse portions, what is commonly known as the central layer.
    The most external or superficial fibres are connected directly and in
 directly with the slightly oblique external fibres, the slightly oblique with
 the oblique, and the oblique with the very oblique.            The very oblique ex
 ternal fibres, on the other hand, are connected with the oblique internal,
 these in their turn being connected with the slightly oblique internal, and
 the slightly oblique internal with the longitudinal or vertical internal.          In
 some instances the longitudinal         external are connected directly with the
 longitudinal   internal,  and so of the  slightly oblique, oblique, and very oblique
 external and internal fibres.
    The   apex and base     of the bladder    are similarly  constructed, and resem
 ble in their general configuration the other portions of the vesical walls ;
 i. e., they are composed of longitudinal or vertical, slightly oblique, oblique,
 and very oblique or circular fibres which cross in given directions on the
 external and internal surfaces.
    The four   sets  of longitudinal or vertical fibres   have a crucial arrangement
at the apex and base, and the slightly oblique fibres are drawn together at the
urachus and cervix by the constrictions which in the embryo separate the
bladder from the allantois and urethra.           The slightly oblique fibres conse
 quently converge towards the apex and base respectively ; and this arrange
ment at the cervix greatly assists in closing the urethra, as the fibres naturally
come together to form an impervious funnel-shaped projection which is di
 rected downwards and forwards.          The closure of the urethra is completed by
the contraction of the very oblique or circular fibres forming the sphincter,
and by the prominence of the uvula vesicae (luette vesicate) and median ridge
in the female, and the caput gallinnginis or verumontanum in the male.
    The longitudinal or vertical, slightly oblique, oblique, and very oblique
 external and internal fibres at the base are continued forward within the
prostate to the membranous portion of the urethra, and the external and
internal surfaces of the corpus spongiosum.
    The coats of the urethra are therefore to be regarded as the proper con
 tinuation of the walls of the bladder in an anterior direction.
    The longitudinal      or vertical, slightly oblique, oblique, and very oblique
 spiral fibres which form the tunics of the bladder and urethra are curiously
enough repeated in the prostate of the male, and the analogous structure
  n the female, so that this gland would seem to be composed chiefly of
 fibrous offsets from the fibres in question.
    The relations existing between the prostate, urethra, and cervix of the
 bladder are best seen when vertical, horizontal, and anteroposterior or
 transverse sections of the bladder and prostate are made.
    In such   sections   the external longitudinal    or vertical anterior, posterior,
 and lateral fibres are seen to pass forward        on the external surface of the

1866.]                      of the Bladder and Prostate.                          247
urethra;     a certain proportion passing outwards to be inserted into the
anterior, posterior, and lateral surfaces of the capsule of the prostate, others
passing inwards or through the gland in a vertical or longitudinal and like
wise in a horizontal or transverse direction.        The crucial arrangement of the
four  sets  of external fibres at the apex and base is thus clearly traceable in
the prostate. Such of the external fibres as are not inserted into the capsule
of the prostate are attached to the posterior surface of the pubis, the internal
border of the aponeurosis of the levator ani, aud the fascia covering Guthrie's
muscle.      The external fibres investing the dorsal, ventral, and lateral
aspects of the urethra and. prostate are separated by a considerable interval,
thus showing that, although the relations existing between the urethra and
prostate are of the most intimate description, they may nevertheless be
regarded as independent.         What has been said of the external longitudinal
fibres applies equally to the slightly oblique, oblique, and very oblique
external and internal ones, these bifurcating and distributing themselves
with considerable regularity to the walls of the urethra, and the substance
of the prostate respectively. The urethra and prostate are thus com
posed of fibres crossing in every direction as in the bladder itself.
    The very oblique external and internal fibres are interesting because of
the very obtuse angles at which they intersect, and because they are prin
cipally concerned in forming the sphincter of the bladder, and the so-called
circular layer of the prostate.       The very oblique fibres, like the other fibres
described, are arranged in an anterior and a posterior set, which are largely
developed, and a right and left lateral set, which are developed less feebly.
The anterior fibres, which are directed posteriorly, form the posterior half
of the sphincter    vesicse, and the posterior      fibres, which have an opposite
direction, the anterior.       The sphincter is thus bilaterally symmetrical, and
is somewhat oval in shape, the long axis being directed transversely, or
from side to side.      The two    sets of lateral fibres, which  also enter into the
formation of the sphincter, intersect the angles formed by the crossing of
the anterior and posterior fibres, and render its aperture more circular than
it would otherwise be. This circumstance, taken in connexion with the
fact that the fibres pursue a very oblique direction, has given rise to the
belief that the fibres of the sphincter and neck of the bladder generally are
circular fibres, which, as the author shows, is not the case.            The fibres of
the sphincter are best seen by inverting the           bladder  and   dissecting from
within, or by making transverse sections of the prostatic portion of the
urethra in     the   direction of the fundus.         They  are most strongly     pro
 nounced at the cervix, but are continued forward              on the urethra      and
 backwards into       the bladder.      In the   female   they extend even to      the
 meatus    urinarius.    The very oblique or circular fibres of the urethra are
 separated from the corresponding fibres of the prostate by the longitudinal,
 slightly oblique, and oblique fibres forming the outer half of the urethral
 wall and the inner portion of the prostate.            The interval is particularly
 evident at the cervix, where the sphincter is most distinctly pronounced ;

348     On the Muscular Fibres of the Bladder and Prostate.               [June 21,
and here the two sets of very oblique or circular fibres have different axes.
Further forward, or towards the apex of the prostate, the space gradually
diminishes, the circular fibres of the gland curving in an upward direction
into the verumontauum or caput gallinaginis, and blending with the circular
fibres of the urethra.       While, therefore, the very oblique or circular fibres
of the urethra are entirely distinct at one point, they are indissolubly united
at another.      This is important, as it shows how the sphincter may act in
dependently of the prostate, and the revere.
    The longitudinal or vertical internal fibres posteriorly, connect the me
dian or central portion of the trigone (trigone vesical, trigonum vesicas,
Lieutaud    ) with the verumontauum in the male, and the uvula and median
ridge in the female. The slightly oblique internal fibres bound the trigone
laterally, and are continued into the verumontanum, where they cross
slightly. The oblique fibres which assist in forming the base of the trigone,
are likewise continued in a downward direction on the verumontanum, where
they cross, and are mixed up with the continuations of the very oblique
fibres which form the sphincter at the neck, and with the circular fibres
of the prostate. The arrangement of the fibres in the trigone resembles
that found at the cervix and fundus generally, and the author is of opinion
that Sir Charles Bell was in error when he described the " muscles of the
ureters
         "  as separate   structures.
    The ureters enter the vesical parietes at a very obtuse angle, and the angle
increases according to the degree of distension of the bladder.          These tubes
receive accessions of fibres from the longitudinal, slightly oblique, oblique,
and very oblique external and internal fibres of the bladder in their vicinity,
and are continued upon each other within the bladder in the form of a
strong transverse band.         The transverse band which connects the ureters
together   within   the  bladder,   or between the uretral orifices, is equal in vo
lume to the ureters themselves within the vesical parietes.             The band in
question   is best  seen  when    the  base of  the  bladder is detached and held
against the light, and seems to be formed by the obliteration of the uretral
tubes between the uretral orifices.
    The uretral channels      seek the internal surface of the bladder even more
obliquely than the      ureters,   and the inner walls of the ureters become so
thin, particularly towards the uretral orifices, that they act mechanically
as moveable partitions or valves, as in the smaller veins*.              The canals
of the ureters     are consequently closed, partly by the contractions of the
muscular walls, and partly by the mechanical pressure exercised by the
urine about to be expelled.
    From the foregoing description it will be evident that the various sets of
external and internal fibres forming the bladder, urethra, and prostate are
antagonistic, not only as regards themselves, but also as regards the territory
or region they occupy ; the loops formed by the anterior fibres crossing

each other      at more or less acute      angles    according to their depths, the
anterior fibres, as a whole, crossing the posterior or homologous fibres as
a whole.      While, therefore, the fibres, in virtue of their twisted looped
arrangement, antagonize each other individually, the aggregation of the
fibres in any one region check, antagonize, and coordinate a similar aggre
gation of fibres at an opposite point; the anterior fibres, e.g., acting on
the posterior, and the right lateral upon the left lateral.              This arrange
ment, which is productive of great strength, ensures that the external and
internal fibres shall act in unison or together, and fully explains the views
of the older anatomists, who described the bladder              as consisting of fibres
crossing in every      direction, and forming     an  intricate network.     It likewise
accords with the more modern opinion, that the fibres of the bladder may
be divided into strata or layers.
    The  fibres, when their points    of attachment      are taken into consideration,
can only contract spirally from above downwards, and from without in
wards ; they in fact converge, or close spirally in the direction of the
cervix, which may be said to diverge or open in an opposite direction as
the contraction proceeds. As a result of this twisting movement, the urine,
like the blood, is projected spirally*.
    Finally, the fibres of the bladder, urethra, and prostate pursue at least
seven well-marked directions       ; the fibres crossing with remarkable precision
at wider and wider angles, as the central            portion of either is reached, as
in the left ventricle of the vertebrate heart .        f     In fact, the fibres of the
bladder and heart have a strictly analogous arrangement, and the author
is inclined to believe that functionally also they possess points of re
semblance. Very similar remarks may be made regarding the structure and
functions of the stomach and uterus.

    The subject of this paper is the lunar-diurnal variation of the magnetic
 declination and of the horizontal and vertical components of the magnetic
 force, derived from a seven years' series of photographic records obtained
at the Kew Observatory between January 1, 1858 and December 31, 1864.
    The discussion which it contains          has for its objects — 1st, to exemplify
 the consistent and systematic character of the lunar-diurnal influence thus
 derived ; and 2ndly, to serve both as a guide and as an encouragement to

 adopting the Kew methods of magnetic investigation.                   The completeness
 of the photographic process         is shown   by the  fact,  that  of  175,344 hourly-
  positions which should have been recorded in the interval under notice,
 there were only 1497 failures from all causes whatsoever; and even of
 these few a considerable portion is shown to be due to the employment of
 the instruments in other experimental investigations.               The paper contains
 a full statement of the processes of tabulation from the photograms, and
 of the different stages of reduction through which the tabular results
 were passed, for the purpose of deriving from them the facts connected
 with the lunar influence on the terrestrial magnetic elements. A lunar-
 diurnal variation is shown to exist in each of these elements, — of very
 small amount, but         having peculiar and well-marked systematic charac
 teristics.    It is further shown that these characteristics present a similarity
 and accordance, which it is impossible to regard as accidental, with the
 results obtained at several         other and widely-separated localities in the
 middle latitudes of both hemispheres, as for example at Hobarton, Toronto,
 Philadelphia, Pekin, and the Cape of Good Hope.                  A magnetic variation
 shown to be thus obviously dependent upon the moon's position relatively
to the terrestrial meridian, and agreeing in its principal features in such
 various localities, is urged by the author as being ascribable with great
probability to the direct magnetic action of the moon, made sensible at the
surface of the earth through the production of phenomena which, in the
present state of our knowledge as regards the magnetism both of the earth
and of the moon, it is as yet difficult wholly to explain, but which are likely
 to lead to   a  considerable advance of our knowledge in both these respects.
    The further prosecution of the investigation, both at Kew and else
 where, is recommended as highly deserving the attention of those who
 occupy themselves       in the pursuits of inductive philosophy.

la Congelation des Animaux," published in the 'Journal de PAnatoroie et
de la Physiologie,' the Number for January and February of this year, he
refers to a statement of mine, made many years ago*, that the leech may
be froz en without loss of life.         The experiments which he has instituted,
and wh ich appear to have been conducted with great care, have led him to
au opposite conclusion, viz. that congelation is not only fatal to the leech,
but to     animals generally, without a single exception.             He considers the
cause of death, the vera causa, to use his own words, to be an altered con

to repeat the experiments on the leech, aud to extend them to some other

Mr. Robertson             ;       and since then, in the following                      month, they have been
continued at home in Westmoreland.
  At Oxford the trials                            were   made    on leeches         and frogs      ;   at home, on

results obtained were briefly the following : —

enough to hold                    it,

when perfectly rigid and     hard, and   gradually thawed,    showed when                         it
punctured    faint indication of irritability

traction of the part punctured, the oral extremity, and nowhere else.      It
did not revive.
   2. Another leech was similarly exposed, but for    shorter time.  When               a
divided by an incision,  was found not frozen throughout.

marks of revival   but they retained

                                         a
of the frog being held in the warm hand taken out after some minutes     ;
they were quite hard and motionless, whilst the body and upper extre
mities did not appear to be affected.   It moved about, dragging the lower
extremities as          if
                 they were dead.    In about four hours  recovered the use                   it
of its femoral muscles                   ;     on the following day the use of the muscles of the
legs  the day after
       ;                                it   was able to bend and extend these limbs    but there      ;
was no  proof that its feet had recovered sensibility.                                      On the fourth day     it
was found dead.

     7. The lower extremities of a large toad were immersed in direct contact
 with the mixture, the temperature falling to 3°.                        Gradually thawed, the
parts showed no marks of life. This toad, which before the trial was in
 a dull state, afterward became almost torpid, and so continued until the fol
 lowing morning, when it was apparently dead : opened, the auricles were
found feebly acting, ceasing after a few seconds*.
     8. A similar experiment was made on the lower extremities of an active
frog, and with a similar result, except that the vivacity of the animal was
for    a   short time but little impaired : after four hours it was apparently
 dead    ;  opened, its auricles contracted when punctured.                        It may be right
to mention that, before exposing the toad and frog to the freezing mixture
in direct contact, it was ascertained that the frog bore the immersion of its
lower extremities in a saturated solution of common salt without any appa
rent loss of sensibility or motive power f.
     9. The lower extremities of an active frog of a large size were wrapped in
 tin-foil, and together with one of its upper extremities not so wrapped, were
 kept in a freezing mixture about a quarter of an hour.                        The frozen parts in
thawing showed no marks of life.                    The frog died in about three hours.
    * This    toad was a female which had shed her ova ; the           oviduct was still large ; the
stomach was distended with caterpillars, slugs, &c., seeming              to show that there was no
diseased state.       It is noteworthy that the apertures of the cutaneous glands appeared
to be closed ; for when the animal was irritated there was no ejection of the acrid fluid,
a circumstance        I  had before noticed in a female during the breeding-season,              sug
gestive of a condition of surface favourable to the male in the generative act                 When
the tubercles were incised, they were found to contain the acrid fluid in plenty, and
judging from its bitter taste, and the irritating effects of an extremely small portion
applied to the tongue, not deficient in activity,.          The same state of the cuticular glands
 was found in another female toad killed by congelation, which had shed few of its ova,
— this on the 23rd of June. It was of a lighter colour than usual. It was found like
wise in two examined in July, in which some ova remained.
    t The effect of immersion of the lower extremities of a frog in a saturated solution
 of common salt varies,         I  find, according to the length of time ; if for a very few
minutes, it is inconsiderable ; if for many, it is well marked ; and if much pro
longed it is fatal.       In one instance, after a quarter of an hour's immersion, the limbs
seemed paralyzed, the animal in a state approaching to torpor : after having been well
washed      in fresh water it slowly recovered its activity, and the limbs their motive
power      and  sensibility ; the motive power first, their sensibilily later ; indeed not until
the following morning, judging from the effects of puncture. After a longer immersion,
with a fatal result, the limbs had become rigid and somewhat hard, especially the
feet, as if their juices had been extracted by osmotic action.                    Opened after three
hours, even the auricles were motionless, and this when punctured.                    The muscles of
the limbs      no  longer   showed   a striated  structure,  whilst those   of  the upper extremities
displayed this structure distinctly.
    The toad with a thicker skin was found to bear the immersion of its extremities for
 a longer time ; but tbo difference           seemed to be only in degree ; much longer con
 tinued, the    same   effects were  produced, viz. rigidity, with loss of motion and sensibility,
 which (the immersion          not   being too long) were slowly recovered after fresh water
 ablution.
    The blood-eorpascles, acted on by the same solution, underwent a change, contract
ing slightly, and acquiring a granular appearance, commencing in their nuclei.

                     Dr. Davy on       the Congelation    of Animals.
    10.   A   cockroach,     a  flesh-fly, and     a  minute insect, an ichneumon *
(Gelineus nigerl),        confined together in     a small glass tube, were kept some
minutes in the mixture.            Thawed, they were found all three dead.
    These results, so far as the particular instances are concerned, are suffi
ciently confirmatory of M. Puget's, and on my mind they leave little
doubt     that his general proposition (his inference from his very numerous
experiments) is correct, that congelation is fatal to animal life.                    It is
hardly worth while to attempt to account for the different conclusion I
had come to, that referred to by him relative to the leech, it being partly
founded on the fact that leeches which had been enveloped in ice for many
days were not thereby killed, and partly on witnessing some marks of
vitality in leeches which were believed to have been artificially frozen, and
which very soon after died<
    Whilst admitting that congelation, thorough congelation of an animal is
incompatible with life, the cause of death from congelation seems open to
question, and more especially that assigned by M. Puget as the vera causa,
a change in the blood, and chiefly in its corpuscles.             That these corpuscles
are changed by freezing in form and condition seems to be certain.                  Before
seeing M. Puget's paper          I  had ascertained the fact, and not only that the
corpuscles were changed, but also that the entire blood was to some extent
altered,    leading me at the time           to  ask whether some of the injurious
 effects  of frost-bite may not        be mainly owing to the freezing     of the blood,
 and the changes in consequence           in the corpuscles and in a less degree in the
 fibrin  t ; and since,    in  examining the blood of the animals exposed to the
 freezing mixture, I have had this confirmed ; but the change in these in
 stances was comparatively slight ; even in those of the congealed limbs of
 the frogs and toad the majority of the corpuscles appeared little altered ;
 some few seemed ruptured,           some corrugated, and more contracted.
    Judging from the effect of congelation on the heart of the frog in ex
 periment No. 5, and from the effects of congelation partially produced, as
 in the extremities of the frog and toad, I would rather attribute the death
 to the freezing of the organs, not excluding the blood, than to the freezing
 of the blood alone ; and I would ask, is not this view most in accordance
 with the pathology of the subject, with all that we know of frost-bite and
 its consequences in man, and with the results of Mr. Hunter's experiments
 on the local effects of congelation in animals — those on the ear of the
 rabbit and wottle of the cock % ? and do not some even of M. Puget's results
    * For  the name of this insect   I  am indebted to Dr. Gray, F.E.S. It -was selected on
 account   of its minuteness : it weighed hardly -j-j^ of a grain ; it seemed probable, on
 account of the minuteness of its vessels, that its fluids might escape congelation after
 the manner of fluids in capillary tubes, which may be reduced many degrees in tempera
 ture without being frozen.

 254         Letter   to the  President from Col. Walker,          R.E., F.R.S.,
 give it support, such as the opacity of the crystalline lens, he admitting
  that, were it possible for an animal to revive after complete congelation, it
 would be blind from cataract          ?   Now,    if the crystalline lens, if the blood-
  corpuscles suffer and undergo           an appreciable change from congelation, it
  would be very remarkable indeed did not the brain and nerves, and the
  organs generally suffer from the same cause, and experience changes in
  compatible with life.        In the instance of man, we know that a certain re
  duction of his temperature merely, not reaching to congelation, suffices to
 extinguish life *, and that in the instances of other animals, especially the
 hybernating and insects, a moderate reduction occasions torpor, ending in
 death    if too  prolonged.      That the organs generally suffer from congelation
 M. Puget himself admits, as expressed in the subjoined paragraphf.                            I
 have found, too, that the muscles, after having been frozen, exhibit a
 marked change ; thus, in one instance, that of a frog, in which, after de
 capitation, an upper and lower extremity were frozen, the muscles of these
 limbs, when thawed,          compared with those which had not been frozen,
 showed a well-marked          difference under the microscope.           Thus, whilst in
 the latter the striated structure was very distinct, in the former it was no
 longer visible ; and after a few hours, viz. on the following morning,
 whilst the unfrozen muscles had undergone no perceptible alteration, those
 which had been frozen had become of increased tenderness, yielding to a
 slight rending force, and breaking short, as if the coherence of the particles
 forming the fasciculi was greatly diminished.

    My dear General, — Captain Basevi                   has  just returned to my head
quarters, on the close         of the operations of his first field-season with the
 pendulums.
    You will     be glad to hear that      his progress has on the whole been very
satisfactory.       At the outset he met with numerous difficulties; the
-v acuum      apparatus was very troublesome, the air-pump constantly getting
out of order, and the receiver as constantly leaking.                  It is very easy for
philosophers to suggest improvements and refinements in the modus
operandi of such operations, but it is not so easy to carry them out prac
tically.       Capt. Basevi has undergone a great amount of labour and
anxiety,     but  he has successfully surmounted all his difficulties.
   *  Instanca'* have occurred in the Lake    District of persons who have perished on the
hills from prolonged    exposure to strong wind and rain, siorm-stricken, in the language of
the country.

  The two most recent theories dealing with the physical constitution of
the sun are due to   M. Faye and to Messrs. De la Rue, Balfour Stewart,
and Loewy.     The chief point of difference in these two theories is the
explanation given by each of the phenomena of sun-spots.
   Thus, according to M. Faye *, the interior of the sun is a nebulous
gaseous mass of feeble radiating-power, at a temperature of dissociation ;
the photosphere          is,
                     on the other hand, of    high radiating-power, and at
                                                          a
a temperature sufficiently  low to permit  of chemical action.   In sun-                        a
spot we see the interior nebulous mass through au opening in the photo
sphere,       caused    by an     upward      current,
                                           and the sun-spot    black, by                is
reason of the feeble radiating-power of the nebulous mass.

1866.]                      Observations    of the Sun.                                    257
some observations (referred to by the authors last named) which had led
me independently to the same conclusion as the one announced by them.
The observations indicated that, instead of a spot being caused by an up
ward current, it is caused by a downward one, and that the results, or, at
all   events, the concomitants     of the downward current          are a dimming          and
possible vaporization      of the cloud-masses carried down.             I       was   led to
hold that the current had    downward direction by the fact that one of
                                   a
the cloud-masses observed passed in succession, hi the space of about two
hours, through the various orders of brightness exhibited by                 facula,       ge
neral surface, and penumbras.
   On March 4th of the present year I commenced a spectroscopic ob
servation of sun-spots, with a view of endeavouring to test the two rival
theories, and especially of following up the observations before alluded to.
   The method I adopted was to apply a direct-vision spectroscope to my
6,|-inch equatoreal (by Messrs. Cooke and Sons) at some distance outside the
eyepiece, with its axis coincident with the axis of the telescope prolonged.
In front of the slit of the spectroscope was placed a screen on which the
image of the sun was received ; in this screen there was also a fine slit cor
responding to that of the spectroscope.
   By this method it is possible to observe at one time the spectra of the
umbra of a spot and of the adjoining photosphere or penumbra ; unfor
tunately, however, favourable conditions of spot      e. as to size, position
                                                          (».
on the disk, and absence " of cloudy stratum"), atmosphere, and instru
ment are rarely coincident.   The conditions were by no means all could              I
have desired when my first observations were made and, owing to the
                                                                ;
recent absence of spots,    have had no opportunities of repeating my ob
                            I
servations.  Hence    should have hesitated still longer to lay them before
                       I
the Royal Society had not M. Faye again recently called attention to
the subject.

the umbra of the small spot then visible fell on the middle of the slit in the
screen, which, like the corresponding one in the spectroscope, was longer
than the diameter of the umbra, the solar spectrum was observed in the
field of view of the spectroscope with its central portion (corresponding
to the diameter of the umbra falling on the slit) greatly enfeebled in
brilliancy.
      All
       the absorption-bands, however, visible in the spectrum of the pho
tosphere, above and below, were visible in the spectrum of the spot they,              ;
moreover, appeared thicker where they crossed the spot-spectrum.
 I   was unable to detect the slightest indication of any bright bands,
although the spectrum was sufficiently feeble,     think, to have rendered
                                                     I

indicated by M. Faye, but that we have in this absorption-hypothesis                    a
complete      or  partial   solution   of  the  problem     which   has   withstood    so
many attacks.
    The dispersive power of the spectroscope employed was not sufficient
to enable     me to determine whether         the decreased brilliancy of the spot-
spectrum      was due    in any measure to      a greater number of bands of ab
sorption,    nor could     I  prove whether the thickness of the bands in the
spot-spectrum,      as compared       with their thickness in the photosphere-
spectrum, was real or apparent only*.
    On these points, among others,           I shall hope, if permitted, to lay the
results of future observations before the Royal Society.                    Seeing that
spectrum-analysis       has  already  been   applied  to the  stars with  such  success,
it is not too much to think that an attentive and detailed spectroscopic
examination of the sun's surface may bring us much knowledge bearing
on the physical constitution of that luminary.             For instance, if the theory
of absorption be true, we may suppose that in a deep spot rays might
be absorbed which would escape absorption in the higher strata of the
atmosphere ; hence also the darkness of a line may depend somewhat on
the depth of the absorbing atmosphere.               May not also some of the vari
able lines visible in the solar spectrum be due to absorption in the region
of spots ? and may not the spectroscope afford us evidence of the existence
of the " red flames " which total eclipses have revealed to us in the sun's
atmosphere ; although they escape all other methods of observation at
other times? and if so, may we not learn something from this of the
recent outburst of the star iu Corona 1
         IV. " On      a  Crystalline Fatty Acid from Human Urine."
         By E. Schunck, F.R.S.              Received September 21, 18GG.
                                        (Abstract.)
    After referring     to the various forms in which fatty matter occurs in
 human     urine, and to our extremely defective knowledge regarding its
 physical and chemical properties, the author proceeds to describe a process
 whereby he obtained from healthy urine a small quantity of a substance
 having the properties characteristic of the fatty acids which are solid at
 the ordinary temperature.           The process consists in passing urine, after
 having been filtered in order to separate all insoluble matter which may
 have been deposited, through animal charcoal in an ordinary percolating
 apparatus.      The urine is thereby completely decolorized and deodorized,
 a small quantity of charcoal producing this effect on a large quantity of
 urine.    The charcoal, after being thoroughly washed with water, is treated
 with boiling alcohol, to which it communicates a bright yellow colour like

 that of urine itself.   The filtered alcoholic liquid is ' evaporated, and the
 residue is treated with water, which leaves undissolved a quantity of
 hrownish-yellow fatty matter. This, after being purified in the manner
 described by the author, is found to consist principally of a fatty acid,
 having the properties characteristic of the group to which palmitic and
 stearic acid belong.     The acid is white, crystalline, has a pearly lustre,
 melts at 540,3  C,   volatilizes unchanged when heated, and is insoluble in
 water but easily soluble in alcohol and ether.          It is soluble in caustic
 potash and soda-lye, in aqueous ammonia, and in solutions of carbonate of
 potash and carbonate of soda.       The solutions froth on being boiled like
 ordinary   soap  and   water.    The potash compound is obtained from the
 watery solution in the form of small pearly scales, and from an alcoholic
 solution in prismatic crystals.        The soda-compound separates from a
 boiling-hot solution on cooling as a thick, white, amorphous soap, a very
 small quantity of which is sufficient to cause the liquid to gelatinize.   The
 watery solution of either of these compounds gives white curd-like preci
 pitates with salts of barium, calcium, lead, and silver. The quantity of the
 acid obtained in the author's experiments was too inconsiderable to enable
 him to determine its composition and atomic weight, and it therefore
 remains uncertain whether it is identical with any of the known fatty acids
 or not.   The author inclines to the opinion that it is a mixture of stearic
 and palmitic acid, which according to modern investigations constitute
 together what was formerly called margaric acid.          The author does not
 venture to assert that it forms a normal constituent of the healthy secretion,
 though the urine employed in his experiments in no case exhibited any
 thing peculiar.   The experiments described do not throw any light on the
 question how this acid, which belongs to a class of substances almost inso
luble in water,  comes to be dissolved in a liquid like urine, which is itself
 usually acid.
V. On Oxalurate of Ammonia             as  a Constituent of Human Urine."

    When ordinary healthy urine is     passed  through   animal charcoal in the
manner described in the preceding paper, several organic substances are
separated and absorbed by the charcoal in addition to the fatty acid there
referred to. The liquid obtained by treating the charcoal with boiling
alcohol having been evaporated, the residue is treated with water, which
leaves the fatty acid undissolved.       The filtered liquid yields on evapora
tion a quantity of crystals, which, after being purified in the manner
described by the author, are found to have the properties and composition
of oxalurate of ammonia. The watery solution of the substance gives
with acids a white crystalline precipitate of oxaluric acid ; with nitrate of
6ilver it produces a precipitate which dissolves without change in boiling

of silver. The lead compound produced by adding acetate of lead to the
watery solution, forms well-defined prismatic crystals.             With chloride of
calcium the watery solution gives no precipitate, but on adding ammonia
and boiling, there is an abundant precipitation of oxalate of lime.                 By
treatment   with  strong   acids   the  substance    is  decomposed,   yielding  oxalic
acid and urea.     Its composition was found to correspond with the formula
C6 HT   N, Oa,  which is that of oxalurate of ammonia.
   The author's experiments        were not sufficiently numerous to decide the
question whether     this  salt is a normal constituent of human urine or not.
There is no doubt, however, that its presence, whether exceptional or not,
affords an easy and satisfactory explanation of a phenomenon which has
until now proved very puzzling, viz., the formation of oxalate of lime in
urine long after its emission.        It is doubtless owing to the decomposition
of oxaluric acid, which takes up water and splits up into urea and oxalic
acid ; the latter then combines with lime, of which there is always a suffi
cient quantity present to saturate the acid.           There can "be little doubt also
that oxaluric acid is derived in the animal frame, as in the laboratory, from
uric acid, the oxidation of which is its only known source.
VI. " On the Structure of the Optic             Lobes of the Cuttle- Fish."         By
       J. Lockhart Clarke, F.R.S.                 Received     September   26, 1866.
                                       (Abstract.)
    The brain of the Cuttle-fish consists of several ganglia closely aggregated
around the upper part of the oesophagus.                The foremost or pharyngeal
ganglion, which is much the          smallest, is   bilobed   and somewhat quadran
gular.    The next is a large bilobed ganglion which forms the roof of the
canal for the oesophagus.          Beneath the oesophagus is another large and
broad mass, which is connected on each side with the supra-cesopbageal
 masses by bands that complete the oesophageal             ring.
    From   each  side  of the cephalic masses springs a thick optic peduncle
 which ends in the optic lobe.        Each optic lobe is larger than all the other
 cerebral masses taken together, and has a striking resemblance in shape to
 the human kidney.         It is completely enveloped in a thick layer of optic
 nerves disposed in flattened bands which issue from all parts of its sub
 stance and proceed to the back of the eye in a fan-like expansion, the
 upper and lower bands crossing each other in their course. The substance
 of each lobe consists of two distinct portions, which differ from each other
 entirely in appearance. The outer portion resembles a very thin rind or
 shell, is extremely delicate, and very easily torn from the central substance
 which it encloses.       It consists of three concentric layers — an external
 dark layer, an internal dark layer, and a middle pale and broader layer
 containing thin and concentric bands of fibres.
    The first or outer layer consists of a multitude of nuclei and          a few small

1866.]                of the Optic Lobes    of the Cuttle-Fish.                261
nucleated cells, with which      filaments of the optic nerves are connected.
The second or middle layer is composed entirely of fine nerve-fibres which
form two sets — one vertical, and the other horizontal.         The vertical fibres
issue at the under surface of the first layer from the network which its
nuclei form with the fibres of the optic nerves. Some are continuous with
the horizontal fibres, but the majority continue downward across them to
the third or inner layer.       At the junction of these two layers is a row of
nucleated cells which      send thin  processes  in different directions, and with
which    some  of the nerve-fibres are   connected. The third or inner layer is
composed entirely of closely-aggregated nuclei, which are joined together
in a network by the fibres which issue from the under surface of the middle
layer.
     The cortical substance, consisting of these three layers, forms only a very
 small portion of the optic lobe.      Out of the nuclear network of the inner
 layer fine nerve-fibres descend into the body of the lobe which it encloses.
 At first  these  fibres are vertical, parallel, and arranged in uniform series,
 with scattered nuclei between them ; but as they descend to the centre of
 the lobe, they diverge more and more, and cross each other to form a
 plexus, first with oval and then with broader meshes, in which the nuclei
 and nucleated cells are collected into groups of corresponding shape and
 size.
     From the plexus at the inner side of the lobe bundles converge from all
 parts to form the lower half of the peduncle, the upper part of which
 consists of masses of small nuclei, and gives attachment, by a short pedicle,
 to a small tubercle.      This tubercle consists of closely-aggregated nuclei
 connected by fibres which converge to its neck and escape into the peduncle
  of the optic lobe.
     After concluding his description of the optic lobes, the author gives a
  short  account of the structure and connexions of the remaining cerebral
  ganglia of the Cuttle-fish, with the view of determining their homologies.
     From the nature of the parts which it supplies, the foremost or pharyn
 geal ganglion would seem to combine the function of the centres which give
  origin to the trigeminal, the olfactory, and the gustatory nerves in the
 vertebrata.     The second bilobed ganglion appears to correspond partly to
 the cerebral lobes and partly to the cerebellum of fishes. The posterior
 portion of the subcesophageal mass is the analogue of the medulla oblongata ;
 while the anterior portion may be regarded as the spinal cord concentrated
 below the oesophagus and in the neighbourhood of the feet, which derive
 all their nerves from that source.

following conditions, — (1) the nature of the solution, that is to say, its
 temperature, and the nature and quantity of the different ingredients which
 it contains in a unit of volume, (2) the quantity of the solution, or the
 number of such units of volume, (3) the time during which the change
 proceeds. The relation of the amount of change to the second and third
 of these conditions is determinate : it varies directly with each ; for the
 solution is homogeneous, and, if all other conditions are fixed, the rate of
 change is uniform.         But the first condition comprises an almost indefinite
 number of particular conditions         ;  for not only may various iodides and per

oxides be used without, as far as we know, altering the nature of the re
action, but other substances may be introduced into the solution, and
their influence upon the amount of change determined.
   The present paper contains an account of the methods employed for ob
serving this reaction, and of the results obtained by varying two particular
conditions, namely the amounts of peroxide and of iodide.
  If   hydric peroxide and hydric iodide, or barytic peroxide, potassic
iodide, and hydric chloride, be brought together in dilute solution at the
ordinary temperature, a gradual development of iodine takes place. If a
drop of a dilute solution of sodic hyposulphite be added to the mixture
capable of reducing to iodide all the iodine which has been formed up to
the time of its addition, but not all that will be formed in the course of the
reaction, the liquid which had become yellow becomes colourless, remains
colourless for a while, and then suddenly becomes yellow again.     This
yellow colour may be exchanged for a more intense blue colour by putting
starch into the solution.  It was found that in dilute solutions no direct
oxidation of hyposulphite by peroxide took place ; and that the quan
tity of hyposulphite required           to reduce the iodine liberated by a measure
of peroxide            was the same, whether the hyposulphiteadded little by
                                                                 were
little during the course of the reaction, or after the primary reaction had
completed itself, and when no peroxide remained in the solution.
   The method of observation founded upon                these   facts was   briefly as
follows    :   —
   Measured quantities of all the standard solutions, except that of hydric
peroxide, were introduced into a glass cylinder about 1 1 inches high by 3
broad, and water was added till the upper surface of the liquid was
level with line drawn round the cylinder.
                   a                      This adjustment of volume
was made through a hole in the bung, which closed the cylinder; two
other holes admitted   thermometer and an inverted funnel-tube.
                               a                                 A cur
rent of carbonic acid passing down the funnel-tube to the bottom of the
cylinder, and rising in large bubbles from the mouth of the funnel, served
at once to stir the liquid constantly, and to protect its upper surface from
the air. When the volume and the temperature of the solution had been
adjusted,   small measure of hyposulphite was first added, and then the
               a
pipetteful (10 cub. centims.) of peroxide.    The cylinder was placed on a
sheet of white paper in front of a clock beating seconds.  By watching the
surface of the fluid and counting the seconds when the time of an observa
tion was near, it was possible to note accurately the moment at which the
colour changed.  A second small measure of hyposulphite was then intro
duced, and at the proper interval a second observation was made.  Each
such addition of hyposulphite, with the observation preceding and following
it,   spoken of as an experiment, and these experiments were continued
      is
until the reducing power of the last measure of hyposulphite being greater
than the oxidizing power of the remaining peroxide the blue colour did not
return.

  The small  measures of hyposulphite consisted of single drops collected
under circumstances  favourable to their perfect uniformity. The peroxide
employed was either an acidified solution of sodic peroxide, or dilute
bydric peroxide obtained by the distillation of such a solution. In each
set of experiments the value of the measures of hyposulphite and of the
pipetteful of peroxide could be compared by determining what fraction of a
measure of hyposulphite remained in the solution when the set of experi
ments had been brought to an end. These values could also be compared
by determining each with a standard solution of potassic permanganate.
In presence of an excess of potassic iodide, sodic hyposulphite may be esti
mated by this reagent exactly as it may by staudard iodine solution.
   During each set of experiments, then, all the conditions of the reaction
are constant except two, which are progressively modified.  One of these is
immaterial, the accumulation of a small quantity of sodic tetrathionate ; the
other is material, the gradual disappearance of the small quantity of per
oxide upon whose presence the reaction depends.
  The first point, therefore, requiring to be investigated was the law of con
nexion between the amount of change and the amount of peroxide.
   Since the amount of peroxide originally taken is known, and also the
amount which corresponds to a measure of hyposulphite, the amount re
maining in the solution at the moment of each observation is also known.
Thus the data supplied by each experiment are (1) the amount of peroxide
present in the solution at a particular moment of time, (2) the time at
which this amount is present, (3) the amount present at a subsequent
moment of time, (4) the time at which this amount is present. Represent
ing these two amounts of peroxide by y and y' respectively, and the cor
responding moments of time by t and       the result of each experiment
                                              t',                                        is
that an amount of chemical change          y—y' has   been accomplished       in   an   in
terval   t'—t.According to the hypothesis proposed in our former paper,
namely that the amount of chemical change varies directly with that of
each of the substances partaking in            it,
                                          these quantities should exhibit
throughout   set of experiments

                                  y'
  The numerical results obtained in various sets of experiments performed
under different circumstances are compared with those calculated from
equations of this form, and the two are shown to agree within narrow
limits of experimental error.    It   is   inferred that in this case the amount of
chemical change taking        place at any moment         is   proportional        to the
amount of peroxide present at that moment in the solution.
   The constant a in the preceding equation represents the effect upon the
amount of change of those conditions which do not vary in       set of experi
                                                                     a

the law of connexion      between        the condition thus varied and the amount of
change.
  Accordingly           of sets of experiments was made, in which, all else
                  a series
being kept constant, different quantities of potassic iodide were used in
different sets. It is shown that the values of a derived from the different
sets   of experiments                  to the quantities of iodide used in each
                        are proportional
case.  In this scries hydrie sulphate was an ingredient of the solutions ; a
second series was made, in which an equivalent quantity of hydric chloride
was substituted.    The result, as regards the effect of varying the amount of
iodide, was the same as in the previous series. The rate of chemical change,
that is to say the amount in a given time with a constant quantity of per
oxide, was found to be directly proportional to the amount of iodide in the
solution.   Thus the law of connexion is the same in this case as in that
already investigated of the variation of peroxide.
   The total amount of chemical change is a function of all the conditions
of the system in which it occurs.              If
                                       we call this amount 2, the volume of
the solution », its temperature h, the time during which the change pro
ceeds t, and the amounts of the various ingredients, peroxide, iodide, &c.
in a unit of volume, p, t, a, b, e . . ., then
                 2 =/(«,       b,c,...h,i,...p,...t,..v...).
The form of this function is determinate in the                    case      of two of   these condi
tions, viz. v, t, and has now been determined experimentally in the case of
p and i, so that the equation may be written in the form
                             'S.—ip t    v   ./(a,   b, c . . . A . .    .).

troduced into the system and affect the amount only, and not the nature of
the chemical change, and which may therefore be regarded as so many con

the investigation of the influence of some of these may prove of interest,                         it
being possible thus to compare various substances which may be sub
stituted one for another in the system by      new standard.
                                                          a   They find, for
 example, that comparing            equivalent quantities (in the ordinary chemical
sense) of hydric sulphate and hydric chloride, the effect of the latter                            is
nearly double that of the former.     But the most important condition of
the change whose influence    still undetermined
                                    is               that of temperature, for
                                                                    is
this condition intervenes under all circumstances of the reaction, and indeed
in all chemical changes whatever. The authors have already made many
experiments on both these points.     The results of this investigation, which
will complete the study of the reaction, may, they hope, form the subject
of subsequent communication.

       Tarn, M.A., Memb. Roy. Inst. Brit. Architects. Communicated
       by G. Godwin, Esq.          Received October 23, 1866.
                                     (Abstract.)
   In   a former    paper on this subject which the author presented to the
                                                         *              '
Royal Society, and which is published in the               Proceedings     (vol. xv.
p. 182), he obtained formulae         for calculating  the   thrust  of a spherical
dome of uniform thickness, by supposing it to consist of a number of thin
ribs, each of which is formed by two vertical planes intersecting at the axis
of the dome, and making a small angle with each other ; and then treating
each rib as forming, with the corresponding one of the opposite side, a
complete arch.
   In the present paper the author applies the same method to domes of
other forms than the spherical.        The following are the kinds for which the
formulte are investigated : —
   A. The Gothic dome, of which that of the cathedral nt Florence               is a
splendid example. This kind has for its section a pointed arch formed by
two segments of circles, the centre from which each is struck being on the
springing line, but not in the axis of the dome. The author denotes by
a the angle between      the vertical and a line drawn from this centre to the
point, near the crown of the dome, where its axis is intersected by a circle
drawn around that centre with a radius equal to the mean of the radii of
the circles which generate the outer and inner surfaces of the dome, and
reduces his results to numbers for three different values of the angle a.
   B.   A dome whose inner surface is a paraboloid of revolution, the thick
ness   of the shell being uniform throughout.
   C. The dome whose surface is formed by the revolution of an ellipse
about its major axis.       In the investigation, the two surfaces are supposed
to be generated by the revolution of two concentric elliptic quadrants,
whose major axes differ from one another by the same quantity as the
minor axes, so that the thickness is very nearly uniform throughout.
   1).   A  form   of  dome   commonly used in eastern countries, sometimes
called the ogival dome, the surface of which is generated by the revolu
tion of a curve which has a point of contrary flexure.            In the investiga
tion, the author takes for this curve the curve of sines, the equation            of
which is    y'=r   sin—, where x', y' are the vertical and horizontal        coordi-
                       r
nates   of a  point in the generating curve, and supposes the outer and inner
surfaces to be generated by the revolution of two such curves, differing only
by the value of r, the origin being the same.
   The following Table exhibits the principal         results obtained from the
author's investigations.      All the domes, except the last, are supposed to be
of the uniform thickness throughout of 1 foot. In the last the thickness is
1 foot at the springing, but gets rather less towards the top.      The domes are

    In the preceding       cases, except the last, the domes            are assumed to be        of
uniform thickness.          The author finally applies his formulae to the case                  of
the spherical dome in which the thickness at the crown is one-half that at
the springing, the inner surface being generated by the revolution of a
circular quadrant whose centre is raised above the centre of that which
generates the outer surface by half the difference of the radii.                      Assuming
the outer and inner radii R,          r  to be respectively         11 feet    and   10 feet,   he
finds that the weakest point on a dome of this form appears to be at a
 height equal to -f>T R above the springing line ; and with the other nume
rical values, assumed the same as before, he finds for the horizontal thrust
at the weakest joint 55*78 lbs.
    For each kind of dome the author forms what he calls the equation of
stability, giving, for an assumed value of the height of the pier, the least
thickness t which will permit of stability.                 The following are the results
 for each kind of dome, the height of the pier being taken at 50 feet : —

    The author considers what he has found as the weakest part of a dome
 to be the position in which an iron belt must be placed to produce the
 greatest effect in counteracting the thrust of the dome.         If  this be done,
 the thickness of the pier may be considerably diminished, and need not
 greatly exceed the strength necessary        for supporting  the superincumbent
 weight acting vertically downwards.
               III. "A     Supplementary Memoir on Caustics."
          By A. Cayley, F.R.S.           Received November 15, 1866.
                                      (Abstract.)
    It is near the conclusion of my " Memoir on Caustics," Phil. Trans,
vol. cxlvii. ( 1 857), pp. 2/3, 3 1 2, remarked that for the case of parallel rays
refracted at a circle, the ordinary construction for the secondary caustic
cannot be made use of (the entire curve would in fact pass off to an infinite
distance), and that the simplest course is to measure off the distance GQ
from a line through the centre of the refracting circle perpendicular to the
direction of the incident rays. The particular secondary caustic, or ortho
gonal trajectory of the refracted rays, obtained on the above supposition
was shown to be a curve of the order 8 ; and it was further shown by con
sideration of the case (wherein the distance GQ is measured off from an
arbitrary line perpendicular to the incident rays), that the general secondary
caustic or orthogonal trajectory of the refracted rays was a curve of the
same order 8.       The last-mentioned curve in the case of reflexion, or for
      — l, degenerates into a curve of the order 6 ; and I propose in the
fi=
present supplementary memoir to discuss this sextic curve ; viz. the sextic
curve which is the general secondary caustic or orthogonal trajectory of
parallel rays reflected at a circle.

    The President then   addressed  the Society as follows : —
       Gentlemen,
 During     the autumnal recess, and in the absence of the President, the
 Treasurer, on learning that the Government had it in contemplation to
 assign the main building of Burlington House, now appropriated to the
 Royal, Chemical, and Linnean Societies, to the Royal Academy (together
with ground in its rear for the erection of additional buildings), deemed it
advisable in the interests of the Society, and after consultation with the
 Senior Secretary, to address a letter to the Earl of Derby.    The officers of
the Society were referred by his Lordship to the Chief Commissioner of
Works, by whom they were informed in reply that due provision was to be
made for the Societies,   and that the Architects,   Messrs. Banks and Barry,
with whom the Office were to advise       on the subject, were instructed to
confer with the Council of the Royal Society.         Those gentlemen having
accordingly communicated to the Council that they are directed to report
to the Government on the accommodation that can be provided for the Royal
and the other Societies in new buildings, to occupy part of the space between
Burlington House and Piccadilly, the Council have appointed a Committee
to consider the whole matter and to confer with the Architects thereupon.
The Committee have had an interview with Mr. Banks, and have handed
in a statement setting forth the nature and extent of accommodation that
will be required for the Society in lieu of their present apartments. There,
bo  far as we are informed, the matter rests for the present, but from the
tenor of the communications which have passed, there seems every reason
to feel confident that the Society will be suitably and amply provided for.
   I  had the pleasure of announcing at the last Anniversary          that the

      1866.]                       President's Address.                         271
     printing of the Catalogue of Scientific Papers, in the preparation of
     which we have been so long engaged, was at length commenced. Twenty-
     eight quarto sheets are now printed and eight more are in type.      The work
     would    now have been further advanced, had not the Superintending
3    Commitee in the mean time obtained access to additional Periodical Works,
     containing Memoirs deserving to be included in the Catalogue, and too
     numerous to warrant their being postponed for a supplement.       The printing
     has therefore been interrupted for a time in order to allow of the insertion
     of these additional titles in their proper places. Moreover, proofs of every
     sheet are supplied to several of the Members of the Library Committee who
     separately revise them ; and this mode of proceeding no doubt somewhat
    protracts the work, but it has the more than compensating advantage of
    securing the greatest attainable accuracy.
        The attention of your Council     has been much occupied in the past year
    in complying with a request from Her Majesty's Government for the advice
    and co-operation of the Royal Society in the re- organization of the Meteo
    rological Department of the Board of Trade, and in preparing the prelimi
    nary   arrangements for the establishment of a system of British Land-
    Meteorology to be carried out under the authorization of that Board.
       Perhaps there is no branch of scientific research in which a greater
    amount of human labour has been expended than has been the case in
   Meteorology, —a natural consequence of its intimate connexion in so many
   ways with the interests and pursuits of man ; and it may perhaps be said
   with equal truth that there is no department of natural knowledge in which
   the labour bestowed has beeu of a more desultory character, or the value
   and importance of the conclusions less commensurate with the time and
  labour bestowed on their acquisition.        The object to be desired, therefore,
   is scarcely so much to give a stronger impulse to the spirit of inquiry, as
  to aid in giving to that which exists a more systematic direction.          This
  has been attempted in several         of the continental States of Europe and
  America, by the establishment         at the expense  of the respective govern
  ments, and under the superintendence of men eminently qualified by
  theoretical and practical knowledge, of systematic climatological researches ;
  and, ns regards the individual states themselves, it may be confidently said
  that the results have been very beneficial.
       For some time past it has been desired to establish a closer connexion
  between these independent and separate systems of observation, by effect
  ing an assimilation of instrumental means, and of the modes and times of
  observation.     It was chiefly in this view that the assemblage   took place by
  special invitation, at the Cambridge Meeting of the British Association in
  1815, of the Directors of the principal meteorological (and magnetical)
  observatories in Europe and America ; and that a second meeting took place
  at Brussels    in 1853.     The difficulty that impeded success on these two
  occasions cannot be     better stated than in the words of Captain Maury, in
      vol. xv.                                                         z

  his Report to the Government of the United States, by whom he had been
  appointed to visit the principal European Meteorological Observatories for
  the express purpose of urging a uniformity of procedure.
     " would recommend that the United States should abandon, for the

  time at least, that part of the ' Universal System           which relates to the
  Land, and that we should direct our efforts mainly to the Sea, where there
  is such a rich harvest to be gathered for navigation and commerce.            I am
  inclined to make this recommendation in consequence of the evident reluct
  ance with which Russia, Austria,        Bavaria, Belgium, and other powers
  seem to regard' any change in their systems of meteorological observations
  on shore.     Each country     seems to have adopted a system         of its own,
  according to which its labourers have been accustomed to work, and to
  which its meteorologists are more or less partial.     Any proposition having in
 view for these systems a change so radical as to bring them into uniformity,
 and reduce them to one for all the world would,        I have reason to believe, be
  regarded with more or less   jealousy by many, — not     so, however, with regard
 to the sea ; that proposal meets with decided favour and warm support."
     The most hopeful way of removing the difficulties which impeded the
 adoption of a system in which all might willingly unite was obviously the
 introduction of instruments which should be continuously self-recording,
 and which, after sufficient trial, should receive general approval.             The
 importance of such a substitution had been recognized at the Observatory
 of the British Association at Kew at a very early date, even before the
 Cambridge Meeting of the British Association in 1845 j and at that meet
 ing the satisfactory performance was announced of a photometrically self-
 recording barometer, self-compensated also for temperature, devised by
 Mr. Francis Ronalds, the Honorary Director of the Kew Observatory, — the
 same to whose merits in regard to the instantaneous transmission of mes
 sages by means    of electricity, at the very early date of 1823, attention has
 been recently called  in the public journals.     Encouraged by this success in
 one   instrument, the Directors of the Kew Observatory proceeded, as rapidly
as the means at their disposal enabled      them to do, towards the provision of
 self-recording instruments for the other meteorological elements (as well
as for the magnetical elements), and were considerably advanced in their
preparations when in 1854 the Board of Trade informed the President and
Council that, in fulfilment of a previous earnest recommendation to that
effect from the Royal Society, they were " about to submit to Parliament an
estimate for an office for the discussion   of observations on meteorology made
at sea in all parts of the globe;"      adding that,
                                                      " as it may possibly happen
that observations on Land upon au extensive scale may hereafter be made
and discussed in the same office, it is desirable that the Royal Society should
keep in view and provide for such a contingency."
    The subject of a Government system of Meteorological Observations on
Land was again brought under the consideration of the Royal Society in a
letter from the Board       of Trade in May       1865,   and the President      and

 I860.]                          President's Address.                            273
Council were expressly requested to offer suggestions in reference to it.
The suggestions which they offered in reply have been made known to the
Society, in their leading outlines at least, in my Address of last year, and
in No. 82 of our ' Proceedings.'          They have been submitted by the Board
of Trade to     a Committee appointed by itself, whose general approval they
are understood to have        received  ; and the whole scheme is now under the
consideration of Government in respect to its cost.
   The    sea-observations,    so hopefully   spoken of by Captain Maury, were
the subject of a very full communication addressed by the President and
Council of the Royal Society to the Board of Trade in February 1855, and
the recommendations contained therein were made the basis of the instruc
tions given to the Meteorological Office of the Board of Trade at its first
formation.       The collection of what have since been comprehended under
the general designation of " Ocean Statistics
                                                       " proceeded for some time
with much activity and success under the direction of our lamented Fellow
the late Admiral FitzRoy.          His exertions and those of his assistants were
afterwards in great measure diverted to an object which, if it could be — or,
to speak more sanguinely, whenever it shall become — practically attain
able with a fair measure of scientific certainty, will assuredly both deserve
and receive in the highest degree general favour and support.                I mean
the system popularly known by the appellation of " storm-warnings."
Meanwhile, if the recommendations of the Royal Society and the inten
tions entertained by the Board of Trade shall now receive the hoped-for
sanction of the general government, the collection of ocean statistics and
their systematic combination will be resumed with fresh vigour, and with
all the aids which experience and matured scientific consideration can
afford  ;  and at the same time,     if  our hopes respecting the proposed system
of Land-Meteorology         are realized,   and if its fruits correspond in a fair
degree to the expectations which we venture to form respecting them, we
shall gradually obtain such a more complete knowledge of the laws which
govern the changes of weather in the British Islands and their vicinity, as
may enable the predictions of approaching storms or
                                                              " storm-warnings," if
now suspended, to be resumed hereafter, and at no very distant period,
with far greater confidence and more assured advantage.
   At our    last Anniversary    I acquainted you that the Legislature of Victoria
had voted the sum of £5000 for the construction of a large reflecting telescope
to be erected at Melbourne and employed in a thorough survey of the Nebulae
and multiple stars of the southern hemisphere.            They also requested the
cooperation of the President and Council of the Royal Society in arranging
a contract for the work and superintending its execution.               We selected
for the task one of our Fellows, Mr. Grubb of           Dublin,   whose  well-known
optical and mechanical talents gave sure promise of success, and we obtained
for him the advantage and assistance of a Superintending Committee, con
sisting  of our late President the Earl of Rossc, Dr. Robinson,     and  Mr. Warren
                                                                       z 2

De la Rue.    The contract for the work   was signed on the   1 9th of January ;
the progress has been rapid, and I have great pleasure in informing you
that, according to all appearance, the instrument will be ready for trial in
the spring of 186/.     All the large parts of it are ready for mounting, and
the rest considerably advanced. The lattice-tube, the appearance of which
is known to many of us from the photographs, is put together.          It is made
of ribs of steel to combine lightness and strength ; they are rolled taper to
effect this in the highest degree.    The equilibrated systems of levers which
support the great speculum, with their boxes, are of the same material and
are also completed.     Three specula have been cast on a plan differing from
that of Lord Rosse only by such modifications as were made necessary by
their having central apertures.     The first speculum came out sound from
the annealing furnace, but had two blemishes on its surface which would
have required a month to grind out, and Mr. Grubb broke it up without
hesitation, though not many years ago such a disk would have been almost
inestimable.    The second cast has been successfully ground, and its surface
is faultless.   The third,  a duplicate  speculum, was cast on the 24th of
October.     The grinding   has been performed by the polishing     machine and
steam-engine which belong to the telescope, and will accompany it to
Melbourne.      The trial-piers on which the instrument is to be set up for
the examination of the Superintending Committee, are ready.
   At  the request of the Board of Visitors of the Melbourne Observatory,
and at the recommendation of the aforenamed Superintending Committee,
I have appointed as Observer with this telescope Mr. Albert Le Sueur, a
Graduate at Cambridge and a Wrangler in 1863.         He is at present training
himself in sidereal astronomy at the Cambridge Observatory under the
guidance of Professor Adams, and will be present at the polishing of the
specula.     Mr. De la Rue     has  kindly promised    to instruct  him in the
practice of celestial photography ; so that there is reason to hope that this
magnificent instrument will be used with full intelligence and zeal, and
amply repay the munificent spirit that has guided the Legislature of this
energetic and prosperous colony.
   The large appropriation made by the Colony of Victoria for the con
struction of this telescope and for its accompanying spectroscope, and for
a suitable provision for its effective  employment at Melbourne, have not
been the only manifestation in the present year of the enlightened spirit
which animates and guides the Legislature of that colony.            A sum has
been remitted and received in this country for the purchase of a com
plete equipment of self-recording maguetical instruments on the model of
those at the Kew Observatory, to be located in the Government Reserve
adjacent to the Melbourne Astronomical Observatory, and to be employed
under the superintendence of its director, Mr. Ellcry.        The instruments
have been made and verified under the immediate care         of the Director of
the Kew Observatory, and have been despatched to their destination. The

 Bystem   of intended observation is modelled on that exemplified      at the Kew
 Observatory.
    The intention, adverted to in my last year's Address, of the Government
 of Mauritius to establish there a magnetic observatory, working with the
instruments     nnd adopting the methods exemplified at Kew, has been since
matured.       The  necessary funds have been remitted, and the instruments
are made      and   are  now under process of verification at Kew, where
Professor Meldrum,      the Director of the Mauritius Observatory, is daily ex
pected to arrive, with the view of making himself thoroughly acquainted
with the instruments, and with the processes in which they are to be em
ployed.     The geographical position of Mauritius is a very important one,
both for magnetical and meteorological observations. Hitherto meteo
rology has been exclusively pursued there, and the researches of Professor
Meldrum on the cyclonic storms which prevail in the vicinity of the
Island are well known.
   Those of our Fellows who remember the assiduity and devotion to sci
entific pursuits manifested by Mr. Charles Chambers during his employ
ment as one of the assistants of the Kew Observatory, will be glad to lcain
that he has received from the Government of Bombay the temporary ap
pointment of Superintendent of the Bombny Magnetical and Meteoro
logical Observatory, and in that capacity has been required to submit a
scheme for the reorganization of the observatory, with instruments and
methods of research suitable to the advance which has been made in thete
respects in the last twenty-five years. Mr. Chambers's report is understood
to be on its way from the Government of Bombay to the India Office, with a
view to its being submitted to the consideration of the President and Council
of the Royal Society ; and should it be approved, it will probably lead to the
permanent employment of Mr. Chambers in his present temporary position,
and to the thorough utilization of the observations of past years, in addi
tion to the prospect of most efficient work at this observatory, under the
best conditions, both personal and material, for the future.
   I have to add to the list of magnetic observatories established in the pre
sent year one at the Roman Catholic College at Stonyhurst, supplied with
the Kew instruments, and pursuing the same methods of observation and
reduction.     I refer to this with the greater satisfaction, because in addition
to the value to science of the actual work performed at the observatory, it
may be expected to be, and is expressly designed by the authorities of the
College to be a means, amongst others adopted by them, of fostering among
the students a taste for scientific pursuits, which may remain with them in
after life. For this latter purpose Stonyhurst has added to the more ordinary
modes of instruction in natural knowledge that practical instruction which
is only to be gained by working under proper tuition in observatories and
laboratories directed to special scientific pursuits, among which magnetism,
terrestrial and celestial, may now be considered to have taken its place.
   It was from the twofold motive of aiding the advancement of science by

ting to the dissemination of a taste for scientific pursuits among a large
class   of our gentry, that the Council of the Royal Society thought it       right
to allot last year from     the parliamentary grant annually placed at their
disposal,    a sum sufficient to defray half the cost of a set of mognetical in
struments for Stonyhurst.
    This is the fortieth year    since  Mr. Schwabe   began   at Dessau   his series
of observations on the Solar spots, which he has continued without inter
mission from 1826 to the present time.           Impressed with the extreme de
sirableness of continuing beyond the limits of a single life a series already
so valuable, the Committee of the Kew Observatory concerted with Mr.
Schwabe for the commencement last year at Kew of a series which should
run parallel with his for a time, and which afterwards, when the identity
or proximate identity of the two should have been established, might, it
was hoped, be prolonged indefinitely through future years. Mr.Schwabe's
observations and those at Kew have accordingly been proceeding con
temporaneously, and the comparison between their results during the ten
months from January to October 18GG inclusive, gives reason to believe
that the object will be satisfactorily attained.      The number of new groups
of spots observed at the two stations in the ten months is identical, and
very similar, if not always quite identical, in each single month ; although,
as might have been expected from the difference between the continental
and insular climates, the number of days of observation at Kew is consider
ably less than at Dessau.
     The results of the first year's experiments with the pendulums which
 were    noticed in my last year's Address        as having been    supplied to the
 Indian Trigonometrical Survey, have been received from Colonel Walker,
 11. A., F.R.S., Superintendent of the Survey.        They were made by Captain
 Iiasevi at several stations where the triangulation is now proceeding.         In a
 letter to myself accompanying them, dated August 30 of the present year,
 Colonel Walker says, " Already these experiments are beginning to throw
 light on the subject of Himalayan attraction ; for the observations clearly
 show that the force of gravity is less than it should be theoretically at
 the stations in the vicinity of the Himalayas, and that the difference between
 theory and practice diminishes the further the station is removed from the
 Himalayas.        This seems a remarkable confirmation of the Astronomer
 Royal's opinion, that the strata of the earth below mountains are less
 dense than the strata below plains and the bed of the sea.             Combining

  In our Transactions of the present year we have an elaborate and valuable
memoir by Mr. Abel "On the Manufacture andCompositiou of Gun-cotton,"
pointing out the causes of the difference in the analytical results obtained
by many of the earlier inquirers into its nature, and confirming its compo
sition as determined by Crum and more fully proved by Hadow, and again
stated by the Committee of Chemists who reported on Baron von Lenk's
Gun-cotton.     In pursuing these analytical inquiries, Mr. Abel has tested
the methods, both synthetical and analytical, formerly employed, and has
devised some modes of analysis of his own.     The multiplied and varied
experiments which he has made leave no room to doubt the accuracy of
his results, though they differ from those of M. Pelouze.
   With regard to the processes of manufacture, Mr. Abel has proved by
experiments, both in the laboratory and on a manufacturing scale, that
Baron von Lenk's method, although it does not at first sight present any
important features of novelty, yet unquestionably ensures the attainment of
greater uniformity and purity of the product, though Mr. Abel has him
self   suggested     one or two modifications   of importance.        The most valuable
practical   result deducedby Mr. Abel from his experiments        that the      is,
instability which has been observed in certain samples of gun-cotton, pro
ducing the gradual decomposition of such samples by prolonged keeping,                    is
due to insufficient purification of the material employed, in consequence of
which oxidized products of small quantities of resinous and other foreign
substances are formed in the manufacture, and are still retained by the tu
bular fibre of the cotton.   These undergo decomposition, and the change
extends  to  the mass.  Many of these impurities arc removed by the action
of the alkaline bath upon the cotton before treating with the nitric and sul

the instruction derived from them of comparatively little value.    The pro
duction of an apparatus by  which the actual strain experienced in successive
parts of the bore may be recorded, is in fact the first step in a scientific
inquiry which should establish the proper relations between the1 form of
the cartridge and the gun.    But for the production of an efficient appara
tus for this purpose, a chronoscope of greater delicacy and perfection than
any we have hitherto possessed in England is indispensable.       A chrono
scope recently devised by Captain Schultz of the French Artillery appears, as
far as can be judged previous to a practical trial, to correspond to these
conditions, and to be likely to supply a means of surmounting the difficulty             ;
it is not improbable that it will be tried in the present year.
     I proceed to the award of the Medals.
     The Copley Medal has been awarded to Professor          Julius Pliicker, Foreign
Member of the Royal Society, for his researches             in Analytical Geometry,
Magnetism, and Spectral Analysis.
     To   an audiencenot exclusively mathematical it is obviously impossible
to enter into details of researches which deal with geometrical questions of
no ordinary difficulty.     Amongst these, however, may be indicated, as
especially appreciated by those who are interested in the progress of ana
lytical geometry, his theory of the singularities of plane curves as developed
in the " Algebriiische Curven," with its six equations connecting them
with the order of the curves : the papers on point and line coordinates and
on the general use of symbols, may also be noticed as establishing his claim
to a position in the department of abstract science which is attained by
few even of those who give to it their undivided attention.  But Professor
Pliicker has high merits in two other widely different fields of research,
viz. in Magnetism and Spectrology : and to these I may more freely invite
your attention.
   Shortly after Faraday's discovery of the sensibility of bodies generally to
the action of a magnet and of diamagnetism, Professor Pliicker, in re
peating some of Faraday's experiments, was led to the discovery of magne-
crystnllic action, — that      is,
                            that  crystallized body behaves differently in the
                                        a
magnetic field according to the orientation of certain directions in the
crystal.    The crystals first examined were optically uniaxal, and       wasit
found that the optic axis was driven into the equatorial position (that is, of
                                                                       ;
course, assuming that the magnecrystallic action     not masked, in conse
                                                            is
quence of the external form of the body, by the paramagnetic or diamag-
nctic character of the substance).  New facts, discovered both by Faraday
and      by
        Pliicker himself, led him to modification of this law, to the effect
                                             a
that the optic axis was impelled, according to the nature of the crystal,
either into the equatorial or the axial position.  This subject was after
wards followed out      by
                       Professor Pliicker into the more complicated cases
in which the conditions of crystalline symmetry are such as to leave the
crystal optically biaxal   ;    and after having recognized the insufficiency   of   a

  1866.]                          President's Address.                            279
  first empirical generalization of    the law applicable to crystals    of the rhom-
  bohedral or pyramidal system, and accordingly to uniaxal crystals, he was
  led to assimilate a crystal to an assemblage of small ellipsoids, capable of
  magnetic induction, having for their principal planes the planes of crystal
 line symmetry where such exist ; and to apply Poisson's theory.              The re
 sult of this investigation is contained in an elaborate paper read before the
 Royal Society in 1857, and published in the PhilosophicalTrausnctions              for
 the following year.       In this paper Professor Plucker has deduced from
  theory, and verified by careful experiments, the mathematical laws which
 regulate the magnecrystallic action.          These laws have not necessarily in
 volved in them the somewhat artificial hypothesis respecting the magnetic
 structure of a crystal from which they were deduced ; and at the close of
 his memoir Professor Plucker recognizes the theory of Professor Sir William
 Thomson, with which he then first became acquainted, as a sound basis on
 which they might be established.           The laws, however, remain identically
 the same in whichever way they may be derived.
     Another subject to which Professor Pliicker has paid much attention is the
 curious action of powerful magnets on the luminous electric discharge in glass
 tubes containing highly rarefied gas.        In this case the luminous discharge
 is found to be concentrated along certain curved lines or surfaces.           He has
 succeeded in obtaining the mathematical definition of these curved lines or
 surfaces,  by  a simple application of the known laws of electromagnetic ac
 tion, regarding an element of the discharge as the element of an electric
 current.    With regard to the blue negative light, for instance, starting
 from a point in the negative electrode, he has shown that there are two
 totally distinct paths, one or other of which, according to circumstances, it
 may take, going either within the enclosed space along a line of magnetic
 force, or else along the surface of the glass in what he calls an
                                                                            "
                                                                              epipolic
curve," which is the locus of a point in which the inner surface of the ves
sel is touched by the line      of magnetic force passing through that point.
     Angstrom appears to have been the first to notice that the spectrum of
the electric spark striking between metallic electrodes through air on an
other gas at ordinary pressures is a compound one, consisting of very bright
lines varying with the metal, and others, usually less bright, depending only
on the gas.      Under the circumstances which         presented  themselves in his
experiments, the latter can frequently be but       ill observed  ;  and the diffused
light of   a rarefied gas in a wide tube is but faint, and does not form very
definite spectra.     But Plucker found that by employing          tubes which were
capillary in one     part, brilliant light and definite spectra     were obtained in
the   narrow   part.    These    spectra were  observed   by  him   with great care,
and were found to be characteristic of the several gases and to indicate
their chemical nature, though the gases might be present in such minute
quantity as utterly to elude chemical research. It further appeared that
compound gases of any kind were instantaneously, or almost instantaueously,

decomposed ; at least the spectra they offered                were   the spectra of their
constituents.
    In   a recent memoir, which has only just hcen published in the Philoso
phical Transactions, Professor Plucker has investigated the two totally dif
ferent spectra frequently afforded by the same elementary substance accord
ing as it is submitted to the instantaneous discharge of a Ley den jar charged
by an induction-coil, or rendered incandescent by the simple discharge of
the coil, or else, in some cases, by ordinary flames.   The two spectra show
a remarkable difference in character, and are not merely different in the
number and position of the lines which they show. Some phenomena
which he had previously noticed receive             their explanation by this twofold
spectrum.
   This difference of spectra is attributed by Professor Pliicker, with the
greatest probability, to a difference in the temperature of the flowing gas
when the two are respectively produced.       The discovery opens up a new
field of research, the exploration of which may throw much light on the
correct interpretation of celestial phenomena, especially in relation to the
physical condition of nebular and cometary matter.

    A Royal Medal            has   been   awarded to     Mr. William Huggins for his
Researches on the Spectra of some of the Chemical Elements, aud on the
Spectra of certain of the Heavenly Bodies ; and especially for his Re
searches on the Spectra of the Nebulae, published in the Philosophical
Transactions.
   The researches on the stellar spectra referred to in this award were made
by Mr. Huggins conjointly with our highly valued Treasurer and senior
Vice-President, Dr. William Allen Miller.       The position of the latter as
one of the officers of the Society and a member of its Council has forbidden
the consideration of his claims to share in the honours which the Society
can bestow; and in conformity with the spirit of this, our

1866.]                        President's Address.                         281
    Fraunhofer,   Lamont, and others have at various times attempted to ob
serve the spectra   of the planets and fixed stars ; yet, though provided with
powerful instruments, they obtained no important results.
    Mr. Huggins and Dr. Miller devised a method of seeking in the spectra
of the fixed stars that evidence of the existence in them of known elementary
substances which had been obtained in the case of the sun by Bunsen and
Kirchhoff.     A preliminary investigation of the spectra of the more im
portant of the terrestrial chemical elements, and their direct comparison
with the lines in the spectrum of common air, was undertaken by Mr.
Huggins, with the view of providing a standard scale of comparison, which,
unlike the solar spectrum, would be always at hand when stellar observa
tions are possible. This was in itself a work of enormous labour ; and when
completed, the spectra of the fixed stars, including those of some double
stars of contrasted colours, were attacked by the two investigators ; and
by a happy adaptation of comparatively moderate instrumental means, and
unwearied diligence in observing and determining by micrometrical mea
surements the positions of objects that all but elude human vision, their
researches have been rewarded by the most complete success.
    The spectra of the stars were compared by a method of simultaneous
observation with the spectra of many of the terrestrial elements.         It is
upon this method of direct comparison that the trustworthiness of the
results obtained chiefly depends, and in this respect these observations
stand alone.     [In 1815 Fraunhofer recognized several of the solar lines in
the spectra of the Moon, Venus, and five of the fixed stars. In 1862
Donati published      diagrams of three or four lines in fifteen stars.     Re
cently Secchi, Rutherford, and the Astronomer Royal have given dia
grams of the positions, obtained by measurement only, of a few strong
lines in several   stars.]   Eighteen stars have afforded spectra containing
lines coinciding with the lines of many of the elementary substances.        In
 thirty-seven more the spectra are full of lines which have not yet been
fully compared.
    On extending    these researches  to the Nebulae,   Mr. Huggins made the
 most unexpected discovery that the spectra of certain of these bodies arc
 discontinuous, consisting of bright lines only, whence he drew the conclu
 sion that  " in place  of an incandescent solid or liquid body transmitting
light of all rcfrangibilities through an atmosphere which intercepts by ab
 sorption a certain number of them — such as our sun appears to be — we
must probably regard these objects, or at least their photo-surfaces, as
enormous masses of luminous gas or vapour.          For it is alone from matter
in a gaseous state that light consisting of certain definite refrangibilities
only, as is the case with the light of these nebulae, is known to be emitted."
    During the last two years Mr. Huggins has examined the spectra of more
than sixty nebula; and clusters. This examination shows that these re
 markable bodies may be divided into two great groups : viz. 1st, true or
 gaseous nebulae, which furnish a discontinuous spectrum, consisting of two

282                           Anniversary Meeting.                     [Nov. 30,
or three bright lines only ; and 2nd, what we may distinguish as spuriou*
 nebulee, or nebulous matter with clusters, which give a spectrum apparently
 continuous.     Of the latter group a large proportion show signs of resol-
vability   into clusters by telescopes of high power.
    In the present year also Mr. Huggins has made a remarkable observa
tion upon the small comet, known as comet No. 1, 1866.            lie ascertained
 that the minute nucleus gave a gaseous or discontinuous spectrum ; whilst
 the spectrum of the coma, as though formed by suspended particles which
 reflected solar light, gave a continuous spectrum.
    Since the publication of these results by Mr. Huggins, our investigators
 have examined with great care the spectrum of the star which is either new
or has greatly increased in brilliancy in Corona borealis, and have found
that that star has     a spectrum of absorption, and also   a gaseous    spectrum
of   which hydrogen is probably the source.        They  have also connected,    in
one instance at least, the change      in a variable star with a  variation  in its
spectrum.
    Discoveries like these, which acquaint us not only with the constituents
of the heavenly bodies but also with their state of aggregation, are of the
nature of those which occur only once in the course of centuries, — like
the discovery of the satellites of planets, of solar spots, or of double star?,
— and have the strongest possible claim on the Royal Society for such
honours as the Society has at its disposal.
        Mr. Huggins,
    It  gives  me the greatest    pleasure to present you with this Medal : a
testimonial of the very high estimation in which your successful labours
(conjointly with Dr. Miller) are held by the Society, which has the satis
faction of regarding you as one of its most distinguished Members.            You
are    at an age at which you may reasonably indulge in the prospect of
having a long career before you ; yet, however long, it will scarcely exhaust
the noble field of research which you have opened for yourself, and which
is one in which you are quite sure to be accompanied by the sympathy of
men of science throughout the world.

published    in the   Philosophical Transactions.     In these elaborate and
beautifully illustrated memoirs, Mr. Parker has not only displayed an ex
traordinary acquaintance with the details of Osteology, but has shown
powers of anatomical investigation of a high order, and has made important
contributions    towards the establishment of the true theory of the vertebrate
skull.
       Mr. William Kitchen Parker,
    I present  you with this Medal in testimony of the high esteem in which
 your investigations are held by those of our body who are qualified to
 appreciate them, and who look at once with approval and with expectation
 at the increased and still increasing interest of the communications contri
 buted by you to our Transactions.
    The Council have awarded the Rumford Medal to M. Armand Hippo-
 lyte Louis Fizeau for his Optical Researches, and especially for his Inves
 tigations into the Effect of Ileat on the Refractive Power of Transparent
 Bodies.
    In  1849   M. Fizeau   rose into celebrity as the experimenter who first
 succeeded in measuring the velocity of light by observations limited to
 objects on the surface of the earth.      He noted the time required for the
 passage of light from the place of the observer to a mirror, normal to the
 path of the light, 8633 metres distant, and back again, by means of a
 wheel having 720 teeth revolving rapidly.        When the wheel made 1 26
 revolutions in 10 seconds, the light that had passed through the notch
 between two teeth towards the mirror was stopped completely on its re
 turn, after reflexion, by the second of the two teeth ; showing that the light
 had travelled 17,266 metres while the wheel had revolved through half the
 angle subtended at its centre by the distance between the summits of two
 adjacent teeth, or xtti^it second.
     In 1859 he wrote a remarkable memoir,     "Sur une experience qui paratt
 demontrer que le mouvement des corps change la vitesse avec laquelle
 la lumiere se propage dans leur interieur."
     His " Methode propre k rechercher si l'azimuth de polarisation du
 rayon refracte est influence par le mouvement du corps refringent" (1860)
 involves such complicated arrangements that great hesitation was felt
  about accepting the results. But whoever has seen his experiments on the

expansion and the alteration of the refrangibility of bodies when heated,
is not disposed to question any conclusions regarded by Fizeau himself as
well founded.
    In  1862 he published
                                 " Recherches sur      les modifications    que  subit la
vitesse   de la lumiere dans        le verre et plusieurs      autre corps solides sons
l'influencc dc la chalcur,"     — the first of  a scries  of memoirs on the change of
dimensions and        refractive powers of various kinds of glass, and many crys
tallized substances.
    On the    2.'5rd   of May,    186-1, he read before the Institut "Recherches
sur la dilatation et la double refraction du cristal de roche cchauflv ;" and
on the 21st and 28th of May, 1866,                 " Mumoires sur la dilatation        des
corps solides par la chaleur."
    In  these observations he has availed himself          of the possibility of forming
Newton's rings with the monochromatic sodium light when one of the in
terfering rays is 52,205 waves in advance' of the other, a fact which, con
jointly with M. Foucault, he announced in 1849. Using the length of a
wave of sodium light (0 0005888 millimetre) as the standard of measure,
the position of a ring being observable to within -fc of the distance be
tween two consecutive rings, the variation of the distance between                    two
surfaces producing         the Newton's rings can be measured to within            ^ J^-j-
millimetre.
    A  plate of the substance to be experimented on (let us suppose it to be
 fluor), usually from 10 to 15 millimetres thick, bounded by parallel plane
 surfaces, rests upon the platform of a metal tripod (the metal was steel in
 the earlier observations, platinum with -j1^ of iridium in the later).              The
 feet of the tripod are screws of equal lengths terminating above in obtuse
 points.    On these points, at a distance of about ^ millimetre above the
 upper surface of the fluor, rests a plate of glass. By counting the number
 of rings or bands that pass over a mark on the upper surface of the fluor
 during a given change of temperature, the corresponding variation of dis
 tance   between     the lower surface of the glass and the upper surface of the
 fluor is given, and the expansion of the metal being known by a similar
process, the expansion of the fluor is found.
    The Newton's rings formed          between   the two surfaces of the fluor depend
upon its thickness and its refractive power.                The number of rings that
pass over the mark on the fluor during a given change of temperature being
observed, and its expansion having been found by the preceding observa
tion, the change of its refractive power due to the change of temperature
 becomes known.
    In this way M. Fizcau obtained             several   very unexpected results.      Of
 these a few may be noticed.
    The indices of refraction of most       substances were found cither to increase
 or to remain unaltered with an increase of temperature, but in fluor the
 index of refraction diminishes with an increase of temperature.               Diamond,
 cuprite, and beryl have a maximum density, like water diamond at         —

 — 42°-3   C,    cuprite at — 4°-3, and beryl at — 4°-2. Beryl, when heated,
 unlike calcite, contracts in the direction of its axis, and expands in a
 direction making right angles with the axis.          Quartz, rutile, cassiterite,
 spartalite, corundum, and hematite were found to expand in every direc
tion when    heated    ; but in each case the expansion in the direction of the
principal axis was different from the expansion in a direction at right angles
to the principal axis.
    M. Fizeau is also the author of many other important          researches — on
Moser's images, on photography, on the automatic engraving of photogra
phic images on copper, on the interference of rays of heat, on electricity
and the velocity of its propagation, and on the position of the plane of po
larization of light reflected from striated metallic surfaces.

 I. " Discussion       of Tide-Observations at Bristol." By T. G. Bunt,
     Esq. Communicated by the Astronomer lloyal.                Received October
     24, 1866.
                                      (Abstract.)
     This Paper contains the results of a Discussion of about 19,000 obser
 vations of Times and Heights of High Water at Bristol, for the purpose of
 obtaining the Empirical Laws of the Diurnal Inequalities of the Times and
 Heights, and of the Solar Inequality of the Times, of the tides       at that port.
 Curves on Diagrams which accompany the Paper exhibit the results.
     The Observations were taken by a Self-registering Tide-Gauge, the
 Clock of which has from the first been regulated by transit observation.
     The Diurnal Inequalities of the tides     at   Bristol are not large, that of
 time averaging only 2 minutes (earlier or later),, and that of height 24
 inches (greater or less).
     Although it was stated by Sir John W. Lubbock (in 1839) that the diurnal
 inequality in time is too minute to be observed on our coasts, the slightest
 examination of the Diagram (No. 4) will be sufficient to show that
 this remark is inapplicable to Bristol. On this diagram are laid down
 the times and heights of tide registered there during six months of the
 year    1865.    In   consequence   of the tranquil state of the weather, the
 agreement of the      observed  with the predicted times was unusually close ;
 the average error in time, during the six months, being only 2| minutes,
 and for six weeks less than 1*9 minute.          The diurnal inequality, of time
 as well as    of height, is throughout the diagram most conspicuous ; and
  the agreement      of the calculated with the observed inequality close and
 satisfactory.
     For  each  of the Diurnal Inequalities, the residues, or errors, of the cal
 culated Times and      Heights were arranged for every half month, and for
 each of the twenty-four hours of Lunar transit, making (24 x 24 = ) 576
 Groups.      The averages of these, laid down in Curves, are shown in Dia

described in the previous paper, the authors now proceed to relate                                                                                       what
further experiments have been made.
   In the preliminary experiments it was conclusively shown (art. 8) that
the effect on the pile caused by rotation of the disk was due to radiant
heat, and also (art. 9) that this effect was not due to the heating of the
rock-salt, which in most of the experiments was placed before the mouth
of the cone.
   It was also rendered probable that the effect was not due to radiation
from heated air, by the two following considerations : —
   (1) Because in order that nearly dry air of such a tenuity might give
such a radiation it would require to be heated enormously.
   (2) Because when the lampblack was removed from the aluminium disk,
leaving it a rough metallic surface, the indication afforded by the galvano
meter was reduced to about one-fourth of the amount with the blackened
disk.
  The following observations tend to strengthen this proof : —
  (3) The heating effect is the same in hydrogen or in coal-gas                                                                      as         in air,
although there is no question that the absorptive, and therefore the radia
tive power of coal-gas is much greater than that of air. This is shown by
the following sets of experiments, which were made with the blackened
aluminium disk insulated with ebonite, and with rock-salt in the cone.

     (3) The heat indication afforded                                                                            by         an ebonite disk           is   against the con
clusion that this effect                                     is          due to rotation under the earth's magnetic force.
   It would therefore appear to be proved that                                                                                               in these experiments the
increased temperature of the aluminium disk                                                                                             is   not due to rotation under
the earth's magnetic force.
     1        It
          might perhaps be said that the heating of the disk may be due
         9.
to heat conducted from the bearings into the disk and then distributed
outwards              ;         will require to be examined, since the bear
                                    and this conjecture
ings are, no doubt, heated       friction during the motion. This heating               by
effect on the bearings was measured        means of    very delicate thermo                                                by                     a
meter, which was inserted into     small hole in the bush through which oil                      a
is  supplied to the spindle, and made to be in metallic contact with the
sides of this hole the mean of three observations made the heating effect
                                               ;
at the spindle due to rotation to be 4° Fahr.
     In the next place, the aluminium disk, separated from                                                                                                        its metallic
spindle by the ebonite washer, and in every respect the same as when
made to rotate, had its spindle heated artificially by  mercury bath, gene                                                                        a
rally at least 40° Fahr. above the previous temperature. After the lapse of
two minutes the effect upon the pile was hardly perceptible — not more
than five divisions.
      1)      It      would                  appear from this experiment that the heating effect ob

294        Messrs. Balfour Stewart and Tait on              the  Heating      [Dec. 6,
served   in rotation     cannot be due to heat conducted from the bearings
through    the ebonite washer, since a temperature difference between the
bearings and the disk ten times greater than that produced by rotation
causes a heating effect at least six times less than that caused by rotation
in  a somewhat less time.
    (2) The ebonite washer used to prevent the heat of the bearings from
reaching the aluminium disk, is a cylindrical disk, its thickness being two-
tenths of an inch, and the area of one of its faces 3-15 square inches.              It
is shielded behind by a brass disk, of similar size, which brass disk being
near the bearings, and metallically connected with them, we may suppose
to have the same temperature as the bearings.                   Thus one face of the
ebonite washer      is  in  contact  with  brass,   having the temperature of the
bearings, while the other is in contact with the aluminium disk.                  Sup
posing that this washer, used to protect the aluminium disk from the heat
of the bearings, was of iron instead of being of ebonite, we can calculate
approximately from Principal Forbes's determinations of the absolute
conductivity of this metal, how much heat would be conducted across the
washer during the experiment.            According to these observations, if a cube
of iron whose side is one foot, have one of its faces kept permanently at
a temperature 1° C. higher          than the opposite face,       the quantity of heat
conducted across       in  one minute    will  be  -Oil unit nearly,   a unit denoting
the amount of heat required to raise a cubic foot of water 1° C. Since
in these observations both the temperature difference and the unit are
expressed in the same thermometric degrees, we may, if we choose, sub
stitute degrees Fahr. for degrees         Centigrade in the above expression for
conductivity.     Now, if we assume as an approximation that during the
whole experiment of rotation the heat conducted across such a washer
is the same as if for one minute the temperature difference between both
sides of the washer were kept at 2° Fnhr., and if we make allowance for
 the surface and for the thickness of the washer, we obtain the following
expression as approximately representing the heat conducted across the
washer during the experiment,
                   Heat=-011 x        2x^|x^|=-028            unit nearly,
                                          144      '2
where the first factor is on account of the double temperature difference,
 the second on account of the surface, and the third on account of the
thickness.
    But  a unit  of heat in the above expression denotes the amount necessary
 to raise a cubic foot of water (or nearly 1000 ounces) 1° Fahr.              Now the
 weight of the disk is 10-5 ounces, and its specific heat is 0-22.           Hence the
 above amount of heat will raise the disk
                   '028 X    l~ X ~=
                              10-o   -22
                                            1 2° Fahr. in temperature.
    Hence we    see  that   if the material of the washer had been of the metal
bismuth,    of which the conductivity is       7  times less than that of iron, and   if

 1866.]               of a  Disk by rapid Rotation in vacuo.                 295
 we suppose the circumstances of the experiment to be equivalent to a tem
 perature difference of 2° Fahr. between the two sides of the washer lasting
 for one minute, then the quantity of heat conducted across the washer will
 be a little greater than that observed.       But the conductivity of ebonite is
 no doubt very much less than that of bismuth, and therefore on this
 account we cannot suppose that the heating effect observed is due to
 conduction.
     (3)  In this investigation no account has been taken of the unequal dis
 tribution of temperature from the centre to the circumference of the disk,
 the tendency of which would be to diminish the effect upon the pile (which
 was directed to the circumference of the disk) of the heat passing through
 the washer ; and indeed, when this element is taken into account, it is not
 surprising to find,    as was actually the case, that in some preliminary ex
 periments,   where   the  disk was metallically connected with the spindle, the
 effect was not greater than with the ebonite washer.
     (4) The short time in which the effect attains its maximum value is
 against the supposition that it is caused by conduction from the bearings.
     (5) The fact that (as we shall afterwards see) the temperature effect in
 three aluminium disks of different thicknesses is inversely proportional     to
 the thickness, is also against this supposition.
     (6)   And   so  is the fact that   a  heat-effect  obeying apparently the
same laws, holds for an ebonite disk in which there is but a very feeble
conduction.
     On the whole, therefore,     we cannot suppose this effect to be due to
 conduction,    or at least we must conclude that the effect of conduction con
 stitutes only an exceedingly small fraction of that observed.
     20. Itwas suggested to the authors by Professor Stokes and by Mr. Grove,
that the effect might be due to vibrations of the disk, the energy of which,
owing    to the viscosity   of the disk for such vibrations, might ultimately
become converted into heat ; and it is necessary to examine this question.
     (1) The thickest aluminium disk was found to be out of truth not more
than -015 inch on each side.        Hence, the thickness of this disk being -05
inch, when turned with moderate rapidity, its apparent thickness should be
                              -015+,05 + -Q15=-08;
and experiment showed that when turned very fast, its apparent thickness
was no greater. The greatest possible range of vibrations of the disk at
its circumference could not, therefore, be more than -015 inch on either
side of the position of rest.
    Again, it was ascertained by means of the note given by this disk, that
it vibrates about 250 times per second.
    Let us suppose the whole mass to have the same range of excursion
(this will of course increase the result), the equation of vibration (not
allowing for loss by viscosity) is

                    = weight of disk in pounds through -fa of        a foot.
   But an approximate experiment performed by causing the disk to ring,
and noticing how long the sound lasted, would seem to show that probably
the energy of vibration of the disk diminishes at first, and therefore con
stantly (if it is maintained) at the rate of the whole in 3 seconds.           Hence
in 30 seconds it loses 10 times as much as the whole ; that is to say, in 30
seconds the heat produced cannot be greater than that due to the energy
produced by the disk falling under gravity through \% of a foot.                  Re
ducing   this  to its  heat-equivalent,  the  greatest possible   heat  effect due to
vibration during 30 seconds rapid turning will be less than
                                                  *ahr"
                         16X 772X;22-272
which is   a  very small fraction of the effect observed.
   (2) The thin aluminium disk was out of truth about "02 inch on each
side.   Its note of vibration was as nearly as possible one octave lower
than that of the thick disk, while its coefficient of viscosity was some
what greater, say in the proportion of 3 to 2, than that of the thick
disk.   On the supposition that the heat generated is due to vibration, if
we call the heat generated during        30 seconds in the thick disk =1, then
that generated during the same time in the thin disk ought to be
where the first factor is on account of difference of time of vibration, the
second on account of difference of range, the third on account of difference
of mass, and the fourth on account        of difference of viscosity.
   But the heating effect (as far as quantity of heat is concerned) produced
in the thin disk is as nearly as possible the same as that produced in the
thick disk.
   This fact is therefore against the hypothesis that the heating effect is
due to vibration.
   (3) In order to estimate the effect (if any) of want of truth in the disk,
the thick aluminium disk was purposely put out of truth about 3| times

1866.]                 of a  Disk by rapid Rotation in vacuo.                      297
its usual amount ; but the heating effect was as nearly as possible the
same in both cases, being 32 divisions of the scale in both.
    On all these grounds it would appear that the heating effect cannot be
due to vibration of the disk.
    21. It is hardly necessary to mention that the heating effect cannot be
 due to radiation and convection from the wheelwork, which is no doubt
slightly heated during the experiment, for the mass of this metallic matter
is so great, that we cannot imagine it to be heated more than 1° Fahr.
 Now the radiation from this against the back of the disk may certainly be
neglected, while the convection must be very small, since in the experi
 ments the pressure of the air was very small.            Besides, the heating effect,
as   will be seen shortly, was found to be independent of the pressure.
    22. It has thus been shown that the disk is heated during the experi
ment, and that this heating effect —
    (1) Is not due to rotation under the earth's magnetic force ;
    (2) Is not due to conduction of heat from the bearings ;
    (3) Nor to radiation or convection from the wheelwork ;
    (4) Nor to vibrations of the disk.
And in view of the large and constant nature of this heating             effect it may
be asserted that it cannot be sensibly due,           either to one of these causes
singly, or to their combined effect.
     23.  It will  now be shown that the heating effect is independent both
of the density and chemical constitution of the residual air and vapour
around the disk.
     In art. 16,  if  we compare together        the 7th, 8th, 9th, 10th, 11th, and
 12th sets of experiments, we shall see          that the heating effect was sensibly
the    same, whether the residual gas was atmospheric air, or hydrogen cr
 coal-gas.
    As hydrogen diffuses very quickly, it might perhaps be supposed that
when heated by rotation it might find access to the pile through the rock-
salt cover more easily than heated atmospheric air, so that while the whole
 effect might appear the same in hydrogen as in air, yet only part of that
in hydrogen might          be due to radiant heat, the remainder being due to
heated gas which had obtained access to the pile.             This was, however, dis
proved by an experiment, which showed that by blackening the interior
of the cone, the effect upon the pile was just as much diminished in a
hydrogen vacuum as in an air vacuum            ;  and hence in both cases the whole
 effect is due to radiant heat.
     But, besides the residual gas, it may with truth be supposed that there
 is always more or less of aqueous vapour, and also a little of the vapour of
 oil, and perhaps of the vapour of mercury in the receiver. As regards the
 hygromctric     state  of the residual air and its influence on the disk, this would
 appear to be of the following nature : —
     (1) When the vacuum has just been made, there is generally a hygro-
 rnetric difference between the air and the surface of the disk, ou account of

298         On Heating of a Disk by rapid Rotation in vacuo.            [Dec. 6,
which there is a strictly temporary effect, either in the direction of heat or
cold, at the surface of the disk, owing probably to condensation or evapora
tion of small quantities of aqueous vapour ; but this effect disappears the
 moment the motion is stopped, leaving behind the permanent effect ap
parently unaltered.
    (2) This temporary effect disappears when the disk has been left for
 some hours    in the vacuum.
    Next, with regard to vapour of oil, we cannot suppose its effect to be so
large or so different in character and constancy from that of aqueous vapour
 as to account for the effect observed.        Add to this that the effect takes
 place  with  an uncoated metallic     disk probably to the same extent as with
 a coated  one.    The  same remark may be made       with regard to vapour of
 mercury.     The effect would therefore appear to be independent of the che
 mical nature of the residual gas and vapour around the disk.
    In order to prove that this effect is also independent of the pressure of
 the residual gas, it is only necessary to refer to the whole body of experi
 ments which have been        described, to see  that between 4 inches aud 0-25
 inch there is no perceptible variation in the effect observed.
    24. The following generalization may now be made : —
    (1)  If  a perfectly true aluminium disk (without vibrations)    be made to
 rotate in  a  vertical plane at the earth's surface, after the manner herein
 described, there will be an increase of the temperature of the disk, which
is not due to communication of heat from the bearings or machinery, nor
to the earth's magnetic force.
    (2) This heating    effect is independent  of the density and chemical con
stitution of the residual air and vapour which surround the disk.
    (3) It is probable that the quantity of heat developed in disks of similar
extent of surface and similar circumstances of motion is the same.          For,
in the first place, the quantity of heat developed in three aluminium disks,
 •05, '0375, "025 of an inch in thickness respectively, would appear to be
the same, the relative thermometric effect for these disks varying inversely
as their thickness, and being in the following proportions, 30, 43, 60, as
determined by one complete set of experiments.
    Again, the quantity of heat developed in the thick aluminium disk, with
its surfaces both uncoated, was probably the same as when one surface was
coated and one left bare, or as when both surfaces were coated.
    25. The authors will not attempt here a further generalization, but
they would desire to make one remark.             In absence of definite know
ledge of the nature of that medium which transmits radiant light and
heat, it might be supposed possible that when a radiant body is in rapid
motion, the intensity of its radiation is somewhat increased.         But if we
bear in mind that in these experiments the effect was observed after
bringing the disk to rest, and that the temporary effect during rotation
sometimes observed can probably be otherwise accounted for, we are
forced to conclude that, as far as we may judge from these experiments

(and they are of a very delicate nature), there is no perceptible effect of
motion upon radiation.
    In conclusion    the authors desire to say that they are much indebted to
Mr. Beckley, who not only invented the apparatus, but              assisted at all the
experiments, and without whom they could not have been performed in a
manner so satisfactory.      They are also indebted to Mr. Atkinson for his
kindness in lending them a large gasometer, and to Mr. Browning and
Mr. Ladd for exceedingly true aluminium and ebonite disks.
III. "    On the Bones of Birds at different Periods of their Growth."
       By John Davy, M.D., F.R.S., &c.                    Received      October 28,
       1866.
   In  this paper   I beg to submit to the Royal Society the results of some
further observations on the bones of birds, and more especially on those
bones which in the adult contain air.
    In offering them,   I would wish them to be considered as a continuation
of those communicated       on a former occasion, and published in the Pro
ceedings of the Society*.
   In engaging in the inquiry     I have had     two objects chiefly in view : one
to endeavour to determine whether at an early stage the bones, which at
maturity contain air, differ essentially from those of birds which           are then,
and are permanently filled with marrow ; another, to endeavour to ascer
tain in the instance of the former, the rate at which their early contents
are absorbed, or an approximation to the time that air takes the place of
the medulla.
   The birds of the first kind subjected to observation have been the follow
ing : the common fowl, dnck, goose, turkey, pheasant, partridge, grouse,
rook, common crow, owl, sparrow-hawk, buzzard, blue tit ; of the second
kind, the woodeock, blackbird, water-ouzel, marten, swift, greenfinch, tit
lark, sparrow, stonechat, blackcap, yellow ammer, little sandpipe, canary.
   I. Of the Common Fowl. — Of this bird I have examined the bones at
different ages in a large number of instances.          A few are selected as most
characteristic   : —
   1.  Of  a foetal chick taken from the egg on the fourteenth day of incu
bation, the bones of the extremities were much advanced, the inferior more
than the superior. Their epiphyses were almost gelatinous ; but the shafts
were partially ossified, and had already some firmness.                  In  both the
humeri and femora, medullary matter was found.              It was of    a red colour,
and under      the microscope exhibited the usual character of this tissue.
Broken up, in each were seen numerous oil-globules, with which were
mixed blood-corpuscles and other corpuscles of a smaller size, some circular,
some   of an irregular form.

300                    Dr. John Davy      on the Bones  of Birds.         [Dec. 6,
   2.   A chicken     twenty-eight days old, reckoning from the time of hatching,
was found dead on the 12th          of January ; during the preceding night there
had been a severe frost.         It weighed 10,275 grs. ; one of its humeri in its
moist state weighed        2-5 grs. ; one of its femora 8 grs.    In each of them
a soft red medullary matter was detected, which, like the preceding, was
composed of oil-globules, blood -corpuscles, and smaller colourless corpuscles
or cells. The contents of the ulna and clavicular arch were similar, but
in the latter the quantity of medullary matter was very minute.
  '3. Of    a pullet three months old, which had been hatched on the 6th         of
April, and weighed, when examined, two pounds, the humeri thoroughly
ossified, sank in water.        From one of them, opened under water, a few air-
bubbles only escaped, which came from its superior extremity.          The canal of
the bone, excepting the small portion from which the air proceeded, was full
of red marrow of the usual appearance of medullary tissue, and with similar
contents.      A   communication was found to exist by the air-foramen between
the cancellated structure towards the head of the bone and the lung,
through the adjoining air-sac.
    4. Of another pullet of the sam« brood, but of more advanced growth,
which, though three days younger when examined, weighed two pounds
and three-quarters, the humeri sank in water, but in sinking maintained a
perpendicular position.         One of them laid open was found to contain in its
inferior portion, to the extent of • 7 inch, marrow ; in its superior, to the
extent of    1 "8  inch, air.
    5.  Of   a pullet    three months and eleven      days old, which had been
hatched on the 28th of May, the humeri floated in water.           In one of them,
laid open, a small portion of marrow was found in the cancellated structure
of its distal extremity ; and in this portion a conspicuous blood-vessel
terminated,
    6.  Of  a cock five months old, which weighed five pounds, the testes
large,   and   abounding in sperm-cells and spermatozoa, the humeri contained
only air.
    II. Of    the    Partridge. — Of    one shot on the 1st  of September, which
weighed 4136 grs., the humeri and femora sank in water ; in sinking the
distal extremity of the former reached the bottom first.        From one of these,
opened under water, a very little air escaped.          The lining membrane was
very   vascular,    and  the  lower one-fourth   of the canal was full of blood of
a dark colour, contained apparently in varicose vessels.          Under the micro
 scope,   no   oil-globules   were  distinguishable in the blood, only blood-cor
puscles ; nor in any part of the cavity were there found any remains of
marrow.
    2.  Of another, shot on the         same  day, which weighed 5226 grs., the
 humeri swam in water, the femora sank.               Air only was found in the
 former.     On the lining membrane there were two or three delicate vessels
 containing florid blood.        The femora were full of a reddish marrow.
    3. Of another, shot on the 19th of October, which weighed 5432 grs.,

1866.]                  Dr. John Davy on       the Bones    of Birds.                 301
the state      of the humeri and femora         was very similar    to that of the pre
ceding.        The humeri contained only air, the femora only marrow ; the
lining membrane of the former was finely vascular ; the medullary tissue
of the latter abounded in oil-globules and corpuscles suggestive of blood-
corpuscles altered.
     III. Of the Pheasant.       — Of  a  female shot on the 9th of October, both
the humeri         and   femora swam in water.         Both contained air without any
marrow.         The former were perfectly white, and no vessels were visible in
their lining membrane ; the latter were of a reddish hue, and their lining
membrane was beautifully vascular, the vessels delicately ramifying, of a
bright florid hue, and anastomosing, and this throughout the whole of
the circumference.
     2.   Of another female, shot on the 17th of October, the humeri con
 tained only air, the femora air with a trace of marrow*.                The latter were
 redder than the former, and their lining membrane was very vascular.
     IV. Of      the Goose.  — Of   one hatched      in the spring, which, when         ex
 amined       on the 26th June, weighed eight pounds, the humeri sank in
 water.       They    were full of marrow of a light bright-red colour.                The
 quantity collected from one of them was about 82 grs.                  It exhibited the
 usual character of medullary cellular structure, and was rich in oil, which
 in drying exuded copiously from it           ; but it contained comparatively few
 blood-corpuscles         or blood-vessels,   of which these corpuscles were the
 index.
      2.   Of another hatched on the 22nd of April, which          on the 7th   of August
 weighed nine pounds and a half, a humerus dissected out weighed 561 grs.,
 was 7'5 inches in length, and its shaft between -4 and -5 inch in width.
 It sank in water. Its upper third portion was of a darker hue than its
 inferior two-thirds.        The latter was full of a light-red marrow, abounding
 in oil. It owed its reddish hue to blood-vessels in the medullary structure.
 The former, entirely without air, contained a collection of blood-vessels
 resting on a cancellated structure.            These vessels had the appearanee of
  veins, seemed largely varicose, and were full of dark blood, which (ex
  amined whilst warm) was still fluid.            Of the other wing, the humerus was
  somewhat different       — the difference was in the superior portion.         Although
  the bone sank in water, a little air was found in this portion, and the
  blood-vessels in it were less distended, and contained, instead of dark blood,
  aerated blood of a florid hue.          The marrow, which occupied about two-
  thirds of the shaft, terminated abruptly superiorly, and there            a pretty large
  blood-vessel       united  the   two   parts — the     medullary    and    the   varicose
  portions.
      3.   Of another hatched in the spring, examined on the            3 1st of October,
  the humeri        contained only air.      The lining membrane of its cavity          was
  rich in blood-vessels.
     *   It was detected by washing out the cavity of the bone with a weak solution  of salt.
  Oil-globules    were found suspended  in the solution,

  302                   Dr. John Davy      on the Bones  of Birds.          [Dec. 6,
      4. Of the humerus of        a goose hatched in the spring, weighing     on the
  2nd of November nine pounds, the canal was found full of air, with the
  exception of its inferior one-third ; this contained marrow rich in oil.         In
  one of several portions of it submitted to the microscope, a red vessel was
  seen containing granules and oil-globules.            In one direction it ended
  abruptly, as if torn ; in the other it was lost, as it were, by diffusion into, or
  blending with the cells of the medullary tissue. The upper portion of the
  marrow, it may be remarked, where it came in contact with the air, had,
  as in some other specimens,           a rounded well-defined surface.      In this
  instance no large blood-vessels were found in any part of the bone ; and on
  the delicate membrane connecting the trabeculae of the cancellated struc
  ture, only a very few delicate vessels of a florid hue were to be seen.
      5. Of a fifth, also hatched in the spring, when examined on the 20th
  of November, the humeri, like those of the last but one, were found to
  contain only air.      Their lining membrane was very vascular and partially
  varicose.
     V. Of the      Common    Ditch. — Of  a young drake hatched on the 26th of
  April,  which    when    weighed  on  the  13th of August was four pounds, the
 humeri sank in water.          They containad a light reddish marrow, and were
  entirely destitute of air.
     2. Of two ducks of the same brood as the drake, the humeri, examined
 on the 15th of Augr.st, sank in water.          Two-thirds of each were filled with
 marrow     ;   one-third,   the upper portion, with dark blood, seemingly in
 varicose vessels, which were connected with a light-coloured delicate mem
 brane.
     3.  Of   a duck, little more then one year old, the humeri contained only
 air.
    VI. Of the Red         Grouse. — Of one, which on the 12th of August was
 not fully fledged (it was shot for examination),        the humeri contained air,
 the femora marrow.
    2.   Of another more advanced, shot on the 31st of August, weighing            a
pound and a quarter, the humeri contained air, the femora a little marrow,
but more air, the former inferiorly.
    3.   Of   a  third, shot on the 28th of August, which weighed 8770 grs.,
the humeri were hollow, the femora partially so, a little reddish marrow
only remaining, and this in their inferior extremity.
    4. Of one shot on the 27th of August, which weighed 11,856 grs., and
which, judging from its plumage, was probably a spring bird, both the
femora and humeri swam in water and were free from any trace of marrow.
The lining membrane of the cavities of the femora was beautifully Vascular,
the vessels of a florid hue from the well-aerated blood which they contained.
The lining membrane of the humeri was similarly vascular, but in a less
strongly marked manner.
    VII. Of the Rook. — Of a young one not quite capable of flight, shot
on the 11th of May, and which theu weighed G132 grs., the humeri sank

1866.]                   Dr. John Davy on          the Bones    of Birds.                 303
in water ; they contained no air, but a soft marrow,                  of a blood-red colour.
The bones were very vascular, and were easily cut.
      2. Of another,        shot on the 22nd of June, when capable of flight,
 though the quill-feathers of its wings were only partially hollow, its weight
 5113 grs., the humeri sank in water in a perpendicular position. Of one
 which was examined, its inferior two-thirds were found full of a reddish
 marrow, its superior one-third of air. The proportion of oil seemed
 greatest in the distal part of the marrow.                  The bones were less vascula
 than those of the preceding,          and   of greater firmness.
      3. Of a third, shot on the 23rd of June, then weighing 4982 grs.,
  which, judging from the state of its feathers, its bursa Fabricii, ovary, and
  oviduct, had been hatched in the spring, the humeri were full of air
  without a vestige of marrow *.
       VIII. Common Crow. — Of one shot on the 1st of June, then weighing
  5402 grs., its quill-feathers not fully formed, the humeri sank in water,
  and contained only marrow.
       2. Of another shot on the 21st of June, weighing 6533 grs., capable of
  flight, the humeri contained air. The lining membrane was very vascular.
       IX. Of the Tawny Owl. — Of a young one, examined on the 21st of
  June, then weighing 4796 grs., its quill-feathers not fully formed, the
  humeri contained a very red marrow, and were entirely destitute of air.
       2. Of one of uncertain but mature age, judging from its general appear
  ance, and which weighed on the 8th of April 5/76 grs., the humeri were
  full of air. There was also air in the scapular arch, and partially in the
  furcula, its proximate portion.
       X. Of     the  Sparrow-hawk. — Of a young one, which on the 31st of
   July weighed 3686 grs., its sternum then only partially ossified, still
   flexible, the humeri were for the most part hollow ; the little marrow they
   contained was confined to their            distal portion.       The same remark was
   applicable to the scapular arch.           The femora contained even less marrow
   than the humeri ; they were very nearly full of air.
       XI. Of the Buzzard. — Of a young one taken from its nest on the
   10th of June, when supposed to be about a fortnight old, then weighing
   5293 grs., the     quill- feathers of wings only sprouting, the bones generally
   were very vascular ; the humeri and femora sank in water. Their ossifi
   cation was much advanced, but the sternum was still cartilaginous.                    After
   drying, all the bones floated in water.            The humeri and       femora,  now laid
   open, were found to contain a red matter             lining but not filling the cavities,
   suggestive    of its having been, in its moist state,       a  fluid or  a semifluid.    In
   this, its dried state, it was of a firm consistence.         After soaking iu water and
   trituration, it formed an emulsion, which,          as seen under the microscope, was
   found to contain oil-globules and particles of different kinds.              Digested and
      * This bird, like most rooks, was infested with parasites, lice.     They were plentiful
   even  in the cavity of the wing quill-feathers.    According to Dr. Gray, F.R.S., to whom
   I  sent one, and who kindly gave me its name, it is a Dccophorus (D. atraius).

heated     in alcohol, it   was partially dissolved, the solution becoming         turbid on
cooling.   Evnporated, and as seen under the microscope, the residue, pro
portionally small, seemed to consist chiefly of fatty and oily matter (stearine
and olein         ?),
             with some needle crystals.
  XII. Of the Blue Tit. — Of young one taken from the nest on the
                                       a
31st of May, then weighing 28'5 grs., quite naked, except        few delicate
                                                                          a
fibre-like feathers on the head, some yolk still remaining in the abdominal
cavity, the humeri were very small and pale, so small that no attempt was
made      to examine them, except by crushing.    Comminuted with          few       a
drops of solution of salt, and subjected to the microscope,  there  were  seen
mixed with the fragments of cartilage, blood-corpuscles and oil-like globules.
  2. Of    young one, nearly fully fledged, which on the 3rd of August
              a
weighed 142 grs., the humeri sank in water, maintaining    perpendicular
                                                                      a
position. They were completely formed and well ossified. Excepting
towards their inferior extremity they were white, there to  small extent
                                                                      a
they were red.   The white portion, at least nine-tenths of the entire
length, contained air; the red, not exceeding one-tenth, marrow which,
as seen under the microscope, had all the character             of medullary          tissue
and abounded in oil.
   3.Of third, shot in the same place as the preceding, and probably of
              a
the same brood, which on the 18th of August weighed 179"5 grs., the
humeri floated in water, and were entirely full of air. The feathers of the
abdomen were not fully formed, and the bursa Fabricii was much smaller
than that of the preceding.
   From these results, may not the following conclusions be drawn?
   First, that at an early stage, and up to     certain period of growth,
                                                      a
marrow exists in the bones specified, of all the birds first named    and            ;
that about the time of hatching the medullary tissue abounds less in oil
or fatty matter than at      later, the proportion varying in different in
                                a
stances   ;              in birds of prey, such as the buzzard and owl
              least probably                                                              ;
most in birds, the food of which      mostly vegetable, such as the goose.
                                        is
  Secondly,  that the  substitution  of air for marrow in those bones which
are eventually hollow, varies as to time in different species    earlier in
                                                                      ;       is
the rook, the crow, the grouse, the tit, than in the common fowl,
duck, and goose, especially the latter  the exchange of one for the other
                                             ;
having probably  some  relation to the time of taking wing and the use of
the parts and, in accordance, the humeri, except in the instance of the
              ;
sparrow-hawk, seemed to have the marrow absorbed somewhat earlier than
the femora.    It may be conjectured that, like the residual yolk in the
young  bird, the marrow in the bones in question may serve in part as food,
nourishing in the act of its removal.
   Relative to the structure of the hollow bones,      I   have but   a   few words to
offer.

   1866.]               Dr. John Davy on         the Bones    of Birds.                305
      In the humeri there        is a peculiarity which may he deserving      of mention.
  Towards the head of the              bone, near the pneumatic foramen, the can
  cellated structure,      connected more or less by a delicate membrane, per
  forms the part of a valve, as indicated by its permitting a free access
  of air in one direction, but preventing in the other, its exit. This is
  clearly shown by the use of the blowpipe, and in no instance have I found
  an exception.
      In the humerus of the common fowl, in three instances (a section of the
 boue having been made) the air has been found to enter from the pneu
 matic foramen by a small bony canal contiguous to the side of the bone,
 in length about '6 inch, in diameter about            -06 inch  *.
     It is said that the trabecule, or minute columnar in the cancellated struc
 ture of the hollow bones, are also hollow.               In some of those of the hu
 meri of the adult buzzard I have found a canal, but not in others ; these
 were solid.       Nor have I found them otherwise than solid in the humerus
 of the common fowl,         goose, and turkey.
     As  to the bones     of those birds    of the  second   kind, in which the marrow
is persistent through          life, I  may  briefly remark that in them, as in the
 former, at an early period the marrow seems to be comparatively poor in
oily matter ; and that the earlier, the nearer the embryo state, the less is
 its degree of consistence, the nearer it is to a liquid, and the larger is the
 proportion of blood-corpuscles and of albuminous matter, and the smaller
the proportion of the adipose.
     "When mature of growth, the bones of these birds appear to be richer in
oily matter than those of the former permanently without air. Thus the
tibia of the one kind in the dried state invariably sinks in water, whilst
that of the first kind only partially sinks ; the marrow in drying in the
latter, from containing less oil, contracting more, and allowing of the
entrance     of air.     In the radius and ulna the difference is          less strongly
marked      ; these bones in their dried state commonly sinking in water, even
when belonging to birds of the first kind.
     As regards the quality of marrow in the bones of different birds, the
trials I have made have been very limited.                 I am disposed to infer from
them that, besides         differing, as in many instances it does in colour, it
may     differ  also  in  composition, in the proportion of adipose matter and
its kind, and in the proportion of albuminous matter ; in some, as in the
bones of the goose, oil most abounding ; in others, as in those of the rook
and buzzard, albuminous matter and fat of the stearine kind.                Even in the
bones of birds of the second kind, such as their long bones, there is a
difference in this respect ; of these, all that        I have examined sink in water,
with the exception of the femora, which only partially sink, the marrow
in them being        less  rich in adipose matter, and consequently in drying
contracting more, and, as before remarked, admitting more air.

    As to the marked difference of birds of the two kinds in relation to the
condition of their bones, the rationale is not very obvious.           Perhaps an
approximation      to the  truth,  or  to the  probable, may   be  made by com
paring the bones of birds of the two kinds, which are possessed of similar
powers, the swift, for instance, and the buzzard, rivals in swiftness of
flight and enduring power of wing.           How different arc their humeri ' of
the former, very short, strong, and compact, provided with firm and large
processes for the attachment of muscles ; in the latter, long, hollow, and
light, and comparatively brittle, yet sufficiently firm to bear without fracture
the muscles which act on them.          Here, have we not after a manner a kind
of substitution of qualities 1 great strength and extended surface in small
space in the one, for lightness with greater length of leverage in the
other.     Further, the one kind of bone, that which contains marrow, being
less   brittle than that which       contains air,  and more yielding,     may be
less liable to fracture;    a quality  which, in  the bird, before the  ossification
is complete, may be of essential service ; so that, teleologically considered,
it may perhaps serve to account for the bones which are eventually
hollow having primarily marrow in place of air.

     Poisson's solution has always been regarded as imperfect, and may
easily be shown to be so.
     I was some time ago struck by finding that the above equations, while
they yielded with facility the result of Poisson, notwithstanding their
simplicity, baffled every effort to extract from them one more consonant to
the general     exigencies   of the problem.
     I had at this time arrived at the conclusion that the law of pressure
 assumed in the received theory of Fluid Motion could not be generally
 true, and in a Paper* communicated to the Royal Society, had pointed
 out that, in a certain case of motion, the assumption of the truth of that
 law led to a contradiction ; while in another case of motion the expression
  for the pressure given by the received theory was palpably erroneous.
     It occurred to me, therefore, that the defective law of pressure of the
  received theory accounted for the defective solution which alone was ob
  tainable from the equations of motion derived from it.            If the law of pres
  sure of the received theory was not always true, if it held only when cer
  tain conditions were satisfied, those conditions would obviously have the
  effect of dismissing from the complete solution of the problem obtained on
  a perfect theory at least one of the two arbitrary functions which it must
  necessarily involve.
     With a view to establishing this point, assume the solution of the equa
  tions of motion to be contained in the pair of equations,
                          F(xVtpv)=<p{f(xytpv)},       j                             W
                                                                                     -B
                          F(xVtpv)=W(xVtPv)}.S
     If  these  equations satisfy the equations (A), the latter will equally          be
  satisfied by the pair of    equations,
                          ¥(xytpv)=*v,
                          F(jxytpv)=^{f{xytpv)).
     But it is shown in my Paper that these latter can only satisfy the            equa
  tions (A) on the supposition that F is of the form
                          F=F(»±olog,p).

F must have the above form, we may equally prove that f, F,/"must seve

assumed solution (B), that the equations (A) are insoluble, except on the
assumption that the velocity may be expressed in terms of the density
alone  ; i. e.  that we may assume

 which is the most general solution of which the equations of motion are
 susceptible ; and which, making allowance for the difference of the ordi-
 nates employed in the two cases, y referring to the particle when in motion,
 and x to its position   of rest, is identical with that of Poisson.
    The failure of mathematicians to derive from the equations of motion of
 the received theory a solution containing two arbitrary functions has
 hitherto, I apprehend, been universally attributed to difficulties of integra
 tion.   So far is this view from being well founded, however, that in a
 postscript to my Paper it is shown that, assuming the pressure to follow
 any law whatever, a solution of the equations of motion can be obtained
 containing two arbitrary functions ; a result, however, which requires that
 the expression for the pressure shall satisfy certain conditions, which con
 ditions are violated when the pressure is assumed              to vary with the den
 sity alone.
    Whatever be the law of pressure, it must always be capable of being ex
 pressed in terms of x and t.           Moreover, the velocity and density are in
 like manner severally capable of being expressed in terms of x and / j
 whence it follows that we may always express x in terms of p and e, and
 equally that we can express t in terms of p and v ; so that, whatever be
 the law of pressure, we may assume it to be a function of p and v.

        the Direction of Colonel Sir         Henry James, R.E., F.R.S., &c,
       Director of the Ordnance Survey. Received November 15, 1866.
                                      (Abstract.)
    In  the preface to this paper, Sir Henry James gives an account of the
circumstances under which the work was undertaken, as follows.                 (A
Table of results is appended, p. 313.)
    The principal triangulation of the United Kingdom was finished in
1851 ; and the triangulations of France, Belgium, Prussia, and Russia
were so far advanced in 1860, that, if connected, we should have a conti
nuous triangulation from the Island of Yalentia on the south-west ex
tremity of Ireland, in north latitude 51° 55' 20", and longitude 10° 20' 40"
west of Greenwich, to Orsk on the River Ural in Russia.
    It was therefore possible to measure the length of an arc of parallel
in latitude 52° of about 75°, and to determine, by the assistance of the
electric telegraph, the exact difference of longitude between the extre
mities of this arc, and thus obtain a crucial test of the accuracy of the
figure and dimensions of the earth, as derived from the measurement of
arcs of meridian, or the data for modifying the results previously ar
rived at.
    The Russian Government, therefore, at the instance of M. Otto Struve,
Imperial Astronomer of Russia, invited (in 1860) the cooperation of the
Governments of Prussia, Belgium, France, and England, to effect this
most important object, and to their great honour they all consented, and
granted the necessary funds for the execution of the work.
    The portion of the work which was assigned to me, was the connexion
of the triangulation of England with that of France and Belgium, and             I
published the results of this operation in 1862 *. But this work has been
done in duplicate ; for when application was made to the French Go
vernment to permit the necessary observations to be made in France, they
not only consented to allow this, but at the same time volunteered to join
in the labour and expense of the work itself.
    It would obviously have been wrong to mix up observations made with
different kinds of instruments and on different principles, and therefore it
was agreed that the work should, in fact, be made in duplicate, both the
French and English geometricians using exactly the same stations.
    The results obtained by the French geometricians is published in the

gium.    London, 1863.

Supplement to vol. ix. of the 'Memorial du Depot General de la Guerre,'
1865, and the agreement with the results obtained by the English is truly
surprising.
   But however accurately the trigonometrical observations might be per
formed, it is obvious that, without a knowledge of the exact relative
lengths of the standards used as the units of meusure in the triangulation
of the   several countries, it would be impossible accurately to express the
length of the arc of parallel in terms of any one of the standards.
   It was therefore necessary that a comparison of the standards of length
should be made, and as we had a building and apparatus expressly erected
for the purpose of comparing standards at this Office, the English Govern
ment, on my recommendation, invited the Governments of the several
countries named     to send their   standards here, and we have had the fol
lowing compared with the greatest accuracy       : —
   1 . Russian standard, double toise, P.
   2. Prussian standard toise.
   3. Belgium standard toise.
   4.  Platinum metre of the Royal Society, compared with the standard
metre of France by M. Arago.
   5. English standard yards, A, B, C, 29, 47, 51, 55, 58.
   6. Ordnance Survey 10-foot standard bar.
   7.  Indian 10-foot standard bars, new     and old.
   8. Australian 10-foot standard bar.
   9.  In addition to   the above,   the 10-foot standard bar of the Cape of
Good Hope was compared         heie in 1844.
   We have invited the Governments of Austria, Spain, and the United
States of America, also to send their standards.         We have been promised
that of Austria, and, but for the unfortunate war in which she has been
lately engaged, we should have received it before this.
   I  have entrusted the execution of the work of comparison and the
drawing up of the results to Captain Alexander R. Clarke of the Royal
Engineers, who designed the apparatus used.             The numerous compari
sons to be made      entailed   a great amount     of labour upon him and his
assistants,   Quartermaster Steel and Corporal Compton, of the Royal

    So called organic
                       " cells," chiefly those of various cancerous tumours,
 were seen, on the addition of water, to expand to several times their ori
 ginal size, and at last to vanish altogether into the surrounding medium.
    The  " nucleus "  did not always participate in this change, but at times
 remained unaltered, whilst the outer constituents of the
                                                                  " cell " were un
 dergoing this process of expansion.
    This curious phenomenon of extreme dilatation is intelligible only on the
 supposition that the spherical bodies in question are in reality globules of a
 uniformly viscid material, which by imbibition swells out till at last its
viscosity is overcome by the increasing liquefaction.
    In embryonic tissues and in various tumours, single       " nuclei "  were seen,
 each surrounded by    a  shred of granular matter.       On the addition of water
 there would bulge from one of the margins of the granular mass a seg
ment of a clear globule, which continued growing until it had become a
 full sphere, which ultimately detached itself, and was carried away by the
 currents.    At other times no such separate globule would be emitted, but
 the entire granular shred would itself gradually assume the spherical shape,
 ultimately encompassing the " nucleus," and constituting with the same
 the most perfect typical " cell."
    Not only single " nuclei
                                 "   were fouud, each surrounded by a shred,
but also clusters of two, four, and more were seen similarly enclosed
 by a proportionately large granular mass.            Under these circumstances it
 sometimes occurred that, on the addition of water, the whole granular

mass        of such  a cluster became transformed into a large sphere, containing
t-wo,      four or more    " nuclei." The resulting body was to all
                                                                              appearance
identical       with shapes well known under the name of " mother-cells."           In all
these       cases the granular shred must have partly consisted of a viscid ma
 terial,     which, on imbibition, naturally assumed the spherical shape.
        Primary globules     were surrounded by a secondary globule, and thus the
 typical "cell" was completed under the observer's eye.
       In some instances the globules resulting from the transformation of            the
  granular      mass   were    at first bright and transparent, the granules having
  completely disappeared. They, however, gradually reformed, showing at
  first molecular motion, then crowding more and more, till at last the whole
  mass      seemed to undergo coagulation.
       Alternate liquefaction and coagulation of the same material was found to
   play an important part in the development of " cells."
       Masses    of certain viscid materials       do not, on imbibition, expand uni
   formly throughout         their entire bulk,   but globules of a definite size are
   emitted, as many as the mass will yield.
       The crystalline    lens   of many young animals affords, when treated with
   -water, a beautiful illustration of this fact.        Its homogeneous material is
   transformed, under the influence of imbibition, into a vast number of
   globules of nearly equal size.
       Hyaline embryonic        tissues  display, under similar conditions, the same
   phenomenon.
       Certain inferences lead one to suspect that this size-limiting property is
    due to the crystallizing propensity of some ingredient of these viscid
   substances.
       Blood-corpuscles,      human blood corpuscles at least, are evidently tiny
   lumps of a uniformly viscid material.
       When broken up into fragments, each fragment             assumes    the spherical
   shape.
       On slow imbibition, they often emit a clear sphere, or a segment of one.
       In various specimens of fcetal blood, each blood-corpuscle was seen to
    emit as many as two and even three equally sized globules, the original cor
    puscle being at last no more distinguishable from its descendants.              This
   is sufficient proof of the uniformly viscous nature of the blood-corpuscles.
       In many    cancers the most recently formed part consists         of  mere fibres.
   These after    a time become "nucleated."         The "nuclei" are at first very
    elongated, this being due      to the lateral pressure of the still fibrous texture.
   But   as the mass gradually softens, the ovals expand more and more into
    spheres, forming the primary globules, round which, as has already been
    shown, a secondary globule is often seen to shape itself.
       Chemical differentiation transforms first one portion of the fibrous mass
   into viscid material.        This at once strives, by imbibition, to assume the

  316                 Dr. E. Montgomery on         the  Formation of          [Dec.    20,
  globular shape. The remaiuing portion may or may not ultimately undergo
  similar transformation.
      Inflamed serous membranes become often densely nucleated."
                                                                "                   In the
  deeper layers, the "nuclei" are very elongated.             At  the   surface they are
  perfectly globular, and are detached as minute opaque balls.               These balls
  are the granulation- or the pus-corpuscles.              On  imbibition,   one portion
  of their soft material swells out, encompassing the rest, which, when form
 ing a single uniform globule, goes under the name of granulation-corpuscle ;
  when, on the other hand, broken up into several granules, constitutes the
  famous pus-" cell."        This is an example of a second mode of "cell "-for
 mation.       Here the secondary globule is shaped from a portion                 of  the
  primary mass.
     In some instances these        " nuclei "   or balls will, when still       enclosed
 within the surrounding texture, undergo the above-mentioned change on
 imbibition, and thus whole rows of granulation or pus-corpuscles are seen
 to form.
     This   second mode    of "cell "-formation   is still more strikingly manifested
 in epithelial textures.      In the mucous membrane of the          nose, for instance,
 the faint oval " nuclei
                             " of  the large scales become during disintegration
 more and more distinct         and globular.     The surrounding material of the
 scale gradually liquefies, aud the minute balls, thus liberated, expand by
 imbibition into mucus- or pus-corpuscles. It often succeeds to make them
form in all perfection whilst they are still contained within the scale.
     In abscesses of the skin the pus-corpuscles arc formed in exactly the
 same manner.         They can often be watched, fully shaped, still enclosed
within the     scale.    Here, it would seem, are     " cells," not the result of life,
but rather of death.
    The multiple       "        " of
                         nuclei        pus-corpuscles are not the result of over-
fecundity, but are simply due to the disintegration of the non-imbibing
portion of those oval or spherical clear-cut bodies, which are themselves
so well known under the name of " nuclei."
    The disintegration of this non-imbibing portion can be traced through
all possible stages, down to the cluster of most irregularly shaped gra
nules (which, notwithstanding,          have been looked upon as the result of
fissiparous division), and has been made to represent the crowning feature of
the cell theory.
    The    same minute balls found swimming in the serum              of  a blister were
seen, when treated with water, to disclose single          bright clear cut "nuclei;"
when treated with acetic acid, to reveal        the most typical multiple nuclei of
pus-cells.

                              II. — Experimental      Verification.
   Iu       all    the above-cited observations the existence of a viscid, imbibing
material          was proved with almost conclusive evidence, — a viscid material
which is capable of forming globules of               a   definite size, and which in the
living organism actually forms such globules; shapes, the nature of which
has been hitherto mistaken.
   After a long search, the substance known under the name of myeliue was
found to be the desired material.
   When to myeline in its dry amorphous state water is added, slender
tubes are seen to shoot forth from all free margins. These are sometimes
-wonderfully like nerve-tubes in appearance. They are most flexible and
plastic.   From this curious tendency of shooting forth in a rectilinear
direction it was inferred that a crystallizing force must be at work.
   To counteract this tendency, and                            to crystallize
                                                  to oblige the substance
into globules, it was intimately mixed with white of egg. The result
was most perfect.   Instead of tubes, splendid clear globules, layer after
layer, were formed, resembling closely those of the crystalline lens formed
under similar conditions.
   Here was actually found           a viscid substance    which, on imbibition, formed
globules of a definite size.
  The remaining task        comparatively an easy one.
                                 was                     By mixing the
myeline with blood-serum, globules were obtained showing the most lively
molecular motion.
   When the serum somewhat) preponderated, the whole globules seemed,
after a while, to undergo coagulation, and appeared often as beautifully
and finely granulated as any real " cell."
   When this mixture of myeline and serum was spread very thinly over
the glass slide, there often started into existence, on the addition of water,
small primary globules, round which an irregular mass of granular mate
rial became          gradually detached from the glass slide.          It   at last shaped
itself into a secondary globule, enclosing the primary one, and constituting
with    it,
          down to the minutest details, the most perfect typical
                                                                 " cell." In
many instances the nucleolus did not fail, and the narrow white margin,
so often mistaken for cell-wall, was always present. Beautiful
                             a
                                                               " mother-
cells
        "          in the same manner.
            were formed
   The next endeavour was to form " cells " according to the second mode.
   Ifthe amorphous myeline be very thinly spread on the glass slide, in
stead of tubes there will form bodies looking like rings.   They are actu
ally double globules, the inner globule being more transparent than the
outer.  They correspond to the inner and outer substance of the above-
mentioned tubes. When these are left to dry, and then again acted upon
with water, one portion will swell out into clear globule, enclosing the
                                                          a
rest as "nucleus."           These     "nuclei"   are either large and single, like those

R18                    Lieut.-Col. Walker on t/ie Results of           [Dec. 20,
of granulation corpuscles, or they are multiple, exactly like those of pus-
cells. Whole layers of perfect pus-corpuscles are thus formed.           But, of
course, more complicated shapes occur as well. Among these, for instance,
many such pus-cell-like bodies enclosed within one large sphere.
    If, instead of water, serum be added to the thinly-spread myeline, bi
concave disks will form, only generally much larger than blood-corpuscles.
    " Cells " being thus merely the physical result of chemical changes, they
can    no longer    afford a last retreat to those specific forces called vital.
Physiology must aim at being something more than the study of the
functions of a variety of ultimate organic units.         And pathology will gain
new hope in considering that it is not really condemned to be the inter
preter of the many abnormities to which the mysterious life of myriads of
microscopical individuals seemed to be liable.
II.    "Preliminary Notice of Results of Pendulum Experiments
        made in India."        By Lieut. -Col. Walker, F.R.S. : in a Letter
        to the President.        Received September 21, I860.
    I have   the pleasure to inclose a provisional abstract of the results of
Capt. Basevi's      observations with his pendulums during the past field
season.     Though provisional, it will probably be found to agree very
closely with the final results, which will be deduced as soon as the correc
tions for buoyancy, temperature, &c. are finally known.
    Already these experiments are beginning to throw light on the subject
of Himalayan attraction ; for the observations clearly show that the force
of gravity is less than it should be theoretically at the stations in         the
vicinity of the Himalayas, and that the difference between theory             and
 practice diminishes the further the station is removed from the Himalayas.
    This is a remarkable confirmation of Airy's opinion, that the strata of
 the earth below mountains are less dense than the strata below plains        and
 the bed of the sea.
     Combining    these   observations with those that were used by Mr. Baily
 (including,   I believe,  all your own), the value of the ellipticity will be
 diminished from             to Firff (approx.), and will therefore tend    more
 closely  to assimilate with Capt. Clarke's value, ^j*.
                           * The pendulum result is 2^j.

" On     the Appendicular Skeleton of the Primates."                     By St. George
        Mivart, F.Z.S., Lecturer on Comparative Anatomy at St. Mary's
        Hospital.        Communicated by Prof. Huxley.                     Received        No
        vember 22, 1866.
                                           (Abstract.)
    The author      began by mentioning        the principal variations found in the
 order Primates, as to the absolute and relative length of the pectoral limb
 with and without the manus ; and then taking each bone separately, described
 the modifications undergone by each in all the genera of the order*; as
 also the relative size of the segments and bones of the limb compared to
 each other and to the spine.             The pelvic limb     was then similarly      treated
 of, and,   in addition, its     segments and bones were compared with the homo-
 typal segments       and  bones    of the pectoral limb.
     The author after this reconsidered the question as to the use of the
 terms    " hand " and " foot," and the applicability of the term " Quadru-
 manous
            "  to Apes and Lemuroids.
     He controverted the position lately assumed by Dr. Lucae-|", that both
  anatomically and physiologically the pes of apes is more like the human
  hand than the human foot.             At the same time he recommended the use of
  unambiguous homological terms, such as
                                                        " manus "    and  " pes "    (already
  adopted by some) instead of hand
                                        "         and  " foot," in   all treatises on com
  parative anatomy.
     Tables of the dimensions and proportions of the limbs, their segments,
  and bones were then given, exhibiting the variations presented in these
  respects throughout         the whole series of genera.
     The author then considered the more peculiar forms of the order, begin
  ning with Man.
     The principal resemblances and differences in form, size, and proportion
  between the human appendicular skeleton and that of other primates were
  given in detail, followed by a list of those points in which man differs, as to
  the bony structure of his limbs, from all other primates.
      The limb-skeletons of the Orang, Marmoset, Indri, Slender Lemur,
  Tarsier, and Aye-aye were then similarly reviewed, and lists given of the
  absolute peculiarities found in each.
      The conclusion arrived at from these comparisons was, that Man differs
  less from the higher Apes than do certain primates below him from each

other     ; and that he, thus judged, evidently takes his place amongst the
members of the suborder Anthropoidea.
    A list of the principal osteological variations presented by the several
groups and genera of the order, before unmentioned, was then given ; and
the author concluded by stating what he believed to be the degrees of affi
nity existing between the various forms, as far as could be ascertained from
the consideration of the appendicular skeleton exclusively.

    Sir, — I    have the honour to forward you an account of some actinome
trical observations made last summer on the summit of Mont Blanc and at
Chamonix, and at the same time to thank the Committee of the Royal
Society for the grant which they were so good as to vote me for that object.
    I reached Chamonix on the 7th of July, in bad weather, which had been
prevailing for some time, but which ushered in a fine week very opportunely
for my work.         After allowing a few days for the weather to settle and for
the snow to consolidate, I left Chamonix in the afternoon of Friday the 13th
for the Grands Mulets, having previously arranged for a corresponding
series     of observations being taken the next morning in the valley.        Leav
ing the Grands Mulets at about 2^ a.m. on the 14th, I reached the summit
of Mont Blanc about 8 a.m., and proceeded at once to work.
   I  had brought with me from England two of Newman's mountain-baro
meters, a thermobarometer of Casella, six small thermometers graduated on
the stem (three for the dry-, and three for the wet-bulb observations),
three of the tubes described in Appendix (A), with two of the actinometers
in each.       I carried besides an aneroid by Cooke, which proved to be of
excellent quality.       The third set of apparatus was taken in some faint hope
that    I might   be able to arrange for a   third set of simultaneous readings at
the Grands Mulets. In this I was disappointed.                Notwithstanding   the
greatest care had been taken, one of the barometers was found on the Bre-
vent on the 9th to be deranged, and one of the actinometers to be broken ;
and on the 12th a second actinometer was broken at Chamonix by an acci
dent.       I thought it best to leave the remaining barometer for the valley
observations, and to depend upon the thermobarometer, as being more por
table and less liable to fracture, for the readings on the summit.            I was
eventually obliged      to  rest satisfied with a single observation of  this ; and
the downward range of the small thermometer unfortunately proved too
                                                                    2 d2

li mited  for the wet-bulb readings.       Thus the meteorological observations
 at the upper station are of the scantiest.         Neither above nor below were
 the actinometrical readings so continuous as I hnd wished to make them.                I
 had no one with me on the summit capable of rendering me the smallest
 assistance ; but it is some consolation to think that, even had this been
 otherwise, the results could not, under the circumstances, have been, mate
 rially enhanced.
     There cither did not exist, or     I failed to detect,    as the sun's      altitude
 increased, anything like a uniform progression of actinic power at either
 station during the limited time in which the observations were continued.
     The results do little more thau determine the ratio of the average inten
  sity at the two stations for a portion of the forenoon. This indeed was the
  main object which I had in view. For looking at the experience of Prin
  cipal Forbes under easier conditions, when the continuance of the observa
  tions, as long as the clearness of the sky might last, presented no difficulty,
  I did not at all anticipate being able to trace a dependence of the actinic
  power on the hygrometric state of the atmosphere.                 He thus remarks
  (Bakerian    Lecture,  Phil. Trans,  part 2  for 1842, p. 253)   of the experiments
  on the Faulhorn and at Brienz, that " it cannot be affirmed they are suffi
  cient to show the kind of dependence which the opacity has on the damp
  ness, and that the values     of the coefficient of extinction do not present any
  correspondence    with   the hygrometric variations;" and again, p. 268, "It
  must be confessed that no evident relation to the hygrometric condition of
  the air appears in the individual observations."
     From the experiments of the 14th of July the actinic ratio between the
  summit of Mont Blanc and Chamonix, from 9" 31m to 10" llm apparent
  time, presents, with a single exception, a gradual decrease from 1 *244 to
  1-206.     The interest of   a comparison     of these  results with those which
  Principal Forbes obtained       between   the Faulhorn and Brienz        is unfortu
  nately diminished by the fact that his actinometer was not furnished with
  an internal thermometer for ascertaining the temperature of the liquid
  employed.      This was ammonio-sulphate of copper, which has a coefficient
  of dilatation varying from 1 at 60° F., to 2 562 at 32° F., and 0-626 at
  100° F. His recorded numbers for three hours before and three hours
  after apparent noon derived from his freehand curve, are as follows            : —

   The sky during the observations       was not only cloudless, but, as seen from
the summit,     remarkably clear.
 The observations have all been reduced by means of Tables derived from
Gmelin's '           vol. i. p. 231, to what they would have been had
              Chemistry,'

          a prolonged
the factor for reducing the indications of (K) to the standard of (A) was
found to be 1-29.
  Considerable practice is necessary to acquire expertness in the use of the
actinometer employed.    It is desirable, as nearly as may be, to work it at
such a temperature that the rise in the sun may be equal to the fall in the
shade.      If the mean of the
                           two mean temperatures of the liquid, in taking
the shade observations which precede and follow a given sun, differ much
from the mean temperature of the liquid during that sun, a sensible error
will be introduced.     This, however, is    to a great extent eliminated by taking
the mean     of three, and still more completely by taking the               mean       of   five
successive   actinic results in column (I).
   The difficulty of using the instrument was overcome by the kind coope
ration of several friends for the Chamonix    observations. To the good
offices of my cousin, Mr. G. F. Hodgkinson, were added those of a lady, a
worthy sister of one of the foremost mathematicians of his year, and her two
nieces.   Under her auspices an admirable arrangement of the work was
made, by which each of the party was responsible for a precise and definite
function, the adjustment and direction of the instrument, with the shading
and unshading, the watch, the readings, and the records.    To this friendly
and efficient  help I am greatly indebted for whatever success has been
achieved.   How small this    no .one can be more sensible than myself;

the results will not appear either disappointing or discouraging.     The
season was extremely unfavourable for the further prosecution of the work.
Looking to the imperfection of the instrument employed by Principal
Forbes in his observations in 1832, it would seem to be highly desirable
that his experiments on the column of air between the Faulhorn and
Brienz should be repeated, and that other pairs of stations, intermediate
in character to that and the Chamonix pair, should be essayed.     I have

    "While simultaneous observations at several          adjacent stations       of progres
sive heights are much to be desired,      it should not       be forgotten how largely
the condition of simultaneousness at even only two stations adds to the
difficulty of the work. And the question arises, whether detached readings
of the actinometer (with the accompanying meteorological facts) taken at
various points, as opportunity offers, may not be encouraged with advan
tage.   An accumulation of these, carefully reduced and tabulated, could
hardly fail to be valuable ; and they may be obtained with comparative
facility.      It
             would indeed only be prosecuting these observations as we do
.those  of atmospheric temperature and pressure.      In process of time we
 might hope to obtain the mean actinic power at stations of various heights
 and circumstance for different altitudes of the sun.
   Since the scale of each actinometer is empirical, in order that observa
tions with different instruments may be comparable, a standard of reference
is necessary.         If
                   such a standard were kept at Kew, and each instrument
employed were marked with a factor of reduction, ascertained by careful
comparison, a great encouragement would be afforded to actinometry ;
nor can any material progress in that department of observation be looked
for until some such arrangement is made.     The actine-standard of Sir J.
Herschel   can hardly be said now to have been preserved ; to recover                          it,
a  careful set of observations under    vertical sun would be necessary

and since an arbitrary standard, which may be assigned without any such
trouble will answer every purpose,   seems best at once to resort to this.

 I   would venture, in conclusion, to couple with my thanks to the Com
mittee for their kind encouragement, an earnest recommendation that mea
sures be taken to provide   standard actinometer accessible for comparison,

                                       Description               of   the Actinometer.
   The actinometer employed consists of a thermometer with a spherical
 bulb one inch in diameter, and a tube, of which an inch and a half next the
 bulb      is,
         for   reason which will presently be apparent, left unsealed.
                        a                                               The
 succeeding ten inches                  is     made to represent, as nearly as may be, the range

1867.]                         Observations among the Alps.                        329
from        40° F. to 45° F.     At  eleven inches and a   half from the bulb the tube
is widened,        so that the following     inch and  a half may represent the range
from        45° F.  to 115° F.    The tube then finishes in a spheroidal chamber, of
¦which the diameters are about an inch and half an inch. The widened
portion of the tube may be dispensed with, as the correction            which it serves
 to ascertain may be otherwise found by means of a Table                experimentally
 constructed for        each instrument.      In that case the spheroidal chamber,   in
 which        the tube will then terminate at eleven       and a half inches from the
 "bulb, should be made somewhat larger. The fluid employed is alcohol
  coloured with a drop of pure aniline-blue.             A considerable quantity of air
  is left in the chamber. As a running column has to be read at a particular
  instant,      great plainness is the first requisite for the scale.  On this account
  graduation on the tube has not been adopted ; but at an inch and a half
   from the bulb is attached an ivory scale, nine-tenths of an inch broad and
   eleven and a half inches long (or somewhat less if the widened tube be dis
   pensed with), its other extremity coinciding with the commencement of the
    spheroidal chamber. This scale is graduated throughout in millimetres.
    The number of millimetres corresponding to each degree Fahr. on the tube
    of narrow bore, and to every fifth degree from 45° to 115° on the widened
     tube, should be noted on the back of the scale.
          The principle of the instrument is the same as that of Sir J. Herschel's ;
     and it is to be worked according to the directions given by him in • The
     Manual of Scientific Enquiry.' It was devised for mountain use, where the
     •weight of the Herschel and the fragility of its internal thermometer are
     elements of difficulty.     It has also the advantage of being less costly. The
     air-chamber is made to serve the purpose of the screw in the Herschel, viz.
      that of altering at will, according to circumstances, the range of the ther
      mometer.      This is effected by throwing off into the chamber a greater or
      less quantity of fluid, retaining it there by holding the instrument with the
      chamber end somewhat lower than the bulb, and working with the remain
      ing column.     As alcohol expands unequally between its freezing- and boiling-
      points, a small correction is necessary, depending on the temperature of the
       alcohol at the time of working,       This temperature is ascertained by noting
       the point iu the widened tube, at which the column stands, when the fluid
       is thrown off into the chamber.         The excess of this temperature above
       45° F., the point from which the fluid is thrown off, has to be added to the
       temperature between 40° and 45° shown by the head of the working column,
       in order to have the true temperature. From the openness of the scale,
       and consequent small range of the instrument for any one adjustment, it is
       necessary to select for working a temperature not much removed from that
       at which the rise in the sun is equal to the fall in the shade.     This tempe
       rature, which may be called the temperature of equilibrium, will vary prac
       tically, according to the solar intensity, from some 5° F. to 20° F. above
       the temperature of the surroundiug influences.         By driving the fluid into
       the chamber until the temperature of equilibrium is represented at a point

near the middle of the tube, the readings will go on for a considerable time
without altering the quantity of fluid in the chamber, and ten inches of
graduation are found to be ample under all circumstances.    By thus taking
all the readings, so to speak, on the balance, a uniformity of proceeding
is secured, which is not without its value.   The instrument, constructed
according to the dimensions here given, will denote the intensity of the

   Owing to the difficulty of shading satisfactorily, and anomalies found
to occur in observing among the snow-fields on the high crests of the
Alps, the following contrivance has been adopted : —
  A plain telescope-tube of bright metal, 1 8 inches long    and 2£ inches in
diameter, open at both ends, is pierced in its central section with a circular
hole      l\   toinch in diameter, from which springs a flanged shoulder
projecting about       i
                    inch to receive a perforated split bung, which clasps the
thermometer-stem and holds the bulb firmly in the centre of the axis of
the tube.   Two caps, fitted at the ends with clean plate-glass, are made
to slide off and on at the two ends to admit of the glasses being readily
wiped.    By protecting these with a little wadding, the tube serves as a
case for two actinometers.  In the central section of the tube, made by a
plane perpendicular to its axis, and nearly 90° from the centre of the cir
cular hole, is a screw to attach the tube to an altitude And azimuth motion,
by means of which it may be kept constantly directed towards the sun.
Below the joint is provided means of attachment to an alpenstock or ice-
axe.  The shading is effected by means of a loose-fitting cap, bottomed by
a chamber with air-holes.   The shadow of the large thermometer-bulb on

84 post.), and of the syzygies of the degree 6, occupies the commence
ment of the present memoir.      The remainder of the memoir is in a great
measure a reproduction (with various additions and developments) of re
searches contained in Prof. Sylvester's Trilogy, and in a recent memoir by
M. Hermite*. In particular, I establish in a more general form (de
fining for that purpose the functions which I call " Auxiliars ") the theory
which is the basis of Prof. Sylvester's criteria for the reality of the roots
of a quintic equation, or, say, the theory of the determination of the cha
racter of an equation of any order.    By way of illustration, I first apply
this to the quartic equation ; and I then apply it to the quintic equation,
following Prof. Sylvester's track, but so as to dispense altogether with his
amphigenous surface, making the investigation to depend solely on the
discussion of the bicorn curve, which is a principal section of this surface.
I explain the new form which M. Hermite has given to the Tschirnhausen
transformation, leading to a transformed equation, the coefficients whereof
are all invariants ; and, in the case of the quintic,    identify with my        I

quadric function of four indeterminates. The discussion of this form led to
criteria for the character of    quintic equation, expressed like those of

I. " On      aNew Method of Calculating the Statical Stability of a
        Ship." By C. W. Merrifield, F.R.S., Principal of the Royal
        School of Naval Architecture.        Received January 15,            1867.
   The time required for the calculations of the stability of ships has prac
tically restricted the ordinary draughtsman to the use of the metacentre.
This implies that the locus of the centres of buoyancy cuts the transverse
midship plane in a curve which may be treated as a circle ; and this is
only true, in general, for very small limits of inclination.  In some parti
cular cases it has been felt desirable to supplement this by computing the
moment of stability at some definite angle of inclination, by means of the
" ins and outs," or immersed and           emersed    wedges.      But this has only
been applied to one selected inclination,        generally of   10° or 14°   ;   and owing
partly to this, and partly to the very scant time left available to the skilled
draughtsman or calculator, this has never been a part of the ordinary work
of the computation of a ship's quantities. For this reason it becomes of
great consequence to find some method of getting at the stability, with an
amount of extra work, which should not exceed that of the ordinary sheet
known as the " sheer-draught calculation"*.
    A method has occurred to me by which, as I think, this object may be
attained.  Upon conferring with some of my students t, who have sug
gested and removed certain difficulties of detail, we think we see our way,
by an easy calculation, to place the whole account of a ship's statical
stability in the hands of any person who understands simple equilibrium,
either in an algebraical or geometrical form, as he may prefer.
   It will take some time, with my present occupations, to prepare detailed
examples. But as the method is complete in respect of principle,      have          I
thought it best to bring it at once before the Society.
   The fundamental assumption       that the locus of the centres of buoyancy
                                     is,
can be sufficiently represented by    conic. The stability
                                       a                        then measured
                                                                    is
by the perpendicular, from the centre of actual weight, on the normal due
to the inclination. The chief step, therefore,   to find the conic, of which,
                                                     is
I may remark, ive already know the vertex, and the tangent and curvature
at the vertex    ;for these are given      the ordinary calculation of the

centre of buoyancy and the metacentre.  Now observe that the conic
                                                       I                                 is

of the plane of floatation         at the inclination.       This, divided    by  the
unaltered displacement, gives the radius of curvature required.
     But the chief practical difficulty lay in finding the means of drawing an
inclined water-line across the body plan, so as to give an unaltered dis
placement.         This  I have at length  succeeded   in overcoming, as follows.
     The sheer-draft calculation gives us, inter alia, the areas of the level
sections, belonging to the upright position, as rectangles.               Now, if we
make one side of each of these equal to the length of the ship, their
 breadths form a series of ordinates for a curve of mean section ; that is to
 say, the transverse section of a cylindrical body, of which the displace
 ment at any level immersion will be the same as that of the ship.                 We
 then make out a scale of displacement for this section at various immer
 sions, for a selected inclination, taking care to measure the immersions on
 the middle line of the original body plan.              By this means the finding
 of any water-line at the selected inclination is reduced to a problem of plane
 geometry ; and it is obvious that the place of the water-line so found will
 be a very close approximation to that of the required plane of floatation in
  the    ship.
      The calculations are as follows : —
       1 . Take out the horizontal areas from the sheer-draught calculation, and
  divide each by the ship's length.          Set them off right and left from a
   vertical line at their present vertical interval, and draw a curve through
  their ends.
       2.   Any practised draughtsman will     have   little difficulty in drawing, at
   sight, an inclined line of floatation which shall give an unaltered immersed
   area on this mean section.         He can verify it by measuring the immersed
   and emersed triangles obtained by his first guess, and make the correction
    due to the difference, if they do not agree.
        3.  In strictness, the more accurate course would be this, — through each
    of the vertical stations draw right lines at the selected angle Thence, by
    Simpson's rule, form a scale of areas, ending at the highest inclined water-
    line.    Use the vertical interval of the upright displacement, and neglect
    the cosine of the inclination.       Then divide the upright displacement by
    the ship's    length and by the cosine of the inclination, and find to what
     immersion this displacement corresponds in the scale of inclined areas.
     But this is needless, unless the calculations have to be made for different
     draughts of water.
         4. Use this immersion to draw the inclined plane of floatation in the
     hody plan.
          5. Calculate the area, common moment, and moment of inertia of this
      plane, about the longitudinal     axis formed by its intersection with the
      original plane of floatation, upright.
          6. Transfer this moment of inertia       to the longitudinal axis passing
      through the centre of gravity of the inclined plane of floatation.
          7. Divide the moment so found by the displacement.             This will give

                                            a
with trichloride of phosphorus.
   The continuation of these researches necessitated the preparation of
phenylformamide, and later also of tolylformamide in greater quantities.                           I
have repeatedly obtained these bodies                   by

pounds may be readily accomplished.
   According to Gerhardt, the principal product of the distillation of the

   But nothing is   easier than to change the conditions     of the experiment
so as to give rise to the almost exclusive formation      of phenylformamide.
Act with    1 molecule of oxalic acid on    1 molecule of aniline (or even with
3 molecules of oxalic acid on 2 molecules of aniline), taking care to give
at once the highest possible temperature, and phenylformamide will be
nearly the only product, 1 molecule of water and I molecule of carbonic
acid separating from the primary aniline oxalate at first formed,

   The distillate is a fluid of peculiar odour, which, on the addition of a
strong solution of caustic soda, immediately solidifies to the crystalline soda-
compound of phenylformamide.           This crude product always containing
a quantity of aniline, is sufficiently pure for the preparation of methenyl-
diphenyldiamine previously described by me.            It is only necessary to
treat the distillate with trichloride of phosphorus to obtain the methenyl-
compound in abundance.
   The action of oxalic acid on aniline at a high temperature gives rise,
however, to quite a series of other reactions subordinate to the principal
changes,    but affecting nevertheless a goodly quantity of material.        Car
bonic oxide is observed to be evolved, together with carbonic acid, during
the distillation.   It is the result of two secondary processes. In the first
place, phenylformamide already formed splits up, according to the analogous
decomposition of formamide, into aniline and carbonic oxide,

    On this occasion the formation of the latter body was once more satis
 factorily proved by special experiment.        During the distillation a consi
 derable quantity of a crystalline substance saturated with oil had solidified
in the neck of the retort.        This substance was purified by washing with
 cold and recrystallizing a few times from hot alcohol ; combustion showed
that it was pure diphenylcarbamide.
    The crude oil obtained by the distillation of 1 molecule of aniline and
 1 molecule of oxalic acid contains, further, hydrocyanic      acid, and it is not
 difficult to explain in a satisfactory manner the origin of this compound.
 When the distillate is heated to ebullition with concentrated hydrochloric
 acid, an oily body passes over with the steam.        This oil has a peculiar

18G7.]             Aromatic Monamines into Acids richer in Carbon.                   337
odour, recalling that of benzonitrile, and exhibits an inclination to crys
tallize ; it is readily proved to be a mixture. If this substance be boiled
for some time with a concentrated soda-solution in alcohol, it partly
 dissolves with evolution of ammonia.              When the fluid    is allowed to cool,
 after ammonia         has ceased to be evolved       and the alcohol distilled off, its
 surface     is found to be covered with oily drops, which after a time become a
 crystalline solid. This solidification is instantly produced by treating the
 oil with a small quantity of concentrated hydrochloric acid. When a few
  drops of strong nitric acid are added to the hydrochloric fluid in which the
  crystals      are floating, and the mixture is then gently heated, a deep blue
  colour produced. This reaction is characteristic of diphenylamine, with
            is
  which the crystalline body perfectly accords in every respect. It cannot
  be doubted that diphenylamine is produced from phenylformamide as a
  product complementary             to hydrocyanic    acid ; 1 molecule of phenylform
   amide and        1 molecule of aniline contain the elements of 1 molecule of
   diphenylamine,        1 molecule of hydrocyanic acid, and      1 molecule of water.

       It  still remains to give an account of the fluid substance formed together
   with diphenylamine, which had disappeared with evolution of ammonia
    when the mixture was heated with soda-solution.              Had not both its odour
    and its behaviour with soda pointed to benzonitrile, all doubt of the for
    mation of this body would have been removed, when upon addition of
    hydrochloric acid to the filtered sodic liquid an abundant quantity of the
    purest benzoic acid was separated, the nature of which was, moreover, fixed
    by an analysis of the silver-salt.
        The formation of benzonitrile is easily explained.          It is produced by a
    secondary transformation of phenylformamide, from which 1 molecule of
    water separates,

        The transition      of phenylformamide into benzonitrile is only in part
     accomplished       during the distillation of the mixture of aniline and oxalic
     acid.     The    greater portion of the nitrile is evidently formed during the
     treatment of the crude product of the distillation with hydrochloric acid.
         The conversion of aniline into benzoic acid, an acid richer in carbon than
     this base, claims some interest, inasmuch as the development of the
      manufacture       of coal-tar colours places the aromatic monamines at our
      disposal in abundant quantity, and at the cheapest price.               It was by no
      means improbable         that  some  of  the acids, already  known,    might in this
      manneT     be more easily prepared than heretofore, nor Was         it doubtful that
      the formation       of many new compounds could           be accomplished     by this
      process.

     I   have therefore, in the first place, endeavoured to establish           the gene
rality of the reaction by treating toluidine in a similar                   manner.  The
phenomena observed when a mixture of 1 molecule of toluidine with 1
molecule of oxalic acid is distilled, are perfectly analogous to those presented
by the corresponding experiment with aniline.     It was not necessary for
the purposes of the investigation to trace step by step the several phases
of the complicated proc«sses.     The crude distillate, which contained
abundance   of tolylformamide, was therefore immediately heated with
strong hydrochloric acid and submitted to distillation. The oily substance
which distilled over with the water, evolved ammonia on being boiled with
soda-solution, and the filtrate from the insoluble residue yielded, on addition
of hydrochloric acid, a crystalline acid which combustion, as well as analysis
of   the silver-salt, proved to be     tolylic acid. Here also tolylformamide            gave
rise to       tolonitrile, from which tolylic acid subsequently was produced.

however,      I   intend to follow this reaction somewhat further,       I       shall not for
the present go deeper into the question.
   The experience collected in the phenyl- and tolyl-series, as might have
been expected, has also been confirmed in the naphthyl-series.
   The investigation of the naphthaline group in this direction appeared
more particularly interesting. The idea naturally suggested itself of com
pleting this group by taking advantage of the new reaction for the forma
tion     of   a   series   of compounds, the existence of which had long been
pointed out        by   theory, but the preparation of which as yet, notwithstanding
repeated attempts, had not succeeded.
   Naphthaline, the most common product of the action of high tempera
tures on organic bodies, has, singularly enough, not as yet been traced to
a  simple reaction.    It was not doubtful that the hydrocarbon would in
time be met with as the result of the splitting up of an acid, holding to                  it
a relation similar to that which obtains between benzoic acid and benzole.
   This acid, which      represented by the formula

          during Rest and Exercise, on a Diet without Nitrogen." By
          E. A.     Parkes, M.D., F.R.S.         Received  January 23, 1867.
     The     experiments    recorded in this paper were undertaken to test the
 results arrived at by Professors Fick and Wislicenus, with respect to the
 elimination of nitrogen during exercise on a non-nitrogenous diet, as
 recorded in the Philosophical        Magazine for June 1866 (Supplement).
      Although these results are supported by the previous experiments of
 Dr. Speck, who has shown that if the ingress of nitrogen be restricted,
 bodily exercise causes no, or a very slight increase in the elimination of
 nitrogen by the urine, it appeared desirable to carefully repeat all the
  experiments, not only because the question is one of great importance,
  but because objections might be, and indeed have been, reasonably made
  to the experiments of Professors Fick and Wislicenus on the ground that
  no sufficient basis of comparison between periods of rest and exercise was
  given ; that the periods were altogether too short, and that no attention
  was paid to the possible exit of nitrogen by the intestines.
       In making the experiments, I was fortunate in being permitted to use
   the services of two perfectly healthy soldiers belonging to the Army Hospital
   Corps, and doing duty at the Royal Victoria Hospital at Netley.             When
   soldiers are steady and trustworthy, as these men were, they are good
   subjects for experiments of the kind, as they are accustomed to very regular
   diet and occupation, and moreover, from their habits of obedience, carry
   out all instructions with great precision.        The satisfactory results of my
    experiments, as shown by the almost perfect agreement in the effect on
    each   man, is owing essentially to the very great care with which these
    two intelligent men carried out every rule which was laid down.
        One of these men, S., is an admirable example of an average man ; he is
    22£ years old, 5 feet 8 inches       in height, weighs close upon 150 lb., is
    strong, with large bones and firm muscles, with sufficient but not exces
    sive fat ; he is very temperate, and is no smoker.      He has never been ill in
    his life.   The second man, T-, is also a perfectly healthy man, and has
    only been ill twice, once in China six years ago with tertian ague, and
    about three years ago with intermittent hemicrania.        But he is in size and
    weight a good contrast to S.         He is 36 years of age, very well propor
    tioned and active, but is only 5 feet 4 inches in height, and weighs only

112 lbs.     His  size is not owing   to any imperfection in make or nutrition,
but to the fact that he comes of a small race, his father being small, and
his mother remarkably so.         He has small bones,      good firm muscles, but
very little fat.    In fact, he is a thin man.
    In the following experiments, the amounts of the total nitrogen of the
urine (by soda-lime), of the urea, of the chloride of sodium, and on cer
tain occasions of the phosphoric and sulphuric acids, were determined.
The urea was determined by Liebig's solution, the chlorine being first
eliminated, the phosphoric acid by acetate of uranium, the sulphuric acid
by baryta and weighing.
    The urine was collected from 8 a.m. to 8 a.m., and great care was taken
not to lose any, and to pass it at the exact time.
    The amount of water, solids, and nitrogen      passed from the bowels were
also determined on several occasions.
    All the ingesta were   most carefully weighed and measured, and the amount
of water in the crumb and crust of bread and in the meat was determined.
The nitrogen in the bread was also determined, but the long time de
manded by the other processes prevented a complete analysis of the other
food ; this was, however, a matter of no importance as regarded the imme
 diate object of the inquiry.
    The experiments were commenced on December 6, 1866, and were con
tinued daily till December 23.
          First Period of ordinary regulated Diet and Occupation.
     The men     were  first kept under observation for six days, in order to
 determine the variations in weight and in the excreta, and to see if the
 metamorphosis of tissue appeared to be healthy.              This was found to be
 the case ; in fact, more completely healthy urinary and intestinal         excreta
 could not be conceived.
     The weight of the body ranged nearly 1 lb. avoir., or \ kilog. above
 and below the mean amount in each man.
     The daily average amount of food and drink was only slightly different
 in  each man, and the quantity taken from day to day was very          uniform.
     The men   were not placed on any absolute quantity, but ate according
 to appetite  within  narrow limits.

   The excretion of nitrogen        was fairly constant from day to day, the range
of the urea being, in the          case  of S., from 38'37 to 33-36 grms., or be
tween 2 and 3 grms, above           and below the mean amount ; and in the case
of T. from 27'68 to 24-906, or nearly               1  grm. above and below the mean

   The very close relation, indeed identity, as far as the total nitrogen is
concerned, of the excretion per kilog. of body-weight in these two men
comes out very clearly, and shows that there must be a real connexion
between body-weight and urinary excretion.
   It   is remarkable     that while      the heavier man passed            \\  grms. more
nitrogen daily from the kidneys than the smaller man, he did not eat any
great excess of food.        Unfortunately, as the nitrogen in the food was not
perfectly   determined, it is impossible to know precisely whether the 52
grms.    of excess  of solid food taken by the larger man would contain A\
grms. more nitrogen. As, however, the amount of meat was precisely the

 842               Dr. Parkes on       the Elimination     of Nitrogen.            [Jan.  31,
  same, and as the smaller man only took £ oz. or 14 grms. less bread, and
  25 grms. less vegetables, this would seem to be unlikely, and,                 if  so, some
 of the nitrogen taken by T. must have passed off in other ways.
    The mean relation of the ureal to the total nitrogen was very close in
 each man, being, if the ureal nitrogen is taken as unity, as 1 to 1*1 , and
 as 1 to 1*108 respectively. From day to day, however, the relation varied.
    The intestinal excretion was examined only on one day, the last but one
 of the series.

    The smaller man         passed    rather more solids, water, and more nitrogen
 than the    larger     man, and through this channel some of the nitrogen
 unaccounted for by the urine must have escaped.                    Whether this would
 account for the whole of it cannot be stated, as the experiments in respect
 of the nitrogen in the food and in the intestinal excreta of the whole
period were not sufficiently exact to determine this point.

    On the day following the men were placed for two days on a non-nitro
genous diet consisting of arrowroot, sugar, and butter, from which the
casein had         been  separated. The only nitrogenous substance taken was
that contained in infusion of tea.           I thought it better to allow the use of
warm tea, without milk, both for the comfort of the men and because                    I

 of diet.
     The arrowroot       was made into cakes with butter and sugar, and was also
 taken as jelly.        Butter and sugar were taken as desired.          I put no re

      It  is of no consequence to calculate the proportion to body-weight, as
  some starch and sugar passed off by the bowels.
      During these two days the men were kept in complete rest.             They were
  allowed to get up for fear keeping in bed should make them feverish, but
  they sat quite still, or lay down on the bed, and          did not leave the room
  during the time.
      The weight decreased in the case of S. from 677 to 66-5 kilogrammes,
   and in the case of T. from 50-6 to 49-8 kilogrammes.
      The Urinary Excretion was collected as usual on the first day, from
   8 a.m. to 8 a.m. ; but on the second day it was collected from 8 a.m. to
   8 p.m., and again from 8 p.m. to 8 a.m, so that the last twelve hours'
   urine was secreted forty-eight to sixty hours after the last meal of nitro
   genous    food.

    The full details   are given     further   on, and   I  will now merely       state the
 mean results.
    On the mean of the two days the urea of twenty-four hours fell from
 35 grammes to 16-765, or more than one-half in the case of S., and from
 26 to 15, or rather less than     one-half in the    case of T.
    The amount of urea in the last twelve hours was only 5 and 4'2 grammes
 for the two men. The total nitrogen, or a mean of the two days, fell from
 17 97 and 13-4 to 8-176 and 7 grammes in the two men, while in the last
 twelve hours it was only 3 0 17 and 2-17 grammes, or at the rate of only
 6-034 and 4-34 grammes in twenty-four hours.

   Therefore   during complete nitrogenous inanition the tissues of the
smaller and older man furnished a slightly greater amount of nitrogen
than those of the larger man, and this is evident both in the ureal and non-
ureal nitrogen, so that it could scarcely be accidental.
   The sulphuric acid and phosphoric acids were determined on the last
day; the latter acid was in almost precisely the same absolute mean
amount in each man, viz. -9533 and -941 gramme ; the larger man passed,
however, one-third more sulphuric acid, viz. -633 as against '427 gramme.
   In the last twelve hours the chloride of sodium fell to 1 and -42
gramme.

   The amount of soJids was almost identical, but S. passed less nitrogen
than T., as occurred also in the first period. The excreta were quite
bilious, and had a greenish tint.

    The considerable derangement of the usual balance is very evident ; it
depended in part on the greater amount of water taken as compared with
the former period, but not apparently altogether.
    The water of the kidneys and the insensible perspiration were increased,
while the intestinal water was lessened.
    There was no sugar in the urine detectable by common tests.
    The effects of the diet in the two men being thus very similar,         a satis
 factory basis of comparison was obtained for the period of exercise.
                 Third Period. — Ordinary Food and Occupation.
    The   men then returned to their     former regulated diet and usual occu
 pation for four days. Very nearly the same amount of food was taken as
 in the first period. At the end of four days the weight of the body in
 each man had returned almost exactly to its former amount.
    The excretion of urea and the total nitrogen (which is given in more
 detail further on) followed a course very similar in each man.
    On the first day after the return to nitrogenous diet the urea was in round
 numbers 14 and 12 grammes respectively below the mean of the first
 period, that is to say, it was nearly the same as during the first day of non-
 nitrogenous feeding ; it then, in the case of S., increased day by day till it
 reached 29-67 grammes on the fourth day.           In the case of T. it increased
 for two days, but fell a little on the fourth day ; the total nitrogen, how
 ever, increased regularly every day.
    The general result     was that whereas  in four days of the first period on a
 similar diet and exercise the excretion of nitrogen was 71-892 and 53-636
 grammes respectively, during these four days of the third period the
 excretion of nitrogen in the urine was only 51-952 and 44-38 grammes ;
 so that in the case of S. 19-94 and in the case of T. 9-256 grammes of
 nitrogen were retained in the body for the nutrition of the nitrogenous

two days by    cutting   off  the  supply   of nitrogen.
    At the end of the four days it was considered that the tissues had re
covered their composition.
             Fourth Period. — Non-nitrogenous Diet and Exercise.
   Diet. — The diet during this period was of the same kind as in the second
period.     The men were directed to eat what they pleased of arrowroot
 made into cakes, and jelly, sugar, and the oil of butter.
   They took in the two days of December 17-18, and 18-19, the follow

   The amount of water drank in the two days was.                .  5159-5        4762-6.
   Both men eat more during this period, partly                  because they felt more
hungry, partly    because     the  arrowroot-cakes      were   better   made.      T. espe
cially took more butter, to which he felt a distaste previously.
   The diet satisfied hunger ; there was no sinking or craving for other
kind of food, but it was monotonous, and neither man wished to con
tinue it.
   Exercise. —During these two days the men took the following amount
of walking-exercise, on level ground.            On the first day the exercise com
menced at 9 a.m., and lasted till 7.45          p.m.  with intervals. On the second
day   it commenced    at  9  a.m.,  and  lasted  till 9 p.m.       The men then went to
bed.
   First day. — 2370 miles=38           23 kilometres.
   The work done was calculated according to Professor Haughton's                       for-

kilogrammes-metres, or 34674 tons lifted a foot.

                            S. = 194294 kilogramme-metres.
                               = 625-8 tons lifted a foot.

                               =      475 toiis lifted a foot.
     The first day's walking was done pretty well hy hoth men. On the
 second day both men did the first 20 miles well, but felt very much
 fatigued during the last 13 miles. During the last 4 miles each man felt
 pain in the small of his back. Both men could, however, have marched on
 the following day if necessary.
      With regard      to the amount      of fatigue   as compared    with other occasions,
  T. would give no opinion,          as he said he had no        fair basis of comparison.
  S., however, was clear that he was much more fatigued than on other food.
  In 1865 in Ireland he marched 26 miles on one day and 20 on the following,
  carrying his rifle, accoutrements, and forty rounds of ball-cartridge (an
  additional weight equal to 18 lb. nearly), and yet he did not feel fatigued at
  oil ; while on the present occasion, marching without weight except his
  clothes,    he felt much exhausted.
      Both men felt hungry ; the food satisfied them ; neither had any per
   ceptible action of the skin ; the days were fine and rather warm. During
   these two days S. lost almost precisely 2 kilogrammes in weight, and T.
   lost  | of a kilogramme.
       The Urinary Excretion. — The urine was collected as usual from 8 a.m.
    to 8 a.m. on the first day, and from 8 a.m. to 8 p.m., and from 8 p.m. to
    8 a.m. on the second day.            In order to compare this, I have placed to

     The excretion of the urea was very parallel in the two men, and followed
 this course.       In each man in the first twenty-four hours nearly 1 gramme
 less was excreted by each man in the period of exercise as compared with
 that of rest ; the larger man excreted nearly 3 grammes more urea than the
 smaller one.                                                     ,

 larger man now had no effect in the urea.
     In  the last twelve hours (chiefly rest during night) the urea increased in
 each man in the period of exercise, as compared with that of rest, the abso
 lute increase in S. being 2 grammes, and in T. 1 gramme.

      In the case of T. the total nitrogen during exercise was like the urea
  below the period of rest in the first 36 hours, but in the last 12 hours the
   excess of nitrogen in the period of exercise was so considerable as to
  cause the nitrogen of the two days of exercise to exceed that of rest by

    I draw the conclusion, therefore, that in both these men there was in
the first 36 hours a decrease in the amount of urea ; but in the last 12
or rest-hours of the 48 hours of the period of exercise, an increase.
   That in the case of S. the total nitrogen was increased throughout                         the
whole    period of exercise, the total increase being 1'589 gramme, or
24-5 grains of nitrogen, while in the case of T. the total nitrogen, like the
urea, was lower in the first 36 hours of the period of exercise, but increased
greatly in the last 12 hours.
    It may, indeed, be said that the difference between                the amounts in the
two periods is after all so inconsiderable as to be explained by the necessary
errors of observation.       But the constancy of the results in the two men,
and in the case of T., the amount on the first day after the work-period,                       as
given further on, seem to me to show the excess to be real.
    On the    same diet the heavier man excreted                rather more urea and total
nitrogen throughout than the smaller man, except in the first                  12 hours of the
 second active day, when the urea was a trifle less.
    The excretion of nitrogen in the urea,                  as compared with the total
 nitrogen, was (the ureal nitrogen being taken as unity) as follows : —
                                                        S.                     T.

In   both cases there appears to have been a greater relative excretion of the
nitrogenous substances other than ureal.                    Is it not probable that the
 creatinine was increased     ?

     The sulphuric acid       was  slightly increased in each man, but the                    i

     As the results    agree    in both men, it appears that on a diet free from
 common salt much more chloride of sodium passes with the urine during
rest than exercise ; it is to be inferred that in the latter case chloride of
 sodium passes off by the skin.
     No sugar      was   detected    in the urine by the ordinary                  tests   of liquor

    If these   numbers are compared with those of the corresponding period
of   rest, it appears    that the total intestinal excretion was larger, but this
arose in one man from an excess of water ; in the other the solids were
increased.       In both men the nitrogen         was in excess in the period of exer
cise, but the difference was not great,          and may probably be disregarded.

 were very greatly increased (nearly 100 and 50 per cent, respectively) j
 the intestinal egesta were also much larger ; the urinary smaller, especially
in the    case   of T., who    passed nearly 800 cub. centims. less           of urine, though
he took more fluid as drink.

                    Fifth Period. — Ordinary Diet and Exercise.
    The men       were now again placed on their weighed diet, and                     took their
ordinary     exercise for four days, except that on the day following                    the walk
of 33 miles they       were tired and rested a good deal.
    This period has now to be compared with the third period, which fol

   Unfortunately, on the third day, in the case of T., the determination of
the nitrogen by soda-lime was not satisfactory, and as some time elapsed
before    could be again done, the amount has been omitted.

posing there was the same relative excess over the ureal nitrogen as in the
other days, the total nitrogen would have been 13-97 grms.       Adopting
this number, the following are the results —                    :

   The question now arises, was this excess of nitrogen excreted during
the after work-period the result of the elimination of the products of
destroyed muscle during the work-period, or was    the consequence of an  it
excess  of nitrogenous food  the four days following the exercise

fore, in the case of S.,   cannot be affirmed that                          any excess             of nitrogen
was      derived from disintegration of muscle during the exercise.                                        In     the

 and almost      an ounce more vegetable (in all 1-2 grm. of nitrogen), it is
 evident that here also the excess of nitrogen in the urine might have been
 derived from the food.          However, it is really probable that some of the
 very large excess of urea on the first day of this period, in the case of T.,
 was really owing to augmented elimination from the work. No such ex
 cess is observable in the case of S., who had, however, a larger elimination

1867.]
   i The    reason   of  these differences    between   Professors Fick and Wislicenus     /
        myself, is probably to be found in the short period of time during
which their observations were carried on, and also because the urea was
not determined by them in the night of the 30th to 31st of August.                    /
     But their conclusion is certainly borne out, that on a non-nitroaenous
diet exercise produces no notable increase in the nitrogen of thsf urine,
although, when the whole period is considered, it                 does produce/ a slight
increase.
     It  may now^lso be said that, under similar conditions, exercise pro
duces no increaskin the excretion of nitrogen by the bowels*
     The diminution in the amount of urea during the actual period of work,
as compared with tire rest-period, which, if I am not mistaken, is obvious
in both our experiments, is a very curious circumstance.                     It shows, not
that on a non- nitrogenous diet the nerves and muscles/are totally unaffected
by exercise, but that changes go on which either retain nitrogen in the
body or eliminate it by another channel.                        /
     Is possible
         it              that   when   the   excess  of  nitrogen is restricted, the ex
hausted muscle will take nitrogen from the products given off from
another portion of decomposing^ muscle, and thus the nitrogen may be
 used over and over again ? or, after all, is nitrogen really given off in some
form by the skin during exercise, as\formerly supposed ?
     Although it is thus certain that veW severe exercise can be performed
 on non-nitrogenous diet for a short tirne, it does not follow that nitrogen
 is unnecessary. The largest experience^ shows not only that nitrogen
 must be supplied if work is to be done, hut that the amount must aug
 ment with the work.              But for a short period the well-fed body possesses
 sufficient nitrogen        to permit muscular exertionNto go on for some time with
 out fresh supply.           But the destruction of nitrogenous tissues in these two
 men      is  shown     by  the  way in which, when nitrogen was again supplied,
  a large amount was retained in the body to compensate                   for the previous
  deprivation.
      I  believe also that in these two men the great exhaustion of the second
  day showed that their muscles and nerves were becomingstructurally im
  paired, and that if the experiments had been continued there would have
  been on the third /day a large diminution in the amount of work.
      I   have found/ that the period when a restricted supply\pf nitrogen
  begins      to tell Am the work        differs in different    men ; in one   \xperiment
  I reduced      the' nitrogen in the food to one half its normal quantity in two
  men ; in one no effect was produced on exercise in seven days, in tne other
                                                                                       \
  a lessening of active bodily work was produced in five days ; doubtless the
  previous/nutrition of the muscle would influence the time.
                   it may     be questioned whether the relation         of elimination fcf
  nitrogen to        exercise   can be properly determined in this manner, i. e. by
   cutting off the supply of nitrogen.             The true method would probably be
        supply nitrogen in certain definite amount, so that the acting muscle

  2867.]          Dr. Parkcs     on the   Elimination of Nitrogen.                 355
    The   reason  of these differences    between    Professors  Fick and Wislicenus
 and myself is probably to be found in the short period of time during
 which their observations were carried on, and also because the urea was
 not determined by them in the night of the 30th to 31st of August.
    But their conclusion is certainly borne out, that on a non-nitrogenous diet
 exercise produces no notable increase in the nitrogen of the urine — although,
 when the whole period is considered, it does produce a slight increase.
    It may now also be said that, under similar conditions, exercise pro
 duces no increase in the excretion of nitrogen by the bowels.
    The diminution in the amount of urea during the actual period of work,
 as compared with the rest-period, which, if I am not mistaken/ is obvious
 in both our experiments, is a very curious circumstance. It shows, not
 that on a non-nitrogenous diet the nerves and muscles are totally unaffected
 by exercise, but that changes go on which either retain nitrogen in the
 body or eliminate it by another channel.
    Is it possible that, when the excess of nitrogen is restricted, the ex
 hausted muscle will take nitrogen from the products given off from
 another portion of decomposing muscle, and thus the nitrogen may be
 used over and over again      ?  or, after all, is nitrogen really given off in some
form by the skin during exercise, as formerly supposed ?
    Although it is thus certain that very severe exercise can be performed
 on non-nitrogenous diet for a short time, it does not follow that nitrogen
is unnecessary. The largest experience shows, not only that nitrogen
must be supplied if work is to be done, but that the amount must aug
ment with the work.           For a short period the well-fed body possesses
sufficient nitrogen to permit muscular exertion to go on for some time with
out a fresh supply ; but the destruction of nitrogenous tissues in these two
men is shown by the way in which, when nitrogen was again supplied,
a large amount was retained in the body to compensate, for the previous
deprivation.
   I believe   also  that in these two men the great exhaustion of the second
day showed that their muscles and nerves were becoming structurally im
paired, and that, if the experiments had been continued, there would have
been on the third day a large diminution in the amount of work.
   I   have found that the period when a restricted supply of nitrogen
begins to tell on the work differs in different men. In one experiment
I reduced    the nitrogen   in the food to one-half its normal quantity in two
men   :  in one, no effect was produced on exercise       in seven days ; in the other,
a lessening of active bodily work was produced in five days.            Doubtless the
previous nutrition of the muscle would influence the time.
   Finally, it may be questioned whether the relation of elimination of
nitrogen to exercise can be properly determined in this manner, i. e. by
cutting off the supply of nitrogen. The true method would probably be
to supply nitrogen in certain definite amount, so that the acting muscle
might appropriate at once what it required.

  These experiments are a continuation of those described in a paper read
February 22, 1866, with some modifications in the apparatus employed
which render the comparison between torsion and flexure more direct.
The amount of torsion or flexure produced by subjecting                                     a cylindrical      rod
to a uniform couple throughout its whole length, is measured by                                        means of
two mirrors clamped to the rod near its ends, in which, by the aid of two
telescopes,      the reflexions of         a scale    overhead are seen and the                         displace
ments read off.           One end of the rod is fixed, and                 a   couple        (of     torsion   and
flexure alternately) is applied to the other end.
   Three rods, of glass, brass, and steel, were experimented on, and                                       the re
sults obtained were as              follows — M,      n, and k denoting the resistances                           (in

   In   those cases where the values         of radiation       and vapour do not agree, the
exceptions will, it is believed, be sufficiently accounted for ; thus the oc
currence of the second maximum of solar radiation in September 1843 in
place of July, though tension was higher in the latter month, is explained
by the obscuration of the sun, and the unusual quantity of rain in July.
The tension of vapour in September was -06 higher than in JuneJ.

tember occurred in 18G5, when tho excess over the mean of the five preceding Sep
tembers was 21°7, and the increase of contemporaneous vapour-tension -086. This
appears to be accounted for by the rainfall in August        the weather in September 1865

    Actinometer-observations. — The observations of the actinometer made                          by
Mr. Nash        at the Royal Observatory in 1864 supply                  further  evidence    of the
fact that the maxima of radiation occur in the autumn, and after 0h.
     I have extracted the mean results of the several groups of observations
which were taken at or near the same elevation of the sun, in the months
 of August and September in autumn, and in the months of March and
April in spring, and find that the value of the mean increase of the scale-
 readings in the autumn is about 100 per cent, greater than in the
 springj.
    The mean increase of the scale-readings in March and April is 19'4.
    The mean increase of the scale-readings in August and September is 39'fc.
     The difference is 20-2, at the same mean altitude of the sun.
    The means of the contemporaneous observations of the vacuum-thermo
 meter on the grass were as follows             : —
                          In March and April                           70°'3  F.
                          In August and September            . . .     840,7  F.
     The difference is 14°'4.
     And the mean tension of vapour for the four mouths is, in March                             and
 April '23, and in August and September '34.
     * August U the only month in which the mean tension of vapour is higher at                4> r.M.
 than at 2h 1.m.
    t  With    the exception   of July (when there is the minimum difference of -007 between
 the results at 10*   a.m. and  noon) and of September (when there is the maximum difference
 -014), the mean increase       in tension at noon in the several months is also remarkably
 regular.

    The great    accordance     between the foregoing results renders              it unnecessary

    Increased solar radiation supposed                 to be   due   to the action      of aqueous
 vapour. — Herr von Schlagiutweit, applying Professor Tyndall's discovery
 of the absorptive properties of aqueous vapour to the phenomenon of inso
 lation, attributed the high readings of his solar thermometer, in certain
 parts of India, to the fact that air, when highly charged with moisture,
 impedes free radiation ; that is to say, the air restores to the instrument
 some portion of the heat which has been radiated off from it.
    A like cause has been recently assigned for the variations in temperature
 which take place on clear nights in Madras                   under different tensions of        va-

   364                   Mr.  J,  P. Harrison on      the  Relation of          [Feb.   14,
      The explanation of the phenomenon of the maxima of insolation oc
  curring on days of great relative humidity in India, however, which has been
   already alluded to, applies with increased force to the absorptive properties
  of visible moisture ; and the known action of even the lightest form of cloud
  in radiating heat to the earth, would point to this as the principal cause of
  the phenomenon, though it cannot be doubted that some of the effect is
  due to the action of invisible vapour, whether as warmed directly by the
 solar rays, or by heat derived from a secondary source.
      The dependence of terrettrial heal on vapour and cloud. — It was                    to
  increased or diminished radiation under a clear or clouded sky that                   the
 inflections of the curves of mean temperature, which I communicated                      to
 the Royal Society in May 1865, were ascribed*.                   The effects produced
 were on that occasion considered to be principally due to radiation at nightf;
 but an examination of the daily means proved that a similar action occurred
 also by day %, — the phenomenon in fact depending, as in the case of solar ra
 diation, on the quantity of moisture in the air.
     The   precise values    of heat resulting from the action and reaction        of solar
radiation and vapour cannot be ascertained until mean numerical values have
been deduced from a sufficient number of hourly observations to afford
trustworthy data for determination.                The present paper merely helps         to
establish a     relation  between    solar  radiation   and humidity, and suggests       aa
additional cause for the effects which appear to follow from it.
     * It has since been found    that the value of the difference of temperature for fifty
years at Greenwich, due to terrestrial      radiation, was very much understated by me,
principally from the fact that the mean temperatures for the greater part of the entire
period had been corrected by quantities in the Philosophical Transactions which were
afterwards found to bo erroneous, and have been disused at Greenwich for several years.
All the conclusions which were baaed specially on the results for fifty years must there
fore be considered    as withdrawn.
.   The results derived from the more perfect means for periods of seven and eight yean
are confirmed by the Oxford thermographs, and by almost identical results which I
find were obtained by Dr. Mtidler from fifteen years' observations at Berlin nearly
thirty years ago.

    II.  " On    the Conversion        of Dynamical into Electrical Force with
          out the aid of Permanent Magnetism."                   By C. W. Siemens,
          F.R.S. Received February 4, 1867.
       Since the great discovery of magnetic electricity by Faraday in 1830,
    electricians have had recourse to mechanical force for the production of
    their most powerful effects ; but the power of the magneto-electrical ma
    chine seems to depend in an equal measure upon the force expended on the
    one hand, and upon permanent magnetism on the other.
       An experiment, however, has been lately suggested to me by my brother,
    Dr. Werner Siemens of Berlin, which proves that permanent magnetism is

868                Conversion         of Dynamical into Electrical Force.             [Feb. 14,
not requisite in order to convert mechanical into electrical force ; and the
result obtained by this experiment is remarkable, not only because it de
monstrates this hitherto unrecognized fact, but also because it provides a
simple means of producing very powerful electrical effects.
   The apparatus employed in this experiment is an electro-magnetic machine
consisting of one or more horseshoes of soft iron surrounded with insulated
wire in the usual manner, of a rotating keeper of soft iron surrounded
also with an insulated wire, and of a commutator connecting the respective
coils in the manner of a magneto-electrical machine.      a galvanic batteryIf
were connected with this arrangement, rotation of the keeper in a given
direction would ensue.    If the battery were excluded from the circuit and
rotation imparted to the keeper in the opposite direction to that resulting
from the galvanic current, there would be no electrical effect produced,
supposing the electro-magnets were absolutely free of magnetism ; but by
inserting a battery of a single cell in the circuit, a certain magnetic condition
would be set up, causing similar electro-magnetic poles to be forcibly ap
proached to each other, and dissimilar poles to be forcibly severed, alter
nately, the rotation being contrary in direction to that which would be pro
duced by the exciting current.
   Each forcible approach of similar poles must augment the magnetic ten
sion and increase consequently the power of the circulating current ; the
resistance of the keeper to the rotation must also increase at every step
until it reaches a maximum, imposed by the available force and the con
ductivity of the wires employed.
   The cooperation of the battery is only necessary for a moment of time
after the rotation has commenced, in order to introduce the magnetic action,
which will thereupon continue to accumulate without its aid.
  With the rotation the current ceases ; and                  if,
                                              upon restarting the machine,

 electro-magnets.         On imparting rotation        to the armature   of such an arrange

 extent that either the driving-strap               commences     to slip or the insulated
wires constituting the coils are heated to the extent of igniting their insu
lating silk covering.
    It is  thus possible to produce mechanically the most powerful electrical
or calorific effects without the aid of steel magnets, which latter are open to
the practical objection          of losing their permanent magnetism in          use.
III. * On        the Augmentation of the Power of a Magnet by the reaction
       thereon of Currents induced by the Magnet itself." By Charles
        Wheatstone,           F.R.S.        Received February 14, 1867.
   The magneto-electric machines which have been hitherto                      described are
actuated either by a permanent magnet or by an electro-magnet deriving
its power     from a rheomotor placed in the circuit of its coil. In the present
note   I  intend to show that an electro-magnet, if it possess at the commence
ment the slightest polarity, may become a powerful magnet by the gradu
ally augmenting currents which               itself originates.
   The following is a description of the form and dimensions of the electro
magnet I have employed. The construction, it will be seen, is the same as
that of the electro-magnetic part of Mr. Wilde's machine.
   The core of the electro-magnet is formed of a plate of soft iron 15 inches
in length and ^ an inch in breadth, bent at the middle of its length into a
horseshoe form.             Round it is coiled in the direction of its breadth, 640
feet of insulated copper wire -fe of an inch in diameter.                     The armature,
which is according to Siemens's ingenious construction, consists of a rota
ting cylinder       of soft iron 8| inches in length, grooved         at two opposite sides
so as to     allow the wire to be coiled upon it longitudinally ; the length of
the wire     thus coiled is 80 feet, and its diameter is the same as that of the
electro-magnet         coil.
   When this electro-magnet is excited by any rheomotor the current from
which is in a constant direction, during                the rotation of the armature cur
rents are     generated in its coil during each semirevolution, which are alter
nately    in  opposite directions ; these alternate currents may be transmitted
unchanged to another part of the circuit, or by means of a rheotrope be
converted to the same direction.
   If now,      while the circuit of the armature remains completed, the rheomo
tor be removed        from the electro-magnet, on causing the armature to revolve,
however rapidly,         it will  he found by the interposition      of  a galvanometer, or
any    other     test,   that but very slight effects take place. Though these
effects become       stronger in proportion to the residual magnetism left in the
electro-magnet from the previous action of a current, they never attain any
considerable amount.
    But if the wires of the two circuits be so joined as to form a single cir

370                  Mr. Whcatstone     on the Augmentation             [Feb.  14,
cuit, in which the currents generated by the armature, after being changed
to the same direction, act so as to increase the existing polarity of the elec
tro-magnet, very different results will be obtained.       The force required to
more the machine will be far greater, showing a great increase of magnetic
power in the horseshoe ; and the existence of an energetic current in tit
wire is shown by its action on a galvanometer, by its heating 4 inches of
platinum wire "0067 in diameter, by its making a powerful electro-magnet,
by its decomposing water, and by other tests.
   The explanation      of these  effects  is as follows : — The electro-magnet
always retains a slight residual magnetism, and is therefore     in the condition
of a weak permanent magnet ; the motion of the armature occasions feeble
currents in alternate directions in the coils thereof, which, after being re
duced to the same direction, pass into the coil of the electro-magnet in
such manner as to increase the magnetism of the iron core ; the magnet
having thus received an accession of strength, produces in its turn more
energetic currents in the coil of the armature ; and these alternate actions
continue until a maximum is attained, depending on the rapidity of the
motion and the capacity of the electro-magnet.
   If the two coils be connected in such manner that the rectified current
from the coil of the armature passes into the coil of the electro-magnet in
the direction which would impart a contrary magnetism to the iron core,
no current is produced, and consequently there is no augmentation         of mag
netism.
    It is easy to prove that the residual magnetism of the electro-magnet is
the determining cause of these powerful effects.         For this purpose it is
sufficient to pass a current from a voltaic battery, a magneto-electric ma
chine, or any other rheomotor, into the coil of the electro-magnet in either
direction, and it will invariably be found that the direction of the current,
however powerful it may eventually become, is in accordance with the po
larity of the magnetism impressed on the iron core.
    If, instead of the currents in the coil of the rotating armature being    re
duced to the same uniform direction, they retain their alternations, no effects,
or at most very small differential ones, are produced, as no accumulation of
magnetism then takes place.
    I will now call attention to the fact that stronger effects are produced at
the first moment of completing the combined circuit than afterwards.
The machine having      been put in motion, at the first moment    of completing
the circuit    4 inches of platina wire   were  made   red-hot, but immediately
afterwards the glow disappeared, and only about one inch of the wire could
be permanently kept at a red heat.        This diminution of effect was accom
 panied by a great increase of the resistance of the machine.       The cause of
 the momentary strong effect was, that the machine from its acquired mo
 mentum continued its motion for a few seconds, though it required a
 stronger force than could be applied to maintain that motion.         Each time
 the circuit is broken and recomplcted the same effect recurs.

1867.]                     of the Power of a Magnet by reaction.                         371
     On      bringing    the primary coil of an inductorium (RuhmkorfPs coil) into
the circuit         formed by connecting the coils of the electro-magnet and rota
ting      armature, no spark occurs in the secondary coil.                On account of the
 great resistance of the circuit, which now              also includes the primary coil    of
 the inductorium,           the current is not in sufficient quantity to produce any
 noticeable inductive effect.
       A    very remarkable increase of all the effects, accompanied by a diminu
  tion in the resistance of the machine, is observed when a cross wire is
  placed so as to divert a great portion of the current from the electro
  magnet.           The four inches of platinum wire, instead of flashing into redness
  and then disappearing, remains permanently ignited. The inductorium,
   which before gave no spark, now gave one a quarter of an inch in length ;
   ¦water was more abundantly decomposed                ; and all the other effects were
   similarly increased.
        I  account for this augmentation of the effects in the following way : —
        Though so much of the current is diverted from the electro-magnet by
   the cross wire, the magnetic effect still continues to accumulate, though
    not to so high a degree ; but the current generated by the armature, passing
    through the short circuit formed by             the armature-branch       and cross wire,
    experiences a far less resistance than if it had passed through the armature
    and electro-magnet branches ; and though the electromotive force is less,
    the resistance having been rendered less in a much greater proportion, the
     resultant effect is greater.
         I  must observe that a certain amount of resistance            in the  cross wire is
     necessary to produce the maximum effect.               If  the resistance be too small,
     the electro-magnet does not acquire sufficient magnetism ; and if it be too
     great, though the magnetism becomes stronger, the increase of resistance
      more than counterbalances        its effect.
         But the      effects already described are far inferior to those obtained by
      causing them to take place        in the  cross wire itself.    With   the same appli
      cation   of force, 7 inches of platinum wire were made red-hot, and sparks were
      elicited  in the inductorium 2\ inches in length.
         The force of two men was employed in these, as well as in the other ex
      periments.       When the interrupter of the primary coil was fixed, the ma
      chine was much easier to move than when it acted.                  For when the inter
      rupter   acted,    at  each moment    of  interruption    the  cross  wire being, as it
      were, removed, the whole of the current passed through the electro-magnet,
      and consequently a greater amount of magnetic energy was excited, while
      in the intervals during which the cross wire was complete                   the current
       passed mainly through the primary coil.
          The effects are much less influenced by a resistance in the electro-mag
       net branch than in either of the other branches.
          To reduce the length      of the spark in the inductorium (the primary coil
       of which was       placed in the cross wire) to | of an inch, it required the re-

              of    5 -J
the armature-branch, and 4 feet in the electro-magnet branch.
   When there was no extra resistance in either of the branches, the length
of the cross wire being only about a few feet, the intensity of the current
in the electro-magnet branch, compared with that in the cross wire, was as
 1:60; and when the resistance of the primary coil of the inductorinm was
interposed in the cross wire, the relative intensities were as 1 : 42.
     In conclusion             I
                     will mention that there is an evident analogy between
the augmentation of the power of a weak magnet by means of an inductive
action produced by itself, and that accumulation of power shown in the
static electric machines of Holtz and others which have recently excited
considerable attention, in which a very small quantity of electricity directly
excited       is,   by
                 series of inductive actions, augmented so as to equal, and
                           a
even exceed, the effects of the most powerful machines of the ordinary con
struction.

I       have been led to attempt the preparation                    of   a   general view   of Silurian
life, as far as now known, by my own frequent want                              of such    a   record or
muster-roll of the constituent members of this great initiatory division of
palaeozoic zoology,
                    — task which has been made pleasant

knowledge of two countries rich in the earlier formations.
I   have been further encouraged by the great accumulations of the last
few years, through the establishment in North America and elsewhere of
numerous colleges, each of them having become the centre of more or less
field-work.    Far more aid still has been derived from many public surveys
on   atolerably liberal scale. Nor can we forget the highly meritorious and
successful  labours which have been, and still are, carried on by private
individuals in almost every part of Europe and North America.
     As this undertaking required                  critical skill in deter
                                                    an exactitude and    a

presides.
     To the careful superintendence of these two eminent naturalists I am
indebted for corrections and suggestions of the greatest importance, and
particularly as relates to Britain and to Europe generally. .
     My matter has beea principally found in the voluminous and truly
priceless writings of Murchison, Sedgwick, Barrande, Sowerby, DeVerneuil,
James Hall, McCoy, Salter, Billings, Angelin, Eichwald, Shumard, and
Davidson — together with those of other authors, some of whom are scarcely
of inferior merit*.
     I  have been favoured with many unpublished contributions from my
 friends Mr. Billings (the learned Paleontologist of the Canadian Survey)
and Principal Dawson, F.R.S., of McGill College, Montreal, — also, through
 the kindness of Mr. Salter, from the Himalayas (Colonel Strachey, R.E.),
from West Tasmania (Dr. Milligan), from South Wales (Henry Hicks,
 Esq.), and from the late Mr. Wyatt-Edgell.
     I   propose to give to this effort the name of " Thesaurus Siluricus."
 Besides its use for general reference in the closet and in the quarry, the
 •
    Thesaurus ' provides a high station from which the student may obtain a
 broad survey of the Silurian populations of the whole earth.                    It will
 assist in tracing the extent, shape, and varying depths of areas, in dis
 covering      regional affinities, differences, and those great zoological seve
  rances which we call breaks.               By its aid we may compare horizons
  remote from each other, and, moreover, note the frequent changes of
  many kinds which take place while the epoch is working out its long
  history.      It will place under our examination numberless communities of
  life, their constituents, habits, rise, and decline.
      The 'Thesaurus' points       to the universality (as defined) at times proximate
   everywhere, brings       into prominence the riches, magnitude, and wide diffu
   sion of the Primordial stage ; illustrates the power of locality over life,
   and opens out the wonderful march           of geographic dispersion through      ob
   stacles innumerable.
      For   a long period naturalists have      been arranging    the life of the globe
   into species, genera, orders, &c., with a view to the establishment of types
   as standards of comparison.          It is from such data, well considered and
                                           '             '
   generally acknowledged, that this Thesaurus has been compiled.
       As long as an individual mollusk remains unregistered it is deprived of
   its full usefulness ; but even then it may reveal an important fact— as the
   trilobite speaks of the Palaeozoic period, and      a  nummulitc of the Tertiary.

   which it occurs, then, in a given order, its author and locality, or localities,
   in the column indicative of its proper stage.
        More information is thus conveyed, it is believed, than by any other
    form of Table. The summary which is appended to each order shows some
    of the organic relations of the Silurian     system  in Europe and in America
    to each other ; it shows, too, how very little we know as yet of this epoch in
    Asia and Africa ; and, among other things, it tells us the numerical strength
    of the   genera.

  Sufficient territory              resting on Silurian rocks has                been spared from
oscillatory action to enable us to trace                    it    in one or other of its parts over
a large part of the earth.     Vie follow                         it circuitously from England to
Australia, or to America               — the interspaces being filled up either by                   sea,           by
newer rocks, or by kindred palaeozoic strata, which themselves                                  irresistibly
bespeak its frequent continuous existence near at hand.

 locality on the nature and amount of life, in the same way as we observe
 at the present time. As each region yields up its fauna to the collector,
 njuch of that fauna is found to be new, the bond of connexion with other
  Silurian districts being in great measure generic.
     The physical conditions of sea and land being necessarily local, pro
 duced as they are from time to time by agencies limited in space, the
 dwellers among these conditions must in a certain measure be local too,
 and typical — subject at any moment to removal. The first occupants of

     The maximum of life, meaning by that expression the largest combina
 tion of abundance, variety, and rank, is local. It may take place at the
 beginning of a stage, or of an epoch, in the middle, or at the end, being
governed principally by the nature of the sediment. The rich Primordial
beds of Western Newfoundland                   and of Quebec, the crowded Pleta beds of
 Russia and of Esthonia, the Trenton Limestone of America, the Mid-Silu
rian rocks of Bohemia* (E. e. 1, 2), some of those of Wales, the Lower
Helderberg group of New York, are conspicuous examples of this. Parts
of the Llandovery stage of Wales and of New York (U. S. A.) present a
great dearth of life, and for a well-known reason.                        How barren are the
vast accumulations of Lower Silurian in Bolivia, as at present believed !
The Potsdam Sandstone of the valleys of the St. Lawrence and the Missis
sippi shows no signs of life for hundreds (and perhaps thousands) of square
miles, save in small oases peopled chiefly by Lingular in incalculable mil
lions of individuals.

    The Cephalopoda, Crustacea, Brachiopoda, and Annelida of Europe ap
pear to largely exceed in number of species those of North America, while
in nine Orders (see Table C) the two hemispheres hold nearly equal quan
tities. America greatly surpasses Europe in the number of its Crinoids,
and to a smaller extent in Plantae and Gasteropoda.             I am not prepared
with any inference from these facts. We know that the mineral constitu
tion, and the past external influences in these several parts of the earth
are different — not that the first is as influential as has been supposed.

    Many    species are marked as undefined     in the    Thesaurus,' because they
are often only known by simple fragments.
    About a thousand species have never been seen but in one locality.          At
 least 200 Cyrtocerata     are  huddled  together  in the  two contiguous parishes
 of Lockhov and Kozorz, near Prague, and, with other mollusks there, are
unknown elsewhere.         Other instances of this might be cited.
    The two Silurian districts of Sardinia, with not a few fossils in common
with Spain, although tolerably well examined by La Marmora and Mene-
ghini, have not hitherto produced a Trilobite ; nor has Spain given up a
Pentamerus, as far as can be learnt.         Out of our sixty species of Asa phis
only one is known in Bohemia.          Silurian fish are only mentioned as exist
ing in Britain, Bohemia, and Russia ; but doubtless they are in other Silu
rian areas.
     The Trilobite genus Bikelocephalus         of D. D. Owen contains thirty
species.     Only three are found in two       places.    Twelve species are near
 Quebec,     and  there only.     Nine   others are Minnesotan, on the Upper
 Mississippi ;   while  the States  of Texas and Vermont, on Lake Champlain,
 have each one, and Wales three— all distinct species.              Western New
 foundland, although primordial, is thought to be without this remarkable
genus.
     Each of the twenty- seven known species of the Heteropod Maclurea is
 confined to one spot ; twenty are American ; and of these, eleven are con
 fined to Newfoundland West.
     Of the forty-five  species  of the genus Trockoceras (Cephalopoda), forty-
 three are restricted to the vicinity of Prague ; and of these twenty-seven
 inhabited the very small space of 4-6 square miles, in company with many
 other mollusks.      The Brachiopoda of Bohemia are mostly in the Fauna
 F,   and in the two small districts   of Konieprus and Mnienian.
     Out of 270 species of Orthis only two are believed to be in Nora Scotia,
 and of the 109 species of the Gasteropod Murchisonia, again, two, but
 not one of the elsewhere most abundant genus Pleurotomaria.
     On the other hand, Nova Scotia holds one-half of all our Cleidophora ;
  and Tasmania is singularly rich in Palcearca, while the Point Levi shales
  are crowded with theGraptolite family, of extreme beauty, and rarely found
  in other countries. We further observe that, as it is with the horizontal
  disposition of Silurian life, so it is with the vertical : only twelve per cent,
  leave their native horizon, as we shall Bee.

has   treated this subject with his usual great ability in the first volume of
the                 '

    The Primordial            of Barrande (Tacouic of Emmons) is truly Silu
                            stage

   In    the valley of the St. Lawrence it may average 8600 feet in thickness.
    Resting horizontally in America on the inclined Laurentian rocks, the
 lower break is complete in every respect ; while the upper break is very
 nearly   so, although purely organic.
    Itdivides naturally into Lower and Upper Primordial, — Potsdam sand
 stone constituting the former, and calciferous sandstone, with the enig
 matical Quebec group, the latter, with a few layers of chazy limestone
 superadded.
    The whole flora and fauna of the Primordial  stage, American and Eu
 ropean, amount to 919  species, while  those of the St. Lawrence Valley
 alone are 5C0. The western, therefore, seems to be the richer of the two
 hemispheres ; and this comes out still more distinctly in stating the fact
 thnt the Primordial genera at present known in America are 134, and those
 of all Europe 83.

      Great interest attaches to every part of this stage, but especially to the

 380                   Dr.       J. J. Bigsby's Brief Account of the          [Feb. 21,
 Quebec group and its ill-understood                connexion with the immediately con
 tiguous strata.
    An intimate acquaintance with this group near Quebec leads me to
 believe that there, at least, it is a displaced, crumpled, and fractured mass
 of schist, with thin beds of limestone and calcareous conglomerate inter
 leaved,     the last crowded with molluscan and crustacean life.
    It     is above   the Potsdam Sandstone, and on or near the             horizon   of
 Calciferous sandstone and the lower layers of Chazy Limestone (Logan
 and Billings, Report, 1863).   Into these (with a distinct tendency still
 higher) in other parts of North America, the Quebec group probably be
 comes fused, and assumes their horizontal position, mineral character, and
 many of their organic contents.
    The fauna of the Quebec group, consisting of 327 species at Point Levi
 (Quebec) and in Western Newfoundland, is peculiar, and, of course, is
 only found there, with the exception of thirteen species found elsewhere in
 Calciferous sandstone,and eight in Chazy Limestone.  They are one-six
teenth of the whole, and are as follows : —
   Calciferous Sandstone : — Lingula Mantelli, L. acuminata, L. Irene,
Cameralla calcifera, Helicotoma gorgonia, H. uniangulata, H. perstriata,
Pleurotomaria calcifera, P.postumia, Holopma dilueulal, Ecculiomphalus
Canadensis, Murchisonia Anna, Piloeeras Canadense (Billings).
    Chazy Limestone          :   — Ecculiomphalus Atlanticus, Maclurea       Atlantica,
Stromatopora compact a (running into B + BL), Climacograptus antenna-
rius, Ptilodictya fenestrata 1, Leperditia amygdalina, Camerella variant,
Cheirurus prolificus (Billings).                      •
    This group contains, besides the thirteen species just enumerated, 1/4*
allied to those of the Calciferous Sandstone of Central North America, or
more or less westward of Montreal.   It Is this which connects it closely
with the sandstone.    However, 140 remain typical.
   The fossils of Chazy Limestone met with in the Quebec group only be
long to a few of the basement beds of the former, because these almost
immediately, upwards, [change into a compact mass of crushed Crinoids,
Cephalopoda, Gasteropoda, &c. (143 species) — all quite new, and alien
from the life below.
   The Calciferous Sandstone, always truly primordial, has in the Canadas
and the United States of America 375 species, overspreading vast areas.
They may       be separated       into three sets   :   —
   1.Thirteen enter the Quebec group.
  2. One hundred and seventy-four are the allies of that group.
  3. One hundred and eighty-eight are foreign to               it,
                                                     and for the most part
typical.
  Like its two sister groups, the Calciferous Sandstone     shown, in the
                                                                     is

 dividuals, nevertheless,       being prodigiously numerous.           Trilobites  are here
very few.
     Potsdam Sandstone is rich [in Trilobites, Brachiopoda, and Fucoids, but
 in   every other form is very poor ; and yet it possesses a Cystid.
     In the Primordial group, therefore, we find numerous representatives of
 nearly every marine Invertebrate ; and we have a startling example of the
 sudden     development in very early times of the highest types of molluscan
 life, Nautili, Lituites, Trilobites, Protichnites, &c., dwelling, even then, in
 well adjusted communities.
     Most of these facts are taken from the ' Thesaurus ;' but this interesting
                     '              '
portion of the Thesaurus itself is the gift of Barrande, Emmons, Hall,
Logan, and Billings *, and is the fruit of their unwearied study in the city,
and of their toil in the field.
                                          Recurrence.
     A  few words on the subject of recurrence, or the vertical range of Silu
rian life.
     What can be more unexpected, or more wonderful, than the upward
passage by a filial succession, through stages and epochs, of a mollusk
 during centuries inconceivably numerous ! What an almost interminable
 series of posterities must have followed the first ancestor !                The doctrine
of limited duration in species must have its exceptions.
                           '
    The ' Thesaurus enumerates 803 recurrents, or 12 percent, of the
whole known life of the epoch — a very notable proportion, — still leaving
 6200 species faithful to one horizon.
     The synoptical Table E, compiled from the ' Thesaurus,' exhibits many
details, and may be trusted approximately, although about 400 species
have been passed by for want of sufficient information.                  It numbers sepa
rately    the  species   typical   of one  horizon,   and  the  species  frequenting more
 than one horizon (being recurrent).              It also introduces some of the greater
genera, such as Orthis, Murchisonia,             &c.
     The               are    arranged    under the heads        " Primordial," Lower,"
             species
" Middle," and "Upper Silurian ;" and in the                  case  of the recurrents   the
number of horizons occupied by them is shown by the figures 2, 3, 4, 5.
Thus we find that 69 Lower Silurian Trilobites occupy two horizons, 15
three, and 2 five horizons.
    The percentage is stated in the last column, next to that containing the
total recurrence of each order.
       The  Primordial      stage only gives 2-7 per cent,       of recurrency.

    * It is well to note that, under Sir William E. Logan's able superintendence, we owe
the splendid Primordial harvest gathered in Newfoundland and Anticosti, to the dili

       The orders vary greatly in respect to rccurrency. There is none among
  fossil fish. In Cystidea it is only 3 per cent., in Gomphoceras 5 per cent.,
  and is greatest in Strophomena, 31 per cent.
        Although a considerable number of inferences have been prepared, I
- shall      only venture now to introduce a few.
        1 . Recurrence is universal, both as to time and place.
        2. Recurrences seem to be most numerous in the lower stages of the
   epoch ; but further research may teach otherwise.
        3. Species do not often change their horizon, not even when placed in
   countries far apart.
        4. The same species may be typical of a single horizon in one country
   and recurrent in another.
        5. Recurrency shows that a mollusk is not necessarily confined to any
   one community, but may find a home and flourish in several successively.
        G.   The number of recurrents       measures      the amount of change in con
   ditions.
        7.   Communities,    genera,  and species disappear sporadically, except in
    the    rare case  of a catastrophe.
        8. Recurrency is a measure       of viability.
                                 Extra-epochal     Recurrence.
        Few things demonstrate more plainly the sterner discipline now pre
    vailing than the reduction by Mr. Salter to 133 of the 439 palaeozoic spe
    cies which I had tabulated as extra-epochal, although they had the sanc
    tion of    the best palaeontologists   of  the   last fifteen or twenty years.
        My Table, as originally made out, deals with the five palseozoic epochs,
     but in this place only with the forty-two Silurian species which leave for
     the higher periods. To these, recently, several interesting additions have
     been made.
        I. These recurrents are mostly distinct from the intra-epochal, owing to
     their first appearance being in the Upper Silurian stage.
        II. With the exception otChonetes sarcinulata, they all stop within the
     Devonian Period.
        III.   The greater part of       these   recurrents are of low rank       ;  20 are
     Brachiopoda     ;  11 Zoophytes,    1 an Amorphozoa         ;   7 are Gasteropoda   ;  3
     Cephalopoda ; and 1 Trilobite. Manon deforme and Orthis rugosa, Lower
     Silurian fossils, reappear in Devonian, but not in Upper Silurian, where
     they are
                                "
                 " presumably — to use an expression of Mr. Etheridge.
         IV. These species are very migratory — few being found in two epochs
     in the same country, but in different countries.
        V. Opportunities of escape into a new epoch                have been common   ;   but
     the ways and means are frequently concealed by denudations, &C.
        VI. Acclimatization must have been necessary.
        VII.    The length of individual life in proportion               to specific extra-
      epochal life is almost as a unit to infinity;

                      Geographical Distribution        of Silurian Life,
     The   ' Thesaurus'    tends to show that North America, east of the Rocky
 Mountains, may probably be divided into two areas, — the one to the north
 of 57° (or of Lake Superior) being chiefly Upper Silurian, resting on crys
 talline rocks, the one to the south of that line, down to the Gulf of
 Mexico,      on the contrary, being      fully developed in     some part     of this  great
 space.
     It  exhibits the regrettable fact that Asia, Africa, and Australia, taken
 together, have hitherto yielded only 200 species of Silurian remains ; but
 this arises from the absence of exploration.
     I have not yet had opportunity to bring together, harmonize, and com
 pare the Silurian life of the sevcrnl countries of Europe.                    The accom
 plishment of such       a  task might produce some definite truths, and many
 more probabilities.        Either this vast region would prove to be one great
 Silurian     area, with barriers here and there, and with certain channels of
 communication,       and to be the       result of many operations throughout a
long interval of time ; or it might turn out that the Silurian deposits and
 their fossils occupy three separate areas : — (1) the Britanno-Scandinavian,
 which has all the three stages, and the Primordial ; (2) the Bohemian, at

 1
   867.]        On a Transit-Instrument and a Zenith Sector.                  385
present of peculiar interest ; and (3) the middle and southern area, found
in France, Spain, and Sardinia, almost wholly Lower and Mid-Silurian.
    Under this head of geographical distribution we have to deal with some
curious    phenomena — such as concern birthplace or first appearance,
generic and specific, the duration of life, tolerance of conditions, mineral
habitats.     Migration possesses great interest, with its marks, causes, and
modes, with its power, direction, and rate of progress, &c.
    The transport or removal of dead organic matter from place to place,
the " remaniement
                      " of French
                                     geologists, is an important agency under
several aspects, especially  in  the formation of extensive sheets of rock.
    It now has become proper to bring to a close these few observations, or
rather this enumeration of heads of Natural-History subjects, by express
ing a confident hope that this compilation will find many and well qualified
interpreters, and will be useful to geologists in general.

    In  1862 the Secretary  of  State for  India in Council sanctioned the pro
vision of an extensive equipment of geodesical and astronomical instruments
of the first order for the use of the Great Trigonometrical Survey of India ;
and he did me the honour to entrust to me the task of designing and super
 intending their construction.     After  several modifications, the following list
 was adopted : —

The axis   of aluminium bronze, cast in
                is                                 one piece, hollow, and turned both
inside and out. The two halves of the              telescope   are easily separable     from
the axis for         portability.
        It                         for rendering the axis horizontal ; these
             is provided with four levels
are mounted on a plan suggested    and devised by Mr. Cooke. He remarks
that the ordinary striding level usually applied to such instruments watches
the pivots only, whereas the observer wishes to be informed whether or not
the telescope itself describes a true plane.  This it will not do if the flexure
of the axis differs, as it may do, in different altitudes. Mr. Cooke there
fore attaches the levels to the telescope.    His mode of doing this, and of
providing for their due adjustment, will, in the absence of drawings, be best
understood by inspecting the instrument.
   The means of adjusting the axis vertically and azimuthally are also pe
culiar.         The bearings                turn are carried by strong three-
                                  on which the pivots
armed pieces, similar in form to the tribrach of an ordinary theodolite.    On
one side the  tribrach  is raised or lowered  by  means  of the three  vertical
screws which form its feet, and the axis is thus made                 horizontal ; on     the
other side the tribrach is pushed laterally by two horizontal screws, and
the telescope is thus brought into the meridian.  Three principal objects
are sought in these arrangements — to exclude shake, to obviate strain,
and to cause the expansions to take place from the centre outwards.
    I
  have been well satisfied with the trinls              I
                                           have made of them.    I find
these         adjustments to be exceedingly delicate in their           action, and      rery
    stable.
      The Zenith Sector. — This is quite unlike any instrument of the same de
    nomination.  My endeavour in designing it was to combine maximum
    power with minimum weight.
      A solid steel vertical axis revolves within a hollow wide-based conical
    cast-iron pillar.   Across the vertical axis is placed a frame, in which are
    formed bearings for the reception of a transverse horizontal axis. This
    axis carries outside the frame a telescope of 4 feet focal length and 4 inches
    clear aperture, and a portion of a circle comprising two opposite sectors,
    each containing about 45°.     The telescope being vertical for the observa
    tion of stars near the zenith, the sectors are horizontal — that         is,
                                                                      transverse
    to the telescope. The frame which supports the horizontal axis carries
    also four micrometer-microscopes for reading the sectors.       These micro
    scopes are arranged conically, so that all four are illuminated            by
                                                                          single    a

    scopes being fixed.   When packed for carriage, the telescope and sectors
    can be made to lie       in   the same direction, and   so take up much less room

from the arrangement of the sectors, which, being in identical circum
stances, should be liable to no inequalities of either flexure or temperature.

pendent adjustments, the action of which                          appears to be very satisfactory.

II.    "   On the Orders and                    Genera       of Ternary Quadratic Forms."
        By Henry J. Stephen Smith, M.A., F.R.S., Savilian                                    Professor
        of Geometry in the University of Oxford.                          Received February 21,
        1867.
                                                 (Abstract.)
     The object of this Paper is to supply demonstrations of the undemon-
strated results, relating to Ternary Quadratic Forms, which are contained
in an important memoir of Eisenstein's ("Neue Theoreme der hoheren
Arithmetik," Crelle's Journal, vol. xxxv. p. 117), — and, at the same time,
to extend those results to the cases not considered by him in that Memoir.
The following         are the principal                points in which the theory of Eisenstein
has been thus further developed —                  ;
   1. In Eisenstein's Memoir forms of an even discriminant only are con
sidered. Such forms, and their contravariants, are always properly primi
tive ; they have particular generic characters with respect to uneven primes
dividing the discriminant, but have no supplementary characters       e. cha                 (t.
racters with respect to  or 8). The case of forms of an even discriminant
                                    4
is more complicated.    Besides the properly primitive order, there may
exist, in this case, an improperly primitive order, in which the forms
themselves      are improperly                primitive,    and    their contravariants  properly
primitive,   — or,       again,     an improperly primitive            order, in which the forms
themselves      are properly primitive, and their contravariants improperly                        pri
mitive.      Further, forms             of   an even discriminant may have characters with
respect    to   4   or   8 ;   and      a           enumeration of these supplementary
                                             complete
characters      requires       a   careful distinction of cases.  To facilitate this enu-

388          Prof.   H.   J. S. Smith    on the Orders and Genera                 of   [Feb. 28,
meration, a Table    is given in the Paper for finding the supplementary
characters of any proposed form.
   2. A Table is also given for forming the complete generic character of
any proposed form.      This Table is intended to serve the same purposes,
in the theory of ternary quadratic forms, for which the Table of Lejeune
Dirichlet is available in the binary theory (Crelle, vol. xix. p. 338). The
Table, like that of Lejeune Dirichlet, distinguishes between the possible
and impossible generic characters ; and the Paper contains a complete
demonstration of the criterion by which they are distinguished.
  3. Besides the particular characters relating             to uneven primes            dividing
the discriminant, it is convenient,       in those     cases in which there is no sup
plementary character, to consider a certain particular generic character
which does not appear to have been regarded as such by Eisenstein. This
character is termed in the Paper the simultaneous character of the form
and its contravariant : its existence         is demonstrated    ;   and its introduction
as an element  of the complete generic character is justified by its use in
the distinction of possible and impossible genera.
  4. It has been proposed to define a genus of forms as consisting of all
those forms which can be transformed into one another by substitutions
of which the coefficients are rational and the determinant a unit. It is
desirable (in the case of quadratic forms) to add to this definition the
limitation that the denominators of the fractional coefficients are to be
uneven, and prime to the discriminant.    And it is shown, in this Paper,
that two ternary quadratic forms are or are not transformable into one
another by such substitutions, according as their complete generic cha
racters do or do not coincide.
  5.   The preceding observations apply equally to the cases of definite and
indefinite forms. These two cases are included in the same analysis by
means of a convention as to the signs of the two numbers defined by
Eisenstein, and termed in this Paper the arithmetical invariants of the
ternary form.     The first invariant of a form is the greatest common
divisor of the first minors of the matrix of the form ; the second invariant
is the quotient obtained by dividing the discriminant by the square of the
first invariant.   According to the convention adopted in the Paper, the
second   invariant has the        same    sign   as   the discriminant        ;    and the first
invariant has or has not the same sign as the second, according as the
form is definite or indefinite.
   6. The latter part of the Paper is occupied exclusively with the theory
of definite and positive forms. In the case of these forms, the weight (or,
as Eisenstein has termed       the density) of
                                 it,           class   the reciprocal of the

stration) the formulae which assign the weight of a given genus or order
of forms of an uneven discriminant. These formulas are demonstrated in
the present Paper, and, with them, the corresponding formula; relating to
the cases in which the discriminant is even. The demonstration is obtained
by a method similar to that employed by Gauss and Dirichlet for the de
termination of the number of binary classes of a given determinant.          The
sum of the weights of the representations, by a system of forms represent
ing the classes of any proposed genus, of all the numbers contained in
certain arithmetical progressions, and not surpassing a given number, is in
a finite ratio to the sesquiplicate power of the given number when that
number is supposed to increase without limit. Of this limiting ratio, two
distinct determinations are obtained ; of which the first contains, as a
factor, the weight of the proposed genus ; and an expression for that
weight is obtained by a comparison of the two determinations.            Of these
determinations, the first is obtained immediately by an elementary applica
 tion of the integral calculus ; the second depends on an arithmetical
theorem, which is deduced in the Paper from the analysis employed by
 Gauss in arts. 279-284 of the     *
                                     Disquisitiones Arithmctica:,' and which may
be expressed    as follows : —
    " The   sum of the weights of the representations of a given number
 (contained in one of certain Arithmetical Progressions) by a system of
 forms representing the classes of a ternary genus, is equal to the weight of
 a genus   of binary forms, of which the determinant is the product, taken
 negatively, of the given number by the second invariant of the ternary
 forms."
    By this proposition the determination of the limiting ratio is made to
 depend on an approximate determination of the weight (or, which is here
 the same thing, the number) of the binary classes of certain series of nega
 tive determinants.      Two methods are given in the Paper for effecting this
 approximate determination.        The first method presupposes Lagrange's
 definition of a reduced form, and depends ultimately on the evaluation of
 the definite integral

                         x>0,    y>0, c>0, ,r<r,       2y<x.
    The second method employs the expression obtained by Lejeune Dirichlet
 in the form of an infinite series for the number of binary classes of a given
 determinant, and is thus independent of the definition of a reduced form.
 The same result is obtained by both methods ; but the second is more
 easily extended to the case of quadratic forms containing more than three
 indeterminates.

        the Circulation of the Blood."              Being the Croonian Lecture
        for 1867, delivered by          Dr.   J.  Burdon Sanderson.
                                           (Abstract).
    The purpose of the lecture was to show that the explanation usually given
by physiologists of the mode in which the respiratory movements of the
thorax influence the force and frequency                of the contractions of the heart
can no     longer be entertained.
    The doctrine usually taught in this and other countries is stated as fol

the frequency of the pulse is considerably augmented,                  whilst the line of
mean      pressure rapidly       rises,   indicating increased tension in the arterial
walls                  During the act of inspiration, on the contrary, the pulsation
becomes       slower, the curves much bolder, and the line of mean pressure
gradually      falls ;  for then the blood readily enters the thorax, and, as a con
sequence,       the great veins, capillaries, and arterial walls become compara

the    same effect      are to be found in Budge's         'Lehrbuch der Physiologic,'
 1862,    p.   350; in Kirke's 'Handbook of Physiology,'               1863,   p. 129; in
Ludwig's       'Lehrbuch,'      1857, vol. ii. pp. 161, 162.
     From numerous           experiments, in which the respiratory movements and
 the variation of pressure in the arteries in the dog were recorded simulta
 neously by mechanical means, the author had arrived at an opposite con
 clusion, viz. that in natural breathing each expansion of the chest is fol
 lowed by increase        of arterial tension and shortening of the diastolic inter
 val ; in other words, that the immediate effect of inspiration is to increase
 both the force and frequency of the contractions of the heart.
     The experimental method was as follows                  For the purpose of recording
 the   movement of air in and out of the chest, the animal is caused to breathe
                                                                         with the trachea,
 through a T-shaped tube, one arm of which is connected
  while the other remains open.              By the stem it communicates with a disk-
  shaped bag of thin caoutchouc.              The resistance afforded to the ingress and
                                                       inconsiderable, is yet sufficient to

  variations of arterial pressure are measured by a                mercurial   manometer,
  differing   from that of Poiseuille, in that the attached arm, which is the

which rests on the surface of the mercury in the wide arm of the dynamo
meter, the lower with the upper surface of the caoutchouc bag.            At their
extremities they carry fine sable     brushes,  by  which   their movements     are
inscribed on a roll of paper, to which a horizontal movement is communi
cated by clockwork.       By a mechanical arrangement, which need not be here
described, synchronical points can from time to time be marked in the two
tracings inscribed simultaneously on the paper by the momentary with
 drawal of both brushes.       The experiments     were  of the following   nature,
 dogs being employed throughout.
    1.  Experiments as to normal respiration.    — In   these experiments (eleven
in number) the dynamometer was connected          with the femoral artery, while
the breathing-tube was connected with the respiratory cavity, either by
the trachea, or by means of a mask fixed over the snout.            The principal
results were as follows :—
    Experiment 1. — Respirations per minute, 9; pulsations, 108.              Mean
 arterial pressure 6-2 inches.    The tracings show that each respiratory act is
 divisible into two parts ; two-fifths being occupied by thoracic movements,
the remainder by the pause.        Of the former, two-thirds correspond to in
 spiration, one-third to expiration.     During the pause the arterial pressure
gradually sinks, the commencement of inspiration being immediately fol
lowed by an increase of pressure, which becomes still more marked during
expiration, but again subsides at its completion.           The interval between
each two succeeding      contractions of the heart is seen to be three times      as
great in those pulsations which       immediately follow expiration as in     those
which precede it.
    The other experiments of the series were of a similar nature.          In some
the relative length of the respiratory intervals and the regularity of the pul
sations rendered it more easy to judge of the precise relation between the two
tracings than in others, but in all the results were in complete accordance with
those above stated.     Even when the frequency of breathing was such that
three pulsations corresponded to one respiration (experiment 4), it was ob
served that the diastolic interval which immediately followed expiration was
twice   as long as either of the other two.     In one case the respiratory tra
cing showed that the mode of breathing was peculiar : inspiration was sepa
rated from expiration by a pause of considerable duration, during which
the arterial pressure declined and the pulse was retarded.
    2. Experiments for the purpose of determining ivhether the resistance
afforded by the T-lube to the passage of air in and out of the chest exer
cise any modifying influence on the results. — It was obvious that this end
could be best attained by observing the effect of increasing the resistance ;
for by   so doing, any modifying influence exercised     by it would become more
obvious.     With this view a series of observations were made on the same
animal (under the influence of morphia), in which the resistance was gra
dually increased by inserting plugs of various sizes into the aperture of the
T-tube. The tracings showed that even when the nperture was so diminished

as to produce marked dyspnoea, and great exaggeration            of the movements of
respiration, it was observed as distinctly as before that the increase of force
and frequency of the pulse were increased by the prolonged inspiratory
efforts of the animal.
   3. Experiments showing that when the respiratory cavity is completely
closed (as by plugging the trachea), the relation between the respiratory
movements of the chest and the arterial pressure is reversed. — The pro
cess of death by apncea may         be divided into two stages     ;  the first extend
ing from the moment of occlusion to the cessation of the struggles of
the animal and the supervention of apparent insensibility, the second ter
minating with the extinction of the circulation.             In order to observe the
characters of the respiratory movements and those of the heart during these
two stages, it was necessary to substitute a mercurial manometer for the
caoutchouc bag.        It  was then seen that at first the respiratory movements
increase   in amplitude without altering in character        ;  but towards the end
of the first minute, when the animal begins to struggle, they become irre
gular, and each struggle is accompanied by strong expulsive efforts, during
which the mercury in the dynamometer oscillates violently and rises to an
enormous height. At the commencement of the second stage, when the
animal becomes       tranquil, the respiratory movements assume a different
character, become almost exclusively inspiratory (gasping), and much more
regular.     They occur, however, at longer and longer intervals, until they
finally  cease.   As regards the relation between the oscillations of the two
manometers,     the tracings show distinctly that throughout the whole pro
cess they are strictly coincident, both as to the time of their occurrence and
their extent.     Hence it may be concluded that the extraordinary elevation
of arterial pressure which has been long known to occur during the second
minute in death by apnoea, is not due, as was supposed by Dr. Alison and
Dr. John Keid, to obstruction of the capillary vessels, either pulmonary or
systemic, but to the violence of the respiratory efforts. The cavity of the
chest being closed, the force exercised by the respiratory muscles expresses
itself in variations of tension of the      enclosed air, which are communicated
through     the intra-thoracic arteries to those outside of the chest, pro
ducing    those  violent oscillations of the dynamometer which have been re
ferred to.
   In support of this inference, it      was shown that   in an animal under the in-
fluence of woorara (when all respiratory movement ceases, while those of
the heart are unaffected), the process of apnoea is not only of greater dura
tion, but is not attended with any of those peculiar disturbances of the cir
culation which have been hitherto attributed to capillary obstruction.              The
gradual   extinction    of the force  of  the contraction   of the heart  is  indicated
by a slow and uninterrupted subsidence of the arterial pressure.
   4. Experiments for the purpose of ascertaining in how far the influence
exercised by the respiratory movements on the heart in ordinary breathing
are chemical. — For this purpose observations were made on animals which

394          Dr.  J. Burdon Sanderson         — Croonian     Lecture.     [March   7,
had been allowed to respire a limited quantity of air (50-1 00 cubic inches) for
a sufficiently long time to ensure the complete cessation of all appreciable
reaction of its oxygen on the circulating blood.           In this form of apnoca in
sensibility is not produced until from ten to fifteen minutes after the expe
riment.     As in ordinary suffocation, it is associated with a marked change
in the mode of breathing. All expiratory efforts cease, and the animal re
spires by gasps, each of which is separated from its successor by a pause of
variable duration.      Under     these   circumstances, when unquestionably all
chemical reaction is out of the question, the effect observed is of the same
nature as in ordinary breathing, the only difference being that, in conse
quence of the length of the intervals and the absence of expiratory effort, it
is much more obvious.         The moment after inspiration commences, the mer
curial column is jerked up by a succession           of forcible contractions  of  the
heart.
    5. Experiments showing that in       artificial respiralion,when   the mechanism
is reversed,   the chemical conditions remaining the same, the mechanical
effect   is correspondingly     modified ; and that       if  the blood is venous, a
chemical effect is produced by each injection of air into the lunffs, which,
although of the same nature, requires a much longer time for its produc
tion. — If, in an animal under the influence of woorara, artificial respiration
be discontinued until the arterial pressure sinks several inches, and then
air is injected, even in small quantity, no immediate effect is observed
excepting a momentary increase of arterial pressure coincident in time with
the expansion of the lungs ; but after the lapse of six or seven seconds, the
heart begins to beat with extreme frequency, rapidly raising the mercurial
column until a pressure is attained equal or superior to that originally
existing. The length of the time which intervenes between this event and
its antecedent is in itself sufficient to show that the relation between the
 two cannot be mechanical.           This is proved by the observation that, if
 hydrogen be substituted for air      in the experiments, no effect is produced.
    6. Experiments    showing the relation between the thoracic movements and
 the  arterial pressure after section of the pneumogastric nerves. — Section
of the pneumogastric nerves in the neck, besides its well-known effect in
retarding the breathing and accelerating the contractions of the heart, alters
 the mode of the respiratory movements.             The chest is unnaturally dilated
even during the pause.          Inspiration is performed slowly and with effort,
 and terminates in a sudden expiratory collapse. The heart not only con
tracts more frequently, but more forcibly, the arterial pressure rising
 several inches of mercury.        Under these conditions it is observed (1) that
 the arterial pressure tends to increase during the slow inspiration, and to
decline during the pause, and (2) that a more rapid increase of tension
 occurs simultaneously with expiration.            But (3) no variation is observed
of the frequency     of  the   pulsations ; and (4) all the effects are much less
 marked than: in the normal animal.             These peculiarities are to be attri
 buted to the extreme        rapidity   of the heart's action,     to the permanent

  distension of the thoracic        veins,  and to the violence of the expiratory
  movements.
      Theoretical    exposition  of  the mechanical   influence   of  the respiratory
  movements on the circulation.      — (1) It  has been demonstrated by Donders
  that the elastic contents of the chest have at all times      a tendency to shrink
  to a smaller    bulk than that of the cavity in which they are contained, so
  that the viscera within the thorax are constantly distended in a degree
  which varies according to its ever-varying capacity. As, however, they
  are not equally elastic, they yield to this distension unequally.         When the
  chest enlarges, the lungs yield most, the veins and heart, in a state of
  relaxation, next    ; the contracting heart and the arteries scarcely expand at
  all.   (2)  If  the veins contained air and communicated with the atmo
  sphere, they would fill as rapidly as the lungs ; actually their expansion is
  much slower.       Hence the first effect of inspiration is to increase the pro
 portion   of  thoracic  space occupied by the lungs, by which they become
 relatively more distended than the other organs.           So soon, however,   as the
 veins and auricles have time to fill, equilibrium        is more or less restored.
  (3) Hence it follows (a) that the dilatation of the chest in inspiration
 aids the expansion of the heart during diastole and of the thoracic veins ;
 and (5) that these events cannot occur simultaneously with their cause,
 but must follow at an interval varying according to the condition of the
 circulation.      (4) Other things being equal, the force and frequency of the
 contractions of the heart are increased by whatever causes accelerate its
 diastolic impletion.      The more rapidly the cavities fill the shorter must
 be its period of relaxation, the more vigorous its systole, and consequently
 the greater the arterial pressure.        (5) The effect of thoracic expansion on
 the intra-thoracic veins varies both as regards its degree and the time of
 its occurrence. Both kinds of variation depend on the velocity of the
 circulation and the pressure existing in the veins outside of the chest.
 When the systemic veins are distended, the circulation rapid, and the
 arterial   resistance in consequence diminished, the heart almost empties
 itself at each contraction, and the expansion of the chest fills the thoracic
 veins and the relaxed heart with great rapidity.             In the opposite case,
 when the systemic veins are comparatively empty, the cavities of the heart
 fill slowly, and discharge    themselves imperfectly on account of the excessive
 arterial resistance.     (6) Hence the effect of inspiration in facilitating the
 diastolic   impletion of the auricles, and consequently in increasing the
frequency and force of the heart's action, varies directly as the velocity
 of the circulation, inversely as the arterial pressure.
     Conclusions. — 1.    In natural breathing the influence       exercised by the
 thoracic movements       on the heart is entirely mechanical.       So long as the
 respiration is tranquil, variations of air-pressure in the bronchial tubes and
 vesicles of the lungs do not materially affect the arterial pressure ; but
 violent expiratory movements are accompanied by simultaneous increase of
 vascular tension.

    2. "When     the respiratory orifices are closed, the variations of blood-
pressure in    the  arteries are synchronical with those of air-pressure in the
respiratory cavity, and take place in the same direction.
    3. The increased       action of the heart which results from chemical
changes     produced in the circulating fluid by exposure to air, is of the
same nature as the mechanical effect of inspiration, both being indicated
by increased arterial tension and acceleration of the pulse. The former
may be distinguished from the latter (a) by the length of time required
for the production of the effect, and (b) by its dependence on a previous
venous condition of the blood.
    4. Hence the influence of the thoracic movements on those of the heart
 may be either directly mechanical, as in suffocation, indirectly mechanical,
as in ordinary breathing, or chemical.

 tained for calculating to a close approximation her moment of stability at
 any given angle of inclination, on the assumption that the metacentric invo

     It has occurred to me that the latter part of the calculation in    Mr. Mer

 a circle; the locus of its centres of curvature, or "metacentric evolute,"
 being assumed to be the involute of a circle.
     The involute of the involute of a circle is distinguished by the following
  property.     Let r be the radius of the circle, p0 that radius of curvature of
  the involute of the involute which touches the involute at its cusp, and p

 and Professor Wheatstone consist essentially of a fixed and a moveable
 electromagnet, the coils of which are put in connexion by means of a com
 mutator.
    The electromagnets in the actual machines have cores of soft iron, which
  greatly increase the magnetic effects due to the coils ; but, in order to
 simplify the expression of the theory as much as possible, I shall begin by

them in the form of rings, the smaller revolving within the larger on a com

    Let   us next ascertain the effect   of a sudden change of position in the se
condary coil, which alters the value of M from M, to M2 in a time t3— t ,

If we    suppose    the time so Bhort that we may neglect the first term in com
parison with the others, we find, as the effect of a sudden change of position,

     This equation may be interpreted in the language of the dynamical theory,
by saying that the electromagnetic momentum of the circuit remains the
same after a sudden change of position.           To ascertain the effect of the com
mutator, let us suppose that, at a given instant, currents x and y exist in
the two coils, that the two coils are then made into one circuit, and that x
 is the current in the circuit the instant after completion ; then the same
 equation    (1)  gives
                      (L + 2M + N)*'=(L + M>+(N + M)y                              (7)
     This equation shows that the electromagnetic momentum of the com
 pleted circuit is equal to the sum of the electromagnetic momenta of the
 separate coils   just  before completion.
     The commutator may belong to one of four different varieties, according
 to the order in which the contacts are made and broken.               If A, B be the
 ends of the first coil, and C, D those of the second, and if we enclose in
 brackets the parts in electric connexion, we may express the four varieties
 as in the following Table : —

     In the first kind the circuit of both coils remains uninterrupted           ; and
  when the operation is complete, two equal currents in opposite directions
  are combined into one.        In this case, therefore, y=—x, and
                               (L-r-2M+N)a;'=(L-N)x                                 (8)
     When there are iron cores in the coils, or metallic circuits in which inde
  pendent currents can be excited, the electrical equations are much more
  complicated, and contain as many independent variables as there can be in
  dependent     electromagnetic quantities.      I  shall therefore, for the sake of
  preserving simplicity, avoid the consideration of the iron cores, except in
  so far as they simply increase the values of L, M, and N.
     I shall also suppose that the secondary coil is at first in a position in

 which    M=0, and that it turns into       a position  in which 11= — 31, which
 will increase the current in the ratio of L + N      to L— 23I + N.
    The commutator is then reversed.          This will diminish the current in a
 ratio depending on the kind of commutator.
    The secondary coil is then moved so that 31 changes from M to 0, which
 will increase the current in the ratio of L + 2M+N to L + N.
    During the whole motion the current has also been decaying at a rate
 which varies according to the value of L + 2M + N; but since M varies
 from + M to — M, we may, in a rough theory, suppose that in the expres
sion for the decay of the current M=0.

the current        after a semirevolution to the current x0 before the semirevo-

    For the first kind,

    By increasing the speed, T may be indefinitely diminished, so that the
question of the maintenance of the current depends ultimately on whether
r is greater or less than unity. When ris greater than 1 or less than — I,
the current may be maintained by giving a sufficient speed to the machine ;
it will be always in one direction in the first case, and it will be a reciproca
ting current in the second.
    When r lies between + 1 and —1, no current can be maintained.
    Let there be p windings of wire in the first coil and q windings in       the
second, then we may write
                        L=lp\     M=mpq,        N=w?3,                       (11)

the coils.     Since L— 2M+N must always be a positive quantity, being the
coefficient of self-induction of the whole circuit, In — m*, and therefore
LN— M must be positive. When the commutator is of the first kind, the

   When the commutator is of the second kind, the first step is to close both
circuits, so as to render the currents in them independent.                   The second
circuit is then broken, and the current            in it is thus stopped. This produces
an effect  on the first circuit by induction determined by the equation

where x is the original, and x the new value                of the current.
   The next step is to throw the circuits into one,                 M  being now positive.

nected with the currents     in  the coils, an elaborate discussion  of them would
be out  of place   in what   professes   to be only a   rough explanation of the
theory  of  the  experiments.
   Such  a  rough explanation appears to me to be as follows : —
   Without the shunt, the current in the secondary coil is always in rigid
connexion with that in the primary coil, except when the commutator is
changing.      "With the shunt, the two currents are in some degree indepen
dent  ; and the secondary coil, whose electric inertia is small compared with
that of the primary, can     have its current reversed and varied without being
clogged by the sluggish primary coil.
   On the other hand, the primary coil loses that part of the total current
which passes through the shunt ; but we know that an iron core, when
highly  magnetized,    requires  a great increase of current to increase its mag
netism, whereas its magnetism can be maintained at a considerable value by
a current much less powerful.         In this way the diminution in resistance
and self-induction due to the shunt may more than counterbalance the di
minution of strength in the primary magnet.
   Also, since the self-induction of the shunt is very small, all instantaneous
currents will run through it rather than through the electromagnetic coils,
and therefore it will receive    more of the heating effect of variable currents
than a comparison of the resistances alone would lead us to expect.

     My dear Sir, — Professor Wheatstone showed that               a shunt put into
the circuit of the electromagnet increased the power greatly, but the expla
 nation that it. increased the power by equalizing the resistance of the arma
 ture and that of the electromagnet is either wholly incorrect, or very
 nearly so.
     Yesterday I had an opportunity afforded me by Mr. C. Siemens of expe
 rimenting with his machine, in which the electromagnets have each a resist
 ance of about 250 Ohms = 500 Ohms, the armature 400 Ohms.
     On adding a shunt to the electromagnet the flame was greatly increased.
     The two electromagnets when       connected    in   series  had a resistance    of
 about 500 Ohms.          I then connected them in     a  double circuit, the resist
 ance    in this  case being about 125 Ohms.      By this     means   the same result
  as regards resistance could be obtained as by a shunt, with the difference
 thnt the power expended in the shunt is lost in heat ; while reducing the
  resistance by the double circuit caused the whole force to be expended on
  the electromagnet.                                           •
     The results of the experiment were    —
     1st. The shunt invariably increased the power.
     2ndly. When the magnets were joined in double circuit the power was
  greatly reduced.
     The explanation is      to me obvious.    In a  Ruhmkorff's coil, where the
  iron core is divided into fine wire, so that the dying magnetism cannot set
  up currents in the iron core to prolong its existence, the magnetism is very
  rapidly lost, and the make-and-break hammer works very rapidly, some-
  rimes as fast as sixty beats per second.
     If the secondary circuit be closed so that the currents can flow, the make-
  and-break hammer works very slowly, indeed one or two beats per second ;
  and in 1856 I published a description of electromagnets whose action was
  very slow, and which were rendered sluggish by a copper cylinder around
  them.
     Wilde's armature, when revolving,       sends    intermittent    currents around
  the electromagnet, whose circuit     is broken at every half revolution of the
  armature.
     Were the magnets composed of fine iron wire, the magnetism would die
  away rapidly, producing a violent current by its efforts to maintain itself,
  as in the Ruhmkorff's coils.        (This current is called by foreigners the
  extra-current.)
     The shunt which Wheatstone inserted carries this current across, and so
  maintains the magnetism of the electromagnets until the armature gives a

nate directions
  When the armature is discharging its current into the electromagnets,
the current in the shunt is in the direction it would have if the shuut
were in circuit solely with the armature.
   When the armature is changing poles and is disconnected, the secondary
current is in full play, aud the current in the shunt is in the direction of
the current prolonged in the electromagnet, that                        is,
                                                       of the extra current.

power       by
          maintaining the magnetism, and not consume uselessly the force
now wasted in the shunt.
     The overlapping of the armature                and the solid mass of the electromag
nets tends to maintain imperfectly                 the magnetism during the intervals of
no current from the armature               ;   and but for this the machines, whether they
be Wilde's,      Wheatstone's, or Siemens'              s,   would none of them work.

that   if   the armature had two wires instead                   of   one, the current         from   one
being sent through     wire surrounding the magnets, their power would be
                             a
augmented,   and    considerable current might be obtained from the other
                         a
wire available for external work   or there might be two armatures, one to

 or other purposes.      Want of time prevented me carrying this out until
 now ; but since the interesting papers of C. W. Siemens, F.R.S., and Pro
 fessor Wheatstone,    F.R.S.,  were    read last month,   I have carried out the
 idea as follows : — Two  bars of soft iron, measuring 7? in. X  2\ in. x \ in.,  are
 each wound, round the centre portions, with about thirty yards of No. 10
copper wire j and shoes of soft iron are so attached at each end, that when
 the bars are placed one above the other there will be a space left between
the opposite shoes in which a Siemens's armature can rotate : on each of
 the armatures is wound about ten yards of No. 14 copper wire cotton-
covered. The current generated in one of the armatures is always in con
 nexion with the electro-magnets ; and the current from the second arma
 ture, being perfectly free, can be used for any purpose for which it may be
required.     The machine is altogether rudely constructed, and is only in
tended to illustrate the principle ; but with this small machine three inches
of platinum wire '01 can be made incandescent.

       by  Kirchhoff." By Geoege Biddell Airy, F.R.S., Astronomer
       Royal.     Received March 2, 1867.
                                    (Abstract.)
    The author, after adverting      to   the excellence   and importance of the
spectral measures made        by Professor Kirchhoff, points out that         these
measures are not available for physical inquiry until we have deduced from
them the length of the light-wave corresponding to each line. The author
therefore undertook the work of computing the lengths of the light-waves.
For this purpose, he referred to Fraunhofer's direct measures of the lengths
of the waves corresponding to certain lines, and, ascertaining the numerical
measures in    KirchhofFs  scale corresponding to the same lines, he expressed
Fraunhofer's    wave-lengths by an algebraical formula, in which the variable
quantity was KirchhofFs measure.            This formula was applied to each of
the lines (about 1600 in number).           The wave-lengths were at first ob
tained in parts of the Paris inch       ;  but all were ultimately converted    into
parts of the millimetre.

  The author then adverts                     of inaccuracy in some parts of
                                        to the suspicion
these results, arising from the circumstance that KirchhofT s apparatus
was not always in precisely the same state of adjustment.   After expressing
his own       <i   priori belief that   the error,   if any,
                                         must be extremely                                    small, he
adverts to the comparison which he was now enabled to make                                        between
direct measures of wave-length by Angstrom and Ditscheiner, and his own
computations.    Admitting the systematic errors of Frauuhofer which the
later philosophers have indicated, and the errors incidental to interpolation
and extrapolation, the remaining discrepance is very small. Its progress is
so easy that there is no difficulty in interpolating its value for any one
line ; and thus, using the computed wave-lengths of this memoir, the
wave-length for any line may be found                    as    it would     have been measured            bv
Angstrom or Ditscheiner.
   In the tabular part of the communication, the principal Table contains
KirchhofFs measures and symbols, extracted from the Berlin Memoirs
1861 and 1862, with the addition throughout of one column containing the
author's computed wave-lengths expressed in parts of the millimetre. This
is followed by a special Table, in the same form, for the lines produced by
certain metals not included in the general Table.   There is then given a
Table of the wave-lengths corresponding to the lines produced by different
rnetals, extracted by the author from the general                        Table.     And finally       there
are given two Tables containing respectively the comparisons                          of Angstrom's

II. " On            a   remarkable      Alteration of Appearance                  and Structure of
        the Human Hair."                    By Erasmus            Wilson, F.R.S.              Received
        March 12, 1867.
  I    have the honour          of submitting     to the Royal            Society a specimen                of
human hair of very remarkable appearance.                          and
                                                                        Ever)' hair is brown
white in alternate bands, looking as if encircled with rings ; and this
change of aspect extends throughout the whole length of the hair, and
gives to the general mass a curiously speckled character.     The brown
segment  of the hair, which represents its normal colour, measures about
jjLof an inch             in
                 length, or something less than    quarter of   line thea                a          ;
white, or abnormal segment about half that length, namely -j-^j of an
inch   ;   and the two together about           J¥ of         an inch, or one-third      of   a   line.
  The hair           was taken from     a   lad aged seven years and              a   half,   a   gentle
man's son      ;     he
                  reported as being
                          is                         "
                                        an active, healthy boy, quick and
intelligent."  He was delicate up to the age of four, having suffered                                     in
quick succession the diseases of childhood,    severe attack of croup, and
                                                                a
several attacks           of convulsions.     The change
                                             the appearance of the hair
                                                                  in

   increased      perceptibly    during    the  last two years.        There   is no similar
   alteration    of structure of the eyebrows         and eyelashes.     His complexion is
   dark, while that of a younger brother            is fair ; and the latter is free from
   any alteration of the hair.
      Examination of the hair with a lens           shows that the cylinder       of the hair
  is perfectly uniform, that the white portion is contained within the cuticle
  and occupies the whole breadth of the cylinder ; whilst it frequently
  presents a rounded cone at the central extremity, and breaks up into fibres
  at the opposite or distal end ; and in some instances this fibrous structure
  is apparent at both ends of the white segment.                Moreover, by transmitted
  light, the white segment is found to be opake, and consequently presents
 a dark shade, while the intermediate or brown portion has the transparency
 of normal hair.
      When the transparency of the hair is increased by immersion in Canada
 balsam slightly diluted with spirits of turpentine, the white and opake
 segment is reduced in dimensions, and is rendered more or less transparent
 by   imbibition of the volatile fluid        ; moreover it is clearly demonstrated by
 this process that the opacity of the segment its whiteness when seen by re
 flected light, and its darkness by transmitted light, are all due to the presence,
 in the fibrous portion       of  the   hair, of spaces filled with air-globules.        The
 air-spaces are necessarily very numerous and assembled closely together ;
 while at the ends of the white segment they have more or less of a linear
 arrangement,        and give   a  fibrous appearance to the opake mass.              More
 over the     partial transparency       of  the  hair   caused   by  the  balsam    demon
 strates that, besides the air-spaces, large and small, contained in the opake
portion, minute air-spaces,          sometimes    arranged in linear order, and some
 times communicating           and    forming    short irregular canals, are also met
with in the transparent part           of the hair.     And, in addition to the minute
air-spaces of the plates of the fibrous portion of the hair, an accumulation
of air-globules is also very apparent in the cells of the medulla.
     It is evident from this examination of the hairs, that they are imperfect
in structure and development, and that their imperfection indicates a weak
producing organ, and probably a weakly constitution                of the individual  ; that
the cells     of which the fibrous portion of         the hair is composed,      instead of
being    filled with    a horny plasma,      are tinged     with aqueous fluid, and the
desiccation of this fluid leaves behind it vacuities which in the subsequent
growth      of the shaft   become filled with      air.    The  most remarkable      pheno
menon in connexiou with the case, however, is the alternation                 of imperfect
and perfect cells,       the period of continuance of the two processes (sup
posing them to be equally active in point of time) being twice as long for
the perfect as for the imperfect structure.
     Since the publication     of the observations of Berthold in Midler's 'Arcbiv"
for 1850,      it is generally  believed    that the hair grows faster during the day
than during the night ; hence the first suggestion that occurred to me in
connexion with the present case, seeing that the white or opake segment

  408                         Mr. C. Brooke      on the Natttre              [March 21,
  was shorter by one-half than the brown, was that the former represented
  the slower growth by night, and the latter the quicker growth by day — the
  white and the brown together representing an entire day of twenty-four
  hours.     But other observations by myself have given, as the average
  growth of the hair of the head in persons who had been shaved, Jj of an
  inch for the week, and consequently                 of an inch for the twenty-four
  hours.      Now the length of hair comprehended by the white and the
  brown in the present case is ^ of an inch, and consequently a much
  more active growth than is normally met with —corresponding, in fact, iu
  a similar ratio, with thirty-seven hours instead of twenty-four.
      I therefore refrain from speculating upon the cause of alternation of the
  healthy and morbid structure presented by this case, and restrict myself to
  the narration of the fact that during a certain space of time, amounting
  to a day or more, the hair is produced           of normal structure, while during
  another space of time of undetermined extent the hair is produced un
  healthily, — that the periods of healthy formation correspond pretty accu
  rately in extent, as do those of unhealthy formation, while the latter, in
  measurement,      are only    half as extensive as the former, — moreover,     that the
  differences   of the pathological operation are, the production of a horny
 plasma    in  the normal process, and of serous and watery cell-contents in
 the abnormal process.
     I   may   further   observe     that it is by no means improbable that the
 "dead"      and faded hair which is met with after some illnesses and iu
 instances    of debilitated health may       be due to a similar pathological process,
although       wanting in the periodicity         and alternation which       render  the
present case so remarkable.
III. " Remarks           on    the    Nature of Electric Energy, and on the
         Means by which it is transmitted."                  By Charles Brooke,
         M.A., F.R.S., P.M.S., &c. Received March 19, 1867.
     The writer    has clearly shown the interchange          of thermic and dynamic
energy at the point        of junction of    the bars of  a thermo-electric element of
antimony and bismuth*, and he has also pointed outf that the dynamic
nature of electric energy is not less clearly indicated by the long-known
fact that an ordinary voltaic current always commences with a rush, as it
were, the instant that the circuit is closed.             The dynamic cause of this
is clearly     pointed out by an experiment due to the genius of Prof.
Wheatstone.         If a tuning-fork, the tail of which is inserted longitudinally
into a wooden handle, like a file or chisel, be made to vibrate, and the end
of the handle       rested   obliquely on a table, the resonance of the table will
instantly be heard       ;  but on moving the diapason parallel to itself in any
                 *  Phil. Mag. Nov.    1866.              t Ibid. Dec. 1866.

  1867.]                            of Electric Energy.                               409
 direction on the table, the resonance ceases, from the perpetual interference
 of the snccessive planes of vibration with each other.              But now comes the
 illustration   : — On arresting the motion of translation, the         resonance imme
 diately recommences,         but with a rush or momentary increase of sound :
 this must unquestionably arise from the resistance offered by the inertia
 of the molecules of wood to the recommencement of wave-motion ; and the
 parallel phenomenon in electricity may undoubtedly be similarly accounted
 for.    And the      reflex  momentary current (the terminal extra-current of
 Faraday), which is well kuown to take place at the instant of opening the
circuit, is equally susceptible of a dynamic interpretation : it is the ana
logue    of the    wave reflected      from the fixed end of     a  stretched cord, after
having been imparted by the hand to the free end.
     The dynamic nature of electric energy is clearly indicated by the dy
namo-electric* machine of Holtz, in which dynamic is directly converted
into electric energy, — and by the cognate machines of Wilde, Wheatstone,
Siemens,      and   Ladd,    in all of which alike there is an intervening conver
sion of dynamic into magnetic energy.                The enormous amount of current-
energy     evolved   in  Mr.  Wilde's     machine    when the power of a steam-engine
is  employed to rotate the armatures may be judged of by the fact that a                   .
long piece of platinum wire 0 2 inch in thickness was seen to be disinte
grated and partially fused.               It is difficult to conceive that in these
                                                                            " fluid," and
instances      dynamic energy can be converted into magnetic
that again into thermic energy : the conversion of motion into matter,
and    the   subsequent reconversion of matter into motion, are obviously im
possible.
     Some    further    consideration of the effects of electric energy may serve
to   indicate the probable nature of the wave-motion.               The facts of electric
and    magnetic polarity imply and necessitate a polarity or directionality in
the motion itself, which         has no analogue in the waves of sound, light, or
heat.      This requirement is fully met by the hypothesis of a circular spiral
wave,    the motion of which is direct or positive if viewed from one end,
and retrograde or negative if from the other ; and this suffices to explain
the    well-known polarity of electric and magnetic induction.
     Thus far the spiral hypothesis is merely inferential ; but in regard               to
magnetic wave-motion some strong presumptive evidence may be adduced.
It appears from the experiments of Mr. Joule, made more than twenty
years ago, that      if  a suspended      mass  of copper be, by twisting the suspen
sion, made to rotate between           the poles of an unexcited electro-magnet, the
    * The writer has elsewhere
                                  applied (Elements of Natural Philosophy, p. 550, note)
a definite  and intelligible meaning to tho construction of those compound terms which
must be constantly employed in relation to the conversions         of energy. This may be
accomplished by taking       the first  section of the term to mean   the acting came, the
second, the resulting effect : thus a dynamo-electric machine will be one in which
dynamic energy is employed to produce an electric current ; and an electro-dynamic
engine, one in which a current is employed to evolve dynamic energy.

 410                       Mr. C. Brooke                on the    Nature            [March 21,
 rotation of the mass is arrested the instant the magnet is excited                            ;   and
 furthermore, if the mass be forcibly rotated, heat is developed in it.                            And
 it   has since been   ascertained that          if
                                      two cylindrical magnets be so placed
 that their axes lie in the same straight line, their contrary poles being
 opposed to each other, then, if a cylinder of copper be made to rotate on
 its own axis, coinciding with the common axis of the magnets, no heat will
 be evolved by its rotation.
      Now    these phenomena must alike be the necessary                   consequences of the
 assumed dynamical theory   ;         for   if
                                      the copper molecules be                      throwu into
 spiral-wave motion, analogous to that of a pencil of circularly polarized
 light, then the motion of all the disturbed particles will be one of revolu
 tion in planes to which the lines of magnetic force are normals : and the
 inertia or energy of rotation (as it has been variously termed), the
 resistance    offered by each revolving particle to any change in the direction
 of its axis of revolution (as exemplified by the gyroscope), will resist the
 rotation of the mass in any direction perpendicular to that of the axes of
 molecular revolution, and arrest its motion.  And conversely, if the mass
 be forcibly rotated in the above    direction, or in any other direction at
 right angles to the lines of magnetic force, heat will be freely developed,
 doubtless by internal friction arising from the perpetual displacement of
the planes of molecular revolution.                But in the second case, the axis of
rotation of the mass coincides in                             with those of the axes of
                                                      direction
molecular revolution ; hence there                is no displacement of the molecular
orbits, and consequently no internal               friction, and very little if any heat is
generated.
      The rotatory character of the magnetic wave                    is further   confirmed by
the known fact that, if a plane-polarized beam pass through a transparent
solid in the direction of the lines of force of a powerful electro-magnet, the
plane of polarization will be rotated the instant that the magnet is excited.
The truth of    theory can be established only by the verification of its
                  a
necessary consequences ; and it may not be too much to assume that in
the present case the evidence already adduced by the writer         in the           is,
entire absence of  all contradictory evidence, strongly presumptive of the
reality of the hypothesis.
  It has been authoritatively stated that ordinary electric and magnetic
waves cannot both be assumed to be spirals, because each of these forms
of energy notoriously     evolves the other in       direction perpendicular to its
                                                             a
course   ;   and the question   is   not without grave dynamical difficulties  but         ;
they may perhaps not be insuperable.                    It   may possibly be that, from some
unknown constraining condition or property inherent in magnetic bodies,
a  spiral wave, on being constrained into    spiral course, may lose its
                                                              a
original spirality, and become secondary spiral, having molecular motion
                                      a
in   a direction perpendicular to that of the primary spiral.

results having thus been inferred, the question next arises as to the nature

of the media by which the several modes of motion are transmitted.    It is
unquestionable that sound-wave's are transmissible by all kinds of matter ;
but can any valid reason be assigned in favour of the still prevalent opinion
that other modes of wave-motion are incapable of transmission by ordinary
matter? — this incapacity being implied in the adoption of the self-contra
dictory hypothesis       of             an imaginary medium, not cognizable by any known
means       of perception.
      It   is a remarkable fact that in all the superseded                   crude notions of physical
causation, each phase                   of physical energy has          been   presented in the garb
either      of impalpable, imponderable (in fact immaterial) matter itself, or of
the vibrations thereof      ; and to some of these hypotheses have been suc
cessively        added some               violent    supplementary          hypothesis, in order ade
quately to meet the requirements   of advancing knowledge.
   To begin with chemical action : — What are now universally recognized
as simple metals were once supposed   to consist of some earthy matter (their
        combined  with  " Phlogiston," — the material principle of
oxides)                                                            brilliancy.
But, unfortunately for the theory, it was soon found that the metals, on
parting with their share of phlogiston     e. becoming oxidated), not only
                                                                (i.
did not                 but actually acquired weight;
                lose any,                                  therefore phlogiston
was assumed            to not only imponderable, but A^per-imponderable —
                             be
i.   e.   endowed with the property of absolute levity, or negative weight                            !
  In the next place, the Newtonian theory of light assumed light to
consist of molecules (of course imponderable) emanating from the source
of light, and impinging on the perceptive organs of vision.    But this
hypothesis        would          not fit the phenomena of diffraction and interference                      ;
and to suit these physical                facts the molecules must either be thrown into
periodical
                 " fits" of transmission or reflection, or the ray must                          be   a   row
of    egg-shaped       molecules      making isoperiodic somersaults, and
                                            perpetually
plunging        into   a    they come on their heads, or bounding off

they fall against   sideways. Then, again, heat was supposed to consist of
                            it
material particles emanating from the source of heat   and as    ball of ice      ;        a
placed in one focus of   concave mirror was found
                                        a         to lower the temperature

theory of exchanges accounts for these facts. At length these wild specula
tions were  superseded, and light and heat were admitted into the category
of wave-motion but electricity and magnetism were still supposed to be

     Through the kindness of the Rev. Robert Main, director of the Rad-

by the barographs at Oxford and at Kew were compared together on four
separate occasions in the year 1863.
     These comparisons are the more interesting that they were all made
 during squalls or storms ; for on such occasions it is found that the baro
graph curves exhibiting the height of the barometer from moment to
moment present curious characteristic points, without which indeed no
 such comparisons could be made.

This minimum occurred at Oxford at 2.20 a.m. of that day, while at Kew
it did not occur until 3.15 a.m. Oxford was thus on this occasion 55
minutes before Kew.
     The peculiarity of this last occasion is the singular likeness between the
 two curves. I have not compared together any other features of these

impression is that the changes of pressure at Oxford were followed by
similar changes at Kew, only nearly an hour later.
    It is premature (until we obtain more information) to enter into a
discussion of the rate of progress     of storms  ; but we are quite justified in
considering the barograph an instrument            extremely well adapted to ex
tend our knowledge of atmospheric disturbances.
    We   see  that on those     very occasions    when this knowledge      is most
interesting the barograph comes forward to our assistance,         and presents us
with results which could not possibly be obtained otherwise than by a
system of continuous registration.        It does not, however, follow that, while
a continuous record is by far the best, other records are of no value ; for
should an observer be placed beside an ordinary barometer during the
crisis of a storm, observations made in rapid succession and accurately
timed would be of very great assistance.         Such an observer would in fact
produce approximately a record similar in kind to that of            a  barograph,
although inferior in value.
    It ought here to be noticed that two stations are not enough to enable
 us to determine either the direction in which an atmospheric disturbance
 is propagated or the rate    of propagation.     It  is only on the improbable
 supposition that all such disturbances travel in a direct line from Oxford
to Kew that barographs at these two places might be deemed enough.               In
 order to obtain the greatest amount of information which such instruments
 are capable of affording, it is evidently necessary to multiply our stations
 and to distribute them judiciously      over the surface of the country.    Nor  is
 it desirable   to confine ourselves    to one meteorological element,     but the
 barograph should be accompanied by a thermograph and a self-registering
anemometer.        As this is the system about to be pursued by the Board of
Trade in their chief meteorological stations in the British Isles, we may
 reasonably    hope that before long we may by this means receive a large
accession to our knowledge of the laws which regulate atmospheric dis
turbances.

       " On the Lunar-diurnal         Variation of the Magnetic Declination,

                                     (Abstract.)
    The hourly    records  of the magnetic declination systematically       kept at
the Flagstaff Observatory at Melbourne, Victoria, during the period from
the 1st of May 1858 to the 28th of February 1863, have been discussed
by the author, with a view to determine the lunar-diurnal variation to which
that magnetic element is subject. The results arrived at in the course of
this discussion elicit, he believes, facts hitherto unnoticed, to which it
seems desirable that the attention of scientific men should be directed.

     The process employed in reducing the observations was identical with
that generally adopted in such cases. The disturbed observations were
first eliminated, by rejecting all that differed from the final normal belong
ing to the same solar hour by more than a certain separating value, which
was taken at 3*6 1 minutes of arc. The elimination of the larger disturb
ances having been thus effected, from every remaining reading (R) of the
magnet's direction the final normal (N) belonging to that solar hour was
subtracted, so that the residue R-^N is devoid of the influence of the solar-
diurnal variation.     This residue is positive when the north end of the
needle is to the east of its mean position, and negative in the contrary case.
The number of observations at command amounted to 38,194, of which
4 1 78 single observations were excluded from the discussion as being beyond
the assumed limit used for separating the greater magnetic disturbances,
leaving 34,016 available for the purpose of determining the lunar-diurnal
variation.
     The treatment of the residues with a view to classification according to
lunar hours presented no particular novelty. It may be mentioned, how
ever, that before entering on any general discussion, every month's result
was calculated separately. The values for the various months were after
wards arranged, irrespectively of the year, in two groups, viz. Sun South
 (October to March) and Sun North (April to September).         Thus the mean
lunar-diurnal variation was obtained separately for each half of the year, as
well as for the whole year. On examining the results, irregularities in the
lunar-diurnal variation presented themselves which seemed to show that
that variation depended in some degree on the moon's position with refer
ence to the      equator, on the circumstance whether her declination were
north or south.
     Accordingly  the whole series of observations were rearranged in groups,
 " Declination of the Moon           " and "
                               South          Declination|of the Moon North,"
so as to cause her declination to be divided between the hours      of the day,
 all those days being rejected on which the moon was close to the equator.
 The 118 groups of lunar-diurnal variation thus formed were subsequently
 classified according to whether the sun's declination was south or north.
     A Table was thus formed giving for each lunar hour the lunar-diurnal
 variation of the magnetic declination separately under each of nine condi
 tions formed by combining each of the three conditions, Sun South and
 North, Sun South, Sun North, with each of the three Moon South and
 North, Moon South, Moon North. The results given numerically in the
 Table were also laid down graphically in curves.
     A glance at the curves shows that the lunar-diurnal variation must be
 regarded as being influenced by both the sun and the moon ; for it is seen
 that in case the declinations of the two bodies are of the same name, the
 curves show greater regularity than    in the contrary case.
     The question whether during the winter season any lunar-diurnal varia
  tion can be traced at all can, the author conceives, no longer be entertained

if we  pay due attention to the facts which may he gleaned from the Table.
Indeed it is afterwards shown, in discussing the individual years of observa
tion, that in some cases the lunar-diurnal variation manifests itself in a very
striking manner during the winter months.
   On examining the results of the inquiry for the several years of observa
tion, obvious differences are recognized on comparison.      This was espe
cially remarkable as regards the year 1861, which was the more striking as
the] year 1660 did not exhibit any such extraordinary deviations from the
mean values.     At first some error was suspected in the deduction of the
results  ; but a perfectly independent and fresh discussion gave results
agreeing in the main points with those previously arrived at.
   In the course of the year 1861 the instruments previously in use were
replaced   by fresh ones obtained from Munich, which came into use for re
gular registration at the beginning of June.    Though every care was taken
to ensure uniformity of registration, it was deemed satisfactory to repeat the
discussion, including that part only of 1861 in which the old instruments
were employed ; and accordingly the lunar-diurnal variation was discussed,
with special regard to the moon's declination, for the year May 1860 to
April   1861, and likewise for the year May 1858 to April 1859 ; but it was
still found that towards the latter part of the former period the anomalies
above pointed out made themselves clearly felt.
   The results for the years    1860  and 1861 were given numerically in        a
special Table, and delineated in curves.
    In conclusion, the author expressed    a hope that the few facts he had
brought forward might operate as an inducement to those who are engaged
in similar pursuits, to enter upon such a laborious task as that of classifying
 magnetic observations for the purpose of examining into the law and nature
 of the lunar-diurnal variation, according to the moon's position north or
 south of the equator.

      The results of the many     observations   which had been instituted prior
   to 1860 upon the behaviour of gun-cotton when exposed to diffused or
   strong daylight, or to heat, although they agree generally with those of
  the most recent investigations on the subject, as far as relates to the nature
  of the products obtained at different stages of its decomposition, cannot be
  regarded as having a direct bearing upon the question of the stability of
  gun-cotton     produced    by strictly pursuing the system of manufacture
  prescribed by vou Lenk, inasmuch as it has been shown that the products
  formerly experimented upon by different chemists varied very considerably
  in composition.
      The investigations recently published by Pelouze and Maury*, into the
  composition of gun-cotton, and the influence exerted by light and heat upon
 its stability, are described as having been conducted with gun-cotton pre
  pared according to von Lenk's system. The general conclusion arrived at by
  those chemists with reference to the latter branch of the subject was to the
  effect that the material is susceptible of spontaneous decomposition, under
 conditions which may possibly be fulfilled in its storage and application to
 technical and warlike purposes ; and the inference is drawn, partly from the
 results of earlier investigators, and partly from the exceptional behaviour of
 one or two specimens,     that gun-cotton is liable to explode spontaneously at
 very low temperatures when stored in considerable quantities.
     It has been shown, in the memoir on the Manufacture             and Composition
 of Gun-cotton, published last yearf, that modifications in the processes of
 conversion and purification, which appear at first sight of very trifling
 nature, exert most important influences upon the composition and purity of
 the product. Gun-cotton of quite exceptional character has been discovered,
in   several instances,  among samples    received     from Hirtenberg and among
 the first supplies obtained from Stowmarket         ;   other exceptional products
have also been produced by purposely modifying, in several ways, the sys
tem    of manufacture    as pursued at Waltham         Abbey.     The   very consider
able difference exhibited between some of these and            the ordinary products
in their behaviour under       equal   conditions of     exposure to heat and light,
affords good grounds for the belief that the attainment of certain excep
tional results, upon which the conclusions of Pelouze and Maury's report,

418               Mr. F. A. Abel         on the   Stability        of Gun-cotton.       [April 4,
condemnatory of gun-cotton, have been principally founded, are to be as
cribed to such variations in the nature of the material operated upon.
  Very numerous and extensive experiments and observations have been
carried on during the last four years at Woolwich, both with small and large
quantities of gun-cotton, for the purpose of completely investigating the
conditions by which the stability of this substance, when under the influ
ence of light and heat, may he modified, and with the view of ascertaining
whether results recently arrived at in France apply to gun-cotton as manu
factured in this country.
   The principal points which have been established by the results arrived
at in these investigations may be summed up as follows : —
   1. Gun-cotton produced from properly purified cotton, according to the
directions given by von Lenk, may be exposed to diffused daylight, either
in the open air or in closed vessels, for very long periods without undergoing
any change.   The preservation of the material for 3^ years under those
conditions has been perfect.
  2. Long-continued   exposure of the substance in a condition of ordinary
dryness to strong daylight and sunlight produces a very gradual change in
gun-cotton of the description defined above ; and therefore the statements
which have been published regarding the very rapid decomposition of
gun-cotton when exposed to the sunlight do not apply to the nearly pure
trinitrocellulose obtained by strictly following the system of manufacture
now adopted.
  3.    If
         gun-cotton in closed vessels is left for protracted periods exposed
to strong daylight or sunlight in a damp or moist condition, it is affected
to a somewhat    greater extent ; but even under these circumstances the
change produced in the gun-cotton by several months' exposure is of a very
trifling nature.
    4. Gun-cotton which is exposed to sunlight until a faint acid reaction
has become developed, and is then immediately afterwards packed into
boxes which are tightly closed, does not undergo any change during subse
quent storage for long periods.  (The present experience on this head ex
tends over 3| years.)
   5. Gun-cotton prepared and purified according to the prescribed system,
and stored in the ordinary dry condition, does not furnish any indication of
alteration, beyond the development, shortly after it is first packed, of a slight
peculiar odour and the power of gradually imparting to litmus, when packed
with    it,   a   pinkish tinge.
   6.   The influence        exercised     upon the stability of gun-cotton           of average
quality, as obtained          by
                         strict adherence                   to von

ture,   by
         prolonged exposure to temperatures considerably exceeding those
which are experienced in tropical climates        very trifling iu comparison
                                                                  is
with the results recently published               by
                                         Continental experimenters relating to
the effects       of   heat upon gun-cotton       ;   and   it   may be so perfectly counteracted
by very simple means which in no way interfere with the essential qualities

of the material, that                 the storage     and transport of gun-cotton presents no

greater danger,            and             uuder some circumstances, attended with much less
risk of accident than                      the case with gunpowder.
    7.Perfectly pure gun-cotton, or trinitrocellulose, resists to remarkable                                 a
extent the destructive effects of prolonged exposure to temperatures even
approaching    00° C.
                   1    and the lower nitro- products of cellulose (soluble
                                  ;
gun-cotton) are at any rate not more prone to alteration when pure. The
incomplete conversion of cotton into the most explosive products does,
therefore, not of necessity result in the production of  less perfectly per                 a
fectly permanent compound than that obtained                                        by   the most perfect action
of the acid mixture.
   8. But all ordinary products of manufacture contain small proportions of
organic  (nitrogenized) impurities of comparatively unstable properties,
which have been formed        the action of nitric acid upon foreign matters
                                               by
retained by the cotton fibre, and which are not completely separated     the                                            by
ordinary, or even    more searching process of purification.
                            a
   It    is           of this class of impurity in gun-cotton which first gives
              the presence
rise to the development of free acid when the substance        exposed to the                       is
action of heat    and  ;    the acid thus generated which eventually exerts
                                  it   is
a destructive action upon the cellulose-products, and thus establishes de
composition which heat materially accelerates.    If this small quantity of
acid developed         from the impurity                  in    question be neutralized                  as   it   becomes
nascent,       no injurious action upon the gun-cotton results, and
                                                                  great pro                                  a
moting cause of the decomposition of gun-cotton       heat   removed.   This         by            is
result   readily
         is      obtained  by uniformly distributing through gun-cotton                                                        a
small proportion of    carbonate, — the sodic carbonate, applied in the form
                                 a
of solution, being best adapted to this purpose*.
   9. The introduction into the finished gun-cotton of                                         1   per cent, of sodic
carbonate affords to the material the power of resisting                                       any serious change,
even when exposed to such elevated                              temperatures as would induce some
decomposition in the perfectly pure cellulose-products.     That proportion
affords, therefore, security to gun-cotton against any destructive effects of
the highest temperatures to which     likely to be exposed even under very
                                                          it    is
exceptional climatic conditions. The only influences which the addition of
that amount of carbonate to gun-cotton might exert upon its properties as
an explosive would   consist in   trifling addition to the small amount of
                                                      a
smoke attending  its combustion, and    in slight retardation of its explosion,
                                                                 a
neither of which could be regarded as results detrimental to the probable
value of the material.
 *   The deposition of calcic and magnesinn                          carbonates     upon the fibre of gun-cotton,
either by its long-continued immersion in flowing spring water, or by its subjection to
the so-called " silicating

effect, which, however,          is
                           necessarily very variable in its extent, as the amount of car
bonate thus introduced into                a   mass   of gun-cotton       is   uncertain moreover, as
                                                                                           ;                       it   is   only

    1 0. Water acts    as a  most perfect protection to gun-cotton (except when
it is exposed for long periods to sunlight), even under extremely severe
conditions of exposure to heat.           An atmosphere saturated with aqueous
vapour suffices to protect it from change at elevated temperatures ; and wet
or damp gun-cotton may be exposed for long periods in confined spaces to
 100° C. without sustaining any change.
   Actual immersion in water is not necessary for the most perfect preserva
tion of gun-cotton      ; the material, if only damp to the touch, sustains not
the smallest    change, even if closely packed in large quantities.       The organic
impurities   which    doubtless  give  rise  to  the  very slight development of acid
observed when gun-cotton is closely packed in the dry condition, appear to
be equally protected by the water ; for damp or wet gun-cotton, which has
been preserved     for three years, has not exhibited the faintest acidity.         If
as  much   water   as   possible be expelled from wet gun-cotton by the centri
fugal extractor, it is obtained in a condition in which, though only damp
to the touch, it is perfectly non-explosive ; the water thus left in the mate
rial is sufficient to act as a perfect protection, and consequently also to
guard against all risk of accident.            It is therefore in this condition that
all reserved stores of the substance should be preserved, or that it should
be transported in large quantities to very distant places.              If the proper
proportion of sodic carbonate be dissolved in the water with which the
gun-cotton is originally saturated for the purpose of obtaining it in this
non-explosive form, the material, whenever it is dried for conversion into
cartridges, or employment in other ways, will contain the alkaline matter
required for its safe storage and use in the dry condition in all climates.
    Although some experiments, bearing upon the different branches of in
quiry included in this memoir, are still in progress with a view to the
attainment of additional knowledge of the conditions which regulate the
stability of gun-cotton, it is confidently believed that the results arrived at
amply demonstrate that the objections which have been of late revived,
especially in France, against the employment of gun-cotton, on the ground of
its instability, apply only in a comparatively slight degree to the material
produced by strictly pursuing the system of manufacture perfected by von
Lenk —that,     as far as they do exist, they have been definitely traced to certain
difficulties in the manufacture of pure gun-cotton which further experi
mental research may, and most probably will, overcome — but that, in the
meantime,     these   objections are entirely set aside by the adoption of two
very simple measures, against the employment of which no practical diffi
culties can be raised, and which there is every reason to believe must secure
for this material the perfect confidence of those who desire to avail them
selves of the special advantages which it presents as an explosive agent.
   The nature of       the decomposition      of gun-cotton when exploded under
different   conditions is now under investigation by me ; and the results
arrived at will, I trust, be communicated before long to the Royal Society.

II.  "Observations of Temperature during two Eclipses of the Sun (in
       1858 and 1867)."                By John Phillips, M.A., LL.D., D.C.L.,
      F.R.S., Professor of Geology in the University of Oxford. Re
      ceived    April 3, 1867.
   On the   1 5th of March 1 858, occurred an annular eclipse of the sun, whose
central  line  of shadow passed near the village of Steeple Aston, a few miles
north of Oxford.          Ample preparations were made for observing it by resi
dents in Oxford, and they were met on the ground by many persons from
a distance  ; Mr. Lassell being one of the party, there was no lack of tele
scopic power. The day was unfavourable — cold and cloudy, with some
occasional feeble and delusive gleams, scarcely permitting a sight of the
progress of the eclipse, which, however, was obvious enough by the grow
ing  and diminishing         darkness.        Under these circumstances       I devoted  my
principal attention to three thermometers, carefully selected and compared
beforehand — one mercurial with blackened bulb, another mercurial with
clear bulb (these were placed in an open space exposed to the sun) ; the third,
a minimum- spirit thermometer, tint red, was placed in a shaded situation.
The observations       began at        1 lh 30m and lasted till    2h 30m,   thus including
the whole period of the eclipse, which began at                1 lh 35m, reached  the maxi
mum of obscuration at 0b 54m, and ended at 2h                  11™.    The apparent semi-
diameters of    the sun and moon were so nearly equal                 that the eclipse was

422                Prof. Phillips's Observations of Temperature                              [April 4,
   During     the late partial eclipse            of   the sun     on the 6th of March 1867,
observations      of    the ingress     of the    moon were        favoured at Oxford by bril
liant weather       ;  within fire minutes after the moment of maximum obscura
tion                clouds appeared        ; and     from this time till the end        of the eclipse

they never wholly disappeared, but did not prevent the progress of the
moon and the degrees of obscuration from being correctly marked.                                    At
the very end        it was only just possible to observe the egress by a momentary
attenuation of the clouds ; the remainder of the day was cold, cloudy, and
finally snowy. The observations began at 8h and ended at 10h 50m, thus
including the whole period of the eclipse, which began at 8h 12m 15s, reached
the greatest obscuration at 9" 26m, and ceased at 10" 45m 8".                             At the mo
ment of greatest obscuration the light-giving area was reduced to one-third
of  the solar disk.
   The observations comprised —
   (1) Temperature in the shade, by the mean of one mercurial and one
spirit thermometer very nearly agreeing throughout.
   (2) Temperature in the sunlight, by a clear mercurial bulb.
   (3) Temperature in the sunlight, by a dark mercurial bulb.
   (4) Temperature in the sunlight, by a dark mercurial bulb enclosed in
a glass tube exhausted of air.
   The observations were recorded at intervals according                             to convenience
(3m  to  20m),   the     shorter   intervals     being   purposely      chosen    about   the time of
maximum obscuration.                The    results     are  in  the  following Table : —

1867.J        during two Eclipses          of   the   Sun (in 1858 and 1867).                     423
   Ou considering the columns of figures with attention, it will he perceived
that on each occasion all the thermometers iu the sunshine sank as the
eclipse advanced,      so as to reach the greatest           depression       not at, but after the
epoch of greatest obscuration, and from this point rose again as the obscu
ration diminished, but in neither case arrived at the same elevation as in
the beginning of the eclipse.    In each case the eclipse began with fair
prospects, but was followed by rain or snow.
   In the annular (almost total) eclipse three thermometers, two in the
sunshine and one in the shade, reached the very same point (47°'5), that
being the lowest observed ; in the partial eclipse, three thermometers cor
responding to the above reached nearly the same point (36°'7, 38°, 38°),
the lowest observed. The lowest point was not reached on either occasion by
these instruments till some minutes after the moment of greatest obscura
tion (6 minutes in the annular and 9 minutes in the partial eclipse) ; while
the thermometer enclosed in a tube did not sink below 41° at the same time.
The later occurrence of the  extreme depression in the partial eclipse was
occasioned by the additional cooling influence of the clouds which gathered
five minutes after the epoch of greatest obscuration.
   By representing       the observations        in   curves    with ordinates proportioned
to the depressions at the successive epochs,                 the circumstances which have
been referred to are clearly seen, — the convergence of all the lines beyond
the time-point of greatest obscuration — the exactitude of this convergence
in the uniformly clouded sky of               the comparative confusion of
                                            1 858,     and
the lines in the suddenly altered sky of 1867, where the effect of the access
of cloud is 10,9 on the enclosed thermometer, 3°-5 on the clear exposed
bulb, and 50,2 on the black exposed bulb (see Plate IX.).
  The    effect   of the cloud on       the instruments employed              in   the latter   half of
the eclipse is to reduce the temperatures at the end of the eclipse, as com
pared with the beginning, more than 8° in the enclosed thermometer, 5° in
the dark-bulb exposed, and 2° in the clear-bulb ; but in the shaded instru
ments the effect is contrary, for they gained 2°-6 between beginning and end.
  Finally, if the areas of obscuration be calculated for the several epochs of
observation (in 1867), and the proportions be represented by a curve
adapted to the scale used for temperature, the fact of the postponement of
the radiation-effect will appear, as well as the conformity with which the
temperatures follow the curve, in the bright half of the eclipse, and fall
away from     it,   but still proportionately, in the clouded half.

   The following communications            were read    : —
I.   "A   new fact relating to Binocular               Vision."     By A. Claudet,
       F.R.S.     Received March 20, 1867.
   The   persistence    of the impression      made by light on the retina is demon
strated by many experiments         ;   but  one  of the most convincing, which is also
very easy to try, is that which is known under the name of the thaumatrope.
                                                                           "
    Let us write the letters composing a word of eight letters, say Victoria,"
on the two sides of a small card, in such a manner that one surface shall
contain the 1st, 3rd, 5th, and 7th letters, and the other surface the 2nd,
4th, 6th, and 8th, with a space between them sufficient to complete the
word on each surface, which blank spaces are in fact to appear filled up
during the experiment by an artificial means to be explained.
   Fig.  1 shows    the arrangement on the two sides of the card (section view).

   Fig.  2 shows the plan      of the card.       The white letters  are those written
on one surface,    and the dotted lines those written on the other.
                                           Fig.   2.
   Now by means of two strings fixed on the two sides A, B the card may
be made to revolve       on its axis by turning the string between the thumb
and finger   of each hand. By this means a very rapid motion may be com
municated to the card, and while it is revolving both surfaces are alter
nately seen in quick succession, and the perception of the two is so simulta
neous that the two sets      of letters    appear as one, and the whole word is read
as distinctly as   if it were written on one surface only.
   This is  easily explained.       It is known that the persisting action     of light
on the retina has a duration of about one-eighth of a second ; so that if
the card makes at least eight revolutions in a second
                                                                 (it may make consi
derably more), before one impression has vanished another produces its
effect on the next part of the retina, in such a way that they are intermixed
and simultaneously visible, producing an uninterrupted              sensation.

   The     means by which this illusion is produced has been called the
                                                                                                    " thau-
matrope," from two Greek words meaning "wonder" and                                            "turn." It
is difficult to trace the history of this discovery ; but it is certain that it
lias been the result of a very old, simple, and well-known experiment.
   From time immemorial schoolboys have amused themselves by holding                                            a
coin between two pins and making it revolve rapidly by blowing upon                                            it,
when to their surprise the coin showed the head mixed with the device on the
Qther side.    have been told that as Sir John Herschel was one day making
                  I
this experiment to amuse his children, in the presence of the late Dr. Paris,
this gentleman was struck with the idea that       instead of       if,
                                                                coin,  white           a              a
card was employed on each side of which one part of design was properly        a
arranged, the two might complete the subject during the revolution.      Ac
cordingly he made the experiment, which                       succeeded perfectly well.                   If the
story   true, certainly Dr. Paris may be
          is                                                 regarded          as the inventor         of     the
thaumatrope, which he has so well and so fully elucidated    his very in                  in
teresting and instructive work entitled Philosophy in Sport
                                                       '
                                                            made Science
in earnest.'
   This philosophical toy may be employed to show another effect of the
persistence of the retinal image. If complementary colours are fixed on
the two opposite sides of the card, they will become superposed during the
revolution, and white light will be the result.   By the same means, other
curious effects of the mixture of various colours might be tried.
   All    these experiments present no difference, whether they are made look

of producing another phenomenon, elucidating very forcibly the principles
by which binocular vision    the only real and effective means of showing
                                      is
the distances of objects, which are determined                       by
                                                    the degree of the angle
of convergence of the optic axes and    one of its corollaries, the sensation

of double images for all the points which are not exactly on the plape of
vision.
   The thaumatrope          is   capable   of showing that binocular vision                      can detect
to a degree hardly conceivable the most minute difference   the distances              in
of objects, suchas the distance between the planes of the two surfaces of
a card, which distance     nothing more than the thickness of the card.
                                 is
Therefore, supposing that the thickness of the card         of an inch and the
                                                                           is
distance from the eyes     in, there not
                                 15           difference greater than the xsVff
                                                is          a
part of the whole distance  from  the eyes to the two planes of the card and                              ;
still the difference of      the degree    of   convergence          for two planes so near each
other    is    sufficient to excite the action       of binocular vision,           and     by  it   to enable
us to detect that infinitesimal difference                  in their distances.           But that         such
an effect      of binocular vision could possibly                 be displayed         while looking at
two planes so nearly intermixed             as the surfaces               of   a   card revolving upon
its axis with such          a   wonderful velocity           is   the very extraordinary pheno

 menoQ     I  have discovered,    and which    I am about to describe      and  endeavour
 to explain.
     If the   thickness of the card is    A B, fig.   3, and   if the two ends of       each
                                            Fig. 3.
 string, passing through the holes C and D in the card, are brought together
 and turned between the thumb and finger, the card will whirl exactly on
its axis, and during the revolution the two surfaces              A and B will   be at    the
 same distance      from the eyes.
    But   if  the two strings are drawn so that one         of their knots is   as in fig.  4,
                                          Fig. 4.
 the surface B will revolve        round the plane of the surface A corresponding
with the axis of the string, and, during the revolution, every time that it is
 made visible to the eyes       it will appear   as  if it  were   nearer than the       sur
face   A.
    By reversing the position of the knots,         as in fig. 5, instead   of the   surface
                                          Fig. 5.
                                              A
 B revolving round       the plane   of A, it will  be  A that will revolve round         the
plane of B.
    These three different positions of the strings will produce three             different
effects.
    In the position of fig.    3 the effect   will be normal ; that is to say, the two
surfaces coming alternately at the same distance, we shall see the whole
word as     if the letters were on the same surface.
    In the position of figs. 4 and 5 we have a very strange illusion.                   One
half of the letters composing the word will appear before or behind                      the
other half, according to the surface upon which they are written and                     the
position of the knots upon that or the other            surface.
    In fig.   4 the letters written on the surface     B will appear   before the letters
on    the surface    A ;  and in fig. 5 the letters on the surface         A will   appear
before the letters on the surface        B.
    The   cause   of the anomaly resulting from the two different            experiments
is  entirely and positively due to a sensation of binocular vision ;         and we may

1867.]                    Mr. A. Claudet       on   Binocular Vision.               427
easily satisfy ourselves that it is so ; for, looking with a single eye in both
cases, all the letters appear on the same plane, notwithstanding the differ
ent distances of the two surfaces given by the position of the knots : and
we may add another convincing proof, which is that the pseudoscope in
verts the distances of the surfaces.
        At first it is rather difficult   to understand how the phenomenon can take
place   for as the perception of the two surfaces is simultaneous, how is it
           ;
possible that during such a rapid revolution the optic axes can be made
to converge alternately on each surface while it is passing so quickly, and
that they should         be made suddenly to converge        on the other in its turn   ?
   However, there cannot be any question that in reality the phenomenon
takes place, and that it is decidedly an effect of binocular vision ; therefore
it only remains to be explained how it can be produced. In endeavouring
to arrive at the true cause of the phenomenon, wc shall have to bring to
mind various physiological sensations which concur in producing the effect.
One is the effort we make to obtain distinct vision, and the other the
effort we make to obtain single vision.      These two efforts act in unison ;
for it is impossible not to admit that the two muscular processes by which
both the angle of convergence is directed to the object and the focus of
the eyes is adapted to its distance, for the double purpose of having at
once single and distinct vision of every object, are two actions neces
sarily simultaneous and inseparably connected.        They are therefore both,
each in its way, criteria of the distances of objects ; but they give rise to
certain indirect and additional criteria for other distances, in two ways : one,
the most important, is the double images of the objects situated before and
behind the point of convergence ; and the other, but only in a subsidiary
way, the degree of confusion of the objects situated before and behind the
point of convergence   and which are not in focus.
  The comparison of two points, one of which is in focus and well defined, and
the other out of focus and confused, helps considerably in forming a judgment
that they are on different planes. But in a question of binocular vision, "per
haps we ought not strictly to take into account this last criterion, which be
longs equally to monocular and binocular vision ; and if we allude to               it,     it
   only because, although  does not produce the real stereoscopic effect, still
it is
                                  it
  contributes to give that sort of illusion of relief which             by
                                                                various means
may be evinced by monocular vision. Therefore                      is
                                                          particularly the sen
                                                              it
sation of double images, the degree of their separation, and their respective
positions either outside or inside from the centres of the two retinee, which
indicate more powerfully the exact distance of the object from the point
of single vision either before or behind.
        When                   point of one surface of the revolving card,
                we look fixedly on     a
 that point appears single, and we see at the same time another point on
 the other surface which appears double, although we hardly feel that we
 notice its doubleness; and from the position or distribution  of the double
 images, either on the right or on the left of the central point, we have at

 428                   Mr. A. Claudet       on  Binocular Vision.           [April  11,
 the same glance the perception of the respective distances.             Therefore, to
judge of the distances of certain objects in the direction of the Hue of vision,
 we are not absolutely obliged to alter constantly the angle of convergence.
 This is proved by our perception of the two distances of the surfaces of the
 card while   it is revolving   ; for it would  be  impossible that we should alter
 the angle   of convergence     to adapt it alternately to the two surfaces while
 they are turning so rapidly.
    The    same angle  of  convergence     kept on one or the other surface is no
 impediment to our seeing both in a sufficiently distinct manner.
    The whole phenomenon may be better understood by the illustration
 given in fig. 6.
                                          Fig   6.
    When     we  converge   the optic axes on B, this point, being represented
 on the centre of both retiuse at B' B", is single, but A being ne.irer is re
 presented on the left of the centre of the left retina at A', and on the right
 of the centre of the right retina at A"; therefore it appears double.
    For the same reason, converging on A, this point is single, but
 B is double, with this difference — that one image is on the right of
 the left retina, and the other on the left of the right retina;               so that
 the double images of nearer objects situated at A are represented out
 side the centres of the two retinse, and those of further objects situated at
 B are represented inside the centres of the retinse, and each of these two
 different sensations brings to our mind the perception of the distance
 which has produced it.             During the revolution of the card we may
 adapt the convergence either to one or to the other surface and keep it so ;
 but in every case the letters on that surface will appear single and a little
 better defined ; and this, with the sensation of double images of the letters
  on the other surface,    will   be an indication  of their respective  distances.
    As   I  am not aware that the illusion       I have described   in this paper has
 ever been noticed before, it has appeared to me that its publication would
  excite the interest of all those who look for any new fact capable of illus
 trating the principles of binocular vision, and showing the wonderful pro

perty of the angle of convergence, by which the most minute differences
in the distances of objects and the slightest relief on their surfaces can be
detected, and by which also in the abnormal conversion introduced in its
action by the pseudoscope all our sensations are reversed.                Therefore the
pseudoscope     is the  great   test  of the  phenomena     of  binocular     vision ; for
by reversing certain sensations which by constant habit we may hardly
notice, it renders them more conspicuous by the comparison of the abnor
 mal state brought out by its action, and proves the theory of binocular
vision in the most effective manner.
     A  truth is never better established than when it can be shown that the
 same principles are capable         of producing contrary     effects when they are
 applied in a contrary way.
     Professor Wheatstone, by adding the pseudoscope to the stereoscope, has
 thus in the most scientific and ingenious manner completed his splendid
 discovery, and left very little (we might almost venture to say that he has
 left nothing)     for further     investigations  in the    physiology      of binocular
 vision.
 II.    " On  the Calculation      of the Numerical Value of Euler's Constant,
         which   Professor Price, of Oxford, calls E."                   By William
         Shanks, Esq., Houghton-le-Spring, Durham.                      Communicated
         by the Rev. B. Price, F.R.S.           Received March 28, 1867.
      In the year 1 853 Dr. Rutherford, of the Royal Military Academy, Wool
 wich, sent a paper on the Computation of the value of r to the Royal
                                                      '
  Society, and the paper was published in the Proceedings' of that learned
 body*.      The value of it is there given to 607 decimals, the first 440 being
  the joint production of Dr. Rutherford and the author of this paper, and
  the remaining 167 decimals having been calculated by the present writer,
  for the accuracy of which he alone is responsible. Subsequently, the
  Astronomer Royal, G. B. Airy, Esq., kindly presented the author's paper
  on the Calculation of the value of        e, the  base  of Napier's     logarithms, to
  upwards of 200 decimals ; the aforesaid paper also contained the Napierian
  logarithms of 2, 3, and 5, as well as the modulus of the common system,
  all to upwards of 200 places of decimals. This paper was not, however,
  published, but deposited in the Archives of the Royal Society ; but an abs
  tract, containing the numerical results, was printed in the ' Proceedings 'f.
   In a paper sent by the author to the Astronomer Royal, and forwarded by
  him to the Royal Society, will, the author believes, be found the reciprocal
   of the prime number 1 7389, consisting of a circulating period of no less
   than 1 7388 decimals, the largest on record.          Some few remarks are also
   given touching circulates generally, and the easiest modes of obtaining them.
   The writer now desires to supplement what he then did, by giving the

430                       Mr. W. Shanks        on the Calculation     of          [April    11,
numerical value of Euler's constant, which is largely employed in "Infi
nitesimal Calculus," to a greater extent than has hitherto been found, and
 free from error.
    In Crelle's Journal for I860, toI. lx. p. 375, M. Oettinger has contri
buted an article on Euler's constant, and especially on " certain discre
pancies" in the value given by former mathematical writers. Adopting
the formula there employed, as being well adapted for the purpose,                           the
writer of this paper has both corrected and extended what has been                          pre
viously done       ;  and as very great     care  has   been bestowed      upon the      calcu
lations, so    as to    exclude error, he confidently believes that his results             are,
as far as they go,           absolutely correct. He may remark that, since                   the
separate values        of n in the formula (which, see below) produce identical
results as far as they go, and the higher the value of n the more nearlr
we can approximate to the value of the constant, we thus have sufficient
proof afforded of the correctness of the value found when n is 10, 20, 50,
or 100.      If the writer can command sufficient leisure, he may resume the
calculation by and by, and, making n 1000, he may thus verify, as well as
extend,   the value of Euler's constant given in this paper.                   The    numbers
 10, 20, 50, 100, 200, and 1000, especially 10 and its integral                   powers, are
more easily handled than others, particularly in those terms of the formula
which    contain Bernoulli's numbers.              The harmonic progression is here
"  summed" much further than was requisite for finding E to 50 or 55 de
cimals ; but this was of some importance in ensuring correctness in the
decimal expression of each of the higher terms of S100 and S200. It may
be observed that the numbers of decimal places in E, obtained from n being
10, 20, 50, 100, and           200, are nearly proportional       to 10*. 20*, 50},        100s.
and 200* — a rather curious coincidence.
    The formula for Euler's constant, employed by                M. Oettinger,       as above
stated, is —

     My attention      was first directed to this subject by               reading a report of
Professor      Stokes's very excellent lecture at the Royal                 Institution, Friday,
March 4th, 1864. It immediately occurred to me                             that a spectroscope
might be combined with a microscope, and employed to                       distinguish coloured
minerals in thin sections of rocks and meteorites.                     I  was soon led to exa
mine many other coloured substances, and found that the instrument is
more useful in connexion with qualitative analysis, when only very small
quantities of material can be obtained.                At first I employed the imperfect
                                                        '                                      '
apparatus described in my Paper in the Quarterly Journal of Science *,
but afterwards, along with Mr. Browning, I constructed that described in
my Paper in the Popular Science Review +. For general purposes I do
                        '                                  '
not think this could be much improved ; but for chemical testing it is
much less fatiguing to use a binocular instrument. There were many
difficulties to contend with, but at length                  I  constructed one which ap
pears to answer all the requirements of the case.
                                          2. Apparatus.
     I  have an ordinary large binocular             microscope, and use an object-glass
of about three inches focal length, corrected for looking through glass an
inch thick ; the lenses being at the top, so as to be as far as possible from
the slit. This is placed at the focus, and between it and the lenses, at
a distance of about half an inch from them, is                a compound prism, composed
of   a  rectangular prism of flint-glass, and two of crown-glass of about 61°,
one at each end.          This arrangement gives direct vision and a spectrum of
the size most suitable for these inquiries, since a wide dispersion often
makes the "absorption-bands far too indistinct.                     In order to be able to
compare two spectra side by side, a small rectangular prism is fixed over

when the spectra are in focus, their line of junction     some distance withinis

focal length, with its axis in the line of the slit, which can easily be fixed
at such   distance between the slit and the prisms, as to bring the spectra
           a
and their line of contact to the same focus.      In front of the slit, close                                to
the small rectangular prism,                    is               with
                                                   circular opening, to shut

quite full. These are cut from barometer-tubes, having an internal diameter
of about one-seventh of an inch, and an external diameter of about three-
sevenths       of   an inch.        They      are made      half   an inch long, ground flat at         each
end, and fixed with Canada balsam on slips                         of glass two inches long       and about
six- tenths        of   an inch wide, so that the centre              of the tube about one-fourth
                                                                                   is
of   an inch from one edge.  By this arrangement the liquid may be examined
through   the length of the tube     laying the slip of glass flat on the stage
                                                     by
of the microscope, or through the side of the tube,           placing the slip     by
vertical and the tube horizontal.    Cells of this size can be turned upside
down and deposits removed without any liquid being lost and the upper               ;
surface of the liquid sufficiently flat, even when inclined at considerable

are held on             by

made up of alternate black and coloured bands, evenly distributed over the
whole spectrum.      The number of these depends on the thickness of the
depolarizing plate, so that we 'may have, if we please, almost innumerable
fine black lines, or fewer, broader bands, black in the centre and shaded off
at each side.          These facts are of course easily explained by the interference
of   waves.       It   would, I think, be impossible to have a more convenient or
suitable scale for measuring the spectra of coloured solids and liquids.                              If
we use a micrometer in the eyepiece, an alteration in the width of the slit
modifies the readings, and the least movement of the apparatus may lead
to error, whereas this scale is not open to either objection. Besides this,
the unequal dispersion of the spectrum makes the blue end too broad, so
that   a   given width, as measured                      with   a    micrometer in the eyepiece, is not
of the     same optical value as the same width                           in the red. The divisions in
the interference-spectrum bear, on the contrary, the same relation to the
length of the waves of light in all parts of the spectrum, and no want of
adjustment in the instrument alters their position.  As will be seen from
the drawing (fig. 1), the unequal dispersion makes  the distance betweeen
the bands in the blue about twice as great as in the red.   The perfection
of a spectrum would be one in which they were all at equal intervals ; but
possibly no such uniform dispersion could be produced.        By having a
direct-vision prism, composed of one of flint-glass of 60°, and two of
crown-glass of suitable angle, we can place it over the eyepiece, and may
diminish    the dispersion at the blue end, or increase that at the red
end,    by turning  it in one position or the other, and thus see either
end    to the greatest advantage.     It                              is,
                                            of course, very easy to draw
spectra on this principle, and give all parts equal prominence, and not an
unduly compressed red, and an unduly expanded blue end.       Thus drawn,
the spectra                         in many of their characters, and some
                   are far more uniform
general laws are at once apparent that otherwise might have been entirely
overlooked; and on this account    shall adopt this system in those figured
                                                     I

by drawings,   without  being at the trouble of distorting them, so as to be
like naturally distorted spectra.
  Since the number of divisions depends on the thickness of the interfer
ence-plate,   became necessary to decide what number should be adopted.

The     centre  of  the bands is black, and they are shnded off gradually at each
side, so that       the shaded      part is about equal to the intermediate bright
spaces.      Taking,      then, the   centres of the black bands as 1, 2, 3, &c, the
centres of the bright spaces are H, 2\, 3£, &c, the lower edges of each |,
 1 j, &c, and the upper 1 \, 2|, &c.              We can easily divide these quarters
into eighths by the eye ; and this is as near as is required iu the subject
before us, and corresponds as nearly as possible to -j-i-jj part of the whole
spectrum, visible under ordinary circumstances by gaslight and daylight.
Absorption-bands at the red end are best seen by lamplight, and those at
the blue end by daylight.
     On this scale the position of some of the principal lines of the solar
spectrum is about as follows           : —
              A.... I            B.... \i          C....2|         D....    3£

     At first  I  used plates    of  selenite, which are easily prepared, because they
 can be split to nearly the requisite thickness with parallel faces       ;  but I found
 that its depolarizing power varies so much with the temperature, that even
 the ordinary atmospheric changes alter the position of the bands.                Quartz
 cut parallel to the principal axis of the crystal is so slightly affected in this
 manner, as not to be open to this objection, but is prepared with far greater
 difficulty.     The sides should be perfectly parallel, and the thickness about
 •043 inch, and gradually polished down with rouge until the sodium-line
 is seen in its proper place. This must be done carefully, since a difference
 of    1 jIuj  inch in thickness would make it decidedly incorrect.               1 have
 prepared such         plates, corresponding     to my  own,   and placed   them   in the
 hands of Mr. Browning and of Messrs. Becks, so that any one wishing to
 adopt    a  similar scale may be able to do so more accurately.
     The two Nicol's prisms and the intervening plate are mounted in a tube
  and attached to a piece of brass in such a manner that the centre of the
  aperture exactly corresponds to the centre of any of the cells used in the
  experiments, which are all made to correspond in such a manner that any
  of them, or this apparatus, may be placed on the stage and be in the proper
  place without       further adjustment, which, of course, saves much time and
  trouble.

expressed.    This is done by means of a small vertical line over the figure

them.    Definite narrow absorption-bands are indicated by * printed over

                               5.    General Remarks on Absorption, Sfc.
        It  appears       to me that in adopting                 the undulatory theory of light it
  greatly simplifies the subject before us if we, to some extent, make use of
  the phraseology of acoustics.                     And thus, for example, I shall speak of two
  absorption-bands that occur, one nearer                           the red, and the other nearer the
   blue,      end    of   the spectrum, as being relatively lower and higher.                                    In   a
   similar manner,            if  the addition      of    some reagent cause the absorption to                     in
   crease towards the blue, aud decrease towards the red, end,                                   I shall     describe
   it   as raising the position             of  the absorption.             We may also make some facts
   more       intelligible       by comparing them with                    the    analogous phenomena of
   sound, and thus, for instance,                    may suppose            that very narrow absorption-
   bands indicate that the ultimate particles of the substance will only take
   up vibrations of light of nearly one particular velocity, and that broad
   absorption-bands show that the particles have a much less definite rate of
   movement.             Analogy would also lead us to infer that, when two spectra
   differ very decidedly, they must be due to different substances, or to the

   1867.]          Colouring -matters by the Spectrum Microscope.                        439
  same    in a  different condition      ; whereas,  if two spectra agree, they may be
  the same substance,         or two distinct substances,     whose different actions are
  made equal      by particular circumstances.          As an illustration, we may refer
  to a short   string, which may give the same note as a longer whose tension
  is greater.     For this reason we should be careful not to rely too much on
  one spectrum.         If, however, we can produce some great physical change
  in both    substances,      and still their spectra remain the same under equal
  conditions,    and     if  this occur uniformly in several different changes, we
  may conclude        that they are identical.         Hence the value of the various
 reagents    named       below.      Many excellent illustrations of       these   principles
  could easily be given.
                            6.  General Method      of Experiments.
     Since the spectrum-microscope enables              us to use very small quantities,
 it appeared      desirable     to adopt such a    method of research as would enable
 us to take      full  advantage      of this circumstance,    and   to avoid as much       as
 possible previous chemical manipulations.                  On this account      I  shall say
 nothing about modified chemical methods, which may, of course, be also
 employed when sufficient material is at command.                    My aim has been to
 contrive    a special system         of qualitative analysis of coloured substances
 applicable to minute quantities, and as independent of general chemistry as
 the blowpipe method is in the case of minerals. I may here say that in some
very important practical applications to the detection of blood-stains
 not above             of a grain was at disposal, and yet perfectly satisfactory
results were obtained.
     I was led to study the colouring- matters           of flowers,  leaves, fruits, woods,
and     roots, because it appeared a most admirable field of inquiry to teach
 the   general principles of the subject.            The colours being so various, and
occurring under such complicated conditions, I thought that if methods
could be devised to distinguish those that are dissimilar and to prove the
identity of those that are alike, even when mixed with coloured impurities,
such principles        could easily be applied to other inquiries.           If the  question
were merely to distinguish or compare absolutely pure colouring-matters,
there would be little or no difficulty           ; but it appeared to me that one great
value    of the method would be to be able to apply it at once to very impure
and mixed materials.              In such cases mere colour is of very secondary im
portance, since that may be totally changed by a very small amount of
impurity.
                                  7.  Preparation of Colours.
     If  the petals, leaves, &c. of plants be crushed in water, it very com
monly happens that the colour is rapidly decomposed                           and no clear
solution can be obtained ; but if crushed in a moderate quantity of
spirits of wine, and the solution squeezed out, filtered, and evaporated to
dryness      at  a  gentle heat, the colouring-matter          does not decompose,        even

440 Mr.     H. C. Sorby   on Analysis   of Animal and Vegetable [Apt.        11,
when redissolved    in water and filtered to remove anything not soluble
in that liquid.   This clear solution should then be evaporated to dryness
at a gentle heat in a small saucer, and kept dry ; for then the colours often
undergo no important change in the course of many months, whereas, when
kept dissolved in water or alcohol, they may quickly decompose.           I have
thus prepared the colouring-matter of above a hundred different vegetable
substances, some of which have become entirely changed, but a large
number are apparently still unaltered.        I have also kept a number of
colours, sealed up in glass tubes, ready for direct examination, dissolved
in alcohol, in strong syrup, or in alum.        Many have decomposed, but
many have kept perfectly well, or have merely faded, and still give excel
lent spectra after above a year. I have also prepared and kept iu              the
same manner some animal colouring-matters, but comparatively few.
                          8. Method   of examination.
   The coloured  substances   are examined, when dissolved     in water, alcohol,
or other solvent, in the small glass cells already described, and the various
reagents are added and mixed by means of a moderately stout platinum
wire, flattened at one end and turned up square, like a little hoe. I baTe
made many experiments in order to ascertain what reagents are most ser
viceable in developing characteristic spectra,  and have at   length  concluded
that for general purposes the following are the most convenient. Those
which are solid are best kept in small bottles as coarse powder, and added
to the small cells in a solid state, so that the quantity used may be more
readily known.
                                  9. Reagents.
                     Hydrochloric acid.
                     Citric acid.
                      Benzoic acid.
                     Boracic acid.
                      Bicarbonate of ammonia.
                     Carbonate of soda.
                     Diluted solution of ammonia.
                      Caustic potash.
                     Sulphite of soda.
                      Sulphate of protoxide of iron.

                      Solution of hypochlorite of soda.
                      Permanganate of potash.
    This list might of  course be very much extended,     if we  were to include
 such reagents as may be used in separating or decomposing colours by         the
 ordinary chemical methods.       In describing the  effect  of those named in

  1867.]          Colouring-matters      by the Spectrum       Microscope.             441
  this list,  I feel that I could not avoid mentioning some well-known facts
  without breaking the thread of my argument ; and therefore I trust it may
  not be thought out of place if I give a general account of the whole from the
  particular point of view required by the subject more especially before us.
     The action of many reagents is so intimately related to different parts of
 the spectrum, as to show that there must be some connexion between so-
 called chemical reactions and optical           phenomena.       Not that their effect is
 absolutely the same in the case of all coloured substances, but generally
 only the extent differs, whilst the character of the change is uniform ; un
 less, indeed, decomposition take place          ;  and even then    it has a tendency to
 conform     to a general law.
                                       10.   Solvents.
    Water and alcohol are the most useful solvents, and the spectra of the
two solutions     of the same substance often differ most strikingly ; in fact
they often behave in other respects as if they were solutions of different
substances.      Sometimes the spectra are absolutely identical, but often well-
marked narrow absorption-bands             are seen in the alcoholic solution, where
they   are   almost,  or quite, invisible in the aqueous. Very commonly the
same bands are seen in both, but not exactly in the same place, alcohol some
times raising      them to a higher part of the spectrum, and sometimes de
pressing them.        Occasionally the spectrum of the dry material is like that
of the alcoholic solution, and unlike that of the aqueous, as if the dif
ference were due to the presence of water, but in other cases it is unlike
both.     At all events the facts clearly show that a solvent has a most im
portant action on the ultimate          particles of the substance in solution, since
it may produce a greater change in optical phenomena than even chemical
combination.        Undistilled hard water may act like a weak alkali.
                                1 1.  Acids and Alkalies.
    As far as optical phenomena are concerned, there is no absolute divi
sion between acids and alkalies ; for we have every connecting link from
the strongest acids to the strongest alkalies.            In order to understand their
action, it is most essential to distinguish between what may be called
"                                   " local absorption-bands."
    general    absorption" and                                          There may, per
haps, be no absolute line of division, but when seen to advantage they
are affected in such a different manner that it is desirable to treat of each
separately.
                               12.   General Absorption.
    As  a  good example of simple general absorption, we may take the crim
son   colouring-matter of the common Wallflower (Cheiranthus Cheiri), which
is soluble in water, and, along with a yellow only soluble in alcohol, gives
rise to the varied colours      of the flowers.

   These facts will be better understood by means of the following draw
ing:—
                                Red end.           Fig.   2.       Blue end.
               1. Citric acid.
               2. Neutral.
               3. Ammonia.
Whence it will be seen that citric acid raises and greatly increases the cen
tral absorption, and ammonia lowers and also increases it. At the same
time the absorption at the extreme blue end of the spectrum is raised by
the acid almost to beyond the range of vision, but lowered to the centre
of the spectrum by ammonia. Acids and alkalies of intermediate character,
as, for example,     boracic acid and bicarbonate of ammonia, produce inter
mediate    effects.    These well-known phenomena may be looked upon as
typical of acids and alkalies, but the extent of their action varies for each
particular colouring-matter, so that in some cases, it is slight, and some
times neither acids nor alkalies produce any effect.            Their relative action
on the central and upper absorption also              varies very greatly  in different
colours.     If there is no general absorption in the centre of the spectrum,
when the colour is neutral, but only an absorption at the blue end, acids
and alkalies act on it in precisely the same manner as on the absorption at
the blue end in the case        just described,  raising or lowering it to an extent
 varying greatly according to the substance ; and the same may be said of
 any general absorption at the red end. The reverse certainly occurs when
 an acid is added to chromate of potash, or excess of ammonia to a salt of
 copper; and, according to Stokes (Phil. Trans. 1862, p. 609), alkaloid
 bases usually show this reverse action.             It may depend on the different
 properties   of  two    distinct  compounds,    which   does not appear to be the
cause   of the phenomena now under consideration.              In the case of all the
vegetable colouring-matters        which   I have  examined,   the  tendency of acids
is to raise, and of alkalies to depress, the general absorption in each part
of the spectrum ; the extent of this action depending on the strength and
quantity of the reagents, and on the nature of each colouring-matter ; and
 thus we have a general rule, and not several, as commonly adopted bv
 chemists, each of very limited application ; for instance, that vegetable
 blues  are turned red by acids, and green           by alkalies ; and that vegetable
 yellows are reddened         by alkalies.   I  may here remark that some colours

would appear to be exceptions, if we did not remember that waves of
light, or waves analogous to them, exist beyond the visible spectrum.
Thus, for example, when alkalies are added to the yellow solution of Brazil
wood (Ccesalpinia crista), it is changed to pink, the absorption being so
much lowered that the blues are transmitted ; this clear space correspond
ing   to what was probably                beyond the blues visible under
                                            a clear space

Of course   I   here allude to the effect of the same total amount of colour,
and not to the different effect of the same quantity of  strong or dilute                a
solution.  The alcoholic solutions obtained direct from the flowers often
fade so rapidly, and become so nearly colourless, that any one might easily
fancy that all the colour was lost    decomposition  by and an evaporating       ;
dish containing         it,
                     might appear merely  filled with brownish alcohol, and
 yet on evaporation the whole dish might    be covered with   fine deep colour.          a
 The same change may      occur over and  over  again, the deep-coloured solu
 tion first obtained soon fading, and the colour being restored     subsequent                by
 evaporation.
   When such       a    colour        is   dissolved in   a   little water and           added to alcohol       in
 an experiment tube, the colour may at first be very deep, but may fade so
 rapidly that there   scarcely time to observe the spectrum before
                             is                                      passes                          it
 into that molecular state which does  not  absorb any of the rays of light.
 The colouring-matter of the flowers of the red Salvia (S. splendens)    an                                is
 excellent example.     Neutral solutions do not undergo this rapid change                                      ;

                                           14. Absorption-bands.
   Though acids and alkalies thus, to a greater or less extent, alter the
position of the general absorption, they act very differently on the special,
local absorption to which it is very convenient to restrict the term " absorp
tion-bands."     Since I shall often have to speak of their being at equal in
tervals, it would be well to say that I have found it convenient to construct
a wedge-shaped    piece of quartz, cut parallel to the axis of the crystal, and
to use it along with two Nicol'a prisms in such a manner that the spectrum
may be divided into any requisite number of equal portions, by inter
ference-bands situated in any requisite position.      This of course avoids
the errors which so often                       happen when we compare                         together measure
ments that cannot be made                       with very    great accuracy.
   As       an excellent illustration            I    select the colouring-matter                    of Alkanet-root
(Anchusa tinctoria).   It is insoluble in water, but is easily dissolved by
alcohol, even when much diluted with water, and gives a clear pink solu
tion.   The spectrum is nearly the same when the colour is dissolved in
absolute alcohol, as when much water is present, only each of the absorp
tion-bands is situated rather higher. Thus, taking the centres of the bands,
we have          —

 position    as at   first, only modified in intensity.            The band a becomes
 darker and darker as more carbonate is added, until, when the solution is
 a fine purple, it is as dark as the others (see No. 2) ; and on adding1more
carbonate it becomes still darker, and the bands c and d more faint, until
the solution      is a purple-blue       ;  and   the spectrum has only the two well-
marked band 3 a and b, shown by No. 3.
    The bright blue colouring-matter of the flowers of Lobelia speciosa
gives,    when neutral, almost exactly the same spectrum as that of
Alkanet-root when alkaline,            No.     3, having     two well-marked    absorption-
bands, whose centres are at           2|   and   4| ; and on adding carbonate of soda,
the upper one is gradually removed,                 and the centre of the lower is de
pressed    to near 2£.       More or     less similar results occur in the case    of many
other blue colouring-matters           ;   and   on adding a slight excess      of acid the
general absorption is raised, and             other bands may be developed higher up,
at equal    intervals ; but     when   a    large excess has been added, they are lost
in a strong general absorption.                Too strong an alkali may also destroy
narrow bands in a similar            manner,      as is well seen in the case of Brazil
wood.      The neutral       aqueous    solution shows an absorption-band, made far
more distinct by the addition of bicarbonate of ammonia, which makes it
pink and very fluorescent.            The spectrum is then
                                      4f-5|               7;
but on adding excess          of ammonia the solution         ceases to be fluorescent, the
narrow absorption-band           is lost, and the spectrum becomes
                                     3i.-4|— 8-..9i.
Ammonia does            not produce this effect when the colour is dissolved in
alcohol,     the solution      remaining fluorescent and still giving the narrow
band   ;  and, as    a   general rule, that solvent greatly impedes or entirely pre
vents such changes,          and on this account almost invariably shows absorp
tion-bands to the greatest advantage.
   We therefore see from the above examples that the absorption follows
the general rule, and is raised by acids, and depressed by alkalies ; but this
only applies       to the absorption when viewed as a whole, and not to the
separate bands ; for those reagents change their intensity, but not their
position.      In some cases, indeed, their position is slightly altered, so that
perhaps     it would      be more correct to say that acids         and alkalies may raise
and depress       the general      absorption to an extent         equal to a considerable
fraction    of its own great breadth           ; whereas   they either do not change the
position of narrow absorption-bands, or merely raise and depress them by
a fraction of their own narrow width.                   It is their very definite position
that makes them so useful in this method of analysis.
    Unfortunately I have not hitherto been able to find a sufficient number
of colouring-matters giving rise to three or more well-marked absorption-
bands, to warrant a general conclusion ; and therefore it is perhaps prema
ture    to conclude that their centres             always occur at equal intervals.      At

446       Mr. H. C. Sorby        on    Analysis of Animal and Vegetable [Apr.              11,
the same time         it  is certainly a very common fact.            When the maximum
point of     transparency occurs between the different bands,                 there may be, as
it were, a double interval ; but then, sometimes, even this missing band
may be seen under favourable conditions.                   A difference in the general ab
sorption may also somewhat alter the apparent position of a band, if it is
strongly shaded on one side, and not on the other ; and the presence of
impurities may also modify the results, so that absolute accuracy cannot
be expected in all cases ; and occasionally very narrow bands occur which
appear to belong to a second system.                  It must be borne in mind that the
bands are equidistant, only when               measured     by means of the interference-
spectrum.         Thus, in the case of Alkanet-root, when measured with a mi
crometer, instead of the intervals a to b and c to d being equal, they are related
to one another about as            I \ and 2,   and thus the general law is entirely ob
scured.        If  subsequent     research   should prove that the bands are normally
at equal intervals,        it will   be a fact  of great value in deciding whether cer
tain spectra are or are not due to a mixture of colours ; since, if a bawl
occurred at a perfectly unequal interval, it would show that there must be
at least two substances.              Even in the present state of our knowledge, any
inequality      should    make   us   carefully search for some satisfactory reason for
such      a  divergence from a common rule.                  My meaning will be better
understood        from   the  following examples.
     If a little of the colour of Brazil-wood be added to the solution of Alkanet-
root, the bands are not altered, and                 are  seen at   4|,   5 j,  and 1\ ; but a
little bicarbonate of ammonia developes a well-marked band, whose centre is
at h\, and therefore at an interval of 1, instead of \\. The same is also
well seen in the case of a mixed solution of Brazil-wood and blue Lobelia.
I therefore argue that if an unknown substance gave rise to similar spectra,
with bands        at unequal intervals, we ought           strongly to suspect that it was
either naturally composite,            or  that  some    new  compound had been formed
by decomposition.            As a very good illustration I may refer to the product
of the action of         acids on chlorophyll.           The band in the red is not at -an
equal interval ; but, on careful examination, it is seen to be made up of two
bands, the upper of which is at an equal interval.                   I was not aware that
these were due to two different substances,               but was led to think it very pro
 bable ; and Professor Stokes informs me that he has proved it to be the case.
 As an illustration of another kind of exception, I refer to the colouring-
 matter of the pink Stock {Matthiola annua). The aqueous solution shows
 two bands, whose centres are at about 3 % and 5| ; and on adding ammonia
 the upper is removed,           and    the lower depressed to 3£.           In spirit of wine
 they are at 4 and 6-J, and ammonia developes                  a third at 3, which are not
 equal intervals.        However,      if absolute alcohol   he used, the bands are at      2|,
 -1,1,, and   5j, which     are equal intervals    ;   and thus we    see  that the abnormal
 inequality is due to the presence of water, which causes the spectrum to
 be as if due to a mixture of two colours, when in reality it is the same
 colour dissolved       in two solvents.

     In  spectra showing one absorption-band, there is very commonly a general
absorption, extending from it towards the blue end ; whereas it so seldom
extends towards the red end that it is doubtful if it ever occurs in sub
stances, undoubtedly not a mixture of two colours.                  It can, however, so
easily occur in mixed colours, that any substance giving rise to such a
spectrum is probably a mixture.            Many illustrations might be given, but         I
will select Brazil-wood, and the same artificially mixed with the colour of
beet-root.       Adding bicarbonate of ammonia to both, we have —
                                                        *

Here, then, the shading below         the absorption-band from       3|  to 4| is evidence
of    the second colour, and       if  such a mixture had occurred naturally its
 mixed character might easily          have  been overlooked.        I have found many
 cases similar to this, and had proved that they were mixtures, before               I was
 aware that the spectra indicated it.           If  these very common facts turn out
 to be general laws, we might thus detect at once the presence of as many
 as three different substances,       or at all events might     learn what further ex
 amination was desirable.
                                  15.  Sulphite of Soda.
      Sulphite of soda is a most valuable reagent, and its action very remark
 able.     It enables us to divide colours into three groups, according as it
 produces a change in an ammoniacal, or acid solution, or in neither. The
 action is related in     a very simple manner to the spectra.          Having added an
  excess   of ammonia, there may be a well-marked broad absorption over more
  or less of the red, orange, yellow, and upper green ; and above this a
  clear transparent space, limited by a variable amount of absorption, ex
  tending downwards from the extreme blue.                   Fig. 2 will illustrate my
  meaning.       In  the  case of one   group  of   colours, the addition of sulphite of
  soda almost immediately removes the detached, broad absorption in the
  lower part of the spectrum, but leaves that at the blue end quite unchanged,
  or only slightly modified by the solution being made more alkaline.                    If,
  then, as in the case of magenta, there is no absorption at the blue end,
  sulphite of soda makes the solution quite colourless ; whereas if the blues
  are absorbed, as in the case of the ammoniacal solutions of the colour of red
  roses, and some species of Bianthus, it changes the colour from green to
  yellow.      If  the absorption extends continuously down from the extreme
   blue to the orange, as often happens when ammonia is added to yellow
   colours, sulphite of soda produces no change. It is only when there is a
   more or less perfect division between         the upper and lower absorption, that
   it has any effect ; and then it simply and entirely removes the lower absorp
   tion.    Some colours are changed immediately, even when a very small
   quantity of sulphite is added; but others require more and change
   gradually, though still very soon.

                             16.    Groups A, B, and C.
   Colours which are thus altered when the solution is ammoniacal, consti
tute my group A.    Frequently, however, sulphite of soda does not remove
the detached absorption when excess of ammonia is present, but does so
when there is an excess                These constitute my group B.
                           of citric acid.                              As
in the other group, any absorption which extends continuously from the
extreme blue end is not altered, but the detached absorption in the green
is almost immediately removed ; and therefore a deep pink or red solution
may at once become quite colourless, or only a very pale yellow ; and in
many cases this residual colour is due to some yellow colouring-matter
mixed with the other.        I
                         have never seen a colour which was changed by
sulphite when alkaline, and not when acid ; and thus citric acid never
restores   the colour when   it         to the changed ammoniacal solution.
                                   is added
Excess of ammonia usually restores the faded acid solution to nearly the
original colour, and it is therefore not a case of actual decomposition, but
merely the result of some remarkable molecular change. A third group of
colours consists of those which are not almost immediately changed by
sulphite of soda, when either alkaline or acid ; and these          I
                                                           call group C.
Some   of them may     fade on keeping several       hours, and some do     not   fade
even in several days, but they cannot thus be divided into two definite groups.
When thus faded, ammonia does not restore the colour            ;   and therefore it
is evidently the effect of decomposition, and not like the mere molecular
change met with in group B.
   On the whole, the groups A, B, and C are remarkably distinct.       There
are, indeed, a few cases where the change takes place somewhat slowly;
and a few scarlet colours do not show very distinctly the characteristic pe
culiarities of either B or C ; but there are other very strong reasons for
believing that some of these are really mixtures of different groups.  Even
if it should be found that perfectly simple colouring-matters may have, as
it were, intermediate characters, such appear to be so rare that practically
they may be classed with mixtures, until some reason be found for classing
them together as exceptions.
   These reactions of sulphite of soda are so much interfered with by the
presence of alcohol, that it should never be employed as a solvent, unless
the substance is insoluble in water ; and then it should be diluted as much
as possible, since   the ordinary spirit of wine with an equal quantity of
water is the extreme strength admissible, and even that very much delays
the reaction. The effect of various other reagents is also sometimes very
different, according to the nature of the solvent.
   The three groups A, B, and C differ in other particulars.     It is easy
to change A or B into C by various reagents which produce decomposi
tion, but I do not know a case where C can be changed into A or B. Caustic
alkalies usually soon decompose colours belonging to group A, when dis
solved in water, but act slowly on those of groups B and C.         Usually
colours of group C are far more permanent than those of groups A and               15,

 all yellows.

    Boracic Acid. — The chief value of this reagent is that it gives nearly
 the same spectrum as that of a neutral solution when added after the
addition of a slight excess of ammonia. It should therefore be well fused
in a platinum crucible and recrystallized, so as to be quite free from any
stronger acid.
    Sulphate   of Iron. — Sulphate of the protoxide of iron is chiefly useful         as
a deoxidizing agent, in the case of blood and a few analogous substances,
taking care to have citric acid present to prevent the precipitation of the
oxide by ammonia *.
    Alum. — Alum     has a remarkable influence on some colours, and             it  has
the property of gradually restoring many after they have passed into the
faded modification.        Many colours also may be kept for a long time dis
solved in a strong solution, sealed up in tubes ; and it is occasionally an
excellent solvent for substances insoluble in either water or alcohol.              The
chief objection to it as a reagent is that the spectra are so much influenced
by the presence of ammonia, even when neutralized by an acid, that it is
almost impossible to compare together different substances               under exactly
the same conditions.
    Iodine and Bromine. — Iodine        dissolved  in alcohol, and bromine in water,
are useful in producing decompositions, which may differ' very considerably
in colours which are otherwise very similar ; as, for example, the yellow
colouring-matters of the root of rhubarb and of turmeric.                The iodine or
bromine should be added in sufficient quantity, and then ammonia used to
remove the excess, and thus avoid the effect of their own colour. The
solution may then be made acid with citric acid, and should in both cases
be compared with another tube to which no iodine or bromine has been
added.
    Hypochlorite of Soda. — This reagent, with or without the addition of
citric acid, is sometimes useful, as for instance in detecting the adulteration
of rhubarb with turmeric ; but generally its action is too powerful and too
uniform.
    Permanganate of Potash. — This also usually acts too powerfully on
colouring-matters.        The excess can easily be removed by sulphite of soda,
which makes an alkaline solution pale yellow, but an acid solution quite
colourless.

    Having now    considered   some     of the chief peculiarities of the most useful
 reagents, I proceed to describe         what   appears to me to be the most con
 venient method of dividing colouring-matters into groups and subgroups,
 so as to enable us to ascertain      the nature   of any particular   substance under

examination.        The number of distinct coloured compounds              met with     in
different plants is so great, that some such classification is imperative. In
the first place, we cannot do better than divide them according as they are
soluble in water or alcohol.          This may be looked upon as a chemical divi
sion, and is very useful in practice.          Thus —
       Soluble in water and not precipitated by alcohol           .... Division   1.
       Soluble in water and precipitated by alcohol                        „      2.
       Insoluble in water but soluble in alcohol                           „      3.
       Insoluble both in water and alcohol                                 ,,     4.
Of   course cases occur which cannot be unhesitatingly classed with any one
of these;       but they often form good practical divisions, and necessarily
modify     the   methods requisite for further examination.
                       19. Method and Order        of Experiment    .
    If a colour belongs to division 1, a small quantity, sufficient for three
or four experiments, should be exposed to the vapour of ammonia in a
watch-glass, until there is certainly no longer any free acid, and then
gently evaporated, so that all excess of ammonia may be lost.                 If not thus
made neutral we might be entirely misled ; for some pink colours are blue*
reddened      by an acid. A small quantity should then be dissolved in water
in one of the small experiment-tubes and the spectrum observed.                    If  too
little colour has been added to give the characteristic spectrum, more
should     be  introduced    ; but if any part is entirely absorbed, the cell should
be turned sideways,        in order to see whether or no some narrow absorption-
band occurs there ;         and then it may be desirable to remove some of the
solution, and fill up the cell with water.         As a general rule, so much colour
should be added as to make the darkest part of the spectrum decidedly
shaded, but yet not so black as to hide any narrow bands ; and if any
occur, the solution should be made of such a strength as to show them to
the greatest advantage.           This can easily be done, after a little practice,
and is made much easier by being able to turn the tubes sideways. Having
noted the spectrum of the neutral solution, a very small quantity of am
 monia should be added, and then a decided excess, the spectra being
 examined      to see if there   be any difference   ; for this is very often the    case
 and very important facts may be overlooked            if too great an excess be added
 at first.    The addition of      a   small bit of sulphite of soda then shows at
 once whether or no a colour belonging to group A is present ; and on
 adding excess of citric acid we may also determine whether it chiefly
 belongs to groups B or C.              Ammonia should then be added in excess,
 which may or may not restore it to the same state as before the addition
 of the acid. To another portion of colour carbonate of soda should be
  added, and then excess       of citric acid, both spectra being carefully observed      ;
  and finally sulphite of soda, which definitely shows whether or no there
 is anv other colour than one belonging to group C.              Combining the results

of the two sets of experiments, we may decide whether it belongs to groups
A, B, or C, or is a mixture of any of them. If the substance is insoluble
in water but soluble in alcohol, the same experiments should be made, only
we must add the colour dissolved in alcohol to            as   much water        as can be used
without making the solution turbid, and must remember how much the
presence of alcohol may interfere with the action of some of the reagents.
    Another portion of the neutral colour should then be dissolved in as
strong alcohol as will give a clear solution, and ammonia, benzoic acid, a
little citric acid,. and much of it added one after the other; and all the
spectra carefully observed,         as   well as any other facts which may present
themselves.
   By thus using three separate quantities of colour, and adding reagents
one after the other, we may obtain about a dozen spectra, which may differ
from one another in important particulars, or in some few cases may be all
alike. The experiments                                             of twelve
                                 are so easily made, that the whole series
spectra may be seen in the space of five minutes ; and the total quantity of
material need not in some cases be more than 16'60 of a grain. The facts
thus learned may show that for particular practical purposes some different
method could be employed with advantage, and that only one or two simple
experiments are needed.     For example, suspected blood-stains should be
treated in an entirely different manner, as described in my Paper on that
        * ; and in
subject            examining dark-coloured wines, in order to form some
opinion of their age from the relative quantity of the colour belonging to
group C, gradually formed by the alteration of the original colouring-
matter of the grape belonging to group B, it is only requisite to observe
the effect of sulphite of soda after the addition of citric acid. It would,
however, extend this Paper beyond the limits I have prescribed to myself,
if I   were to enter into practical applications, and     I shall therefore merely
give   a   description of   a   convenient method of grouping the various colours.
                                         20. Subgroups.
  Since the narrow absorption-bands are decidedly the most important
means  of identification, it appears to me that we cannot do better than
adopt subdivisions founded on their number.     We may thus divide each
group A, B, and C into subgroups, in which the neutral aqueous solu
tions exhibit 0, 1,2, 3, &c. decided absorption- bands. Sometimes one of
them may be so obscure that we may hesitate whether it should be counted
or not ; but practically this is no very serious objection, if we decide to
reckon only distinct bands, and to look on the fainter as important merely
in identifying individual colours.             If
                                        no absorption-band can be seen in
the neutral solution, we may take into account those seen when more or
less ammonia is added ; and          if none   occur in either case, we may make use
of those seen in the alcoholic solution when neutral, and after the addition
of ammonia. Whenever in this order of experiments the solution gives

Such spectra are at once seen to differ most decidedly when compared side
by side ; and that the colouring-matters are entirely different is proved by
other facts.  If the absorption-bands agree very closely, we ought to com
pare other spectra before concluding that the substances are the same.

   Of      course,        if    any impurity             is present which absorbs                       that part of the
spectrum where the characteristic bands occur, it may be difficult, or even
impossible, to determine the nature of the substance ; but the rest of the
spectrum may be obscured, and the general colour entirely changed, without
the least difficulty being thereby produced. Thus, for example, on adding
a solution of Saffron (Crocus sativus) to that of the blue Lobelia, the
colour is       changed              from blue to             a   curious olive,             and    the      spectrum be

454 Mr. H. C. Sorby                 on    Analysis of Animal and Vegetable [Apr. 11,
to have recourse to the position and character                                   of the     general absorption. This
requires    a good deal       of    care, since a difference                             in the state of the solution
may make         the same colour           than two quite distinct colours.

                       number of experiments,
parison are those obtained by adding first a moderate excess of carbonate
of soda, and then a considerable excess of citric acid. Both of these solu
tions change very slowly, and give well-marked spectra ; whereas ammonia
often causes decomposition, and weaker   alkalies or acids give much more
faint spectra, or such         as       rapidly fade.                 Closely related colours should                            be
compared        together,    and made as nearly equal as possible after the addition
of   the carbonate, and then citric acid added in considerable,  and nearly
equal, excess.   We thus can compare two different spectra ; and even if
the position of the absorption is the same in both cases, the relative inten
sity may vary considerably.      Very closely allied colours may often be
easily distinguished in this manner, and the only great difficulty is when
coloured impurities are present.                         As     an example,                 I   give some colours be

The first    differs entirely from the latter two, but they are so similar that                                                it
requires    great care to be sure that, they differ essentially.       were quite                    If   it
certain that such colours were pure,   would not be difficult to distinguish
                                                          it
them with confidence      but since they may contain coloured impurities,
                              ;
we must occasionally be content with results somewhat doubtful in ques
tions of minute detail, which might not be of the least importance in some
practical investigations.
                                         24.        Yellow Colours.
     One of the best general               methods of distinguishing yellow colours                                        be
longing     to subgroup            C,   aq0 am0 al0 am0, or those with bands which                                         are
much alike,    to make them as nearly as possible of the same tint when
                  is
neutral, and then to add excess of ammonia, which may make them very
unequal.        For    example     —
                                                                                 Neutral.                 Ammonia.
Yellow Dahlia (D. variabilis)                                            8   .
                                                                             .    9 - - 10      —    3...4--4£—
Yellow Calceolaria       (  C. aurea-floribunda)                         7...9--11 —                 6|   . .   6|    - - 7—

The action of ammonia    thus shows that they differ very much, but at the
same time the Calceolaria might be        mixture of the other two, and this
                                                              a
would have to be decided                by
                             other facts.

                            25.  Fading of Group C.
    Sometimes  in examining colours of group C, advantage       may be taken   of
the different rate at which their acid solutions decompose and fade, when
a considerable quantity of sulphite of soda has been added to an acid solu
tion..   The two solutions should be     made as nearly equal as possible in all
respects, and then the rate of fading     may prove that they are very different,
or may show that one is a mixture.         After fading, the addition of excess
of ammonia may show valuable facts.         For example, the colour of the root
of the red beet (Beta vulgaris) is pink, but that of the leaves is red ; the
spectrum differing from that of the root merely in having the blue end
much absorbed.       On keeping acid solutions of both to which sulphite of
soda has been added, that of the root becomes colourless, and that of the
leaves yellow ; and thus, considering that acid solutions of colours be
longing to group C are very rarely pink, it is almost certain that the
colour of the leaves is the same as that of the root, but modified by the
yellow colour so common in leaves.
                                  26. Conclusion.
   Such, then, is a general  outline of the method which   I have hitherto found
the most convenient in studying different colouring-matters,         and  for de
termining to what individual species any particular colour may belong.          I
 need hardly say that it is just the sort of qualitative analysis to employ
in detecting adulterations in many substances met with in commerce, as well
as  in inquiries where very small quantities of material are at command.
By this method we might be able in a few minutes to form a very satisfac
tory opinion, or at least one that might meet all practical requirements, and
even under unfavourable circumstances we might narrow the inquiry to a
 surprising extent ; and if this can be said even now, surely further research
 cannot fail to make it most useful in cases where ordinary chemical
 analysis would be of little or no use.

         ceived April 8, 1867.
   When a solid figure is brought too near the object-glass of a camera
obscura, the difference of focus for its various planes is comparatively so
great, that it is impossible that all the images should be equally well de
fined.  Hence, in the case of photographic portraiture, there is a want of
harmony in the representation of the various parts ; some are too sharplr
delineated, and some others are confused in proportion as they are mote
and more distant from the plane in focus.       But there is another        defect   which
is the consequence of the difference of distance of the various planes bear
ing too great a proportion to the distance of the whole, which is that
the nearest parts of the figure are too much enlarged, and the furthest too
 much reduced.
   In a paper I read at the British Association at Nottingham in 1866, 1
proposed a plan to obviate these defects, which consisted in bringing
                                                                                           all
the planes consecutively into focus,       by
                                          moving, during the exposure, the
tube of the lens or the back frame of the camera  the consequence of which
                                                           ;
was, of course, that the planes were also during that movement brougi'
out of focus    so that
                   ;      sharp image of every plane was impressed upon
                             a
a  confused image; but they were all in the same degree in that mild
state, and the result was an equality of effect producing harmony       the          in
whole, and that kind of softness in the picture so much approved
artists, as resembling, more than the sharpest photographs, the effect that
they aim at producing.

1867.]         Mr. Claudet on   a   Focus-Equalizer    for Photography.               457
   The original simple idea of equalizing the focus of the various planes by
moving either the frame holding the plate, or the tube of the lens, during
the exposure had, it appears, occurred to several persons engaged in photo
graphic pursuits (of which      I
                               was not aware before reading my paper) ; but
it is certain that the plan had never been practically and generally adopted,
and that, at all events, no specimens of the process had at any time been
exhibited in public, probably because it presented several difficulties which
could not be easily overcome. The greatest of these difficulties I soon
found during my investigations, which was that, in changing the focal
distances merely by moving the frame or the tube, the size of the various
superposed images was unavoidably reduced or increased according to the
alteration of focus during the movement applied.
   Therefore     I
                turned my attention to the means   which might be found
capable of avoiding this defect, and a fortunate idea presented itself, by
which     I
         found that it was possible to preserve the size of the various
images during the adaptation of the focus to the different planes of the
figure.
  The desideratum was, when changing the focus, to increase the power of
the double lens for the planes the most distant and to reduce it for tLe
nearest planes.  At first this seemed to be an impossibility. But in con
sidering the subject attentively,         I
                                   was suddenly struck with the fact that
the power of any double combination of lenses being proportionate to the
distance which separates the two lenses greater when they are more sepa
rated, and smaller when they are less separated, it was possible to alter the
power of the combination by changing the distance between the two lenses.
  Therefore,      if,
                instead of moving the whole tube containing the two lenses,
we move only the back lens nearer the plate, when we waut to focus for
more distant planes, we increase at the same time the power of the double
combination, and consequently the size of the image and      we move the
                                                               ;         if
lens further from the plate, when we want to focus for the nearest planes,
in doing so,      by
              reducing the separation of the two lenses, we reduce the
power of the combination, and consequently also the size of the image,

to equalize the definition of the various planes, but at the same time to
equalize the size of their images, and consequently to avoid the exaggeration
of perspective by which the         nearest planes are increased,    and the furthest
disproportionately  reduced, a' defect which          is   so detrimental to the ap
pearance of large photographs.

mathematical point of view, and being unable from indisposition to go
himself into the subject, he charged his step-son, Dr. Sommer, Professor of
Mathematics       at the Carolinian   College of Brunswick,        well versed in all the
                                                                         2   q2

questions of optical photography, to calculate the result of the gradual
increase and reduction of the power of the double combination, in con
junction with the alteration of focus. Dr. Sommer entered thoroughly
into the subject, and soon sent me a series of elaborate formulae, showing
that, although for all practical purposes in photography the movement of
one  of the two lenses, as I had proposed, fulfilled the object I had in view,
still he found that a more scientific consideration of the subject called
for a modification in my plan ; which was that, instead of moving only one
of the lenses, the same degree of their separation should be imparted by
moving the two lenses in contrary directions from the fixed centre of the
combination, and in different proportions, according to the distance of the
object.  These differential proportions were indicated in a table calculated
by  Dr. Sommer  which he sent me.
  This    presented                   and unexpected problem, the solution
                       another difficult
of which     was indeed most perplexing.   But I did not like that it should be
said that my plan was not completely     in accordance with the mathematical
laws of optics ; and I set to work at finding a mechanical means by which 1
could avail myself of the scientific calculations of Dr. Sommer.
  I    have found such means  ; and it turns out indeed that by my mechanical
construction the differential movement can be effected, not only as readily
and easily, but with a greater command and steadiness than by moving
only one lens. The following is a description of the arrangement : —
                       Description   of the Focus- Equalizer.
  The tube, containing at each end the lenses A and B, is divided into
two parts, sliding in the principal tube S S S S fixed in the front of the
camera at V V.
 Each tube has    strong pin, L and L'. These two pins are intended to push
                   a

                                                                     P
of a rack and pinion moved by      handle a  on the axis R. While the
                                                   V
sextant moves in the line  F, the two slits will act on the two pins, and
                                P
gradually increase the separation of the tubes     and on making the sextant
                                                     ;
move back   from  P' to    P,
                          the slits will bring the two pins nearer each other,
and decrease the separation of the tubes.
  It will thus be easily understood how we can increase and reduce the
separation of the two lenses from the centre of the combination    but        ;
we have  now to explain how we can produce the differential movement
according to the mathematical formulae calculated by Dr. Sommer.
  The arc of the sextant   divided into 100 parts, in two rows one against
                                is
the other.     The divisions     on the outer limb     have   their zero on the left,

  Now, supposing that by the table of Dr. Sommer the lens A for a
certain distance of the object should move 0-235, and the lens £ 0-765 of
the whole space by which the lenses require to be separated or approxi
mated, we turn the endless screw until the index is on the 23| division of
the inside scale, and of course on the 76]- division of the outside scale.
   In that position of the sextant the slits M M and M' M', by means of the
pins attached to the tubes of the lens A and of the lens B, will make them
accordingly move — A in the proportion of 0-235, and B in the proportion
of 0-765    of the   whole space.
    Iffor another distance the lens A should have to move 0-333, and the
lens B 0-666, setting both limbs of the sextant to these divisions, the lens
A will move \, and the lens B § of the whole space.
    If we
        wanted to move the two lenses in the same proportion, the sextant
should be set so that the 50th division of both scales should be under the
index.

and the zero of the scale should be placed under the index,   which that  by

the other.

     Although the practical and natural classification of the Madreporara
 (Sclerodermic Zoantharia) which has been submitted by MM. Milne-
 Edwards and Jules Haime is very generally admitted to be the best, still
 there are great gaps in the succession of the genera, and, moreover, some
 genera cannot be placed.
     The "break"    between the Turbinolides       and the Astraeides is so   great as
 to render the classification rather artificial    ; but Dr. Duncan's   discovery of
 a genus     Atterosmilia,  comprising several species, unites these great
 divisions.   The new genus has the peculiarities of the Trochocyathi, but in
 addition it is furnished with an endotheca. The species are described.
    The genera Heterophyllia, McCoy, and Battersbyia, Milne-Edwards and
 Jules Haime, are amongst those incertee sedis. The discovery of several
 new species of Heterophyllia enables Dr. Duncan to determine the anatomy
 of the genus, to offer for consideration the most extraordinary coral form
 he has ever seen, and to ally the genus with Battersbyia, which he proves
 had no coenenchyma.       The species of both of the genera are described
shortly, and the development and reproduction of B. gemman* also. The
genera are placed amongst the Astrseidae.
    The   genus   Palaocyclus, M.-E. &     J. H., supposed to       be  one of     the
Fungidee, is proved to be a vesiculo-tubulate coral genus, and to          be one of
the Cyathophyllidae.
    One Mesozoic family is therefore removed from the Palaeozoic coral-fauna,
and two genera of a Mesozoic division are introduced.            They   foreshadow
the Theeosmiliae of the Trias.

    The skull of Hatteria is distinguished by the following characters :—
    1. Persistence of the sutures, especially of those between the lateral
nalves of the skull, combined with great development of its ossified parts,
as it appears in the expanse of the bones forming the upper surface of the
facial portion, in the completeness of an orbital ring with a temporal and
zygomatic bar (Crocodilia), in the much expanded columella, in the            nearly
completely osseous bottom of the orbit, and roof of the palate.

1867.]            Dr. Giinther on   the  Anatomy   of Hatteria.             461
    2. Sutural union    of the tympanic with the skull ; firm and solid union
of the   bones  of the palate with the tympanic, as shown by the sutural con
nexion of tympanic and pterygoid, broad sutural connexion of the colu
mella with tympanic and pterygoid, immoveable pterygo-sphenoid joint,
firm and extensive attachment of pterygoid to ectopterygoid.
    3. This restriction of the mobility of the bones named is compensated
by an increased and modified mobility of the lower jaw, the mandibles
being united by ligament, and provided with a much elongate articular
surface.
    4. Displacement of the palatine bones, which are separated by the pter
ygoids, and replace a palatal portion of the maxillaries.
    5. Perforation of the tympanic; extremely short postarticular process of
the mandible.
    The vertebral column     and the remainder    of the skeleton show the   fol
lowing peculiarities : —
     1. Vertebrae   amphiccefian ; caudal vertebras vertically divided into two
 equal halves.     Points of minor importance are the uniform development
 of strong neural spines, and the direction of the caudal pleurapophyses
 which point forwards.
    2. The costal haemapophyses       are modified, first,  into a series of ap
 pendages identical in position with the uncinate processes of birds ; and
 secondly, into a double terminal series connecting the ribs with the tho
 racic and abdominal sterna, the distal pieces being much dilated and
 forming the base of a system of muscles (retractors of the abdominal ribs).
    3. The development of a system of abdominal ribs, standing in intimate
 and functional relation to the ventral integuments.
    4. Continuity of the ossification of the coracoid ; presence of an acro
 mial tuberosity of the scapula ; sub vertical direction of the os ilium.
    5. The arrangement of the bones of the limbs and their muscles does
not show any deviation from the Lacertian type.
    The dentition of Hatteria is unique. That of young examples differs
scarcely from the dentition of other acrodont lizards.        In adult examples
the intermaxillaries are armed with a pair of large cutting-teeth ; a part of
the lateral teeth are lost, and the alveolar edges of the jaws are cutting and
highly polished, performing the function of teeth. A series of palatine
teeth is in close proximity and parallel to the maxillary series, both series
receiving between them in a groove the similarly serrated edge of the
mandible.
    As regards the organs of sense, the absence of the pecten of the eye and
of the tympanic cavity, the commencement of a spiral turn of the cochlea,
and the attachment of the hyoid bone to the terminal cartilage of the
stapes— are to be noticed.
   The structure of the heart and of the organs of respiration and circu
lation are of the Lacertian type.
   The   absence  of a copulatory organ is a character by which     Hatteria  is

   The present memoir relates to portions only of the subject of the         curves
which    satisfy given conditions ; but any other title would be too narrow :
the question chiefly considered is that of finding the number of the
curves which satisfy given conditions ; the curves are either curves of a
determinate order r (and in this case the conditions chiefly considered are
conditions of contact with a given curve), or else the curves are conies ; and
here (although the conditions chiefly considered are conditions of contact
with  a  given curve or curves) it is necessary to consider more than in the
former case the theory of conditions of any kind whatever.               As regards
the theory of conies, the memoir is based upon the researches of Chasles
and Zeuthen, as regards that of the curves of the order r, upon the re
searches of De Jonquieres : the notion of the quasi-geometrical represen
tation of conditions by means of loci in hyper-space is employed by Salmon
in his   researches relating to the quadric surfaces which satisfy given con
ditions.    The papers containing the researches referred to are included in
a list subjoined.      I  reserve for a separate   second  memoir the application

satisfy given conditions ; these are conditions of contact with a given
curve, or they may include              arbitrary conditions   Z, 2Z, &c.   If, for   a mo
ment, we consider the more general question where the    Principle is to be
applied to finding the number of the curves Cr of the order r, which satisfy
given conditions of contact with a given curve, there are here two kinds
of special solutions ; viz., we may have proper curves Cr touching (spe
cially) the given curve at a cusp or cusps thereof, and we may have im
proper curves, that       is,
                       curves which break up into two or more curves of
inferior orders.  In the case where the curves Cr are lines, there only           is
the firstkind of special solution, where the sought for lines touch at                     a
cusp or  cusps. But in the case to which the memoir chiefly relates,

       &c., Conservator of the Museum of the Royal College of Sur
       geons of England.
                                      (Abstract.)
    Although the dentition of adult individuals of all the animals which         con
stitute the remarkable Order or, rather, Subclass Marsupialia, has been
 repeatedly subjected to examination, and described with exhaustive miuutt-
 ness  of detail, it is a singular circumstance that most of those peculiarities
 in the succession of their teeth which distinguish them from other mammals
appear hitherto to have escaped observation.           To supply this blank is the
object of the present communication.            Fortunately the materials at my
 disposal, although not quite so complete as might be desired, are yet
amply sufficient to illustrate the main aspects of the question, and to
supply    a result as interesting as it was unexpected.
    Descriptions are given in the paper, accompanied by drawings, of several
stages of the dentition of members of each of the six natural families into
which the order is divided.
    1.  Macropodidae. —The dentition of the Kangaroo (genus Maeroput),
from the completely edentulous foetus to adult age, is described in detail.
Contrary to what has been specially stated with regard to this genus, there
are no deciduous or milk-incisors, the teeth of this group which are first
formed and calcified in both jaws being those which are retained throughout
the life of the animal.       The rudimentary canine and first premolar have
also no deciduous predecessors.       The second tooth of the molar series (a true
molar in form) is vertically displaced by a premolar.         The four true molars
have,   as  has  long  been  known,   no deciduous    predecessors.     There is thus
but one tooth on each side of each jaw in which the phenomenon of diphyo-
dont succession occurs.        The period at which this takes place varies in
different species of the family.       In some forms of Hypnprymnut, the suc-
cessional premolar     is not cut until  after the last true molar is in place and
use,  — this probably having relation to the extraordinary size of the tooth,
and the time consequently required- for its development.           A special charac
teristic of this family is the tendency to lose the canine and one or both
premolars at a comparatively early period of life.
    2. Phalangistidee.    — Several early stages of the dentition of Phalangitta
vulpina are described and figured.        In  a young specimen      in which no teeth
had cut the gum, the crowns of the permanent incisors, canine, and first
two molars were found to be calcified, and the germ of the permanent pre
molar was already formed beneath the milk- or deciduous molar, which, as
in Maeroput, is the only tooth which is shed and replaced by a successor.
The change takes place at an earlier period than in the last family.

adolescent      specimens of this genus and of Chceropus show that a very
minute, compressed, molariform tooth is replaced by the triangular, pointed,
third or posterior premolar.          No other signs of vertical displacement and
succession     were observed.
   4. Didelphidce. — In the American genus Didelphys, the observations are
complete from the earliest stage, and show that, as in the Australian Ma-
eropodidce      and Phalangistidee,     none  of the teeth of the permanent       series
have   predecessors      except the compressed pointed last premolar, which
replaces   a   tooth   having the broad multicuspidate crown of a true molar.
   This change does not occur until the animal approaches the adult age.
   5. Datyuridee. — In a foetal Thylacinus, in which no teeth had cut the
gum, the crowns of the permanent incisors, canines, premolars, and ante
rior true molars were partially calcified, and necessarily much crowded
together in the jaw. A very minute rudimentary molar was situated just
beneath     the alveolar mucous membrane, superficially to the apex of the
hindermost premolar, and was evidently its milk-predecessor.
    6. Pkascolomyidce.       —This    family is placed last because the observations
regarding it are less complete than in the case of any of the others.               The
youngest     Wombat      available   presented  no  evidence  of succession  of  any of
the teeth    ;   but it is probable that the single premolar is preceded by a
milk-molar,       at a still earlier period than any examined.
    From the foregoing observations it may be concluded with tolerable
safety that the animals of the Order Marsupialia present a peculiar condi
tion of dental succession, uniform throughout the order, and distinct from
that   of all other mammals.            This peculiarity     may  be thus   briefly ex
pressed.       The teeth of Marsupials do not vertically displace and succeed
other   teeth,    with the exception of a single tooth on each side of each jaw.
The tooth in which a vertical succession takes place is always the corre
sponding OT homologous tooth, being the hindermost of the premolar series*,
which is preceded by a tooth having the characters, more or less strongly
expressed, of a true molar.
    It has been usual to divide the class Mammalia, in regard to the mode of
formation and succession of theirteeth, into two groups — the Monophyodonts,
or those that generate a single set of teeth, and the Diphyodonts, or those
that generate two sets of teeth ; but even in the most typical diphyodonts
the successional process does not extend to the whole of the teeth, always
stopping short of those situated most posteriorly in each series.                   The
Marsupials occupy an intermediate position, presenting as it were a rudi
mentary diphyodont condition, the successional process being confined to a
single tooth on each side of each jaw.             This position, however, is by no
means without analogy among the mammals of the placental series.                      In
the Dugong         and the existing Elephants the successional process is limited
   * The convenient distinction between false molars or premolars and true molars, is
always well     marked in the form of the crown, especially in the upper jaw, in the
Harsupiala.

to the incisor teeth.       It   is questionable whether the first premolar       of those
animals of this group which have four premolar teeth, as the Hog, Dog (man
dible), &c, ever has a deciduous predecessor, at all events so far advanced
as to have reached the calcified stage.  But the closest analogy with the
marsupial mode of succession is found among the Rodents. Here the incisors
appear to have no deciduous predecessors ; and in the Beaver, Porcupine,
and others, which have but four teeth of the molar series, ». e. three true
molars and oue premolar, the latter           is,
                                         exactly as in the Marsupials, the
only tooth which succeeds     deciduous tooth.
                                  a               The analogy, howeTer, does
not hold in those Rodents which have more than one premolar, as the Hare                  ;
for in this case each of these teeth has its deciduous predecessor.
     In the preceding account     I   have used the term
                                                             " permanent " for those
teeth which remain in use throughout           the animal's life, or,   if   they fall ont
(as do the rudimentary canines and the premolars of the Macropodida),
do not give place to successional teeth and have therefore assumed that
                                              ;       I
the milk or temporary dentition of the typical diphyodont mammals         re        is
presented in the Marsupials only by the deciduous molars.     It may be held,
on the other hand, that the large majority of the teeth of the Marsupials are
the homologues of the milk or first teeth of the diphyodonts, and that               it   is
the permanent or second dentition which       so feebly represented by the
                                                    is is
four successional  premolars.   This view     supported              by
                                                              many general
analogies   in
             animal organization and development,  such as the fact that the
permanent state of organs of lower animals often represents the immature
or transitional condition of the same parts in beings of higher organization.
   Looking only       to the period   of development of the different teeth in       some
of the marsupial      genera,    we might certainly be disposed to place         the suc
cessional premolar in   series by itself, although, indeed, all its morphological
                          a
characters point   out its  congruity with the row of teeth among which                  it
ultimately takes its place, the reverse being the case with its predecessor.
It     however, almost impossible, after examining the teeth of the young
      is,
Thylacine described and figured in the paper, to resist the conclusion
originally suggested.   The unbroken series of incisors, canines, premolars,
and anterior true molars  of nearly the same phase of development, with
posterior molars gradually added as age advances, form   striking contrast
                                                                 a
to the temporary molar, so rudimental in size, and transient in duration.
I   can scarcely doubt    that the true molars of this animal would             be iden
tified by every one as homologous with the true molars of the diphyodonts,
which are generally regarded as belonging to the permanent series, although
they never have deciduous predecessors.     Now,    the homology between
                                                            if
the  true molars of the Thylacine and those of         Dog, for instance, be
                                                            a
granted, and    the anterior teeth (incisors, canines, and premolars) of the
                 if
Thylacine be of the same series as its own true molars, they must also be
homologous with the corresponding permanent teeth of the Dog.
  It may be objected to this argument, that the true molars of the diphyo
donts, not being successional teeth, ought to be regarded as members of the

1867.]         and Succession    of the Teeth   in the  Marsupialia.          467
first or milk-  series ; but, in truth, the fact that they    have themselves no
predecessors    does   not  make    them serially homologous with the prede
cessors of the other teeth, while their morphological characters, as well as
their habitual persistence throughout life, range them with the second or
permanent series.
     We have been so long accustomed to look upon the second set of teeth as
an after-development or derivative from the first, that it appears almost
paradoxical to suggest that the milk- or deciduous teeth may rather be a
set superadded to supply the temporary needs of mammals of more complex
dental organization.      But it should be remembered that, instead of there
being any such relation between the permanent and the milk-teeth as that
expressed by the terms "progeny" and "parent" (sometimes applied to
them), they are both (if all recent researches into their earlier development
can be trusted) formed side by side from independent portions of the pri
mitive dental groove, and may rather be compared to twin.brothers, one of
which, destined for early functional activity, proceeds rapidly in its develop
ment, while the other makes little progress until the time approaches when
it is called upon to take the place of its more precocious locum tenens.
    Many facts appear to point to the milk-teeth as being the less constant
and important of the two sets developed in diphyodont dentition.            Among
these the most striking is the frequent occurrence of this set in a rudimen
tary and functionless or, as it were, partially developed state.        The milk-
premolars of some Eodents (as         the  Guinea-pig),  shed while the animal is
in utero, the simple structure and evanescent nature of the milk-teeth of
the Bats, Insectivores, and Seals, the diminutive first incisors of the
Dugongs and Elephants, all appear to be cases in point.              On the other
hand, examples of the commencing or sketching out, as it were, of the
successors to a well-formed, regular, and functional first set of teeth, are
rarely, if ever, met with. Occasional instances of the habitual early deca
dence, or, perhaps, absence of some of the second or so-called permanent
teeth occur in certain animals ; but these are rather examples of the disap
pearance or suppression of organs of which there is no need in the economy,
and chiefly occur in isolated and highly modified members of groups in
the other members of which the same phenomenon does not occur, as in
Cheiromys among the Lemurs, Trichechus among the Seals, and the
recent Elephants (as regards the premolars) among the Proboscideans.
They form no parallel to the cases mentioned above of the rudimentary
formation of an entire series of teeth of the temporary or milk-set.

    To return to the marsupials : — this view be correct, I should be quite
prepared to find, in phases of development earlier than those yet examined,
some traces either of the papillary, follicular, or saccular stages of milk-
predecessors to other of the teeth besides those determinate four in which,
for some    reason at present unexplained, they arrive at a more mature
growth*.      Such proof as this would alone decide the truth of these specu-

      1.   In a paper " On Stream-Lines," published in                 the Philosophical Ma
gazine for October 1864,                  1   stated, and, in a Supplement to the same paper,
published in the Philosophical                       Magazine for January 1865, I proved the
proposition that
                  " all waves in which molecular rotation is hull begin to
break when the .two slopes of the crest meet at right angles."
   2. I have now to state the purely geometrical proposition of which that
mechanical proposition is a consequence.                                 If a plane    curve which          fulfil*
the        condition       -r-? + -t-j =^           cuts     itself in    a double    point,     it   does so at

right angles.
   3. The following is the demonstration.   It is well known that the incli
nation of any plane curve to the axes at 'an ordinary point is given by the
equation

of the two branches to the                    axes are given by the two roots               of the quadratic
equation
whence it follows that the product of the two values of                                      which        are the

  Professor Stokes, D.C.L., has pointed out to me an extension of the pre
ceding theorem, viz. that at every multiple point in a plane curve which
                                                  =0, the branches             make          equal angles with

Let    0 be the angle made by any branch with the axis                               of x     ;    then

But in    a   curve which fulfils the equation —?+ — =0,                      ?              we have

 III. " A     Tabular Form of Analysis, to aid in tracing the Possible In
         fluence of Past and Present upon future states of Weather."                By
         S. Elliott Hoskins, F.R.S., &c.               Received March 28, 1867.
     The data upon which the present communication is founded are derived
 from the ' Greenwich Reports,' from Mr. Glaisher's papers in the Philo
sophical Transactions, and from my own observations at Guernsey.                   The
latter were commenced in the autumn of 1842, in accordance with the re
commendations of the Committee               of Physics of the Royal Society, and
were taken at the request        of Professor Daniell, by whom the instruments
employed were selected.         These instruments, made by Newman, were after
a time replaced by others, at the suggestion             of Mr. Glaisher, by whom
they were compared with the standards at the Royal Observatory.
     For my own guidance in the first instance, I sought to arrange the re
sults thus obtained in such a manner as to discover, if possible, whether
any month or class of months stood to each other in the relation of cause
and effect ; in other words, whether the atmospheric conditions of autumn
exercised      any distinguishable     influence upon the fruitful       or unfruitful
character of ensuing seasons.
     In order to attain this object, the principle seemed to be that of con
 densing within narrow limits, by means of intelligible symbols, as many
elements of weather, in the popular acceptation of the word, as might be
required.       But the ordinary curvilinear       form of diagram could not be so
modified as to answer this purpose, and          I therefore  availed myself of a plan
suggested     by   Mr. Galton : — that of converting the records of observations
into appropriate signs, and placing them compactly in a series of squares.
     Upon this principle the annexed diagrams* are constructed, comprising
those elements of weather which more directly affect vegetation ; viz. heat,
cold, dryness, moisture, and their combinations.               The same kind of pre
paratory steps      were  taken  for the   compilation  of  the  Greenwich as for the
Guernsey diagram, so as to render the results comparable — less, perhaps,
for the sake of mere comparison, than for the purpose of testing the value
of the latter by means of an accredited standard.
    The first    process consisted in copying out the degrees        of monthly   mean
temperature, the number of rainy days, and the days of wind, from four
directions, intermediate to the cardinal points.          These several copies being
verified, the monthly average of each of the above elements for twenty
years, from 1843 to 1862, was taken.
    The next step was to obtain the difference between the adopted average
and the mean of each month in every year.                 By prefixing the plus and
minus signs to the resulting figures, the excess and defect of each element
is shown.
    The third     process  was to separate     the above-mentioned series of years

into two decennial periods or decades, and then to compute, not only the
number of months above and below the average, but also the degrees of
 temperature.         (See Tables I., II., III., V. and VI. in the Appendix.)
      Lastly, the numerals thence derived were converted into simple and
 familiar signs, which were then delineated upon a sheet of sectional paper,
accurately engraved according to scale. A square space was allotted to each
of the months, and they were laid down as abscissas, with the years for
ordinates.        (See Diagrams I. and II. (Archives).)
     The light     squares    in the diagrams denote warmth, the degrees being
expressed by a modification of the plus sign, in red ink; the dark, or
shaded squares indicate cold, and the degrees are marked in black ink
with the minus sign.            Black dots indicate the number of rainy days above
the     average,   and red dots the number below       it. The diagonal lines from
the     centre of each square show the direction and days of predominant
wind, one-sixteenth of an inch being equivalent to five days beyond the
mean ; the red lines are associated with dryness, and the black with
moisture. It may be necessary to explain that, as regards rainfall, frequency,
rather than quantity, was selected as a criterion. That is to say, the number
of days on which rain fell rather than the number of inches collected by
the pluviometer        ; for it not unfrequently happens that a few heavy showers
yield a greater amount of water than many days of gentle rain of long
continuance.
     The combined signs in the above arrangement are intended to represent
four different states of weather, viz. warm + dry ; warm + wet ; cold + dry ;
and cold + wet.
     If the  sectional paper be large enough to admit of blank spaces being
left, the signs of the weather may be delineated therein as each month
elapses ; and thus the diagram becomes a sort         of  register, and an ever-ready
table    of reference.
     For   instance,     by running the eye along the vertical columns of the
Guernsey diagram, to which            I  must confine myself for the present, the
existing state of the weather can easily be compared with that of corre
sponding months, up to 1843 ; and by following each horizontal line of
 squares the character of each year may as readily be ascertained.               Thus
we shall find, on comparing the September of 1865 with that of preceding
 years, that    it  was the hottest and the driest   of the whole   series.  On look
 ing along the ordinate corresponding to 1846,          it will be   seen that during
 eleven months         of that year the temperature       was   uniformly   above  the
 adopted average.
     On taking      a general view of this diagram, after its completion, a very
 cursory glance sufficed to show me that a striking difference existed in the
  distribution of light and shade.        On closer inspection, it became manifest
  that the number of light squares in the one decade exactly counter
  balanced the dark squares in the other ; so that the warm months              of the
  first period were in direct ratio to the cold months of the second.

   These contrasts,               quite unlooked for by me, were all the more surprising,
as the data employed had been taken as they came,                    and not selected for
the purpose of supporting any preconceived notion.         It seemed to me,
therefore, that this kind of diagram, besides serving as a convenient table
of reference, was a collection of materials prepared and classified for further
analysis.       Under this impression I proceeded to decompose      and to re                              it,
arrange       the products     tabular form* — converting into letters of the
                                       in   a
alphabet the combined signs in the squares, so as to designate the four
states of weather, before mentioned, as follows: — = warm    dry, B=                         A             +
warm wet +     =  cold dry, and
                    ;    C        =  cold wet.

  These letters were then placed in columns under the heads of months
and years   the number of times in which each letter recurred was noted,
                ;
and these numerals, which may be termed coefficients                                              of the    sums.of          the
letters,      were collected            in   lines and columns, those                       of the months at                 the
foot, and those            of the     years at the sides             of   a   table    of analysis. See Table                17.
   When the              coefficients       of   the whole series                  were      thus placed in juxtapo
sition,    it   was satisfactory to find that the general                                   contrasts, noticed    the  in

Howard, in his 'Cycle of the Seasons,' from 1821 to 1841, namely, the
intrusion of one cold year in the warm, and one warm year                                                      ill   the cold
cycle.
   On examining the coefficients more in detail, in the hope of being able
to detect some groupof months which seemed to bear        peculiar relation                        a

between the wet and dry.

  nuary, February, March, and April are also reversed, being 4 to 6, instead
  of6to4.
      When one decade is compared with the other, the last-named months
  are found to stand in exact inverse order, viz. 6 to 4 in the first, and 4 tor
  6  in the second.
      The wet and dry groups seem, on the whole, to be more evenly balanced
  than the warm and cold ; hut the Novembers of the second decade are
  remarkable for dryness. The connexion between the predominant winds
  and the other states      of  weather     has not     as  yet been traced systematically ;
  but the diagram shows           great excess of north-east wind in the spring of
  1852, and a long continuance of cold weather setting in early in the fol
 lowing year. It is also evident that wind from south-east was more pre
 valent during the second than the first decade.
     From the foregoing comparison of the' different months, the group of
 Novembers seems to be the most exceptional ; it may therefore be worth
 while to recapitulate the peculiarities that have been noticed.
     1st. The ratio between the coefficients of this group in different decades
 is invariably   one of considerable inequality.
     2nd. Two cold Novembers only occur in the warm cycle, and only two
 warm ones in the cold cycle.
    3rd. In the second decade the proportion of warm to cold Novembers
is 8 to 2, and of dry and wet 2 to 8 ; but in the warm period warm and
wet months were prettily evenly distributed.
    4th. Novembers of comparatively low temperature, such for instance                        as
those of 1851,        1853,    1854,    1855,     1856,    1860,  1861, and 1862,       were  in
each year succeeding         those    enumerated,       followed by Mays or Junes of a
similar character. The following rtsume shows the relations between the
Novembers and the Junes.

    These contrasts and analogies seem to justify the surmise that the at
mospheric conditions of the former months may have exercised some in
fluence upon those of the latter.                 Whether such be the case generally is
not to be determined until a much longer series                  of results  at Guernsey can
be   compared.
    The peculiarities with        respect     to the     Novembers may be purely acci
dental, or confined to the period under consideration ; but that they are
                                                                             2 R 2

not restricted to locality is proved by the Greenwich Tables, in which
these groups stand out still more prominently (see Table VII.) ; the ratios
between warm and cold being 9 to 1 in the first decade, aud 1 to 9 in the
¦second.      It  is difficult   therefore to avoid the conclusion that, during the
twenty years in question,          the Novembers were exceptional months at both
places ; although        at Guernsey they were more frequently followed by un
favourable Junes.
   The Greenwich diagram (Diagram II. Archives), to which I must now
briefly advert, does not exhibit so striking a contrast of light and shade as
was observable at first sight in the other diagram.                But on further exami
nation it will be found that the warm months of the first decade correspond
nearly in number with the cold months of the second,                      although not so
exactly    as at   Guernsey.

   On comparing the above abstract with that in a previous page, it will be
perceived that the disparity between the general results, from both places,
is not very considerable ; a similarity all the more remarkable, when we

insular stations. See Diagram             III.
   It would be superfluous to enter into any further discussion of the
various alternations which the coefficients              are susceptible of, in a paper
which is merely intended to direct attention to the accompanying diagrams
and analytical tables.          My motive for venturing to bring them under notice
is a desire to place them in the hands of those better qualified than                   I am
for conducting processes of induction              ; and   as the modified plan       I have
adopted     is based upon long recognized principles,             which are applicable to
the investigation of atmospheric phenomena in any locality,                  I  trust that it
may     be deemed      worthy   of  consideration.
IV. "Monthly            Magnetic Determinations, from June to November
        ] 866 inclusive, mnde at the Observatory at Coimbra," by Professor
        J. A.   de Souza, Director of the Observatory.                    Communicated
         (with a Note) by the President. Received May 8, 1867.
   [Note. — These observations contain               the record    of the commencement
of the absolute magnetic determinations              at the Coimbra Observatory,        with
instruments procured by M. de Souza at Kew, and on the system of
observation and reduction adopted at the Kew Observatory.                      The employ
ment of the photographic continuously self-recording instruments at
Coimbra has hitherto been delayed by the works required for the introduc
tion of gas into the Observatory          ; but this has now been accomplished ; and
a letter, dated      April  20,   1867,   from the Director states that the photo

     Observations    of Defection, Vibration, and Dip taken at        the Coimbra
                                    Observatory, 1866.
    The horizontal,       vertical,   and  total forces are calculated to English
measure.
    The vertical    and total forces are obtained from the absolute measures          of
horizontal force and dip.
    The   value  of log >r2K determined at the Kew Observatory is= I -64829
at temp. 62°     Fahr.
    The value of log p is =6-30487.
    The values of the coefficients q and q are respectively 0-000128,
 0- 00000030.       The temperature correction was obtained from the formula
      — 38)+j'         —           The correction for error of graduation of the
                   (<„    38)a.
deflection-bar at 10 foot is =-0-00006, at 1-3 is = — 0-00024.                    The
time of one vibration has been obtained from the mean of twenty-four de
terminations of the time of 100 vibrations.
    The   angles  of deflection    are each the mean   of two determinations.     The
difference between the angles of every pair was found always less than 40".
    In deducing from these observations the ratio and product of the mag
netic moment m of the magnet, and of the earth's horizontal magnetic in
tensity X, no correction has been required for the rate of the chronometer,
or for the initial and terminal semiarcs of vibration, the former having been
always less than 2•0, and the latter less than 70' at commencement, and
30' at end.
    But  the induction and temperature corrections have always been applied,
and the observed       time of vibration has been corrected for the effect of tor
sion  of  the suspending thread.
    The torsion for      90° was found no less than 5'- 1 8, and no greater than
8'-67.
    In the calculations of      the ratio     the third and subsequent   terms  of  the
                                          A.
             P     O
                + — + &c. have been omitted.            The value of the constant P
series  1 -|
             r      rt
was found to be =—0-0022317, by the mean of thirty-one determinations
obtained each from two pairs of deflection observations at distauces l'O and
1- 3 foot.
    The horizontal force for each day is the mean of            those  calculated for
each pair of deflections at distances TO and 1-3 foot.

  absolutely vacuous, the matter previously within it having been distributed
  outside it.      It is known further that the mass of a particle may be
  distributed over any surface whatsoever enclosing the particle without
 affecting the external attraction, and in this way we see at once that we
 may leave any internal space we please, however excentrically situated,
 wholly vacuous      ;  nor is it necessary in doing so to introduce an infinite
 density, by distributing the whole mass previously within that space over
 its surface, since that mass may be conceived to he divided into an infinite
number of infinitely small parts, which are respectively distributed over
 an infinite number of surfaces surrounding the space in question. These
 considerations,      however,    though     they   readily   show that      the   internal
 distribution may be widely different from any that is compatible with the
 hypothesis of primitive fluidity, do not lead to the general expression for
the internal density. Circumstances have recently recalled my attention
to the subject, and I can now indicate the mode of obtaining the general
expression required in the case of any given surface.
     Let the mass be referred to the rectangular axes of x, y, z, and let p be
the density, V be the potential of the attraction. Then for any internal
point V satisfies, as is well known, the partial differential equation
or    as  it may   be written for brevity VV=0.            This equation may be ex
tended      to  all space by imagining the body continued infinitely, but
having a density which is null outside the limits of the actual body ; and
by adopting this convention we need not trouble ourselves about those
limits.      Conversely,   if V   be -a continuously      varying function of x, y, z,
which     vanishes at an infinite     distance, and satisfies the partial differential
equation (1),V is the potential of the attraction of the mass whose density
at the point (x, y, z) is p ; or, in other words,
                                 V=U\£<l*'<fy'dz'                                       (2)
where r     is the distance    between     the points (x, y, z) and (x', y, z), p the
density at (x', y, 2), and the limits are —go to +00 , is the complete
integral of (1) subject to the condition that V shall vanish at an in
finite distance.
     This may be proved in different ways ; most directly perhaps by taking
the expression for the potential (IT suppose) which forms the right-hand
member of (2), substituting for p its equivalent —                    VV,    V   being the
same function of       x, y,     that  V  is of x, y, z, and transforming the integral
in the manner       done by Green*,       when we readily find U=V.

    Suppose now that we have a given closed surface S containing within it
 all the attracting matter, and that the potential has a given, in genera!
 variable, value V0 at the surface. For the portion of space external to
 S, V is to be determined by the general equation VV=0, subject                                    to tbe
 conditions V=V0 at the surface, and V=0 at an infinite distance.                                       We
 know that the problem of determining V under these circumstances admit'
 of one and but one solution, though it is only for a very limited number of
 forms of the surface S that the solution can actually be effected.                             Conceive
 the problem, however,                solved, aud from the          solution let the value of
                                                                                                        ^
 at the  surface be found, v being measured outwards along the normal.
 Now complete V for infinite space by assigning to the space within S any
 arbitrary but continuous* function wc please, subject tothctwo conditions,
 1st, that at the surface it is equal to the given function V0 ; 2ndly, that it
                                    dV
 gives    for the value                  at the surface that already got from the solution
                                 of-^-
 of the problem  referred to in this paragraph.  This of course may be done
in an infinite number of ways, just as we may in an infinite number of ways
join two points in a plane by a continuous curve starting from the tiro
points respectively in given directions, which curve may be either expressed
by some algebraical or transcendental equation, or conceived as drawn
liberd tnanu, and thought of independently of any idea of algebraical ex
pression. The function V having been thus assigned to the space internal
to S, the equation ( 1 ) gives, according to what we have seen, the most
general expression for the density of the internal matter.
    There      is,
             however, no distinction made in this between positive and
negative matter, and  we wish to avoid introducing negative matter we
                                 if
must restrict the function     for the space internal to
                                          V               to satisfy the         S

  It      easy from the general expression to show, what
         is                                                    already known,   is
that the matter may be distributed       an infinitely thin, and consequently

determinate.
   We know that               there exists one and but one continuous function applying
to the space within            S   which satisfies    the equation      VV=0,        and   is   equal   to

                               I

order may be       it  perfectly easy in any case to see. We may of course imagine distri

V0 at the     surface.      Call this function V,.       It   is to be remarked that the
value of -j-1 at the surface is not the same          as    that of  —r~, V being the   ex-
ternal potential, though V,and V are there each equal to V0. The argument,
it is to be observed, does not assume that the two are different ; it merely
avoids assuming that they are the same ; the result will prove that they
cannot be the same nil over S unless the density, and consequently the po
tential, be everywhere null, and therefore V0=0.                     Now attribute to the
interior of S a function        V  which is equal to V, except over a narrow stra
tum    adjacent   to S, the thickness      of which will in the end be supposed to
vanish, within which         V is  made to deviate     from      V, in such   a manner as
to render the variation of           ~

 On applying equation (1),            we see   that the density is everywhere null
 except within this stratum, in which it is very great, and in the limit
infinite.     For the total quantity of matter contained in any portion of the
 stratum, we have from         (1)

 the integration extending over that portion. Let the portion in question be
 that corresponding to a very small area A of the surface S ; we may sup
 pose it bounded laterally by the ultimately cylindrical surface generated by
 a normal to S which travels round the perimeter of A. Taking now
 Tectangular coordinates X, p, r, of which the last is parallel to the normal
 at  one point   of A,    since  V  is not changed in form         by referring it to a new
 set of rectangular axes, we have for the mass required
 Of the   differential coefficients within brackets, the last alone becomes infinite
 ¦when the    thickness of the stratum, and consequently the range of integra
 tion relatively to A, becomes infinitely small. We have in the limit

 both differential- coefficients having their        values      belonging to the surface.

   In assigning arbitrarily a function V to the interior of S, in order to get
the internal density by the application of the formula (1), we may if we
please discard the second of the conditions which V had to satisfy at the
surface,    namely, that                        out   111   tQat   case   to the mass,   of   finite
density, determined by (1) must be added an infinitely dense and infinitely
thin stratum extending over the surface, the finite superficial deusity of
this stratum being given by (3).
   We      have    seen      that the         of the most general internal
                                        determination
arrangement requires the solution of the problem, To determine the poten
tial for space external to S, supposed free from attracting matter, in terms
of the given potential at the surface ; and the determination of that parti
cular arrangement in which the matter is wholly distributed over the sur
face, requires further the solution of the same problem for space internal
to S. If, however, instead of having merely the potential given at the
surface S we had given a particular arrangement of matter within S, and
sought the most general rearrangement which should not alter the potential
at S, there would have been no preliminary problem to solve, since V, and
therefore its differential coefficients,         are known          for   space   generally,    and
therefore for the surface S, being expressed by triple integrals.
   Instead of having the attracting matter contained within a closed surface
S, and the attraction considered for space external to S, it might have been
the reverse, and the same methods would still have heen applicable.     The
problem in this form is more interesting with reference to electricity than
gravitation.

     We   have above a very simple example       of a general principle, viz. that in
  order that   a partial  differential equation of the second order, or a pair of
 simultaneous partial differential equations of the first order, may admit of
 a solution containing arbitrary functions, the coefficients must satisfy a cer
 tain equation of condition      ; from- which it follows that, except in the sim
 plest   instances   (in which   the terms of the equation of condition vanish),
 there is a moral certainty that such a differential equation or pair of equa
 tions which have not been specially selected for the purpose, and whose co
 efficients do not involve a disposable quantity by which the equation of con
 dition   may be satisfied, will not admit of a solution involving arbitrary
 functions.
     The equations applicable to the motion of an       elastic fluid along the axis
 of a tube afford a remarkable illustration of the      scope of these remarks.
     Those equations consist of a pair of partial differential equations of the
 first order involving fire variables, viz. y, t, p, v,p; and it may be shown
 A priori, that when derived upon a true theory they must be capable of a
 solution containing two arbitrary functions ; from which it follows that a
 third equation will require to be satisfied. For this purpose we have p, the
pressure, ready to our hands.
     From the fact of the existence      of the equation of condition not having
been suspected by the founders of the theory of fluid-motion, at the same
time that it was absolutely necessary for them to assign a form to p, they
had recourse for that purpose to an empirical method ; thus, on the one
hand, depriving us of the power of satisfying the requirements of the pro
 blem, and on the other, abandoning the means for the determination of p
which the analysis furnishes.
     It cannot be matter of surprise that the law of pressure suggested under
these circumstances       should    be entirely erroneous, as (by two other inde
pendent methods, one founded upon purely physical, the other upon purely
analytical considerations) I have elsewhere shown.

    Anxious to     assist the development of so interesting a branch of know
ledge    on  the  connexion    of forces in nature as the influence our satellite
exerts upon the earth's atmosphere, I had made it a point to include
investigations, tending to facilitate studies in this direction, in the plan of
discussion of the observations made at the Flagstaff Observatory about to
be published. Fully aware that a geographical position, such as that of Mel
bourne (37° 48' 45" south lat. and 9h 39m 53' east long.), affords but very
few chances for arriving forthwith at a result which might be regarded as
final,  I  thought   it nevertheless of the highest importance to decide how
                                                                    2s2

far nnd to what an extent such small oscillations as those in question, and
which for lower latitudes have already been proved to exist, would make
themselves      manifest, in spite of the great atmospheric disturbances of
higher    latitudes.   The volume of discussions .above referred to contains
consequently the results of the reduction and classification of upwards of
43,500 hourly observations on pressure of air, registered during the period
from the 1st of March 1858 to the 28th of February 18G3 ; and in pub
lishing these results     I  was chiefly guided by the conviction that it would
hardly be compatible with the scope of such a work to enter upon a full
discussion of the phenomena connected with the lunar influence on the
barometer ; while a complete reduction and classification would make the
observations apt to be taken up by any one interested in this matter for
the purpose of being subjected to a rigorous examination and discussion.
While engaged upon this task, I could not fail, however, to be struck by
some very interesting facts which, though they are far from being reducible
to definite laws, may serve to furnish some connecting links with respect to
atmospheric tides, and to give evidence as to the possibility of proving
 their existence even in as high a latitude as that of Melbourne.           A successful
attempt at a complete solution of the problem may only be hoped for when
a larger number of discussions on barometrical observations, collected at
ectropical stations, will be at our command.
    Prior   to entering upon the task proposed, it appears desirable to give a
few particulars, requisite for a full understanding of the subjoined results.
The geographical position of the Flagstaff Observatory was already men
tioned, and it remains only to be added that the standard barometer was
 one of Newman's construction, 0-400 inch in diameter, its cistern being
 120*7 feet above     the mean level of the sea.           A few facts respecting          the

    There is no necessity for entering more fully into a description of the
 method employed in freeing the barometrical observations from the regular
 diurnal fluctuation and arranging the remainders b — b according to lunar
 time, inasmuch as this method is quite identical with the one employed
 by all who have directed their attention to this subject, as General Sabine,

  1867.]                   Atmospheric   Tide at Melbourne.                      491
 Professor Kreil, and others. This much may be stated, however, that the
 reading of the barometer (6), after being reduced to 32°, was invariably'
 increased by 1 inch, in order that it may always exceed the mean pressure
 for the respective hour (6), thereby avoiding          negative results.  This has
 certainly   the  disadvantage of not exhibiting at a glance the excess or defect
 of atmospheric pressure at any time ; on the other hand, there is no doubt
that a mistake with regard to the algebraic sign of the remainders is not
likely   to occur.   In the subsequent Tables it     was made a rule to reduce the
values    6 — 6 to   their  mean value for     a month,    year, or whatever other
 period of time they may refer to.
    The remainders b — b were derived, in the manner just pointed out, for
 every month throughout the period of five years for which the observa
 tions were continued.        Then the means for every month and hour were
 taken, thus obtaining normal values for the several months ; a general
 mean for every month formed the basis to which those normal values were
 referred.     The subjoined Table shows the result of this proceeding.
    The values of the above Table have been thrown into curves, and Plate I.
 shows the results.       The actual mean values are indicated by dots ; a full-
 drawn curve is made to pass through and between them in such a manner
 as to eliminate the greater irregularities.       Some of those irregularities are
 so large as to cause the respective dots to be disconnected with the series to
 which they belong, and it became therefore necessary to indicate this con
 nexion by slight dotted lines.
    On glancing over this series of. curves we cannct fail to observe a great
 regularity, pointing at some cause common to all ; and as the remainders
 b — b have been arranged according to the moon's hour-angle, we may
justly look to the moon as the primary cause. But it is nevertheless true
 that  those curves apparently point to some other influence, most likely due
 to the combined action of the sun and moon.            The monthly curves for the
 several years of observation have also been drawn, though we refrain from
 adding the results here ; and the fact that they correspond in the main
 points with those shown on Flate I., seems to justify our attaching parti
 cular weight to the evidence of the moon's influence on our atmosphere, ns
 conveyed to our minds by the above Tables.              But prior to entering fully
 upon the various points bearing       on the question at issue, we need     to form
 of the monthly results quarterly and semiannual groups. If we call March,
April, May the first, June, July, August the second, September, October,
 November the third, and December, January, February the fourth quarter,
we obtain the quarterly means inserted in the following Table.                It was
furthermore      considered serviceable   to the purpose to group together those
quarters in which the epochs of solstices and equinoxes respectively occur,
under the collective     names "solstitial and equinoctial quarters." The semi
annual periods oomprite, as usually, the months from April to September,
and    thooe   from October to March.         The  mean of all the various hourly
values represents the mean lunar-diurnal         variation in prcstureof air for the
year.

 The curves derived from the results of this Table are shown on Plate XL,
 with the exception of the semiannual and annual curves which may be
 studied on Plate            X.
     Glancing at the various curves thus resulting, we are first                       struck by        the
 great conformity             of    some    of them, whilst
                                               others present irregularities
 apparently quite irreconcileable with what we feel inclined to adopt as the
 law. There            is,
                   however, in all cases manifested      progressive change,  a
evidently depending on the moon's hour-angle in the first instance, calling
for    arigorous examination. The semiannual curves of the lunar-diurnal
variation of atmospheric pressure may be taken as representing the prin
cipal types of the various monthly curves. During the sun's absence from
the hemisphere (in our case, when the sun's declination     north), from             is
April      to September, the lunar variation reaches its maximum at about 23h 15",
or   45m    prior to the moon's upper transit, its minimum value occurring at
19h and      a secondary one at 2h, with  range of 0-00G53 inch.
                                                          a       The curves
for the single months appertaining to this semiannual period exhibit,
generally speaking, the same characteristics, though somewhat irregular, and
showing,         in   some    instances, deviations of considerable extent                ;   so,   for in
stance, the curves  for August and September.      The summer semiannual
curve (while the sun's declination   south) exhibits an essentially different
                                                      is
character, there being no strongly expressed maximum noticeable, whiLt                                   a
decided minimum occurs at 0h 30m or 30m past the moon's upper passage,
the maximal pressure  taking place at Gh, and    secondary one between 18h
                                                                      a

variation of the barometer, when we examine the single months somewhat
more closely thus, for instance, the curve for the month of December shows
                  ;
such characteristics                      like the curves for the winter
                                  as to cause    it   to be more
period, and, on the other hand, we perceive that the curve for the
month of November    exactly of the opposite character as that for De
                                   is
cember. The remaining four months show more or less irregularity, and
make   greater or smaller approach towards the general type for the class
       a
under consideration.                  «
     Although thereundoubtedlyis all of these cases strong evidence of an
                                                   in
influence of the moon on our atmosphere,     could not rest satisfied, con
                                                                 I

                                             somewhat conflicting nature.
                                                                  a
As already explained, the monthly values have, for the purpose of further
inquiry, been combined into quarters, and the results for these quarters
were  again united in mean values, arranging the two quarters in which
epochs of solstice occur, and the remaining two, comprising the equinoxes,
respectively, in two groups.   Thus we obtain six monthly mean values of
the lunar-diurnal            variation for the "solstitial and the equinoctial quarters."
I   was prompted to adopt this course because              of the great similarity of the
curves for December and                 June in       the one case, and      of March and Septem
ber in the other, though in                by   far less   a   degree.     This similarity may best

   be judged by the mean values for the respective two months, representing,
   as they do, in both cases a distinct oscillation with an amplitude      of 0"-01 722
   for the   solstices,  and of 0"-0 1 04 1 for tlie equinoxes.    I may be allowed to
   refrain   from adding here these mean values, suffice it to refer to the
   respective curves at the bottom of Plate          II.   For December and June we
  observe the maximum to occur at 23h, the minimum at or shortly after               8h,
  while for September and March the maximum in the lunar-diurnal varia
  tion of pressure of air takes place at 7h and the minimum at 1 9h. The
  mean for the quarters (each embracing six months) show the same charac
  teristics, though by far less in extent, the amplitude for the solstitial
  quarters being 0"'Q07454, and that for the equinoctial quarters ()",006334.
      There is another fact which requires to be pointed out, in order to throw
  further light upon the character of these oscillations ; namely, that they
                                                                                  ~
 seem to bear        a  great resemblance for both hemispheres during the same
 semiannual period, if we are permitted to arrive at this conclusion by re
 ferring    to  Prof. Ereil's discussions of his observations at Prague (Versuch
 den Einfluss des Mondes auf den atmospheriscben Zustand unserer Erde
 aus cinjahrigen Beobachtungen zu erkennen, 1841).                    The semiannual
 curves of the lunar-diurnal variation of the barometer at Prague and Mel
 bourne closely correspond during the months from April to September, and
 from October to March, which seems to point to some cause common to
 the whole globe in a similar manner, as we know it to be with respect to
 the extent of the rise of the oceanic tides at the time of the solstices and
 equinoxes.        It would be premature to enter now upon any speculation
with a view to bring the results of our observations in accordance with
theory, there being still by far too few discussions on atmospheric tidal
observations at our command.
     The yearly curve of       the lunar-diurnal    variation presents some peculiarly
interesting features, differing in some respects from the results of similar
inquiries instituted by General Sabine and Capt. C. M. Elliot with special
regard to the lunar atmospheric tides at St. Helena and Singapore, al
though the plan of discussion was the same. The lunar horary variation
of the barometer is as follows, "if we arrange the results in such manner
that the hours are combined in which the moon is similarly situated in
respect to the meridian" (Sabine's paper "On the Lunar Tides at St.
Helena") :—

    In  both cases, at the hours following, and at those preceding the meri
dian passage, the minimum is decidedly at the 3rd hour, while the
maximun in the first series occurs at the Oth, and in the second at the 1st
hour. At Singapore and St. Helena, both within the tropics, the lunar-
diurnal variation shows a maximum at the Oth and a minimum at the 6th
hour.       The discussions, based on observations made at Prague, and already
referred to above, exhibit a greater conformity in respect to the lunar
tides at Melbourne than any of the tropical stations. This conformity is
especially     clearly expressed       in the series       for   " the    hours    following   the
meridian passage" (which series seems to present in each respective case
the greatest reliability), and we observe that the minimum occurs at the
3rd and 4th, and the maximum at the 6th hour.                          But in turning Prof.
Kreil's labours in this direction           to account, we must remember that they
refer   to a period of only one year, and cannot be considered as present
ing great guarantees for decisive results, especially when considering that
so high a latitude as 50° 8' N. would rather have required a longer period
of observation than is necessary to prove the existence and character of
the lunar atmospheric tides within the tropics.                   So very few discussions on
this topic being at our command, it is nevertheless of considerable interest
to compare the results for Prague with those at St. Helena, Singapore, and
Melbourne, as done in the following little Table : —

     The decrease in extent of oscillation, as we recede                 from the equator, is
 clearly illustrated by the mean values of this Table.
     Speaking of the extent of the oscillations, it is of importance to add a
 few facts relative to the amplitude, as resulting from the monthly curve.8.
We have seen, in the course of this exposition, that the amplitude for the
 semiannual periods from April to September, and from October to March,
 is respectively 0"-00(i.53 and 0"*00432, which result will be materially
 altered in case we consider only the single months ; for inasmuch as the
 tense of oscillation varies considerably in the single months, constituting a
 semiannual     period, chiefly during summer, the combination of the hourly
  values of six months in one group must necessarily tend to diminish, or

    The semianuual means are, for the six winter months (when the sun's
declination is north), 0"-0129, and for the summer months (when the sun's
declination is south) 0"-01Cl, and therefore the mean amplitude in lunar-
diurnal variation of the barometer is 0"-014o.
    There is evidently a great conformity in the change in extent of oscilla
tion observable, when we examine the semiannual values of the above
series.     In April and October the amplitude reaches a minimum value,
whilst in the months immediately following a maximum occurs.                             For
both the equinoctial months the value in question is nearly alike, making
at the same time the nearest approach to the annual mean.                    The months
following    the  equinoxes  exhibit   the  smallest   range  in  lunar-diurnal    variation
of atmospheric pressure, whilst those months preceding the solstices are to
be considered as maxima with respect            to the value at issue.
    With   a view to ascertain whether         the difference in the extent of the
lunar atmospheric      tide at  the   epochs  of   apogee and perigee may be proved
to be perceptible in as high a latitude as 37° 48', I followed a oaurse dif
fering in some respects from the one proposed by General Sabine in his
discussions of the St. Helena observations.              We have seen that in the case
under consideration the hours of the extremes in pressure are not marked
in  a  like distinct manner    ns  for places near the equator, and          I  thought it
on this account preferable to abandon the adherence to certain hours of the
lunar day in determining the range in the value b — b, simply adopting this
range for the lunar day near the apogee or perigee, irrespective of any
hour of maximum, or minimum.                 In order to increase the "number of
comparisons, this range was determined in addition to the days of apogee
and perigee for the day preceding and             that following     those epochs.      The
 difference in the lunar-diurnal range in atmospheric pressure at the epochs
 of perigee (R') and apogee (R°) was consequently in each case derived from
 six days' observation.     Thus we obtained the following values for R*— R*,
 which, however, cannot be immediately compared, in respect to the amount,
 with the corresponding values of the discussion on the St. Helena observa
 tions just referred to and arrived at by a different process.

    The   mean value     of    -f -02/4G     was derived with due regard to the number
of   epoch3   of  apogee and perigee           occurring in the whole period of observa
 tion, the  total number of barometrical readings from which it                         was derived
 being 720.
    There    can hardly exist a doubt,             after having examined the above re
 sults, that the lunar-diurnal range in pressure of air at the time of the
 perigee exceeds the one at the apogee, a fact which is also in strict accord
 ance with theory.         But it ought        to be pointed out that during the months
 of May,   J uue, and July the reverse             seems to take place, as is manifested in
 every one    of the  five years     of observation. Whether this bears any refer
 ence to the time of aphelion on the 3rd of July, and the time of the peri
 helion on the 2nd of January, we do not pretend to decide now ; suffice it
 to have directed the attention of those more immediately interested in in
 quiries of this nature to a matter replete with so much interest, but as j et,
 comparatively speaking, scantily examined.                         The mean range for the
 epochs   of  perigee   and     apogee     is   respectively 0"1G327 and 0"-13581, re
 sulting a general mean range of 0"-149540.
    A   similar plan to that just described was pursued, in order to ascer
tain whether there existed any perceptible difference in atmospheric
pressure in the periods of syzygy and quadrature.                             The range of the
ntrrrospheric     pressure during a lunar day was determined for days of full
and change, and also for each of the epochs of quadrature separately,
and furthermore for the day preceding and following each of the several
 epochs.      Subsequently        a mean     value was derived by combining                the daily

    The last column of this Table shows the difference R• — R\ so that plus
denotes an excess of the lunar-diurnal rauge at the periods of syzygy, and
minus an excess at the periods of epiadrature.
    According to the above there is a decided minimum in the lunar-diurnal
 range at the time of the first quarter, while the last quarter seems to be
the maximum, the time of the syzygy showing intermediate values.                                      The
general mean would indicate an excess, though very small, in favour of the
epochs of the quadrature.                On examining, however, the difference for the
single   months,      we notice that the algebraic sign denotes for seven months
an   excess   of the epochs of syzygy,                 and     for    five    only the contrary ;
further, that the greatest irregularity in respect                       to the signs and values
prevails durings the months from November to February, when hot winds
are most frequent, and the sudden changes in temperature, connected with
these phenomena, cause the oscillations                 of   the   barometer to be much dis
turbed.      The magnitude of the              values during this period ought to induce
us to receive      them with caution, and to consider the eight remaining
months separately.            The general mean difference for the eight months,
from March to October, both inclusive, represents an excess in favour of
the epochs of syzygy of 0 006/62 inch,                  a value   which most probably makes

    The final result of this Table shows an average excess of 0"-U01126 in
favour of the epochs of syzygy, hut nn analysis of this value shows that for
three years the excess is in favour of the epochs of quadrature, while but
two years seem to confirm what we feel inclined to regard as the rule. So
much we are able to assert, however, that the lunar-diurnal range in pres
sure of air at the time of the first quarter shows a minimum, and that near
the last quarter and new moon a maximum in this range seems to make
itself manifest.       Although the evidence adduced in the case is not of
such a positive nature as that produced when treating on the question of
the increased pressure of air near the perigee, we feel nevertheless inclined
to believe some similar relation to exist between the atmospheric tides and
the moon's phases, as we know to be the case with respect to the oceanic
tides, and that a more rigorous inquiry into this question than we are able
on the present occasion to institute, will ultimately yield a result in strict
accordance with the theory of gravitation.
   Before concluding these researches           I   may be allowed to point out a fact
corroborative    of   the result arrived at when speaking               of the difference of
atmospheric pressure near the epochs of syzygy and quadrature. The mean
diurnal range resulting from the last inquiry amounts to 0"' 153301 ; but
on the former occasion we found this range to be 0"-14954.                         The excess
of 0"-003/(i, of which the lunar-diurnal            range of the atmospheric pressure
is larger, when derived from the epochs of the moon's phases, than when
obtaining it by the periods of perigee and apogee, must be attributed to
the fact that in the latter case sixty-six periods of perigee were com
bined with sixty-seven periods of apogee, giving a fair average result ;
while in the former forty-three epochs of perigee and but thirty-five of
apogee happened to coincide with the several phases of the moon, tending
in this   way to raise the mean value of the lunar-diurnal range of the baro
meter above that average.

 which the metallic mass last found itself in a state of ignition.             The
 meteoric iron of Lenarto appeared to be well adapted for a trial.            This
 well-known iron is free from any stony admixture, and is remarkably
 pure and malleable.         It was found by Wchrle to be of specific gravity
  7'79, and to consist of —

    Prom   a  larger  mass a  strip of the Lenarto iron 50 millimetres by   13 and
 10 millimetres,    was cut by a clean chisel.    It weighed   45 2 grammes, and
 had the bulk of 5-78 cubic centimetres.          The strip was well washed by
 hot solution of potassa, and then repeatedly by hot distilled water,
 and dried.       Such treatment of iron, it had been previously found,
 conduces in no way to the evolution of hydrogen gas when the metal
 is subsequently heated           The Lenarto iron was enclosed in a new
 porcelain tube,     and  the  latter being attached to a Sprengel aspirator,
 a good vacuum was obtained in the cold.            The tube being placed in a
trough combustion furnace, was heated to redness by ignited charcoal.
 Gas came oft" rather freely, namely —
             In  35 minutes                                  5-38 cub. centims.
             In  100 minutes                                 9-52         „
             In  20 minutes                                   1/63        „
             In  2 hours 35 minutes                          16-53        „
    The first portion of gas collected had a slight odour, but much less
than that of the natural gases occluded by ordinary malleable iron.
The gas burned like hydrogen.            It did not contain a trace of carbonic
acid, nor any hydrocarbon vapour absorbable by fuming sulphuric acid.
The second portion of gas collected, consisting of 9'52 cub. centims.,
gave by analysis     —
       Hydrogen                              8-2G cub. centims         85-6S

    The Lenarto iron appears, therefore, to yield 2-85 times its volume
of   gas, of which 80 per cent, nearly is hydrogen.           The proportion of
carbonic oxide is so low as 4£ per cut.

  The gas occluded by iron, from a carbonaceous fire, is very different,
the prevailing gas then being carbonic oxide.- For comparison a
quantity of clean horseshoe nails was submitted to a similar distillation.
The gas collected from 235 grammes of metal (3-01 cub. centims.) was—
         In    150 minutes                                 5'40 cub. centims.
         In 120 minutes                                    2^58       „
         In 4 hours 30 minuteB                             7-98       „
   The metal has given 2-66 times its volume of gas. The first portion
collected appeared to contain of hydrogen 35 per cent., of carbonic
oxide 50-3, of carbonic acid 7-7j and of nitrogen 7 per cent. The
latter portion collected gave more carbonic oxide (58 per cent.) with
less hydrogen (21 per cent.), no carbonic acid, the remainder nitrogen.
The predominance of carbonic oxide in its occluded gases appears to
attest the telluric origin of iron.
   Hydrogen has been recognized in the spectrum-analysis of the light
of the fixed stars, by Messrs. Huggins and Miller. The same gas con
stitutes, according to the wide researches of Father Secchi, the principal
element of a numerous class of stars, of which a Lyrae is the type.
The iron of Lenarto has no doubt come from such an atmosphere, in
which hydrogen greatly prevailed. This meteorite may be looked upon as
holding imprisoned within      it,
                                 and bearing to us hydrogen of the stars.
   It has been found difficult, on trial, to impregnate malleable iron
with more than an equal volume of hydrogen, under the pressure of our
atmosphere.     Now the meteoric iron gave up about three times that
amount, without being fully exhausted.          The inference     that the
                                                                      is

  significant fact that the ' intermediate skeleton,' in Irish and other
  varieties of eozoonal rock, contains modified examples of the ' definite
          '
  shapes    more or less resembling the crystalline aggregations and pris
 matic lumps in primary saccharoidal marbles — that eozoonal structure
 is only found in metamorphic rocks belonging to widely separated
 geological systems, never in their unaltered sedimentary deposits, —
 taking all these points into consideration, also the arguments and
 other evidences contained in the present memoir, we feel the conclusion
 to be fully established, that every one of the specialities which have
 been diagnosed for Eozoon Canadense is solely and purely of crystalline
 origin : in short, we hold, without the least reservation, that from every
 available standing point — foraminiferal, mineralogical, chemical, and
 geological — the opposite view has been shown to be utterly untenable."
     Considering that the Foraminiferal characters of Eozoon Canadense
 had been unhesitatingly accepted by all those zoologists, Continental
 as well as British, whose special acquaintance with the group gave
 weight to their opinion, it might have been prudent, as well as becoming,
 on the part of the Galway Professors, to express themselves somewhat
 less confidently in regard to its purely mineral origin.     The case they
 made out would not have lost any of its real strength, if they had
 simply put forward their facts as affording valid grounds for questioning
 the received doctrine.    And a way of escape would have been left for
 them, if the progress of research should happen to bring to light con
 clusive evidence on the other side.
     Although such conclusive evidence is now producible, it may be well
 for me briefly to point out what    I regard as the fundamental fallacies
 in the argument of Professors King and Ptowney.
    In the first place, the Serpentine-Marble of Connemara, on which
 their investigations had been chiefly conducted, is admitted by every
 one who has examined it to have undergone a considerable amount
 of metamorphic change. To myself, as well as to Professors King and
 Bowney, the evidence which it presents of the operation of chemical
 and physical agencies is most obvious and conclusive ; whilst the evi
 dence of its organic origin rests entirely on its partial analogy to the
 eozooual rock of Canada.      Hence an entire surrender might be made of
the organic hypothesis as regards the Connemara marble, without in
the least degree invalidating the claim of the eozoonal rock of Canada
to an organic origin. But, on the other hand, if the latter claim can
be sustained, it may be fairly extended to the " Irish Green," should
the evidence of similarity be found sufficient to justify such an ex
tension ; since it must be admitted by every Petrologist, that no amount
of purely mineral arrangement in a Metamorphic rock can disprove
it? claim to Organic origin, if that claim can be shewn to be justified

  garding as a finely tubulated Nummuline shell, of which the tubuli that
  were originally occupied by pseudopodia have been permeated by sili
  ceous infiltration.
      So, again, while asserting that by no conceivable process could the
  animal substance originally occupying these tubuli have been replaced
  by siliceous minerals, they have entirely ignored the fact stated by me,
  that this very replacement has taken place in recent specimens in my
  possession, — a fact on the basis of which the reconstruction of the animal
  of Eozoon proposed by Dr. Dawson and myself securely rests.
                                I
     The question may now, believe, be regarded as conclusively settled by
  the recent discovery, in a sedimentary limestone of the Lower Lauren-
 tian formation at Tudor in Canada, of a specimen of Eozoon presenting
  characters that cannot, in the opinion of the most experienced Palaeon-
  tologists and Mineralogists, be accounted for on any other hypothesis
  than that of its organic origin. For in the first place, the occurrence
  of a calcareous framework or skeleton in a matrix of sedimentary lime
  stone, which also fills up its interspaces, altogether excludes the hypothe
  sis that this framework might be the product of any kind of pseudo-
  morphic arrangement produced by the separation of calcareous and
 siliceous minerals from a solution containing both. And, secondly, this
  specimen exhibits that which had not previously been distinctly seen in
  any other, viz., a distinctly limited contour, formed by the curving
  downwards and closing-in of the septa, in a manner as perfect and
  characteristic as the closing-in of the successive chambers of any poly-
  thalainous shell.    I believe that no Palaeontologist familiar with Palaeozoic
   fossils would have hesitated to pronounce this specimen a Fossil Coral
  allied to Stromatopora, if it had occurred in a Silurian Limestone.
      That this specimen, though differing greatly in appearance from the
 ordinary -serpentinous Eozoon, really represents that organism, is shown
 not merely by the general arrangement of the calcareous lamellae, but by
 their minute structure.        This, it is true, is far less characteristically seen
 in thin sections microscopically examined, than it is in the specimens
 whose cavities have been filled up by Serpentine ; the texture of which
 is often so marvellously little changed, as to have all the appearance of
 recent shell-substance.        But the alteration which the shelly layers have
undergone in this specimen, is precisely paralleled by that which              I have
been accustomed to find in the best-preserved specimens of other
organic structures contained in the more ancient Limestones.                     And
there are still distinctly-recognizable traces of the canal-system imper
fectly injected with black substance, which correspond with those of
the    ordinary Serpentinous Eozoon.
      For  the imperfection of the specimen in this respect, however, full
compensation is made in the perfect preservation of the canal-system in
» small fragment of Eozoon long since observed by Dr. Dawson in a

my hands by Sir William Logan, with permission to treat it in any way
that should enable me to make a thorough examination of it, have suc         I
ceeded in finding in it most complete and beautiful examples of the canal-
system, presenting varietiesof size and distribution exactly parallel to those
                I
with which am familiar in the Serpentine-specimens.                   Now as there is
not in the Madoc, any more than in the Tudor specimen, any such com
bination of different minerals as has been supposed by Professors King
and Rowney to have given origin to the arborescent forms of the canal-
system of Eozoon (which they have likened to moss-agate or crystallized
silver), there can be no longer any reasonable ground for disputing the
essential similarity of this canal-system to that first described by myself
in Calcarina, with which it was originally compared by Dr. Dawson*.
    The extension of the inquiry into the character of the Serpentine
limestones intercalated among the Gneissic and other rocks of Lauren-
tian age in various parts of Europe, has brought to light such numerous
examples of eozoonal structure, more or less distinctly preserved, as to
afford strong grounds for the conclusion that this organism was very
 generally diffused at that epoch, and performed much the same part in
raising up solid structures in the waters of the ocean, that the Coral-
 forming Zoophytes perform at the present time.               I  had myself examined
 before the close of 1865 specimens of Ophicalcite from Cesha Lipa in
 Bohemia and from the neighbourhood of Moldau, in which an eozoonal
 structure was distinctly traceable ; and early in 1866 a more extended
 series was transmitted to me through Sir C. Lyell from Dr. Gumbel, the
  Government Geologist of Bavaria, in which              I was able to trace a con
 tinuous gradation from specimens in which the eozoonal structure was
  distinct, to others in which, if it ever existed, it had been completely
  obscured by subsequent metamorphism.                The results of a very careful
 and complete examination of the Ophicalcites of Bavaria by Dr. Gumbel
 himself has been communicated to the Koyal Academy of Munichf.
     Appearances of the same character are presented by a series of speci
  mens of the Serpentiuous Limestones from the Primitive Gneiss of
  Scandinavia, kindly transmitted to me by Prof Loven.
     I venture to hope that the foregoing resume of the present aspect of this
  subject will be of interest to the Fellows of the Royal Society.                    1 say
  the present aspect, because        I  am strongly convinced that we are at
  present only at the beginning of our knowledge of this and other ancient
  types of Foraminiferal structure ; and that careful search in promising
  localities will bring to light many wonders now lying unsuspected in
  the vast aggregate of pre-Silurian strata.

                                     (Abstract.)
      Abstracts of a considerable portion of this paper have been already
  published iu the Proceedings of the Royal Society for June 18, 1857,
  and June 20, 1861, under the title of "Notes of Researches on the
  Intimate Structure of the Brain."
      After adding several new facts, and giving further explanations on
 the subject of the medulla oblongata, the author gives a full description
  of the morphological changes by which the auditory and other centres
 are developed out of elements of the spinal cord.         The auditory centres
 consist of an outer and an inner nucleus.          The outer nucleus is deve
 loped from the grey substance of the posterior pyramid and restiform
 body of the medulla.        The inner nucleus arises between the posterior
 pyramid and the nucleus of the eighth cerebral nerve. From both
 these nuclei the posterior division of the auditory nerve takes its origin.
 The anterior division consists of two portions. The principal portion
 penetrates the medulla beneath the restiform body, and running along
 the outer side of the caput cornu, or grey tubercle, enters both the
 outer and inner nucleus.         The other portion of the nerve runs back
 ward along the upper border of the restiform body, which it accompanies
 over the superior peduncle of the cerebellum to the inferior vermiform
 process.     The outer auditory nucleus, consisting of the grey substance
 of the posterior pyramid and restiform body, is ultimately thrown back
 ward into the cerebellum, part of it arching over the fourth ventricle to
the opposite side, while the rest extends outward to the corpus den-
tatum of the cerebellum.
     It would not be possible to give an abstract of the numerous details
of structure and the complicated connexions of different parts described
in the paper. The following facts, however, may be mentioned.
     The roots of the facial nerve are shown to have a very remarkable
course and very complicated connexions with surrounding parts.               On
reaching    the  fasciculus teres they bend  downward    in  the form of a loop,
the lower arm of which is connected with the motor nucleus of the
trigeminus and with the upper olivary body, as well as with their own
special nuclei. The longitudinal portion of this loop forms the column
which Stilling mistook for what he calls the " constant root of the trige
minus," and which Schroeder van der Kolk mistook for one of the stria)

                           have communicated to the Chemical Society
descriptions of  certain bodies which are best viewed as amides of pyro
phosphoric acid ; and in pursuing the inquiry      have recently obtained    I
some fresh results, and a new class of compounds.     propose continuing              I
to send the details to the Chemical Society, but     may be permitted to         I
submit to the Eoyal Society a condensed account of the main facts
arrived at in the whole investigation, and a theory of the formation of
these substances.

remarkable fact     that the complete ferric salt, and several other pyro
                          is

acid; but on heating the solution    separates in   form which

 ways, of which the most noteworthy are the action of ammonia on phos
 phoric anhydride, of ammonia and water on oxychloride of phosphorus,
 of alcohol or soluble bases on chlorophosphuret of nitrogen, as well as
the breaking down of amides of more complicated structure. It is bi-
basic, and forms salts which are generally very soluble, like itself, in
water and alcohol.
    Pyrophospho-triamic    acid, Ps (NH2)3 HO^, is formed when oxychloride
 of   phosphorus is saturated with ammonia at about 100° C, and the
resulting mass is treated with water, or when tetraphospho-pentazotic
acid is exposed to the action of water for some time. It is nearly inso
luble in water, and so are its combinations, even those with the alkaline
metals. It readily decomposes most soluble salts, giving rise to com
pounds in which 1, 2, 3, or 4 atoms of hydrogen are replaced.          With
slightly acid nitrate of silver it gives a white salt, P2 (NHa), Ag 04 ;
with the ammoniacal nitrate a bright yellow salt, P, N3 H, Ags 0,.
    By the action of water on the compounds of ammonia with oxychloride
 of phosphorus, there are also produced some aeid amides that belong to
a higher series.      Great difficulty was experienced in being certain of
the purity of any specimen of these compounds ; hence gome doubt may
 still rest on their ultimate composition.
    Tetraphospho-tetramic acid, P4 (NH2)4 Ha 09, is a solid stable body,inso-
luble in alcohol, but soluble in water, and combining readily with bases,
the amount of hydrogen replaced appearing to vary from 1 to 6 atoms.
    Terammoniated Tetraphospho-diamic acid, P4 (XH2)aNa Hls On. — This
is a viscid liquid, insoluble in alcohol, but very soluble in water.        It
forms a liquid combination with ammonia ; but metallic salts appear to
break it up into a variety of compounds.       By the action of heat, boiling
water, strong acids, or alkaline carbonates, tetraphospho-tetramic       acid
may be produced from it.        Among the bodies formed when it is heated
per se is a white substance, insoluble, or nearly so, in cold water, having
the ultimate composition PNH4 03. This is at once transformed into
pyrophospho-diamic acid by hot water, or dilute acids.
    Tetraphospho-pentazotic    acid, P4 N, Hu 0„ is formed when oxychloride
of phosphorus is fully saturated with ammonia, and the resulting mass
is heated at about 230° C, and washed with cold water. It is an
insoluble body, capable of decomposing metallic salts. One atom of
hydrogen is replaceable by potassium or ammonium.             "When treated
with slightly acidulated nitrate of silver, it gives a tetrazotic salt,

    By the action of heat on the substances already described, other com
pounds may also be prepared, thus : —
    Pyrophospho-nitrt/lic acid. — If pyrophospho-triaraate of potassium be
heated at a dull redness, it loses two-thirds of its nitrogen as ammonia,
leaving a fused mass, which is insoluble in water, but forms compounds
when treated with silver or copper salts.          These have the composition
of pyrophospho-nitrylates, Pa N Ag 04.             If pyrophospho-triamic acid
itself be similarly heated, it parts with one molecule of ammonia, and
gives a body, P2 N2 H4 Ot, isomeric with pyrophospho-nitrylate                 of
ammonium, which is speedily resolved by damp air into pyrophosphamic
acid and other compounds.
   The process adopted for the analysis of these acid amides was that of
boiling them with strong hydrochloric acid. This converts them all into
ammonia and ordinary phosphoric acid, which were determined in the
usual manner.
                             Theoretical Constitution.
   A difficulty in understanding         the   formation of the bodies above
described from oxychlorido of phosphorus arises from the fact that they
contain P3... or P,..\, while the original phosphorus compound contains
but one atom of that element.         The following considerations may fur
nish a probable explanation       and reveal  their true constitution.
   When a chloride and water act on one another, three different courses
are open, each giving hydrochloric acid as one of the results.            In the
first case the chlorine combines with one of the atoms of hydrogen,
while the remaining hydroxyl, HO, takes its place in the original com
pound, thus : —
            P C13 + 3H, 0=3H Cl+P          H3 03 (phosphorous acid).
In  the second case two atoms of chlorine simultaneously attack the two
atoms of hydrogen, and the liberated single atom of oxygen takes their
place, thus   : —
        P Cl5 + H, 0 = 2 H CI + P CI, 0      {oxychhride  of phosphorus).
   In each of these cases we may consider the new compound as formed
on the same type as the original chloride, only the chlorine is differently
replaced.
                          CI                 HO
   In  the one case     P CI     becomes   P H O,
                          CI                 HO
                          CI                 CI
   and in the other P CI         becomes   P CI O.

   But there is a third case in which the two atoms of hydrogen in
water are attacked simultaneously by two atoms of the chloride, and
the result is that the oxygen is left in combination with two molecules
of the substance originally combined with the chlorine. Here it is
simplest to consider that it is the water type which is preserved.
   It is this third mode of action which explains the production of tho
compounds containing P3... and P4....
    Ifwe act on oxychloride of phosphorus with water, a slow replace
ment of the chlorine takes place, each atom decomposing a molecule of
water, and the result is —
                             CI                        HO

employ strong solutions of potash or ammonia, the result is totally dif

   But the pyro-diamic acid may be equally produced, if we start with
the higher amidated oxychloride formed at a low temperature.     In this
ease it is necessary to suppose that while two molecules of the phos
phorus compound attack one molecule of water, two other molecules of
water give rise to the usual replacement of H O for N Ha. The two
stages are precisely analogous to those given above, but are probably
simultaneous, the reaction being favoured by the affinity of the hydro

   The formation of pyropliospho-triamic    acid is dependent on some
alteration in the amidated oxychloride, when produced at a high tempe
rature.   As the nature of this change is unknown, it may be better not
to speculate on the intermediate stages, but the result of the action on
water would           seem        to be     ? % ^ ^ °) 0            1   O, or Pa (N        HA H C*.

  If this be the true explanation                          of the manner in which the pyrophos
phoric amides are formed, it will equally explain the formation of the

by De Blainville, Desmarest, Richardson, and M. Lartet.                That the
 latter four naturalists are right in the place they assign to it in the
 zoological scale, intermediate between Ovis and Bos, is proved both by
the natural history and the osteology of the animal.         The absence of a
muflSe and dewlap, the hairiness of the nostrils, the shortness of tail and
smallness of ear, and the possession of two teats only, separate the
animal from Bos and connect it with Ovis, while the large size and long
gestation of nine months differentiate it from the latter animal. Precisely
the same evidence is afforded by its skeleton.       In the skull, the taper
ing of the anterior portion, the prominence of the orbit, the vertiealiry
of the facial plate of the maxillary, the presence of a larmier, the square
ness of the basisphenoid, the presence of the occipito-parietal suture on
 the coronal surface ; in the dentition, the sharpness of the costas 1,2, and 3,
 and the absence of the accessory column from the inner interspace of
 the lobes of the upper teeth are among the chief ovine characters, and
  throughout the skeleton the same ovino tendency is manifested.          "With
  the exception of the great development of horns, there is no point in

common between it and Bubalus Caffir.           The encroachment of horn-
cores or parietals differentiate it from the sheep.
    The animal ranges at the present day from Fort Churchill, lat. 60°,
northwards as far as the arctic sea, and eastwards as far as Cape
Bathurst, lat. 71°, living for the most part on the "barren grounds,"
and never penetrating far into the woods.               In geological times,
however, it had a far greater range eastwards and southwards.               In
the pleistocene river-gravels lying on the solid ice in Eschscholtz Bay,
in Bussian America, it is found associated with the elk, reindeer,
bison, horse, and mammoth.            Traces of the animal ranging further
to the east are afforded hy the skull found on the banks of the Tena,
in lat. 70°, long. 135°. Dr. Fallas's discovery of two skulls on the
banks of the Obi brings the animal still closer to the borders of
Europe.      All three skulls were found in the "Tundas," or treeless
" barren             " of
           grounds         Siberia, in the same series of gravels which afford
such vast stores of fossil ivory.     In Q-ermany it has been found in three
localities ; and in France; in the valley of the Oise, it is associated with
flint implements of the St. Acheul type, and with the mammoth and
EJephas antiquus.      It has also been found in the reindeer caves of Peri-
gord, under circumstances that prove beyond doubt that the animal
was eaten by the reindeer folk. In England it has been found in three
gravel-beds of late pleistocene age, near Maidenhead, at Freshford near
Bath, and at Greenstreet-green near Bromley. In 1866 the author dug
it out of the lower brickearth of Crayford in Kent, where it was as
sociated   with Rhinoceros Megarhinus, 22. leptorhinus (Owen), and
Elephas antiquus.       The skull in this latter case belonged to a re
markably    fine old male.    Thus its present limited range in space con
trasts most strongly with its wide range in pleistocene times through
North Siberia and central Europe, north of a line passing through the
Alps and Pyrenees.       Its association with animals of a temperate or
else southern zone is to be accounted for by its having been driven
from its usual haunts by an unusually severe Avinter. The rarity of its
remains proves that it was not so abundant as those animals which are
associated with it in France, Germany, and Britain.
    Professor Leidy figures and describes two fossil skulls most closely
allied to Ovibos moschatus, from Arkansas and Ohio, under the name of
Bootherum cavifrons and B. lombifrons; they are, however, most probably
the male and female of the same species. They differ from Ovibos mos
chatus only in the direction of their horn-cores, and in their bases meeting
and becoming fused on the coronal surface of the male skull. The
horn-cores are supported both by the frontals and parietals.          In other
respects they present the same ovine affinities      as Ovibos, and  certainly
belong to the    same genus.

 IV. " Variations in Human Myology          observed during the     Winter
        Session of 1866-67 at King's College, London."            By John
        Wood, F.R.C.S., Demonstrator of Anatomy (with a Table and
        Seven Drawings).       Communicated by Dr. Sbarpey.             Re
        ceived May 9, 1867.
     A largely increased number of abnormalities has been the result of
 a systematic observation of thirty-six subjects during the past winter
 session.    This has been owing partly to the comprehension of one or
two irregularities which are commonly referred to in systematic works
 on anatomy, — such as the coronoid origin of the^eaw pollicis longus and
the insertion of the extensor ossis metacarpi pollicis, partly to the more
productive results of a vigilant superintendence, an increased efficiency
in the dissections. For much of this the author's thanks are due to the
able help of his assistants, Messrs. Perrin and Amsden, and the intelli
gent zeal of many of the anatomical class.          Mainly, no doubt, the
increase is owing to an absolutely larger number of abnormalities.      The
value of the observations to the author is, of course, much increased by
his having personally and thoroughly examined every specimen before
noting it down, and, if possessing sufficient interest or novelty, sketch
ing it from the subject.     The exact numerical results thus arrived at
have, in almost all important particulars, confirmed, but in some modi
fied, the conclusions as to frequency and coincidence         given in the
author's former papers.       What the author has termed the lines of
variation, i. e. the particular muscles which are by far most commonly
affected, are nearly identical with those of last year, as will be found by
comparing the columns of the appended Table with those of the former.
 Only a few different will be found in the columns occupied by the
 sundry specimens.
     Out of the total number of 295 abnormalities of muscles in 34 sub
jects showing abnormalities (as compared with 132 in 32 subjects of
last year), we have in the head and neck 11 muscles affected with va
rieties, as compared with 10 of last year. In the arm we have 30 lines
of muscular variation as compared with 26 ; while in the leg we have 20
as compared with 14 in last year's subjects.
     The increase will be seen to be disproportionately greater in the leg.
In this part also is the absolute number of the specimens increased ; for
 while those in the head and neck proper (acting only on the parts or
 bones of the head, neck, and spine) are 15 as compared with 10, and
those of the arm 157 as compared with S3, those of the leg are increased
 to 10G as compared with 39. This raises the proportion of abnorma
 lities in the leg to two-thirds of those in the arms, as compared with
 rather less than one-half found last year. This seems to have some
 significance in being coincident with an increase in the number of female
subjects to 12, as compared with 4 in last year's list. The author has

  remarked in former papers upon the apparent greater frequency of one
                              "                                          " in
  variety in the foot, viz. the abductor ossis metatarsi quinti                the
 female subject.      This increase is clearly maintained in the results of the
  present investigation, and apparently extends to some other muscles also.
     To economize time, space, and the difficulties of tabulation, the expla
 nations necessary to understand the adjoined Table are taken, as before,
 in the order of the columns therein given.
     The first three are appropriated to the muscular varieties of the Head
 and Neck, numbering 31 instances, viz. 24 in the 22 males, and 7 in the
 12 females, affecting 15 different muscles.     Of these, the cleido-occipital,
 trapezius, occipito-scapular, and levator anguli scapulae, amounting to
 16 instances, are to be considered as belonging quite as much to the
 upper extremity.       This leaves 15 specimens affecting 11 muscles of the
 head and neck exclusively.
     1. Cleido-occipital. — By this name is signified a muscle usually about
 three-quarters of an inch wide, which, arising from the border of the
 clavicle outside the cleido-mastoid portion of the sterno-cleido-mastoi-
 deus, is placed parallel to the posterior border of the latter, and separated
 from it by a more or less wide areolar interval. It is distinguished
 from the cleido-mastoid proper by its insertion into the superior curved
 line of the occipital bone on the same plane as the fibres of the sterno-
 mastoid.     It joins close up to the trapezius, with which its upper
fibres are sometimes united. The true cleido-mastoid, on the other
 hand, is inserted deeper than the fibres of the sterno-mastoid into the
 mastoid portion of the temporal bone.         It has been recognized as an
occasional accessory portion of the sterno-cleido-mastoideus,        by Meckel,
Kelch,Soammerring,andHenle.            In animals  it forms  an  important part
of the muscle called the Cephalo-humeral. There were in the 84 subjects
examined no less than 12 specimens, all on both sides.          In subject 21 it
was very large, broad, and double, with a superficial slip of communi
cation with the cleido-mastoid. Last session the proportion of specimens
was strikingly similar, viz. one-third of the whole number of subjects.
    2. Omohyoid. — One of the five specimens of abnormality in this muscle
was found in the hinder belly arising from the whole length of the
middle third of the clavicle covering the subclavian artery (No. 17). In
the four others the anterior belly was implicated.        In No. 6 it received a
muscular slip from the sterno-hyoid.         In No. 19 it contributed a large
slip to the same muscle, the latter being double also at its origin, and
giving off a muscular bundle to its fellow on the opposite side across the
median line. In No. 20 the anterior belly was double, the posterior
portion being attached by fascia to the stylo-hyoid muscle, which did
not reach the hyoid bone. In No. 27 the anterior belly was triple, the
middle portion becoming the normal insertion, the front one being in
serted into the cervical fascia, and the hinder one implanted into the
upper horn of the thyroid cartilage.

     8. Ill one of the subjects (No. 8) the whole of the fibres of origin of
the Splenitis colli were placed superficial to, instead of deeper than, those
of the serratus posticus superior, which thus intervened between those
of the lower parts of splenius capitis and colli, the origins of these latter
being in other respects normal.
     In No. 28 was found a muscle which      presents what is possibly a fur
ther development of this displacement.       The muscle was flat and riband
like, three-quarters of an inch wide, attached above to the transverse
 process of the atlas behind the levator anguli scapula?, and between it
 and the splenius colli. Passing down and inwards for about 6 inches, it
 ended at the spinous process of the first dorsal vertebra in a short flat
 tendon with diverging fibres, which passing beneath the rhomboideus
 minor, became blended with the deep surface of the upper fibres of
 origin of the rhomboideus major half an inch from their attachment.
 Some of the fibres were lost on the tendon of the serratus posticus
 superior also.
      A muscle closely similar to this has been described by Mr. Macalister,
 of the Royal College of Surgeons of Dublin, in a paper published in the
                                                 '
    Proceedings of the Royal Irish Academy (April 1866, vol. ix. pi. v.)
 '
 under the name of the rhombo-axoid (by misprint for atloid) . In his case
 the muscle was connected, however, with the rhomboideus minor on its
 deep surface.      In both instances the splenius colli was coexistent.
      A still more striking muscular auomaly, and possibly a further de
 velopment of the same tendency, was seen in subject 20 (fig. 1).            A
 distinct riband-shaped muscle, three-quarters of an inch wide, a quarter
  of an inch thick, and 10 inches long (a), was attached to the occipital
  bone, on a level with the splenius capitis (S), directly under the line of
 junction of tho trapezius (c) with the cleido-occipital muscle (d), which
  was also present.      Passing down and outwards, superficial to and ob
  liquely across the splenii and covered by the trapezius, it was inserted by
  short tendinous fibres posterior- and superficial to the insertions of the
  rhomboideus minor (e) and major        (/)  muscles into the border of the
  scapula opposite to the spine and upper part of the infraspinous fossa.
   Its fibres of insertion were more or less blended with those of the
   rhomboids.
      The author has named this muscle the Ocnipito-scapular.       It may be
   considered   as a slip of connection from the origin of the trapezius (c)
   with the insertion of the levator anguli scapulas (g), in the same
   manner as the levator clavicular may be considered as a muscle connect
   ing the origin of the latter muscle with the insertion of the former,
   thus falling among a numerous class of abnormal human muscles as
   arranged by the author in his first paper upon the subject.      Its action
   would evidently be to approximate the scapula to the occiput, assisting
   the levator anguli ; and to raise the head backwards, assisting the com-
   plexus, splenius, and trapezius.      The author has not met with anv

markable by the additional presence in the fore leg of the same animal of
a somewhat fan-shaped muscle, connecting the epitrochlea and the ole
cranon. As far as the author is aware, this is also unrecorded hitherto.
It  is entirely distinct from the inner head of the triceps, from which it is
separated by the ulnar nerve.           Across the nerve this small muscle is
placed superficially.       The same muscle was found by the author in a
human male subject (No. 7 of the Table of last year's series) as a distinct
muscular slip, arising from the back part of the epitrochlea, bridging
over the ulnar nerve, and separated by it from the triceps above, and by
a distinct areolar interval from the fascial arch which gives origin to
the flexor carpi ulnaris muscle below.           A sketch of this muscle is given
in fig. 2 (a). It may be called the "Anconeus epitrochlearis."
   In two   subjects were found abnormalities of the Trapezius (Nos. 4 &
13).    The   first was one of deficiency, the fibres of origin of the right
muscle reaching only as low as the tenth dorsal spine, and those of the
left only to the eighth.       In the other the insertion of the muscle op
posite to the scapular spine gave off a strong aponeurotic slip down and
outwards to the lower angle of the scapula.
   In a very muscular subject with many irregularities (No. 11) was a
curious arrangement connected with the fibres of the Platysma just
below the chin. A superficial band of muscular fibreB, an inch and a
half wide, arose on both sides from the mastoid process and parotid
fascia, and passed down and forwards, slightly narrowing and thickening,
to unite with its fellow just below the point of the chin. It crossed the
insertion of the masseter, the angle of the lower jaw, and the facial

    In one subject (No. 5) the anterior belly of the Digastric was double,
 the inner abnormal one being attached to the median raphe, but not
 decussating with its fellow.
    In a female (No. 17) was found the curious muscular slip given in
fig. 3 (a), on the left side only.        It is called by the author the Mglo-
glossus muscle.       It arose tendinous from the inner border of the angle
 of the lower jaw, behind and below the internal pterygoid, spreading
 out down, inwards, and forwards, to be inserted into the fibres of the
 tongue, between the stylo- and hyo-glossus muscles (b & e), joining
 especially the latter. The facial artery passed deeper than the muscle,
 and the border of the submaxillary gland overlapped it.             Henle saw a
 cylindrical   muscle   arising  from   the same  place and joining  the posterior
 belly of the digastric (Muskellehre,         S.  112).  This  is the nearest ap
 proach  to  the   above  muscle   the  author  has found mentioned.
    The Stglo-pharyngeus was in one subject (No. 19) found doubled on
 the right side. In another (No. 26) the Scalenus medius arose by a
 thick band of fibres covering the intertransversalis from the transverse

process of the atlas.     In third (No. 27) the Scalenus anticut received
a large slip across   the  subclavian artery from the medius.      In No. 30
the Levator anguli scapulce sent a large slip of its fibres to join the inser
tion of the scalenus medius.
                                    Fig. 3.
   These interchanges have been frequently observed in these muscles.
In No.   32 was a well-marked specimen of the muscle named by the
author in his previous papers the Supra-costal.      It was attached below
to the third rib in front of the serratus magnus, and above to the first
rib and cervical fascia. In No. 33 it was a very distinct duplication of
the Rectus capitis posticus major, like that described by Albinus and San-
difort, and by Douglas both in Man and the Dog.
   Twenty-one columns of the accompanying Table are occupied by the
muscles of the upper extremity only. Twenty-six muscles are concerned.
The instances number 158, viz. 117 in the 22 males, and 41 in the 12
females.
   4. Pectoralis major. — The number and kind of abnormalities of this
muscle, as well as of the pectoralis minor, coincide almost exactly with
those of last year in nearly an equal number of subjects. In one (No. 5)
was  a detached slip arising separately from the abdominal aponeurosis
opposite the seventh costal cartilage, and crossing the axilla to be in
serted into the tendon of, and fascia covering, the coraco-brachialis about
an inch below the coracoid process. In another (No. 6) a similar slip
arose from the fifth rib connected with the lower fibres of the pectoralis
major, and was inserted with the pectoralis minor into the coracoid pro
cess joining on to the coraco-brachialis.    In No. 20 a separate slip arose
from the abdominal aponeurosis at some distance from the rest of the
muscle, and was inserted into the deep surface of its tendon at the upper

border, connected with the "frenum suspensoriuin."         Such slips of the
pectoralis major were noticed long ago by Sir Charles Bell (Anatomy,
p. 302, 1 829) . In No 32 a band of fibres, about an inch broad, detached
themselves from the lower border of the pectoralis major, and, curTing
gradually away from the rest down the arm, were inserted into a long
roundish tendon about three-eighths of an inch wide, which crossed the
brachial vessels and nerves obliquely down and inwards, and joined the
internal brachial ligament about 2 inches above the inner condyle. Al
together this was a fair specimen of the Chondro-epitrochlear muscle de
scribed and figured by the author in former papers as presenting a close
resemblance to the muscle so called in the Monkeys.         It has been de
scribed also by Soemmerring, Caldani, Theile, Grruber, Cruveilhier, Henle,
Hallett, Macwhinnie, and MacaJister. In another subject (No. 33) the
clavicular fibres of the pectoralis major were uninterruptedly continuous
with those of the deltoid, the cephalic vein passing through a foramen
low down.     Otto seems to have met with this peculiarity, which he de
scribes as absence of the clavicular fibres of the deltoid (Path. Anatom.
1830, S. 249).
   5. Pectoralis minor. — Pour subjects were found (Nos. 6, 8, 10, & 13)
to present an insertion of this muscle into the greater tuberosity of the
humerus by a flat tendon usually uniting with that of the supra-spina-
tus, but in one case separately inserted, and grooving the upper surface
of the coracoid process, where it was provided with a bursa. This ar
rangement was described in the author's last paper as resembling the
arrangement in the Mammalia.           It has been noticed by Meckel, Har
rison (Dissector,   i. p. 79), by Benson (Cycl. Anat. & Phys. i. p. 359),
and by Macalister (Journ. Anat. & Phys. No. ii. May 1867, p. 317).
In another (No. 9) the upper fibres of the left pectoralis minor were in
serted into a strong costo-coracoid membrane.        Those on the right side
had become developed      into a separate slip of muscle nearly an inch wide,
which w-as inserted into the lower border of the clavicle itself. This
slip was connected below with the second rib, constituting an approach
towards the formation of a Sterno-clavicular muscle, as described in the
author's last paper.
   6. Latissimus dorsi. — Five subjects were affected with varieties in the
insertion of this muscle. In two females (Nos. 17 & 24) the abnorma
                                              "
lity assumed the more common form of Achselbogen," viz. a short slip
across the vessels and nerves to the insertion of the pectoralis major.
In a male subject (No. 8) the slip on the right side was connected in a
peculiar way with the pectoralis minor, but, on the left, in the common
form with the pectoralis major. The former consisted of a flat, vertically
placed, muscular slip 1 inch broad, attached below to the upper edge of
the tendon of the latissimus dorsi, and above to the lower border of the
pectoralis minor about an inch from the coracoid process, covering partly
the axillary vessels and nerves.       In Nos. 20 & 28 the tendon of the

latissimus gave attachment to a strong, thick muscular slip, which, pas
sing separately down the upper fourth of the arm, finally joined to long
head of the triceps, presenting the most

marked approximation (especially in the
last subject) to the Dorso-epitrochlear
muscle in the Orang and other Simiadae
which the author has hitherto found in
the human subject.        Both the subjects
were males, presenting respectively 16
and 11 muscular variations.
     7. Biceps. — Five variations were pre
 sented by the origins of this muscle. Two,
 one male and one female (Nos. 7 & 24),
 showed on the left side the more common
 third head, arising from the humerus       be
 tween the coraco-brachialis    and brachialis
 anticus.    This was also present in the
 right   arm of another male (No. 27).      On
 the right arm of No. 7, and the left of
 No. 27, the third head arose    as a detached
 slip from the coracoid process, and, in
 one, from the capsular ligament also, form
 ing a fusiform belly which joined the ten
 don of insertion separately at the part
 which gives off the semilunar fascia. In
 two others, both males (Nos. 8 & 13), the
 varieties were found connected with the
 insertions of the muscle.     In the first it
 was found in the left arm only, and pre
 sented    a most complicated arrangement
  (fig. 4). The origin of the muscle was
 normal. Just below the junction of the
 two heads, about the middle of the upper
 arm, the muscle divided into three fusi
 form bellies.    The outer, which is largest
  (a), presents the normal insertions into
 the radius and semilunar fascia (cut att).
 The middle one (c),the smallest, ends in     a
 small rounded tendon, which, passing ob
 liquely down and inwards between the
 semilunar fascia and the radial insertion,
 becomes lost on the supinator fascia and
the bursa of the radial tuberosity (d).
The inner division (e), constituting the larger of the abnormal bellies,
 ends in a strong tendon which, at the elbow, divides into three slips, the

526          Mr.   J. Wood  on  Variations in Human Myology.         [May 23,
outer joining the coronoid insertion of the brachialis anticus at its inner
border (g) ; the middle once is implanted upon the deep or coronoid
origin of the pronator radii teres (f), and the inner, connected under
the superficial muscles with the coronoid origin of the flexor digito
rum sublimis.       We have thus in this complicated arrangement four in
sertions in addition to the usual two. These are, moreover, connected,
with four other muscles, viz. the brachialis anticus, the pronator radii
teres, the flexor sublimis digitorum, and the supinator brevis.
    In another subject also (No; 13), the biceps sent a slip to join the
coronoid origin of the pronator radii teres.        It was detached from the
middle of the inner border of the muscle, as a band of muscular fibres
provided with a separate tendon.         In the right arm this joined with the
semilunar fascia, and on the left with the pronator.
    8. Coraco-brachialis. — In four instances this muscle presented a com
plete interval between its lower fibres implanted into the internal inter
muscular septum and brachial ligament, and its upper fibres, inserted
into the humerus.       In one (No. 27) its highest fibres were inserted into
a fibrous band, constituting an upward prolongation of the internal
brachial ligament across the tendon of the latissimus dorsi and teres
major, as described by Henle.           In all, the musculo-cutaneous nerve
passed between the two portions.         In No. 30 the muscle was inserted
into the intermuscular septum at quite the lower third of the arm.
    9. Brachialis anticus. — In two subjects a slip of the outer fibres of
this muscle was continued into those of the supinator longus. In one
right arm (No. 26) it sent off over the brachial vessels and median nerve
a slip of fascia to join the semilunar.     In one (No. 31) it was deeply di
vided down the middle, the outer part sending some fibres into the
supinator longus, and others into the bicipital semilunar fascia.          The
first-mentioned peculiarity has been before described by the author, and
the last has been noticed by Hildebrandt, Soemmerriug, Theile, and
Meckel, and was compared by the last-named anatomist to the arrange
ment in Birds.
    10. Flexor sublimis digitorum v. perforatum. — Out of nine instances
of irregularities in this muscle two were specimens of deficiency.          In
one (No. 5) the radial origin was entirely absent, in another (No. 18)
the tendon to the little finger was wanting. This has been noticed by
Meckel, Theile, and Henle. In No. 9, a muscular slip from the middle
of the pronator radii teres joined the radial fibres of the sublimis. This
has been noticed by Otto.        In four subjects (Nos. 6, 8, 21, & 31) the
origin  of the  flexor sublimis  was variously differentiated.    In the right
arm of No. 6, a separate muscle arising from the inner border of the
coronoid process gave off the perforatum tendon of the index.
   A separate coronoid or middle head is described in many text-books
as a normal arrangement for the flexor sublimis digitorum.
   In almost every subject, however, the author has found that the fibres

1867.]        Mr.  J.  Wood on Variations in Human Myology.              527
composing the superficial or condyloid head are continued uninterrup
tedly along the internal lateral ligament to the inner margin of the
coronoid process, which they occupy along nearly its whole length, and
are frequently connected there with the coronoid tendon of the prona
tor radii teres. This part usually gives rise to the indicia! tendon of
the muscle. In the subject above mentioned it constituted a separate
muscle. In addition to this, the most common coronoid attachment,
however, there sometimes exists a strong flat tendon arising from the
outer and lower border of the coronoid process and joining, not the
condyloid, but the radial origin of the muscle.
    In the sketches of the muscular anatomy of the limbs of an adult
female Orang-utan dissected by the author, he finds that in this animal
this flat coronoid tendon gives attachment not only to some of the fibres
of the radial origin of the sublimis, but also to the flexor carpi radiali*,
which arises both from it and from the oblique line and outer border of
the radius by a common aponeurosis with the sublimis.          This arrange
ment has been observed by Mr. Macalister in the human arm (op. cit.
p. 12).     In the Orang, the four tendons of the flexor sublimis are
attached to separate muscles, the areolar intervals between which are
very readily separable.      That to the index lies deepest, and arises from
the upper coronoid origin and lateral ligament. Those to the second and
third fingers both arise from the oblique line and border of the radius,
the latter being superficial and attached also to the condyle of the hume
rus, while the former is connected chiefly with the lower coronoid ten
don, but having a separate slip also from the internal lateral ligament ;
while the muscle to the little finger arises superficially from the condyle
of the humerus.
    In one of the above-mentioned varieties of the flexor sublimis (No. 8)
was a separate fusiform muscle to the little finger, arising from a tendi
nous intersection springing from the condyle of the humerus.               In
another (No. 21) the tendons of the left index and little fingers both
were connected with a digastric muscle with a tendinous intersection
in the middle, arising from the condyle, internal lateral ligament and
 upper coronoid origin. This has been observed by Macalister in a fe
 male subject, with many other irregularities.      Such a digastric portion
 has been recorded also by Meckel (Muskellehre, S. 536).          The same
 author describes a similar intersection in the Loris (Anat. Comp. 6.
 p. 340).    In No. 31 all the tendons were provided with separate mus
 cles, the first arising with a digastric formation from the condyle, inter
 nal lateral ligament and coronoid process ; the second from the radius
 and lower coronoid tendon ; the third from the condyle and internal
 lateral ligament ; and the fourth from the condyle only. In No. 10
 was a tendinous slip from the superficial surface of the sublimis to the
 annular ligament, the palmaris longus being normal.
    11. Flexor digitorum profundus v. perforam. — In four subjects (Nos.

  528          Mr. J. Wood         on Variations in Human Myology.             [May  23,
  3, 9, 26, & 34) gome of the indicia! fibres of this muscle arose from the
  inner part of the front surface of the radius.             In one (No. 9) these were
  inserted into the side of the long tendon of a fusiform muscle, which
  (arising with the coronoid origin of the flexor sublimis in connection
 with a similar one passing to the flexor longus pollicis) passed under the
 annular ligament aud divided into two, one to join the tendon of the
 flexor longus pollicis, and the other (larger) that of the index perforans.
 This arrangement, somewhat dissimilar to those formerly described bj
 authors, is yet formed on the same plan or type of the connection be
 tween the flexors of the thumb and index and the flexor sublimis.                     It
 forms a coalescence of the
                                       " Accessori us ad flexorem pollicis longum,"
 with the    "  .Accessorius     ad  flexorem   digitorum profundum
                                                                         " of Gantzer.
     In No. 26 one half of the muscular fibres of the flexor longua pollicis
 were implanted upon the tendon of the index perforans.                     In the left
 arm of No. 6 was found a detached muscular slip from the outer part of
 the profundus, ending in a tendon which joined that of the sublimis per-
foratus of the index in the palm.               It was in the right arm of the same
 subject that the detached perforatus muscle of the index before described
 was found.         In three (Nos. 10, 28, & 33) were found detached mus-
 culo-tendinous slips of the profundus in the fore arm of a like type. In
 No. 10 it was single, and gave part origin to the fourth lumbricalis.
 In No. 28 it was lost on the synovial sheath of the tendons in the palm,
 and in No. 33 it was connected both with this and with the first lumbri
 calis.    This has been noticed by Soemmerring, Theile, and Henle.                   In
 six subjects were found a coronoid origin of the flexor profundus, arising
 in common with the fibres of the flexor sublimis as a fusiform tapering
 muscle ending in a rounded tendon.                 In four (Nos. 7, 9, 13, & 20) this
 tendon joined        the   perforating tendon of the index finger ; in one (No.
 25)   that  of   the   middle    finger : and in another (No. 31) those of the
 ring-   and   little   fingers.     This muscle is mentioned by Meckel, Soem
 merring, Theile, Henle, and by Cowper and Macwhinnie.                    It was named
 by   Gantzer    the   "  Musculus      accessorius   ad flexorem   profundum digito
 rum." In No. 9, as before described, it received muscular fibres also
 from the radius.
     12. Flexor pollicis longus.— hi twelve subjects this muscle also de
 rived a separate fusiform musculo-tendinous origin from the coronoid
 process of the ulna.          This has been noticed by Albinus, Otto, Soemmer
 ring,  and  Meckel,       and  was called by Gantzer the " Accessorius ad flexo
 rem pollicis longum."            It is usually alluded to by text-book writers as
 an   occasional     origin,  described    by some from the outer, and by others
 from the inner side of the coronoid process.                The proportion of its oc
 currence in thirty-six subjects is one-third.             In only three was the origin
 at all separate from the coronoid fibres of the sublimis.                   It usual]?
 assumes the form of a tapering muscle, detaching itself from the indicia!
 fibres of the sublimis, often in connection with the similar contribution

1867.]          Mr.  J. Wood    on Variations in Human Myology.               529
to the flexor profundus, and ending in         a tendon more or less long, which
joins that of the flexor pollicis longus.        In three instances the junction
 took place below the middle of the arm. In a former paper the author
 described a remarkable development and amalgamation of these acces
 sory origins of the flexor longus pollicis and profundus digitorum in a
 Negro, resulting in a complete set of tendons to each of the fingers
 placed intermediate to those of the sublimis and profundus.
      In the Dog, the coronoid origins constitute the chief bulk of the united
 flexors. In the Cat, Hedgehog, Guinea-pig, Rabbit, and many other ani
 mals they form a great part of them.
      In No. 7 was a muscular, and in Nos. 8, 20, & 33 a tendinous connec
 tion of the tendons of the Flexor longus pollicis and Index perforans, con
 stituting a more decided tendency to the complete union of these muscles
 found in the lower animals than even in the instances above-mentioned
  of the radial origin of the flexor profundus. This connection exists more or
  less completely in all the Apes and Monkeys, reaching its most peculiar de
  velopment by the entire substitution of the flexor longus pollicis by a
  separated and entire flexor indicis in the Orang-utan.           It is evidently
  the homologous representative of the tendon of connection between the
flexor longus hallucis and flexor longus digitorum in the foot.
      13. Lumbricales. — In two subjects (Nos. 3 & 5) the fourth lumbri
  calis on the right side was inserted into the extensor aponeurosis on
  the ulnar side of the ring-finger (which was thus provided with two,
   acting in different directions), instead of the little finger, which was
   destitute. In Nos. 11 & 34, in the right hand, and in No. 32 in both
   hands, the third lumbricalis was bifurcated, one being inserted into
   the ulnar side of the middle digit (which was thus provided with
   one on each side), while the other was inserted into the usual place. In
   the left hand of No. 33 both the third and fourth lumbricalis were bi
   furcated, the middle and ring-fingers both having a lumbricalis on each
   side.   These abnormalities have been described by Meckel, Theile, and
  Froment.      According to the last-named author, the lumbricales are
  irregular in nearly half the number of subjects, the third being the most
   frequently bifurcated, and next, the fourth. In half, the author has
  found the irregularities on both sides ; when single, he has found the
  right and left to be in about equal proportions irregular.
      14. Flexor carpi radialis brevis v. profundus. — In only two subjects
   has the author found this year the muscle described by him in previous
   papers under this name.       Both were imperfect specimens, arising in a
   penniform way     from  the  radius   outside the flexor longus pollicis, and
   inserted by a rounded tendon, which in one subject (No. 32) was as large
   as that of the flexor pollicis itself, into that deep portion of the annular
   ligament which is attached to the trapezoid and base of the middle me
   tacarpal bone, secluding the sheath of the flexor carpi radialis tendon.
    In one (No. 20) the palmaris longus was normal. In the other it was

 530         Mr.   J. Wood   on   Variations in Human Myology.       [May 23,
 represented     by a small slip from the superficial surface of the flexor
 carpi   radialis.   Mr. Macalister of Dublin has communicated to the
 author the description of a complete specimen of this muscle inserted
 into the base of the middle metacarpal bone. It existed in the right
 arm only, and had its origin from the radius internal, instead of exter
 nal, to the flexor pollicis longus.     He has also met with an instance of
 an incomplete muscle of this kind inserted into the deep portion of the
 annular ligament, also on the right arm. Apalmaris longus was present
 in one of these cases, but not in the other.
    It is somewhat remakable that in these two cases, as in all the eight
 cases observed by the author, this muscle has been found in the right
 arm only.     It offers the best homologue in the arm to the tibialis posti
 cus in the leg.
    15. Palmaris longus. — In three subjects (Nos. 5, 24, & 32) the normal
 palmaris was absent in both arms.          It was also wanting in the right
 arm of No. 28, and in the left of No. 27. In three (5, 27, & 32) there
 was a feeble slip of tendon from the superficial muscular fibres of the
flexor carpi radialis to the superficial surface of the middle portion of the
 palmar fascia, which seemed to supply its place.       This relation between
 thetwo muscles is interesting in connection with the occurrence of a flexor
 carpi radialis brevis in one of these subjects (32). In the left arm of
 one subject (No. 28) both the tendon and muscular portions of the pal
 maris were doubled, the supernumerary one being smaller and placed
 internal and posterior to the other, and arising with the condyloid
 portion of the Bublimis.       Its tendon was spread out and lost on the
 fascia at the wrist, a little above the annular ligament. In the right arm
 of another (No. 34) the tendon of an otherwise normal palmaris was
 doubled, both portions being inserted into the annular ligament and
 palmar fascia. In a third (No. 8, the subject of fig. 4) the belly of this
 muscle was inverted (A) and placed just above the wrist.
    16. Extensores carpi radiales. — In no less than fifteen subjects these
 muscles presented the intervening muscle and tendon, named by the
 author the extensor carpi radialis intermedins.      In six this muscle arose
 fleshy with the longior, and was inserted by a long tendon with, but
 distinct from, the brevior into the base of the third metacarpal bone.
 In four it arose with the belly of the brevior, and its tendon was di
 stinctly inserted with that of the longior into the second metacarpal.     In
 one subject it was arranged in the first way on the left arm, and in the
 second on the right ; while in the remaining four it was double, e. g.
 there were two additional muscular bellies intervening between the
 longior and brevior, with long tendons crossing in exchange in opposite
 directions.     In one, these tendons were united and more or less blended
 as they crossed each other.       Such   an arrangement   has been recorded
 by Macalister (op. cit. p. 13). In another (No. 26) the left arm was
 provided with a single-bellied intermedins with two tendons, one going

1867.]           Mr. J. Wood   on  Variations in Human Myology.           531
to that of the longior, and the other to the insertion of the brevior.     In
another (No. 14) the longior was, in addition, provided with two tendons
by division.        In two subjects (Nos. 30 & 31) the tendon of the
extensor carpi radial is brevior was inserted into the inner corner of the
base of the second metacarpal bone as well as into the third.       This was
 the case also in two of those which were provided with an extensor
 intermedius (Nos. 29 & 32).        It is interesting as showing how an in
 termediate tendon and muscle may be formed by simple fission of the
 brevior.
     17. Extensor carpi ulnaris. — In two subjects (Nos. 7 & 21) this
 muscle gave off a slip of its lower tendon to the extensor aponeurosis
  of the little finger. In one (No. 11) the abductor minimi digiti arose
  partly from the tendon, and was further provided with two other di
  stinct origins — one from the pisiform bone, and the other from the upper
  border of the posterior annular ligament, evincing a tendency to the
  high origin described and figured in the author's former papers, and
  previously recorded by Giinther, Milde, and Scemmerring.
     18. Supinator longits. — In three out of the four varieties found in
  this muscle, the tendon of insertion was double. In one (No 8, fig. 4, i)
  the lower insertion was the larger and normal one at the base of the
  radial styloid process, while the upper one was attached to the outer
  border of the radius three inches above, the radial nerve passing between
  them to the back of the hand. In No. 34 the same arrangement was
  present in both arms. In another (No. 21) the radial nerve passed
  higher than both tendons.       In one subject (No. 28) the tendon was
  divided   into three portions, the  lowest and largest being inserted into
  the usual place, the upper one near the middle of the radius, and the
  intermediate one opposite the upper border of the pronator quadratus.
  The radial nerve passed between the two latter.
      19. Extensor communis digitorum. — In two subjects (Nos. 8 & 28)
  the tendons of this muscle on the back of the hand were doubled ; in
  the first for each digit, and in the last for the middle and ring-
  fingers only. In one (No. 29) the tendon of the index only was
  doubled, one being connected by a lateral slip with that of the middle
  finger, as the latter was to that of the ring-finger, and this, — with that
  of the little finger. It so resulted that all the tendons were thus joined
  together, except one of the two tendons of the index.         The indicator
  was normal, but the extensor      minimi   digiti gave a tendon to the ring-
  finger. By means of these special tendons, the individual play of each
  finger was kept free.     In one subject (No. 21) there was found, in the
  left hand, a single fleshy slip of the muscle first described by the author
   as the Extensor brevis digitorum mantis, arising from the dorsal surface
   of the os magnum and unciforme, and passing to the extensor aponeurosis
   on the radial side of the middle digit. In another (No. 23) there were
   found, in both hands, two slips passing from the same bones and from

 532         Mr.  J. Wood    on Variations in Human Myology.          [May 23,
 the posterior carpal ligament, to the ulnar side of tbe middle and ring-
fingers, joining the extensor aponeurosis by separate, slender, flat tendons
    20. Extensor minimi digiti.—La nearly half the number of subjects
 was the tendon of this muscle doubled (tig. 5, c).           In one (No. 3)
 there were, further, two distinct muscular bellies.         Iu two subjects
 (Nos. 29 & 34) the additional tendon was inserted with the common
 extensor tendon     into the ring-finger, as in the Orang, ApeH, Monkeys,
 Rabbit, Hedgehog, <fcc. In the Cat and Dog the third and second digit*
 also are supplied by it.
    21. Extensor indicis and Extensor medii digit i. — In two subjects
  (Nos. 8 & 27) the indicator was provided with a double tendon, showing
 the first tendency to the formation of a special extensor of the middle
 finger, such as that found as a distinct muscle iu the remarkable ar
 rangement seen in fig. 5 (a).      Both these are constant muscles in the
 Apes and Monkeys.
    22. Extensor ossis metacarpi pollicis. — An increase in the number of
 tendons of this muscle was seen in 16 subjects out of 36, t. e., nearly half.
 In four the tendon was simply doubled, both being inserted into the
 base of the first metacarpal bone. In four others one of the two tendons
 was inserted into the trapezium. In one (No. 25) the tendon was triple,
 two being inserted into the metacarpal, and one into the trapezium.
 In seven instances the tendon sent off a slip which gave part origin to
 the fibres of the abductor pollicis brevis. These sometimes formed a
 separate muscle.       In four of these there were two tendons only, one
 inserted into the base of the metacarpal bone, and the other going to the
 abductor.     In two (Nos. 20 & 31) there were three tendons, one to
 the metacarpal bone, another to the trapezium, and the third to the
 abductor pollicis.     Such an arrangement has been recorded by Maca-
 lister (op. cit. p. 13). In one (No. 11) there were no less than four
 tendons, three of which were inserted into the middle of the shaft and
 base of the metacarpal bone, and one went to the abductor.             In the
 last subject the    extensor primi  internodii pollicis was  entirely  absent,
 increasing the similarity in the arrangement of these muscles to that
 found in the Chimpanzee and Orang.         In two other subjects (Nos. 6 <t
 21) the muscular part of the extensor primi was entirely blended with
 that of the extensor ossis metacarpi, though the tendon was separate
 and its insertion distinct, into the base of the first phalanx of the
 thumb.
    23. Interossei mantis. — Three specimens of the " Palmar interosseus of
             " of Henle were found.       Iu two subjects (Nos. 4 & 20) the
 the thumb
 first interosseous space was occupied by two muscles, one, the " Abductor
          " of Albinus and the older anatomists, and the other
 indicis                                                             the " In

 indicis" of Douglas (Myograph. Comp. p. 181).

found, in a female subject (No. 3), the muscle described by the author
as the Extensor pollicis et indicis (fig. 5, b). Arising by a distinct pen-
niform belly from the hinder surface of the ulna, interosseous ligament

 and the extensor indicis, it ended in   a strong rounded     tendon, which,
 passing  under  those of the extensor   communis, parallel   with   and out
 side those of the indicator and extensor medii digiti, divided in the groove
 of the annular ligament into two tendons. The outer of these joined
 that of the extensor secundi on the middle of the first phalanx of the

  thumb, to be inserted with it into the extreme phalanx, and the inner,
  smaller, was inserted separately into the base of the first phalanx of the
  index, outside of, and distinct from, the tendons of the common extensor
  and indicator proper.       The author has found the same arrangement in
  the Vampire Bat, Dog, Cat, Hedgehog, and Rabbit.           Meckel found it in
  the Bear, Coati, and Beaver.
      In its insertion, this specimen differs from those formerly described
  by the author by joining the tendon of the extensor secundi internodii
  pollicis. In the others it joined or substituted that of the extensor primi
  internodii which was present and normal in the subject of the woodcut
   (fig. 5). This arm presents an extraordinary instance of multiplication of
  these special extensor muscles of the hand.       In a specimen of the above
  muscle    described  by Macalister  (p. 4), the indicia!  tendon joined that
  of the indicator, and was inserted into the second and third phalanges
  of the index.
      In   one subject (No. 11) the Extensor primi internodii pollicis was
  altogether wanting on both sides. A small tendinous looking ligament
  was attached to the styloid process of the radius and passed to the base
  of the first phalanx of the thumb, which seemed to represent the lower
  part of its tendon on both sides. It indicated an arrest of development
  in the muscular germ above, and was unattended by any evidence of
  diseased action, or any peculiarity in the muscular part of the extensor
  ossis metacarpi pollicis, usually so closely connected with this muscle.
  The occasional total absence of this muscle was noticed by Soemmerring
  and Meckel.       In one subject (No. 21) the extensor primi internodii
  pollicis was entirely blended at its muscular portion with the extensor
  ossis metacarpi, its tendon becoming free at the styloid process of the
  radius.     This has been observed by Theile. In two subjects (Nos. 20
"
  & 34) the tendon of the same muscle sent a large portion (in the last
  the chief portion) of its fibres to join that of the extensor secundi at
  the base of the ungual phalanx.        Soemmerring has observed this pecu
  liarity.    Macalister found once in about nine subjects an opposite ar
  rangement to this, viz., the tendon of the extensor secundi giving a slip
  to the base of the first phalanx.     This has been also seen by the author
  in cases of absence    of the extensor  primi internodii.
      In  one female subject (No. 17) was found a large slip of the spinal
  fibres of the Infraspinatus passing superficially to the rest of the
  muscle and to the teres minor, to be inserted into the lowest part of the
  hinder border of the greater tuberosity.
      In  a male subject  (No. 14) was found, in the right arm, a fine speci
  men of the detached portion of the subscapularis, which has been de
  scribed by Professor Haugbton under the name of Infraspinatus se-
  cundus, and by Macalister under that of Subscapulo-humeral or capsular.
  It was quite detached from the subscapularis, arising from the border
  of the scapular as a flat muscular band, 1 inch wide, crossed the long

  head   of the triceps, and became inserted into the neck of the humerus at
  the same place as the capsular ligament, overlapped a little by the tendon
  of the latissimus dorsi. This muscle has been found by Haughton in tho
  Macacus nemestrinus and other Quadrumana, and by Macalister in the
  Horse, Seal, and other Mammalia. In No. 24 was found a Transvcrsus
  mantis, entirely separate from the bulk of the fibres of the abductor
 pollicis, and arising chiefly from the neck of the third metacarpal bone
 and transverse ligament.
     The remaining ten columns in the Table are occupied by abnorma
 lities of the lower extremity, affecting 23 muscles, a*nd comprising 100
 instances, viz. 74 in the 22 males, and 32 in the 12 females.
     25. Peroneus tertius. — This muscle presented varieties in no less
 than 14 subjects. In no less than five it was absent ; in three, on both
 sides, viz. two males (Nos. 24 & 28) and one female (No. 16). In two
 other females (Nos. 10 & 24) it was totally absent on one side only,
 in one in the right, and in the other in the left leg, the representative
 in the other leg being in each case so small as to be of little account.
 In one, indeed, it was a mere slender band of fibrous tissue attached to
 the lower fibres of the extensor communis digitorum.         It may be said,
 then, that in one-fourth of the 12 female subjects it was wanting, and
 in two only out of the 22 males. In two males (Nos. 20 & 27) its tendon
 was doubled.       In two other males (Nos. 30 & 32) its tendon was in
 serted into the base of the fourth as well as the fifth metatarsal bone.
 In four (Nos. 3, 8, 11, & 29) it sent forward a slip to join the extensor
 aponeurosis of the little toe, in the way of the peroneus quinti from tho
 hrevis.    In all these four, except on the right leg of No. 8, the true pe
 roneus quinti from the brevis was coexistent.       Both these varieties have
 been well known to anatomists since Meckel. In one (No. 7) the slip
 was lost on the fascia covering the last dorsal interosseus, and did not
reach the toe.
     26. Peroneus quinti. — In 12 subjects (or one-third of the whole) was
found a representative tendon of this animal muscle more or less com
plete, connected with the tendon of the peroneus hrevis, and leaving it
just below the malleolus. In three (Nos. 2, 16, & 26) the slip was at
tached to the front end of the fifth metatarsal bone, and more or less
blended with the dorsal interosseous fascia — an arrangement which was
noticed by Meckel in some subjects unprovided with a peroneus tertius.
In all the nine other instances the tendon was more fully developed,
and joined in forming the extensor aponeurosis of the little toe. In one
subject only (No. 17) was it . confined to one side. Three were found
in the 12 female subjects, and nine in the 22 males, showing a larger
proportion in the latter.
    27. Extensor prvmi internodii hallucis longus. — In no less than 19
subjects, or more than one half, was found, in both legs, a long tendon
attached to the inner part of the base of the first phalanx of the great
    Vol.  XV.                                                   2 X

 toe distinct from that of the extensor brevis digitortim.        In three subjects
 (Nos. 9, 17, & 31) this tendon was provided with a well-developed and
 distinct penniform muscular belly, arising from the fibula and inter
 osseous ligament, and separated by an areolar interval from that of the
 extensor longus or proprius hallucis. In a male subject (No. 9) this
 muscle lay at first outside the extensor proprius, and was provided with
 two tendons, the outer ono joining the great-toe tendon of the extensor
 brevis, and the inner, crossing under that of the extensor proprius, was
 inserted into the usual place on the inner border of the base of the
first phalanx.   ¦ In  a female (No. 17) the muscle lay to the inner side of
 the extensor proprius, its tendon subdividing in the same way, and going
 to the same destinations      as the last specimen,     but the outer one cross
 ing in this case under the extensor proprius.                 In another female
 (No. 31)    the right  leg  was provided   with   a distinct  muscle  of this kind,
 with a single tendon joining that of the extensor brevis.              In the left
 leg  it was  represented only by    a slip  of  tendon    given from   that of the
 extensor proprius at the ankle, and lying inside it along the foot to the
 first phalanx, where it was inserted in the usual way. In the 14 other
 subjects, the latter was the arrangement in both legs, the muscular
 fibres, together with the upper part of the tendon, being united more
 or less with those of the extensor proprius.'' Meckel remarks that the
 above abnormality is homologous to the extensor primi internodii pol-
 licis in the hand. It is also mentioned by Sosmmerring, Theile. and
 Hcnle.
     In a male subject (No. 23) this tendon to the base of the first
 phalanx of the hallux was given off from the outer side of that of
 the tibialis anticus.      This anomaly had been previously found by the
 author in two subjects (also males), which were described and figured in
 his first paper on the subject.       He is not aware that it has been. ob
 served by any other anatomist.          It is not to be confounded with the
 common insertion of a slip of the tibialis tendon into the base of the
 first metatarsal bone. During the last j,Scssion a fine example of this
 formation was seen in a still-born male foetus, which was not found to
 present any other muscular variety.            In another adult male (No. 33)
 it was found in the right leg, with the addition of a second slip of
 tendon from the extensor proprius; while in the left leg, two" slips came
 from that of the latter muscle, the outer joining the tendon of the e-r-
 tensor brevis digitorum, and the inner inserted separately into the base
 of the first phalanx of the hallux, as before seen in those (Nos. 9 &
  17) with complete muscular bellies.         The forward prolongation from
 the tendon of the tibialis anticus to the hallux presents a curious pa
 rallel on the inside to that of the quinti from the peroneus brevis on
 the outside of the foot.       A .blending of the tibialisjanticus with the
  long extensor of the great toe is said by Meckel to be found in the Por
  cupine.    Six out of the nineteen subjects possessing a separate tendon

to the base of the hallux were females (one half of the whole number
of subjects of this ses). These comprised two out of the three com
plete specimens.
     28. Extensor longus digitorum pedis.— In one subject (No. 6) the in
nermost tendon of this muscle detached a separate slip to be inserted
into the      base  of the first phalanx of the second toe, producing an exact
analogy to the arrangement in the great toe last described, and which
also coexisted in the same subject.            It is mentioned by Meckel as ho
mologous to the indicator in man, and as also found in the Pig and Por
cupine (Anat. Comp. vi. pp. 429 & 432).             In another (No. 9) a connect
ing slip from the innermost tendon of the long common extensor joined
at the base of the metatarsals with that of the extensor propritts liallucis.
 A similar arrangement is said by Meckel to be found in the Kangaroo
 and in the Euminauts.         In one (No. 11) the tendons of the second, third,
 and fourth toes arose by a separate muscular belly from the outer tube
 rosity of the tibia and head fibula ; that to the fifth toe coming from the
 fibres of the peroneus tertitis.      This is found, according to Meckel, in the
 Hyama, Bear, and other Carnivora, aud also in the Kangaroo and some
 Rodents. In one subject (No. 19) two small slips of tendon, from those
 of the two outermost toes, were inserted into the shafts of the fourth and
 fifth metatarsals respectively.       This is similar to the arrangement found
 in the Sloths and Eeptiles. In No. 23 there was a reduplication of the
 extensor tendon of the little toe. In No. 26 the outermost tendon of the
 extensor longus was connected with that of the extensor brevis by a
 long slip arising from the former above the annular ligament, and join
 ing the latter on the dorsum of the foot. In two (Nos. 32 & 33) the
 tendons of the long extensor were each provided with a separate mus
 cular belly. In tho former there was also a double tendon to the
 second toe.
     29. Extensor brevis digitorum pedis. — In one subject (No. 9) a tendi
 nous slip from the second tendon of this muscle joined that of the first
 dorsal interosseus       ; and another    from the third tendon, that of the
 second dorsal interosseus.         In No. 11 this connection existed with the
first     dorsal   interosseus   only.  This evidence of connection between
 these muscles is interesting in relation to the occasional formation of an
 extensor brevis digitorum in the hand, which the author has in former
 papers explained by posterior displacement and separation of the super
  ficial fibres of the dorsal interossei.           In two (Nos. 23 & 26) the
 tendons to the second too were doubled.
      30.  Flexor longus digitorum      and    Flexor accessorius. — In one sub
 ject (a female) the first tendon of the former muscle                was entirely
  wanting,     its  place being supplied    to  the   second toe by  one from the
  flexor liallucis, approaching the formation in some of the Apes. In
  No. 14 was found a fully developed specimen of the flexor longus ac-
   ces/sorius, arising from the lower third of the hinder surface of the
                                                                    2x2

fibula and the adjacent aponeurosis, as a distinct muscle ending in a
stout tendon, which passed under the annular ligament outside the
vessels, and was joined by the muscular fibres of the
                                                             " massa carnea
Sylvii," and by the tendons of the perforans in the middle of the sole.
The fibres of its tendon passed exclusively to the three outer toes. In
 No. 15 the " massa carnea " was replaced by a thick tendon attached
 to the inner border of the tuber calcis. At its junction with the outer
 tendon of origin, a small flat muscular belly was developed upon it.      In
 the right foot of No. 24, a tendon from the outer head of an otherwise
 normal accessorius was joined to the superficial or perforated tendon of
 the middle toe, forming decussating fibres with others from the opposite
 side of the latter in the usual way.    Three out of the four abnormali
 ties in these muscles were found in female subjects.    The complete^eror
 accessorius longus was seen, however, in a male subject, as in the three
 instances described last year.
    31. Imnbricales pedis. — All the abnormalities in these muscles re
 sulted from deficiency.     In two the fourth was absent, one on the
 right side and one on the left. In one the second was wanted on both
 sides.    All were male subjects.
    32.  Flexor brevis digitorum. —All the varieties of this muscle were
 also from deficiency.    In all the seven subjects affected, the tendon to
 the little toe was absent, and, in Bix out of seven, on both sides.       In
  one (No. 3) its place was supplied by a small fusiform slip of muscle,
 arising from the outermost tendon of the flexor longus perforans.         In
 another (No. 4) the supplementary muscle arose by two slender fusi
 form bellies, one from the long flexor tendon, and the other from the
 inner tubercle of the calcis, deeper than the fibres of the flexor brevis di
 gitorum. This, which the author looks upon as a transitional form to
 the arrangement found in No. 3, and in the Apes and Monkeys, was
 precisely like that given in the author's paper of 1865.      In the rest of
 the subjects no substitute to the missing tendon was found, though pos-
 Bibly a feeble development may have escaped observation in some of
 them.     Meckel has remarked on the frequent deficiency of this tendon
 in the human foot, and also that it is not always supplemented by the
 flexor perforans, comparing it to the usual deficiency of the flexor
  brevis in the Monkeys, and its total disappearance in other Mammalia.
    33. Abductor ossis metatarsi quinti. — No less than 17 specimens of
 this muscle, arising separately from the outer tubercle of the ealca-
  neum, and inserted into the tubercular base of the fifth metatarsal
  bone, were found in the 36 subjects (very nearly one half).       In three
  subjects it was found on the right foot only, and in two, on the left
  only. In the other 12 it existed on both sides. Ten of the spe
  cimens were found in the 24 males, and seven in the 12 females, giving
  a preponderance of frequency in the latter sex.     This preponderance in
  the female sex is still more striking, if the cases given in the author's

1867.]       [Mr.   J. Wood   on   Variations in Human Myology.            539
last    paper are included in the estimate ; 8 having been found in the
36     females (or one half), while only 16 were found in the 51 males
(not one-third).      If  this be established by future observation, as well
as the more frequent deficiency of the peroneus tertius in the same
sex before alluded to, its bearing upon the relative structural inferiority
of the sex will be curious, since both are animal peculiarities.
     Mr. Macalister states that he has found the abductor of the fifth meta
 tarsal bone existing as a distinct muscle in nine out of every twelve sub
jects. Id No. 5 of the Table the muscle was peculiar in arising from the
 inner tubercle of the calcaneum by a large, distinct, and triangular fleshy
 belly, and in being inserted by a long tendon into the neck or anterior
 part of the shaft, instead of the tubercle of the fifth metatarsal bone.
     34. Out of 18 sundry specimens of abnormalities in the lower extre
 mity, two were peculiarities of the tendon of the Flexor longus hallucis.
 In one, a female (No. 3), the usual slip of union with the flexor longus
 digitorum was wanting. In another female (No. 6) the flexor longus hal
  lucis first received a long slip from t\ie flexor communis, and then gave
 two separate tendons to the second and third toes. That to the second
 constituted the only perforating tendon, the one from the common
  flexor being wanting, while that to the third toe joined at the base of
 tbe digit with a smaller one from the common flexor. In two male
  subjects (Nos. 5 & 21) the Plantains muscle and tendon were both ap
  parently blended with the outer head of the gastrocnemius.          In No. 30
  tbe Superior gemellus was wanting. In the right foot of No. 8, a male
  subject remarkable for the number of its abnormalities, a considerable
 portion of the outer fibres of the Flexor brevis hallucis were detached
  from the rest, and inserted into the inner tubercle on the base of the
  first phalanx of the second toe. In the left foot of the same subject a
  still larger slip from the fibres of the Adductor hallucis was detached to
  the same destination.       This was also found as a less developed spe
  cimen in the left foot of No. 13, also a male. Two specimens of these
  abnormalities, also in male subjects (one of each kind), were described
  by the author in his paper of last year. They do not seem to have been
  before recorded by any anatomist, though apparently recurring in the
  proportion of about once in 18 or 20 subjects.
      A male subject (No. 9) was remarkable for the presence of the muscle
  described by Otto as the Peroneus quartus (Neue seltene Beobacht. S. 40) ,
   arising from the lower fourth of the outer surface of the fibula below
  the peroneus brevis, and inserted by a distinct tendon into the outer
  side of the calcaneum, upon the tubercle between the peroneal grooves.
  Theile mentions that this muscle sometimes replaces the peroneus brevis
  itself. In the case just described, both the peroneus longus and brevis
  were coexistent.     A variety of the same character, but inserted into the
   outer border of the cuboid, is recorded by Macalister (op. cit.) in a subject
   having no peroneus tertius. One of the peronei muscles      is, according to

 540          Mr. J. Wood     on Variations in Human Myology.        [May 23,
 Meckel, inserted into the cuboid in the Kangaroo.         In a male subject
 (No. 14), the right Peroneus longus had a doublo tendon, one inserted
 into the internal cuneiform, and the other into the base of the first me
 tatarsal.   In a female (No. 15) the tendon of this muscle gave origin
 in tho sole to the flexor and opponens minimi digili, as well as to the
 third plantar interosseus, as in the variety figured in the author's paper
 of 1865. In another female (No. 16) the Peroneus brevis was, in both
 legs, provided with a double tendon, both inserted into the usual place.
 The peroneus tertius in the same subject was totally absent. In the left
 log of a malo (No. 20) a slip of tendon was detached from tho outer
 border of the Tibialis anticus muscle to be implanted into the inner
 border of the anterior annular ligament and dorsal fascia.      In both legs
 of another malo (No. 29) a more decided development in this direction
 had resulted in a distinct, flat, spreading muscle, 3 inches long, arising
 from the outer surface of the tibia below and distinct from the fibres
 of the tibialis, and endiug in a round tendon which was inserted into
 the annular ligament and dorsal fascia below the malleolus.           Such a
 muscle was described b}r the author in his paper of 1804 under the
 name of the Tensor fascia dorsalis pedis, occurring on both sides in a
 female subject.
     In two  subjects (Nos. 22 & 34) a considerable portion      of the inner
 fibres of tho Pectineus were found to pass across the front      of the deep
 femoral artery to become inserted with the upper fibres of the Adductor
 longus, an irregularity which does not seem to have been hitherto
 noted.    A similar   extension of the origin of the adductor longus is seen
 in tho Marmot among tho Rodents, in the Itatel of the Carnivora, and
 in the Magot and Chimpanzee among the Quadrumana.
     No. 21 was found to possess a remarkable development in both feet
 of an Opponens or flexor ossis metacarpi minimi digiti.
     In the right leg of a muscular female subject (No. 25), the Biceps
flexor cruris was provided with a third head.           This consisted of an
  elongated, rounded, and fusiform muscle (fig. 6, a), 8 inches long and
 three-quarters of an inch wide, connected above by a rounded tendon,
  2 inches long, with the strong fascia which covered the deep surface of
                     '
 gluteus maximus (b b, cut and turned aside in the figure).          Below, it
                                                                               •
  was united by a tendon, 1 inch long, with tho ischial or long head (r),
 just above its junction with tho femoral head (d) at the lower third of
 the thigh.    An additional head to this muscle, though not at all com
 mon, yet has been recorded by various writers, viz. by Meckel, from
 the upper part of the "linea aspera;" by Gruber, from the internal
  condyloid ridge of the femur ; by Henle, from tho fascia lata near the
  upper end of the linea aspera ; and by Sosmmcrring and Gantzer, aris
 ing from the tuber ischii. Of these, the three former joined the femo
  ral or short head, while in tho instances given by the two last-named
  authors, the abnormal head joined the ischial or long head. All having a

closely or identically similar origin to those heads of the muscle with
which they afterwards respectively united, may      be considered   as exten
sions and separations of a portion of the fibres of those heads of origin.
Mr. Macalister mentions that in a male subject he found in both legs a
continuation of the tendinous ischial origins of this muscle over the
surface of the great sacro-sciatic ligament to the side of the sacrum, but it
does not appear that this constituted any approach to a distinct head.
But in the specimen under consideration, the abnormality is constituted
by a distinct muscular bundle, with an upper and a lower tendon, the
fibres of the former capable of being traced in those of the deep gluteal
fascia for a considerable distance. In the Dog the author has found the
almost exact counterpart of this third head of the biceps flexor cruris.
It  is a deeply placed slender baud of muscular fibres, arising from the
surface of the great sacro-sciatic ligament.     It lies under the ischial
origin, and becomes inserted into the fascia on tho outside of the leg
below the main bulk of the widely-spread biceps proper.       It is there con
nected also with a fibrous sheath which invests the tendon of t\\o plan
tains. In this animal this musclar slip seems to represent the caudal
and sacral origin of the biceps in the llodents, and other Mammalia.
The homology between the abnormal third heads in the human subject
and the caudal origin in animals was pointed out by Theilo.
   In a muscular male subject was found an abnormality, in many
                                                            " Accessorius ad
points resembling that described by Gantzer as the
calcaneum."      It was, however, very different in its origin to those
described by that author, although identical in its form and insertion
(fig. 7, a). A long slender tendon, very much resembling that of the
plantaris in its texture and appearance, was placed along the inner sido
of it, so as to present the appearance of a double plantaris. This ten
don was attached above to the upper third of the hinder surface of tho
fibula, below the origin of the soleus (J), and crossed obliquely the pos
terior tibial vessels, muscles, and aponeurosis, towards the inner mal
leolus. At the lower third of the leg, a flat, ovoid, tapering, muscular
belly, 3 inches long and 1 inch wide, was developed upon              it,  and
became implanted by    a  short-spreading tendon upon     the  calcaneum, iu
front and to the inner side of tho tendo-achillis, about three-quarters
of an inch distant from it. From the lower part of its outer border the
muscle sent off a tendinous slip, which joined the plantaris tendon in
a mass of fibro-fatty tissue placed above the bursa of the teudo-achillis.
Hyrtl has mentioned the occasional occurrence of           a   muscle some
what resembling this, as arising from the popliteal (?) fascia, or lower
part of the fibula, and inserted into the calcis. This Henle seems to
consider as an abnormal plantaris. In the case just described, however,
the size, shape, and position of the muscular belly, and the insertion of
the lower tendon so much resemble the muscle described by Gantzer,
and also that figured by the author in his paper of 1864, that he has no

hesitation in referring it to the same class, with a somewhat higher
origin, obtained by differentiation of the more vertical fibres of the
posterior tibial aponeurosis.     It constitutes probably, however, a link
with the plantaris, similar to that which the muscle of the arm, which
ho has called the flexor carpi radialis brevis, in some specimens forms
witli the palmaris longus.       From this point of view, this abnormal
muscle in the leg has a similar relation to the tibialis posticus that
the incomplete muscle in the arm has to a complete flexor of the middle
metacarpal bone, its homologue ; and it occupies a like intermediate
relation to the soleus as the one in the arm does to the flexor suilimis.
Wo shall find herein the most probable solution of some of the diffi
culties of the homologies of these post-tibia! muscles.
    In addition to the foregoing subjects, the author haa had the advan
tage of descriptions and sketches of muscular abnormalities affecting
three subjects out of eight, from his friend and former assistant Mr.
Bellamy, demonstrator in anatomy at Charing Cross Hospital.                 In
one muscular male were found four abnormalities, viz. in the right
arm, a double palmaris longus.      The irregular one was placed internal
to the other, with its muscular fibres commencing just above the mid
dle of the arm, and continued down to the annular ligament, into which
and the palmar fascia it was inserted.        In the same arm was found a
well-developed extensor carpi radialis intermedins, arising distinctly
between the longior and brevior by a fusiform belly, and inserted by a
long tendon into the posterior annular ligament, close to the sheath for
the outer extensors of the thumb.        This the author looks upon as a
formation intermediate to complete development of an extensor carpi
radialis accessorius. A little further extension forwards and outwards
would have brought the insertion of this musclo into relation with the
origin of the abductor pollicis brevis and the base of the first meta
carpal.
    On the left arm of the same subject was a development in the same
direction in the lower part of the arm. A separate muscle was formed
of those upper fibres of the extensor ossis metacarpi pollicis, which so
frequently give off a slip of tendon to the origin of the abductor
pollicis. The muscle arose from the radius and interosseous ligament,
quite distinctly from the extensor ossis metacarpi, and was provided with a
separate tendon, which, passing in the same sheath with that of the latter,
subdivided into two tendons, one to be inserted into the base of the
first metacarpal, and the other to join the outer fibres of origin of the
abductor pollicis brevis.
   If  both the tendencies   evinced  in this interesting concurrence had
been combined in the same arm, the result might have been the pro
duction of an entire extensor carpi radialis accessorius, like that described
by the author in former papers.        In the left leg of the same subject
was found a large and well-marked specimen of the accessorius ad col

  caneum   of G-antzer, arising by a flat, bipenniform, muscular belly from
  the posterior tibial fascia below the tibial origin of the soleus, and
  inserted by a flat spreading tendon, which crossed obliquely the post-
  malleolar tendons into the os calcis in front of the tendo-achillis. Prom
 its outer border was given off a spreading aponeurosis, which was
  attached to the hinder border of the outer malleolus, almost like that
  seen in figure 7.     In the left leg of a female subject was found the
perforatum tendon of the little toe, arising from a separate triangular-
  shaped muscle, which was attached to both the tubercles of the cal-
  caneum between the superficial muscles and the accessorius, like that
  described in the author's former papers.
     In the left arm of another muscular male subject two abnormalities
 were found, viz. a third head of the pronator radii teres, arising with
 the fibres of the brachialis anticus at the junction of the middle and
 lower thirds of the humerus.           The median nerve and ulnar vessels
 passed between the abnormal and condyloid heads, and the radial
 artery came off high in the upper arm. No supra-condyloid process
 was found on the bone (as described by Gruber in such a case), although
 carefully looked for.        The other abnormality was a high muscular
 origin of the abductor minimi digiti, arising from the fascia covering the
 inner flexor muscles of the fore arm by a single penniform head, and
joining partly with the normal abductor, and partly inserted by a sepa
rate tendon into the base of the first phalanx of the little finger.
    The author is indebted also to Mr. J. Galton, of the Dreadnought
 Hospital, for some clever sketches of three abnormalities, one of a detached
 slip of the pectoralis major, arising from the anterior end of the fifth rib,
and inserted behind the sternal fibres into the fascia covering the coraco-
 brachialis, an inch or so below the coracoid process ; another, of an
 "accessories' ad  Jl ex or em pollicis lonyum" of Gantzer, the tendon of
which, after being first connected by a broad aponeurosis with the
muscular belly of the flexor longus pollicis, was then divided into two
slips, one of which joined the tendon of the last-named muscle, and the
 other the indicial tendon of the flexor profundus digitorum (as in sub
ject 9 previously described).        The third was a small fusiform muscular
 slip, found on the deep surface of the jlevor brevis hallucis, arising by a
 pointed tendon from internal cuneiform bone, and inserted by another
round tendon into the abductor and inner head of the flexor brevis
                                                                      "

    Out of 36 subjects dissected at King's College during the Session, 34
have been found to present muscular abnormalities worthy of note.
 Four of these had also noteworthy abnormalities of some of the arteries ;
viz. No. 3, having 10 muscular varieties in the head and arm, had also
an irregularity of the third part of the subclavian, whence a common
trunk was given off for the posterior and suprascapular arteries.        The

internal mammary also gave off an accessory inferior thyroid. No. 7,
having 10 muscular abnormalities, of which 7 were in the head and
arm, presented that remarkable irregularity — the right subclavian given
off from the descending aorta below the left — while the two carotids
carae off from a common trunk *.             No. 20, having 16 muscular abnor
malities, 12 being found in the arm, had also a high origin of the radial
artery.    No. 27, having 12 muscular abnormalities, of which 9 were in
the arm, presented the left vertebral arising from the aortic arch, and
the posterior- and supra-scapular         coming by a common          trunk from     the
second part of the subclavian.
    From the 34     cases   contained    in the adjoined Table, which          were all
examined and noted with the utmost care and accuracy, a fair approxi
mative idea may be deduced of the relative frequency of certain special
instances in the two sexes ; on both sides of the body, or on one side
only.
    The total number of muscular abnormalities noted in 36 subjects is
295 (reckoning both sides as one), of which 221, or about two-thirds,
were found on both sides, and 74, or about one-third, on oue side only ;
the proportion on the right side only being 39, and those on the left
side only 35, or nearly equal on either side.
    The individual abnormalities which exceed the above proportion on both
sides are — the cleido-occipital ; those of the pectoralis minor, coraeo-
brachialis, brachialis anticus, extensor carpi ulnaris, and the interosaei ;
and the extensor      medii digiti in the upper extremity ; and the extensor
longus primi internodii hallucis, and those of the extensor brevis digi-
torum pedis in the lower limb, all of which were found represented on
both sides   ; while the proportion of the abnormalities of the latissimus
dorsi, the peroneus quinti, and the abductor ossis metatarsi             quinti found
on both sides was also greater than that above given.
    Those instances of which the proportion on one side only was greater
than the average, were found in the flexor sublimis and profundus
digitorum and lumbricales, and the more rare abnormality, the fleior
carpi radialis brevis vel profundus, all of which last were found in the
right arm. Of the biceps flexor cubiti and the flexor longus accessorius
digitorum pedis nearly as many were found on one side only as on both.
    The total number of abnormalities found in the 24 males was 215, and
in the 12 females 81, showing a greater proportionate frequency in the
male sex of almost as many more.             Of this number, 15 are confined to
the head, neck, and thorax ; 4 of which are in females, or rather less
than the foregoing average.
   No less than 174 are connected with, and acting chiefly upon, the bones
of the upper limb, 130 of which are in males, and 44 in females.                  This
also is proportionately less in the female than the general average.
   * For an account of the formation of this
                                              abnormality, see a paper by the author in
the Transactions of the Pathological Society of London, vol.  X. p. 119.

  1867.]     Mr.  J. Wood  on Variations in Human Myology.              545
 Of   the remaining 106 found iu the lower limb 74 were in male, and 32
 in female subjects, proportionately a considerably greater average on
 the side of the female. So far as these go, abnormalities of muscles
 appear to preponderate in the male, in the head, neck, thorax, and arm,
 and, in the female, in the leg.
    In a much greater proportion than this on the male side were the
special abnormalities of the cleido-occipital, pectoralis major, biceps,
coraco-brachialis, brachialis auticus, flexor longus pollicis, lumbricales
and interossei manus, flexor carpi radialis profundus, pahnaris longus,
supinator longus, extensor communis and brevis digitorum manus, and
extensor carpi uluaris in the upper limb ; and the peroneus quinti, ex
tensor longus and brevis digitorum, and lumbricales pedis in the lower.
 On the female side the most tangible preponderance is found iu the
 frequency of absence of the peroneus tertius, aud of the presence of the
abductor ossis metatarsi quinti, the extensor carpi radialis intermedius,
and of the extensor longus primi interuodii hallucis.
    The Table shows as decidedly as that of last year, the general absence
of correspondence in combination of the muscular abnormalities.
    Of the 14 subjects in which there are more than 10 variations, three
only are females. One subject has 17 muscular abnormalities, of which
 15 are connected with the arms, and 2 only with the legs.        Two have
16 abnormalities; in one of them 11 are connected with the arms
 (including the cleido-occipital and the occipito-scapular given in fig. 1),
 1  with the head, and 4 with the legs ; the other has 5 in the legs and 1
in the head and neck.      Two males have each 13 abnormalities ; in one
 10 are connected with the arms, aud 3 with the legs ; and in the other,
 1 is found on the ribs, and 4 in the legs.   Three subjects (one of them
a female) have 12 abnormalities, of which 7 belong to the arms. One
male has 11, of which 8 belong to the arms. Two females have each 11,
 of which 6 in one, and 5 in the other, belong to the arms ; and 4 in one,
 and 5 in the other, to the legs. Three subjects have 10 abnormalities,
of which 4, 6, and 7 respectively are found in the arms ; one of these, a
male, and another a female, have each 5 belonging to the legs. In 13 sub
jects no abnormalities are found in the head and neck. In 7 more, those
which were found there acted equally on the bones of the upper limb.
This leaves 14 in which the muscles of the head, neck, and thorax only
were concerned.      In 1 subject only, a female, were no abnormalities
found in the arms, the only abnormal muscle discovered being the ab
 ductor ossis metatarsi quinti. In a male (No. 4) 2 only were found in
 the arms, and 4 in the legs. In 5 subjects one variation only is found
 in the legs, the others being found chiefly in the arms.
    No levator clavicular, extensor carpi radialis accessorius, or sternalis
muscles have this year been found.       With the exception of these and
five others, all that were recorded last year have been found also this
year, with the addition of abnormalities in 10 other muscles.

   In the Table the figures which are placed at the end of the lines
record the number of variations in each subject. Those at the bottom
of each column express the number of variations in each muscle or
muscles, the names of which are found at the head of the columns.

          OBITUARY NOTICES OF FELLOWS DECEASED
              Between 30th Nov.          1864  and 30th Nov.      1865.
     John George Appold             died August 31, 1865.        Mr. Appold was
 greatly distinguished as an amateur engineer, and for his success in the
 general application of chemical, physical, and mechanical principles for the
 purposes of mankind.
     He was born on the Nth of April, 1800, at the factory of his father,
 Christian Appold, in Wilson Street, Finsbury. He was educated at an in
 different school in the vicinity, and at an early age was taken from his
 studies to assist his father, who was a fur-skin dyer of much celebrity. At
 the age of 22 his father gave him the business, when his far-seeing mind at
 once perceived that the power of steam might be advantageously introduced
into his factory, and that if he was to hold the first place in his department
 of manufacture, he must rely upon a knowledge of chemistry and physics.
 For years he     devoted himself to his factory with such success that he im
proved    his art,  and in some cases was the sole possessor of a knowledge of
the means by which he carried out difficult processes.               Through this
Rnperior    skill  he amassed  in a  few years a handsome    fortune,  by industry
and talent alone, without resorting to speculation of any kind.
    From about the year 1844 he bestowed less time on his business, and
was thus enabled to apply the knowledge which he had obtained therefrom
 to  a wider range of subjects, whereby he gained the confidence and esteem
 of the leading engineers of the age.
    Mr. Appold was exceedingly modest and distrustful of his own powers,
till he found that men of the highest reputation listened         to him with   re
spect and commendation, when, fortunately for the public, he became more
confident in enforcing his own inventions.         He was somewhat irritable in
manner, especially when wrongfully contradicted ; but was greatly beloved
by his men, not only from the kindness of his heart, but from the con
fidence with which he inspired them when difficulties had to be overcome.
    He  was married at the age    of  25 to Miss Maria Illmann, who during the
whole of his life sympathized      with  his train of thought, calmed his irrita
bility, took the liveliest interest in all his projects, and by a devotion to
his comfort and happiness contributed in no small degree to further the in
ventions which he has given to the world.
    Mr. Appold was not a man of extensive reading, and indeed he used
books but little ; but he was a careful observer of facts, and his mind was
well stored with accurate and exact data available for use. His inventions
and processes were the result of pure thought.           They were but little de
rived from the analogy of other methods in actual         use,  but were in great
measure creations of his own mind.
    Mr. Appold's chemical inventions        were  confined to his own business ;
none of them have ever been published,         some are still in the possession of
    vol. xv.                                                            *

the present proprietors of the factory, but others doubtless will be for ever
lost.
   In applied electricity Mr. Appold pointed out difficulties in the use of
that agent as a motive power for clocks, and attempted to prevent irregu
larity in their performance, but without, however, attaining the degree of
perfection which his exact mind alone could tolerate.         His great work in
connexion with electricity is of a purely mechanical nature, as he devised
a most efficient break to regulate the speed of laying electric cables at the
bottom of the sea.         From the great value of this apparatus the name of
Appold will be ever associated with this department of engineering, as the
successful laying of the Atlantic and other cables has in no small degree
depended upon this invention, although others have subsequently made
improvements upon it.          This contrivance is an adaptation of a labour-
regulating machine, invented and patented by him some time previously,
for use at prisons, so that the labour which every prisoner performs         may
be exactly apportioned to his strength.
   Hydraulic science was a particularly favourite subject with Mr. Appold.
His centrifugal pump stands boldly forward as an invaluable instrument for
raising large quantities of water to a moderate height.      The construction of
this pump was a special instance of an invention arrived at by thoughtful
investigation. The experiments were made at considerable cost to himself in
his factory, and after accurately watching the results, he applied his mind
to a right consideration of their bearing, and thus produced a pump which
for its particular purposes surpasses every invention which preceded it. In
the Great Exhibition of 1851 a centrifugal pump was exhibited, the merits
of which are fully described in the Reports of the Jurors, and in the Exhi
bition of 1862 a much larger one was shown.             The Appold centrifugal
pump is largely used in Egypt and in the West Indies for the purposes
of irrigation.      It is also beneficially used for draining tracts of ground
lying below the level of the natural outfall ; and Whittlesea Mere, and a
great portion of the Bridgwater marshes were drained by its instrumen
tality.
   Mr. Appold      also devised a pump for raising the  thick viscid printingiuk
                *         '
used    for the   Times     newspaper, which apparatus has been employed for
some time, and well illustrates his success in adapting his contrivances to
the requirements of the case.
   His wonderful power of intelligent observation was well displayed during
the attempts to launch the Great Eastern steamship at Blackwall by means
of hydraulic pumps, when his skilled eye detected that the labourers were
working irregularly, and sometimes the labour which they apparently gave
was a mere sham.         He immediately communicated with Mr. Brunei, who
gave    him leave to fix a test upon each pump to show the work performed.
This was highly appreciated by the great engineer.
   Mr. Appold was peculiarly happy in devising valves in connexion with
large pumps, and many such now in use at the large waterworks were

                                       Ill
contrived by him. He also invented a valve for equalizing the flow of
water, and thus ensuring the safety of persons using hydraulic lifts by a
proper regulation of the speed, irrespective of variation     of the weight by
difference in the number of persons employing them.           This valve is in
common use at all the large hotels.
    A very pretty contrivance was invented by him for throwing air into
water-pipes under great pressure.     At the waterworks of the South Essex
Company water      is pumped 1 2 miles and raised 400 feet by the direct action
of  the engine.     Under these circumstances the air in the air-vessel was ab
sorbed by the water, and the use of an air-pump caused great heat from the
compression of the air.     On consideration of all the facts, he immediately
contrived an injector, by which a suitable quantity of air was thrown into
the air-vessel without the aid of any pump.
    He  also devised a simple method to avoid the bursting    of water-pipes in
houses when the water is suddenly shut off at high pressures, and also to
prevent the unpleasant noise which occurs under these circumstances.         His
contrivance consists in soldering a foot of pipe, closed at one end and full
of air, vertically near the tap. This acts as an air-vessel, and perfectly
prevents the noise or the risk of fracture of the pipe.
    The Appold overflow for cisterns is an ingenious application of scientific
principles, by which cisterns can be filled with safety to a very short
distance of their top. The overflow consists of a funnel-shaped pipe, con
tracted at the bottom and very large at the top.      This is covered with an
inverted metallic saucer, so that when the water flows fast the whole pipe
is filled, and with the covering constitutes a siphon which powerfully sucks
down the water.
    Mr. Appold also warmly advocated the use of siphons to carry water
over an embankment instead of having culverts through the bank.              For
this purpose he recommended that      one valve only should be used, and that
it should   be placed at the upper part of the siphon, so that facility  of exa
 mination may be secured.       Mr. Appold also suggested to Messrs. Easton
 and Amos the arrangement of air-pumps which are employed for the ex
 haustion of the siphons at Kings Lynn.
    Great as Mr. Appold was in his knowledge of hydraulic principles and
 in his application of them, he  was no less  fortunate in his successful appre
 ciation of pneumntic science.      He was a thorough master of ventilation,
 and that at a time when the principles of the art were but imperfectly
 known ; his own house was for years regarded as a model of perfection
 in that way, as fresh air of regulated temperature and moisture, and
 thoroughly    screened  from all impurities,   was  abundantly supplied by a
 series  of most ingenious self-acting contrivances.       The Appold motor-
 hygrometer which Mrs. Appold presented to the Royal Society, whereby
 a self-acting motive power was obtained under any desired condition of
 hygrometric     moisture, is a very remarkable example of the skill with

                                        iv
which    Mr. Appold devised the most delicate apparatus to meet any want.
By   the   use of this instrument the flow of a small stream of water over a
warm stove was regulated, and by this means one uniform hygrometric
state of the atmosphere was ensured throughout the building.            The bel
lows he applied to prevent the jar of slamming doors is an ingenious and
effective    apparatus ; and the Appold Pneumatic Valve, for preventing
down draughts with very feeble currents, acts perfectly.
    Mr. Appold's mechanical contrivances were innumerable, and many of
them distinguished by their extreme originality.          Perhaps the most re
markable is the scrubber, devised to remove deposits from the inside of the
water-pipes of a town. This has been used with perfect success at Torquay,
 but it is to be regretted that he never himself knew that his design answered
its expectations.     It was a question whether the main pipes of Torquay
would not have to be removed, but the action of the scrubber was so           per
fect, that the deposit was entirely disintegrated and carried away with the
flow of water.      In his factory many remarkable devices existed. Pumps
werp curiously arranged to throw on and      off as they were required ; and air
was supplied to the steam-engine fire by self-regulating apparatus.
    Besides his more important contrivances he made some for mere amuse
ment; and every part of his house bore testimony to the fertility of his ima
gination and power of invention.       Doors were made to open on approach,
and to shut after the person had passed through ; others locked themsekes
afterwards.      He had contrivances also by which all the shutters of a room
 closed by the touch of a spring, and thus, when associated with the regu
lator of a gas-lamp, caused a change from daylight to gaslight, to the no
 small amusement of his visitors.        All his numerous contrivances acted
perfectly, even to the unimportant matter of his self-acting stable-gates,
which when once adjusted, were so exact in their mechanism that they
 remained in use for years without requiring attention.
    Shortly before his death he was constructing an apparatus for measuring
 accurately the pitching and rolling of vessels at sea.
                                                            " "
    Mr. Appold showed a knowledge of the laws of heai'by constructing a
 thermometer of extreme delicacy for a range of a few degrees.       It consisted
 of a thin plate of zinc and steel rivetted together, and suspended on a knife-
 edge, so that its bar was unequally balanced.        This form of thermometer
 is difficult to manufacture, otherwise it would doubtless be in general use
 for sitting-rooms and greenhouses, as it indicates distinctly a variation of a
 tenth of a degree, which can be read across the room. He also constructed
 a motor thermometer to regulate the supply of gas to a stove according to
 the temperature of an apartment at a considerable distance, and this acted
 in the most efficient manner.
    One very curious application of physiological experiment Mr. Appold has
 left us in connexion with the Daguerreotype.        In the early days of steres-
 scopic photography he conceived the idea that from the superposition in

                                           V
"Wheatstone's stereoscope of two images of the human countenance, one
laughing and the other extremely serious, a normal state of countenance
would be produced.        Accordingly he had two such pictures made of him
self, and the effect which is produced by regarding the two images through
the stereoscope is so good, that his family and friends consider that it is
by far   the best likeness   which remains, and expresses most accurately his
natural condition of countenance.
    "With   but   very slight knowledge of the use of figures, Mr. Appold
had very considerable power of mental calculation.           He made curious and
extensive mental calculations which approximated very closely to the truth.
 In this way he astonished Stephenson and other engineers by suddenly
stating how much he could by his own strength deflect the colossal bridge
 over the Menai Straits.      Upon accurate measurement it was found that
 he really  deflected  it more than he stated, but then he said he used all his
 strength,   and had been afraid    of overstating his case. His mode of calcu
 lating  appeared to be by a geometric series, continually halving or doubling,
 as the case required, from a known unit.
    During the last twenty years of his life he was always present when any
 great engineering work was being carried out.          He was ever watchful and
 suggestive when difficulties arose, and contributed his share to the success
 of the undertaking.       In this manner he exercised     an important influence,
 and his loss will be keenly felt wherever new and difficult mechanical
 operations are attempted.
    We thus find that Mr. Appold was the author of inventions of great
 originality in various departments of practical science.            It is interest
 ing to know the manner in which he applied his mind for th.it purpose
 It was his habit when a difficulty arose, carefully to consider the exact
 result he required, and having satisfied himself upon that point, he would
 direct his attention to the simplest mode by which the end could be at
 tained.   With that view he would during the day bring together in his mind
 all the facts and principles relating to the case, and the solution of the problem
 usually occurred to him in the early morning after sleep.            If the matter
 was difficult, he would be restless and uneasy during the night ; but after
 repose, when the brain had recovered from fatigue, and when in the quiet
 of the early morning no external influences distracted his attention, the
 resultant of all known scientific principles bearing upon the question pre
 sented itself to his mind.
    Mr. Appold's inventions were essentially practical. They were not mere
 proposals or paper inventions ; and he ever showed that he was a man of
 action in bringing into successful operation his various designs.            Great,
 however, as were his powers of thoughtful invention he was not distinguished
 in the study of the higher relations of the physical forces, and he left to
 others the task of propounding those noble generalizations of modern days
 which have    done so much to    simplify and dignify human knowledge         ; but

he affords a conspicuous example, in his own line, of the benefits that may
be conferred on mankind by rightly directed thought, even when unaided
by acquired learning.        He followed the religion of his country, without
associating himself with theological controversies ; and his numerous           acts
of charity and benevolence were bestowed with the utmost care that               the
giver should remain unknown.
   Mr. Appold was afflicted with a painful disease for the last few years of
his life, which he bore with heroic fortitude.        He was suddenly, however,
seized  with internal haemorrhage at Clifton, when he met his death trim
that calm resignation which marks the true philosopher.             To the honour
of the inhabitants of the parish in which he lived, a monument has been
erected by them to his memory in the Church of St. Leonard, Shoreditch.
    His election into the Royal Society took place on the 2nd of June, ls53.
    George Boole, by whose death mathematical science has                suffered   a
great loss, was born at     Lincoln on the 2nd of November, 1815.        His  father
was a tradesman      of very limited means, but held in high esteem by those
who knew him.         Having nothing to support his family but his daily toil,
it was not to be expected that he could expend much            on the education of
his children   ;   yet they were not neglected.          Being himself a man of
thoughtful    and studious habits, possessed of an active and ingenious mind,
end attached to the pursuit of science, particularly of mathematics,               he
sought to imbue his children with a love of learning, and employed                his
leisure hours in imparting to them the elements of education.               His son
 George   was  sent  first to the  National   School, and  afterwards  to a private
 Commercial      School, conducted by the late Mr. Thomas Bainbridge,
 Lincoln.     From his father he received his principal instruction in the
 rudiments of mathematics, and from him also he inherited a taste for tht
 construction and adaptation of optical instruments.          It was not, however,
 until a comparatively late period of his earlier studies that his special apti
 tude for mathematical investigations developed itself.        His earlier ambitioa
 seems to have pointed to the attainment of proficiency in. the aucieut
 classical languages ; but his father being unable to assist him in over
 coming the first difficulties of this course of study, he was indebted to a
 neighbouring bookseller (Mr. "William Brooke) for instruction in the ele
 ments of Latin grammar.          To the study of Latin he soon added that of
 Greek, without any external assistance, and for some years he devoured
 every Greek and Latin author that came within his reach.
    At the age of sixteen he became an assistant in a school at Doucaster:
 subsequently he occupied a similar post at Waddington, a village about
 four miles from Lincoln. In these situations, besides prosecuting his
 studies in the ancient classics, he cultivated au acquaintance with the besi
 English authors, and began to read the German, French, aud Italni:
 languages, in all of which        he   ultimately  attained singular  proficiency.

                                           vii
  Two of his latest mathematical essays were written, one in German, and
  the other in French. As he had at this time a great wish to take orders
  in the church, he applied himself for two years to the study of patristic
  literature by way of preparation for the regular theological course. But
  the circumstances of his parents and some other difficulties hindered the
 accomplishment of this design.         In his twentieth year he decided on open
 ing   a school on his own account in his native city.       Henceforward mathe
 matics became his special study.
      His earliest papers, written, as he himself incidentally mentions, toward
 the close of the year 1838, were prepared during his perusal of* the
  '                                             "
    Mecanique Analytique,' in the form of Notes on Lagrange." From these
 notes in the following       year he made selections,       and wrote out what
 appears to have      been his   first paper (though not the first published),
 entitled " On certain Theorems in the Calculus of Variations," wherein he
 proposed various improvements on methods of investigation employed by
 the illustrious French analyst.        About the same time his attention was
 attracted to the transformation of homogeneous functions by linear sub
 stitutions, a problem which occupies a very conspicuous place in the
writings of Lagrange, and which had also employed the powers of Laplace,
 Lebesque, Jacobi, and other distinguished continental mathematicians.
The manner in which Boole dealt with this important problem showed him
 at once to be a man of most original and independent thought, and in the
course of his investigations he was led to discoveries which may be regarded
as the foundation     of what has     been called the Modern     Higher Algebra.
 His first published paper     relates  to this subject ; and although he after
wards     greatly improved    and extended       his method of analysis, yet his
original memoir, entitled
                              " Researches on the Theory of Analytical Trans
formations, with a Special Application to the Reduction of the General
Equation of the Second Order," is interesting as showing how the subject
first   struck his mind.     This memoir he communicated in 1839 to the
Cambridge Mathematical          Journal.       Other papers in rapid succession
followed.     The generous assistance of the editor, the late Mr. Duncan F.
Gregory, in correcting the imperfections of style which naturally resulted
from his want of proper early training, Boole remembered with pleasure
and thankfulness to the end of his life. His rising reputation led his friends
to wish that he should enter himself at Cambridge.              This project also
he abandoned, and he continued to work              amidst the interruptions and
anxieties incident to the occupation of a schoolmaster.           While applying
the doctrine of the separation of symbols to the solution of differential
equations with variable coefficients, Mr. Boole was led to devise a general
method in analysis.        The work was too elaborate and weighty for the
mathematical journal ; and he therefore, by the advice of Mr. Gregory,
communicated a paper on the subject to this Society.             For this paper,
which    was printed in the Transactions for 18-14, he received the Royal Medal.

                                              VIII
    In the   course  of  these speculations, and others            of a like nature   which
grew out of them, Mr. Boole was led to consider the possibility of con
structing a calculus of deductive reasoning.                 The severe discipline of hii
efforts to extend the powers of the analysis had given him not only a com
plete mastery over its mechanical processes, but also, what was of far
greater advantage, a profound insight into its logical principles.               In tracing
out those principles he discovered that they admitted of an application to
other objects of thought than number and quantity ; he found, in fact,
that logical symbols in general conform to the same fundamental law*
which govern the symbols of algebra in particular, while they are subject
also to a certain special        law.     This discovery suggested a variety of in
quiries  which    he  seems   at    different  periods to have pursued, but without
any intention of publishing his views on the subject.                 In the spring of the
year   1847,   however,   his attention    was  drawn     to the  question then moved be
tween   SirW. Hamilton of Edinburgh and Professor De Morgan, and he "was
induced by the interest which it inspired, to resume the almost forgotten
thread of former inquiries." His views were embodied in a remarkable essav,
entitled "The Mathematical Analysis of Logic," which in the autumu of
the year was put on sale in Cambridge and London.                     Early in the follow
ing year (1848)       he  communicated        to   the  Cambridge and Dublin Mathe
matical Journal a paper on the "Calculus of Logic," in which, after
premising the notation and             fundamental positions of his essay, he gave
some further developments              of his system. From this time forward he
applied himself diligently to          a course of study and reflection on psycholo
gical subjects, with a view to         the production of a much more elaborate and
exhaustive work than either of those above named.                        He felt that the
inquiry   was   one  of  great   importance,      and   that  in  labouring to perfect his
theory he was rendering essential service to science.                He meditated deeplr
on the nature and constitution of the human intellect.                  The most eminent
authorities, both ancient and modern, were consulted ; opinions differins
widely from each other, and often wholly opposed to his own, were care
fully considered ; and whatever was likely to help him in the great work
which    he   had undertaken, was eagerly sought.                 Mental science became
his study ; mathematics were his recreation.                    So he has been heard to
say ;  and   yet  it is a  remarkable       fact,   and   one  which   serves to show the
great power and genius of the man, that his most valuable and importan:
mathematical works were produced after he had commenced his psycho
logical investigations.
    In 1849 he was appointed to the Mathematical                Chair in the newly fonrceJ
Quern's     College at    Cork    ;   and when the         Queen's Colleges of Belfast,
Galway, and Cork were united so as to form the Queen's University of
Ireland, he was chosen one of the public examiners for degrees.                       These
offices he filled with the highest reputation.                 In 1852 the University of
Dublin conferred upou him the honorary title of                  LL.D., in company     with

the late Judge Hargreave, " in consideration of their eminent services in
the advancement of mathematical science."               Late in the year 1853 Dr.
Boole Drought          to its  close  a labour on  which he had bestowed a vast
amount of profound and patient thought.              Ilis " Mathematical Analysis
of Logic "      was written hastily, and on this account he afterwards •regretted
its publication      ;  but the work which     he now gave to the world must be
regarded as the most carefully matured of all his productions.                   It is
entitled "An Investigation of the Laws of Thought, on which are founded
the Mathematical Theories of Logic and Probabilities."               The principle on
which the investigation proceeds is essentially the same           as that enunciated
 by   the author in his earlier logical essays   ; but, as he himself remarks,    " its
methods are more general, and its range of applications far wider."               This
 great work was published in 1854.
      During the remaining ten years of his life he contributed to various
 scientific journals papers on Probabilites, on Partial Differential Equations,
 on the Comparison of Transcendents, and on other high mathematical sub
                                                            '
jects. He also produced two text-books, one on Differential Equations,'
 and one on ' Finite Differences — works which display a vast amount of
                                          '
 original research as well as an extensive acquaintance with the writings of
 others.      These have become class-books at Cambridge.
      In   1855  Dr. Boole was married to Miss Mary Everest, daughter of the
 late Rev. T. R. Everest, Rector of Wickwar, Gloucestershire, and niece of
 Colonel Sir George Everest, F.R S., lately deceased, as also of Dr. Ryall,
 the Vice-President          and   Professor of Greek in Queen's College, Cork.
 The union       was    one   of great mutual happiness, and was blessed with a
 family of five daughters.
      In 1857 Dr. Boole communicated to the Royal Society of Edinburgh a
 memoir " On the Application of the Theory of Probabilities to the Ques
 tion of the Combination of Testimonies or Judgments."               For this purpose
 there was awarded to him the Keith Medal, the highest honour in the
 shape of prize which that Society has at its disposal.          In June of the same
 year he was elected a Fellow of this Society. At the Oxford Commemo
 ration in 1859 he received the honorary degree of D.C.L.
      Soon after the publication of his Treatise on Differential Equations,
  Professor Boole resolved that if a new edition of the work should be called
  for he would reconstruct it on a more extended scale.               For several suc
  ceeding years his studies and researches were largely inspired and directed
  by this object, which, however, he did not live to accomplish.              The trea
  tise had been for some time out of print, and he was engaged            in preparing
  a  new    and  enlarged    edition  when  he was suddenly   struck   by  the hand of
  death.
       lie  had walked from his residence at Ballintemple to the College in
   Cork, a distance of little more than two miles, in a drenching rain, and
   lectured in his wet clothes.         The result was a feverish cold, which soon

                                          X
fell upon his lungs and terminated fatally.         He died on the 8th of    Decern-
ber, 1864.
    Dr. Boole  was a man     of great  goodness   of heart.   By those who      knew
him intimately he was regarded with a feeling akin to reverence.
                                                                             " Apart
                                                                        *' there was
from his intellectual     superiority," says one of his colleagues,
shed around him an atmosphere of purity and moral elevation, which was
felt by all who were admitted within its influence.         And over all his gifts
and graces there was thrown the charm of a true humility, and an apparent
total unconsciousness of his own worth and wisdom."
    Many illustrations might be given of the versatility of Boole's talent, his
love of poetry and music, his fine appreciation of the beauties of external
nature, his profound reverence for truth, especially religious truth, and
many other qualities of his intellect and heart which have not been so much
as touched upon ; but the limits within which it is proper that this sketch
should be contained forbid any elaborate estimate of his character.
    Boole's mathematical researches       have   exercised a very considerable in
fluence upon the study of the higher branches of the analysis, especially
in this country.      They have stimulated and directed the efforts of other
investigators to an extent that is not perhaps generally known.               Out of
his theory of linear transformations has grown the more general theory of
covariants (due to Professor Cayley), with all its important geometrical and
other applications.       By his invention of an algebra of non-commutative
symbols, a great impulse has been given to the cultivation of the calculus
of operations.      His general method in analysis is the most powerful in
strument which we possess for the integration of differential equations,
whether total or partial.        To Sir John Herschel is due the high praise of
having first applied the method of the separation of symbols to the solution
of linear differential equations with constant coefficients. But it was re
served for Duncan F. Gregory and Boole to set the logical principles of that
method in a clear and satisfactory light ; and to Boole alone belongs the
honour of having extended the theory to the solution of equations with
variable coefficients.     His principal discoveries in this department will be
                 '
found in his        Differential  Equations,'   and the Supplementary volume
 (edited by Mr.    Isaac Todhunter), works which though primarily intended
for elementary instruction, may be read with advantage by the advanced
mathematical student.         Other original investigations will be found in the
same volumes, and more especially in those parts which          relate to Riecatfs
equation, to integrating factors, to singular solutions, to the inverse pro
blems of geometry and optics, to partial differential equations, and to
the projection of a surface on a plane.
    The calculus of logic, upon the invention of which Boole's fame              as a
philosophical   mathematician may be permitted to rest, is most         fully  deve
loped in his 'Investigation of the Laws of Thought.'           The design of this
work is — to use the author's own words — " to investigate the fundamental

                                          XI
laws of those operations of the miud by which reasoning is performed ; to
give expression to them in the symbolical language of a Calculus, and upon
this foundation to establish the science of logic, and construct its method ;
to make that method itself the basis of a general method for the applica
tion of the mathematical doctrine of Probabilities ; and, finally, to collect
from the various elements of truth, brought to view in the course of these
inquiries, some probable intimations concerning the nature and constitution
 of the human mind."
     Boole  has left behind    him a considerable quantity of logical manu
 scripts  ; these will perhaps be published either in a separate form or in
                         '
 a new edition of the      Laws of Thought.'      His works are his noblest mo
 nument, but his friends and admirers have raised other memorials.            Of
 these we may mention in particular, a memorial window in the Cathedral
 nt Lincoln, and another in the College Hall at Cork.

     Samuel Hunter Christie was born in London on the 22nd of
  March, 1784, and at a very early age showed the talent for mathematical
  pursuits which afterwards so highly distinguished him.        lie was entered
  at Trinity College, Cambridge, in 1801, and, in his third year, obtained
  a scholarship.    In 1805 he took his degree of Bachelor of Arts as Second
  Wrangler, having a severe struggle with Turton (afterwards Bishop of
                                 "
  Ely) for the " Blue Riband of the University, and being bracketed with
  him as Smith' s-prizeman.        In 1806 Mr. Christie was appointed Third
  Mathematical    Master    at the   Royal Military Academy at Woolwich, and
  immediately devoted himself to the improvement of the mathematical
  studies at that College, and persevered in the work with much success,
  during his lengthened career of forty-eight years in the public service.
  In 1812 he established the system of competitive examinations, but was
   unable fully to carry out his views in this and in other respects until his
  advancement to the post of Professor of Mathematics in 1838.          It is not
  too much     to say that no two educational institutions could present a
  stronger contrast than the Royal Military Academy in 1 806, and the same
   College in 1854 when Mr. Christie resigned the Professor's Chair j and this

                                                     xii
change was             in great measure            due     to     bis unflagging    advocacy    of   an
improved system.

                        a
share   promoting the great advance in both theoretical and experimental
          in
knowledge of magnetical science, which received its impulse from the obser
vations made during the Arctic voyages in 1818 and 1819.     The leading
idea which runs through Mr. Christie's theoretical discussions of his
various experimental results, he first stated as an hypothetical law iu                               a
paper published in the Cambridge Philosophical Transactions   for 1820.
In paper read before the Royal Society in June 1824, he gave an ac
      a
count of some of his experiments for the determination of the effects
of temperature upon magnetic forces, and established     correction for             a
temperature in the experimental determination of the magnetic inten
sity, which had been previously overlooked.     Mr. Christie was the first
to observe  the effect of the slow rotation of iron in producing magnetic
polarity, and, at his suggestion, the very interesting series of experiments
which he originated, and which are given iu detail in        paper published    a
in the Philosophical Transactions for 1825, were repeated by Lieutenant
Foster,         R.N., during the expedition              to the north-west coast        of America   in
1824, under Captain                               striking than his
                                    Parry, with results         even more                       own,
owing to the diminished horizontal component of the magnetic force.
     In      paper by Mr. Christie upon the magneto-electric conduction
          1833     a
of various metals was selected                by
                                  the Council of the Royal Society as the
Bakerian Lecture for the year. In this paper he shows, both experimentally
and theoretically,that the conducting power of the several metals varies
inversely   the length, and directly as the square of the diameter of the
                 as
conducting wire, thus obeying the same law as that previously discovered
 bySir Humphry Davy and Professor Cumming,         the cases of voltaic andin
thermo-electricity          ;  his conclusion as to

                                in the immediate
appears to have been almost prophetic, now that we are able to submit
this vast velocity to   definite measurement, by timing the transmission of
                                a

  The      effect   of the solarrays upon the magnetic needle very earlyengagedMr.
Christie's        attention, and he showed,              by
                                                  series of experiments detailed
                                                            a                                        iu
papers published in the Philosophical Transactions for 1826 and 1828, that
thedirecteffect of the solar rays definite and not due to any mere calorific in
                                             is
fluence. He then also threw out the suggestion that terrestrial magnetism                            is

                                        xiii
probably derived from solar influence. On this idea he instituted a series of
experiments to determine whether a source of heat applied to two substances
of different conducting powers in uniform contact, like the earth and the
atmosphere, would produce phenomena corresponding to the diurnal
variation, as the source of heat was applied successively to different parts of
the combined system. The results he obtained were in accordance with
this supposition, but of course their validity as evidence is subject to the
question of how far the actual conditions of the earth were truly repre
sented in the ingenious experimental combination which he adopted.
    Mr. Christie appears to have been the first to make use of a torsion
balance for the determination of the equivalents of magnetic forces ; he also
devoted himself to the improvement of the construction of both the hori
zontal needle and the dipping-needle ; and he served constantly upon the
" Compass Committee " formed to assist the Admiralty in bringing the
Compasses of the Royal Navy into some accordance with               the advanced
knowledge of the day.
     In the Report of the British Association      for 1833, the portion which
refers to the then state of knowledge of the magnetism of the earth was
 drawn up by Mr. Christie, and he therein again maintained that not only the
 daily variation, but also the quasi-polarity of the earth is most probably
 due to the excitation by the solar heat, of electric currents at right angles, or
 nearly so, to the meridian ; and he suggests that the direction of these
 currents   must be influenced by the form, extent, and direction of the
 continents and seas over which they pass, and also by the height, direction,
 and geological structure of chains of mountains.
     The Letter of Baron Humboldt in 1835 to H.R.H. the Duke of Sussex,
 P.R.S., on the establishment of permanent magnetic observatories at widely
 separated stations within the British territories, was referred by H.R.H.
 the President, to Mr. Christie and Mr. Airy to report upon.          Their report
 was read to the Royal      Society in November 183G ; and upon a further
 report to the same effect from the joint Committee of Physics and Meteor
 ology in 1838, the President and Council made a representation in favour
 of the measure to Her Majesty's Government which was successful.
      In connexion with Mr. Christie's  career as a teacher,  it may be mentioned
                                    '                                        '
  that he was the author     of an    Elementary Course of Mathematics          for
 use in the   Royal Military Academy.        In 1837 Mr. Christie succeeded Mr.
  Children as one of the Secretaries of the Royal Society, and retained that
  office until 185-4, when he went to reside at Lausanne upon his retirement
  from the post of Professor of Mathematics at the Royal Military Academy.
  He was one of the Visitors of the Royal Observatory at Greenwich ; a Vice-
  President of the Royal Astronomical Society ; a Corresponding Member of
  the Academy of Sciences of Palermo, and a member of the Societc Phi-
  lornathiquc of Paris.    He died at Twickenham, where he had resided for
  some years, on the 24th of January, 1865, having nearly completed his

    The   science   of Palaeontology has sustained a great loss in the death          of
Hugh Falconer, M.D. Born at Forres, in the north of Scotland,                        on
the 29th of February, 1808, he received his early education at the Gram
mar school of that town, and afterwards studied Arts at the University
of King's College, Aberdeen, and Medicine at the University of Edinburgh.
From the former University he received the degree of A.M. ; and from
the latter, in 1829, the degree of M.D.
    As a boy, he exhibited a decided taste for the study of natural objects,
which he eagerly followed up in Edinburgh under the systematic tuition of
Frofcssors Graham and Jameson.              On visiting London in 1829, he availed
himself of the opportunity         to assist the late Dr. Nathaniel Wallich in the
distribution    of his great Indian herbarium, and to study the collection of
Indian fossil mammalia from the banks of the Irrawaddi, formed by Mr.
John Crawfurd during his mission to Ava, and presented by him to the
Geological Society.         Both occupations proved of material service in his
subsequent      career,  and  in the latter instance it determined the labours to
which he afterwards so zealously devoted himself.
    In 1830 Dr. Falconer proceeded to India as an Assistant-Surgeon in the
II. E. I.C. Service, and arrived in Calcutta in September of that year.
Here he at once undertook an examination of fossil bones from Ava, in
the possession of the Asiatic Society of Bengal, and published a descrip
tion of them, which at once gave him a recognized position in the roll of
cultivators of science in India, and led to his being appointed in lt>32 to
 succeed    Dr. Royle     as Superintendent of the Botanic Gardens of Suh»-
 runpoor,    in the  North-western     Provinces.
    In the. same year (1832) he made an excursion to the Sub-Himalayan
range, and from the indication of a specimen in the collection of his friend
 and colleague, Captain, now Sir Proby T. Cautley, the real nature of
 which had been previously overlooked, he was led to discover vertebrate
 fossil remains in situ in the tertiary strata of the Sewalik Hills.               The
 search was speedily        followed   up with    characteristic   energy by Captain
 Cautley in the Kalowala Pass, by means of blasting, and resulted in the
 discovery of more perfect remains, including miocene mammalian genera.
 The finding, therefore, of the fossil fauna of the Sewalik Hills was net
 fortuitous, but a result led up to by researches suggested by previous
 special study, and followed out with a definite aim.               Early in 1834 Dr.
 Falconer gave a brief account of the Sewalik           Hills,   describing their phy
 sical features and geological structure, and showing their relation to the
 Himalayahs (Journ. Asiat. Soc. of Bengal, vol. iii. p. 182).               The name
 " Sewalik " had been vaguely applied before then by Rennell and others
to the outer ridges of the true Himalayahs, and the lower elevations towards

                                              XV
the plains.       Dr. Falconer restricted the term definitely to the flanking
tertiary range, which is commonly separated from the Himalayahs by valleys
or Boons. The proposed name was not favourably received at the time
by geographical authorities in India ; but it is now universally adopted in
geography and geology as a convenient and well-founded designation.                  On
his first visit to the Sewalik Hills, Dr. Falconer concluded that they did
not belong to the " New Red Sandstone," to which they had been referred
by Captain Herbert, but that they           were of a tertiary age, and analogous to
the Molassa of Switzerland.           Thirty years of subsequent investigation by
other geologists have not altered that determination, although our exact
knowledge of the formation has been greatly extended.
    The researches thus begun were followed about the end of 1834 by the
discovery by Lieutenants Baker and Durand of the great ossiferous deposit
of the Sewaliks, near the valley of the Markunda, westward of the Jumna,
and below Nahun.           Captain Cautley and Dr. Falconer were immediately
in the field, and by the joint labours of these four officers a subtropical
mammalian fossil fauna was brought to light, unexampled for richness and
extent in any other region then known.              It included the earliest discovered
fossil Quadrumana*,         an extraordinary      number of Proboscidia belonging
to Mastodon, Steyodon,        and Elephas     ; several extinct species of Rhinoceros ;
 Chalicotherium ; two new subgenera of Hippopotamus, viz. Hexaprotodon
and Merycopotamus ; several species of Sua and Ilippohyus, and of Equua
and Hippotherium ; the colossal ruminant Sivatherium, together with fossil
 species   of Camel, Giraffe,      Cervtis,    Antilope, Capra, and new types of
 Bovidce ; Carnivora belonging to the new genera Sivalarctos and Enhy-
 driodon, and also Machairodus, Felis, Jlyeena, Cunis, Gulo, Lutra, &c. j
 among the Aves, species of Ostrich, Cranes, &c. Among the Reptilia,
 Monitors, and Crocodiles, of living and extinct species, the enormous
 tortoise, Colossochelys Atlas, with numerous species of Emys and Trionyx ;
 and among fossil Fish, Cyprinidce and Siluridce.                The general facies of
 the extinct fauna exhibited a congregation of forms participating in Euro
 pean, African, and Asiatic types.          Thrown suddenly upon such rich mate
 rials, the ordinary means resorted to by men of science for determining
 them by comparison were wanting.               Of palseontological works or osteo-
 logical  collections   in that remote    quarter of India there were none. But
 Falconer was not the man to be baffled by such discouragements.                     He
 appealed   to  the  living  forms   abounding     in  the  surrounding forests, rivers,
 and swamps to supply the want.              Skeletons of all kinds were prepared j
 the extinct forms were compared with their nearest living analogues, and
 a series of memoirs by Dr. Falconer and Captain Cautley, descriptive of
    * Dr. Falconer's first published memoir on the
                                                        Quadrumana of the Sewalik Hills
 wo3 dated November 24th, 1836, and it was not until January 16th, 1837, that M.
 Lartet's memoir on the discovery of the jaw of an Ape in the tertiary freshwater forma
 tion of Simorro was presented   to the French Academy of Sciences.

   the most remarkable         of the newly discovered forms, appeared in tlie
   ' Asiatic Researches,' the '    Journal of the Asiatic Society of Bengal,' and

  notice in Europe, and in 1837 the Wollaston Medal, in duplicate, was
  awarded for their discoveries to Dr. Falconer and Capt. Cautley by the
  Geological Society.
       In 1834 a Commission         was appointed by the Bengal Government to
  inquire     into  and report  on the  fitness of India for the growth of the tea-
  plant of China.         Acting on the information and advice supplied bv Dr.
  Falconer (Journ. Asiat. Soc. of Bengal, 1831, iii. p. 182), the Commission
  recommended a trial.           The Government adopted the recommendation;
  the plants were imported from China, and the experimental researches
  were placed under Falconer's superintendence in sites selected by him.
 Tea culture has since then greatly extended in India, and the tea of
 Bengal bids fair to become one of the most important commercial              exports
 from India, as Falconer long ago predicted.
      In  1837      Dr. Falconer   was ordered to accompany Burnes's second
 mission to Caubul,         which preceded the Affghan war.         Proceeding first
 westward to Kohat and the lower part of the valley of Bunguish, he ex
 amined the Trans-Indus portion of the Salt-range, aud then made for
 Cashmeer, where he passed the winter and spring in examining the natural
 history of the valley, and in making extensive botanical collections.            The
 following summer (1838) he crossed the mountains to Iskardo, in Bulkis-
 tan, and traced the Shiggar branch of the Indus to its source in the
 glacier, on the southern flank of the Mooztagh range.             Having examined
 the great glaciers of Arindoh and of the Brahldoh valley, he then returned
 to India viil Cashmeer and the Punjab, towards the close of 1 838, to re
 sume charge of his duties at Suharunpoor.             His report of this expedition
 was at the time one of great interest ana importance.
     In this,    as in many other scientific expeditions, Falconer's health suffered
 greatly     from   the results of incessant exposure; and in 1842 he was com
 pelled to return to Europe on sick leave, bringing with him the natural
history collections amassed by him during ten years of exploration of the
 Himalayahs, of the plains of India, and of the valley of Cashmeer.            They
amounted to eighty cases of dried plants, aud about fifty large eases of
fossil bones, together with geological specimens, illustrative of the Hima
layan formations from the Indus to the Gogra, and from the plains of the
Punjab      across the mountains north       to the Mooztagh  range.    This exten
sive collection of Indian fossils, together with the still larger collection
presented by Capt. Cautley, now forms one of the distinguishing             charac
teristics in the Palseontological Gallery of the British Museum.
     From 1843 to 1817 Falconer remained in England.              He occupied this
time in publishing numerous memoirs on the geology and fossil remains of
the Sewalik Hills, which appeared in the Transactions of the Geological

                                           xvii
    Society, and in the Proceedings       of the Zoological Society, and of the
    Royal Asiatic Society.      He also communicated several important papers
    on botanical subjects to the Linnean Society, of which may be specially
    mentioned    that on Aueklandia     Costus, the Cashmeer plant which yields
    the Kostos of the ancients   ;  and that on Narthex Assafatidce, which was
    the first determination of the plant, long contested among botanists, which
   yields the assafcctida of commerce.        He had found it growing wild in the
   valley of Astore, one of the affluents of the Indus.
       But his main work at this time was the determination and illustration of
   the Indian Fossil collection presented by Captain Cautley and himself to
   the British Museum and to the East India Company.                  The bulk of the
   specimens were still imbedded in matrix.          Sir Robert Peel's Government
   gave a liberal grant to prepare the materials in the national museum for
   exhibition in the Palaeontological Gallery.      Falconer was entrusted with the
   superintendence of the work, and rooms were assigned to him by the
   trustees in the British Museum.       At his instance and under his superin
   tendence a series of casts of the most remarkable of the Sewalik fossils was
  prepared and presented by the Court of Directors of the East India Com
  pany to the principal museums in Europe.               Under the patronage of the
   Government and of the East India House an illustrated work was also
  brought out, entitled
                          " Fauna Antiqua Sivalensis."        In less than three years
  there appeared nine parts of this work, each containing twelve folio plates,
  executed in a style rarely equalled and never surpassed. No fewer than
   1 1 23 specimens  are figured in these plates   ;  and of many specimens three,
  four, or five different views are given.     Besides the Sewalik fossils proper,
  the 'Fauna Antiqua' includes illustrations of a very valuable and important
  series of mammalian remains from the pliocene deposits of the valley of the
  Nerbudda, together with illustrations of the miocene fauna of the Irrawaddi,
 and of Perim Island in the      Gulf of Cambay.       The letter-press of the work
  did not   keep progress  with the  plates ; and at   the close of 1847, before the
 arrears could be brought up, Dr. Falconer was          unfortunately compelled, by
 the expiration of his leave, to return to India,      where he found it impossible
 to continue the work by correspondence        at a  distance from the specimens.
 It   is hoped, however, that the manuscript notes and memoirs which he has
 left behind will form     a complete key to this great work on Indian Palae
 ontology.
      On his return to India in 1848, Dr. Falconer was appointed Superin
 tendent of the Calcutta Botanic Garden, and Professor of Botany in the
 Medical College.       In 1850 he was deputed to the Tenasserim Provinces to
 examine the teak forests, which were threatened with exhaustion from reck
less felling and neglected conservation.         His report, suggesting remedial
measures, was published by the Bengal Government.              In 1852 he published
a memoir recommending the introduction into India of the quinine-yielding
Cinchonas, and indicating the hilly regions in Bengal and the Neilgherries
in Southern India as the most promising situations for experimental nur-
      vol. xv.                                                            c

                                      xviii
series.   Some years afterwards the Cinchona was introduced from South
America, and it is now thriving in India.       In 1854, assisted by his friend
the late  Mr. Henry Walker, he undertook       a ' Descriptive  Catalogue of the
Fossil Collections in the Museum of the Asiatic Society of Bengal,' which
was published as a distinct work in 1859.      In the spring of 1855 he retired
from the Indian service.
    On his return to England he resumed his palseontological researches, and
in 1857 he communicated to the Geological Society two memoirs " On the
Species of Mastodon and Elephant occurring in the Fossil state in England."
Besides attempting to discriminate with precision the three British fossil
elephants, till then confounded under the name of Elephas primigenius, Dr.
Falconer produced for the first time a Synoptical Table, showing the serial
affinities of all the species of Proboscidia, fossil and living, then known, of
the former of which a large number had been either discovered or deter
mined by himself. In the same year he published an account of the remark
able Purbeck mammalian genus ' Plagiaulax,' discovered by Mr. Beckles
near Swanage. In 1860 he communicated a memoir to the Geological Society
 "On the Ossiferous     Caves of Gower," explored or discovered by his friend
Lieut. -Col. Wood. The existence of Elephas anliquus and Rhinoceros hemi-
 tcechus as members of the cave-fauna was then for the first time established,
 and the age of that fauna precisely defined as posterior to the boulder-clay,
or period of the glacial submergence of England.          In 1862 Dr. Falconer
 communicated to the British Association at Cambridge an account of Ele
phas melitensis, the pigmy fossil elephant of Malta, discovered, with other
 extinct mammals, by his friend Captain Spratt, C.B., in the ossiferous cave
 of Zebbug. This unexpected form presented the Proboscidia in a new
light to naturalists.     Further researches on the general questions concern
ing   the same   family appeared in a memoir published in the
                                                                   ' Natural His
 tory Heview' in 1863. Among many notes and papers which never ap
 peared during his life-time may be mentioned a most important memoir
 " On the European Pliocene and Post-pliocene
                                                        species of Rhinoceros,"
 which, it is hoped, will shortly be published.      In this memoir it is shown
 that there are four distinct pliocene and post-pliocene species of Rhinoceros,
 three of which have long been confounded by Cuvier and other palaeonto
 logists under the name of R. leptorhinus.         One of these, R. leptorhinus
 (iJ.  megarhinus of Christol.) has no bony nasal septum ; two, R. Etmscus
  (Falc.) and R. hemitachtcs (Falc), or R. leptorhinus (Owen), have a partial
 bony nasal septum ; while the fourth, R. antiquitatis (Blumb.) or R.
 tichorhinus   (Cuv. & Fisch.), has a complete bony nasal septum.
    While exploring the Himalayahs in his early days, Falconer's attention
 had been closely directed to the physical features which distinguished them
 from mountain-ranges in temperate regions, and more especially to the
 general absence from their southern valleys of the great lakes so common
 in corresponding situations in the Alps.      When the hypothesis of the ex
 cavation of lake-basins by glacial action was brought forward, he took a

                                          xix
share in the discussion, and combated the view by an appeal to the contra
dictory evidence furnished by the Himalayahs, the lakes of Lombardy, and
the Dead Sea.
     For nearly thirty years Dr. Falconer had been engaged more or less with
the investigation of a subject which has lately occupied much of the atten
tion both of men of science and of the educated classes generally, viz. the
proofs of the remote antiquity of the human race. In 1833, fossil bones
procured from a great depth in the ancient alluvium of the valley of the
Ganges in Hindostan were erroneously figured and published as human.
The subject attracted much attention at the time in India. It was in 1835,
while the interest was still fresh, that Dr. Falconer and Captain Cautley
discovered the remains of the gigantic miocene fossil tortoise of India, which
by its colossal size realized the mythological conception of the tortoise
which sustained the elephant and the world together on its back (Geol.
 Trans. 2nd ser. vol. v. 1837, p. 499).         In the same formations as the
 Colossochelys    the  remains  were   discovered of a smaller tortoise, identical
 with the existing Emys tectum. About the same time also several species
 of fossil Quadrumana were discovered in the Sewalik Hills, one of which
 was thought to have exceeded the Ourang-outang, while another was hardly
 distinguishable from the living "Hoonuman" monkey of the Hindoos.
 Coupling these facts with the occurrence of the camel, giraffe, horse, croco
 diles, &c. in the Sewalik fauna, and with the further important fact that
 the plains of the valley of the Ganges had undergone no late submergence,
 and passed through no stage of glacial refrigeration, to interrupt the pre
 vious tranquil order of physical conditions, Dr. Falconer was so impressed
 with the conviction that the human race might have been early inhabitants
 of India, that   he was constantly on the look out for the upturning of the
 relics  of man,  or of his works, from the miocene strata of the Sewalik Hills.
 In April 1844 he wrote thus to his friend Captain Cautley : — "Joining the
 indication given by the Hindoo mythology with the determined fact of the
 little Emys tectum having survived from the fossil period down to the pre
 sent day, I have put forward the opinion that the large tortoise may have
 survived also, and only become extinct within the human period.           This is
  a most important matter in reference to the history of      man."     The  same
 view was publicly announced at the Zoological Society and the British
 Association in 1844.
      Ten years later Dr. Falconer resumed the subject in India, while investi
  gating the fossil remains of the Jumna.        In May 1858, having the same
  inquiry in view, he communicated a letter to the Council of the Geological
  Society, which suggested and led to the exploration of the Brixham cave,
  and the discovery in it of flint-implements of great antiquity associated with
  the bones of extinct animals.      In conjunction with Professor Ramsay and
  Mr. Pengelly he drew up a report on the subject, which, communicated in
   the same year to the Councils of the Royal and Geological Societies, excited
  the interest of men of science in the case.      Following up the   same object,
                                                                     c 2

                                        XX
he immediately afterwards proceeded to Sicily to examine the ossiferous
caves of that island, and there discovered the
                                                   " Grotta di Maccagnone," in
which flint-implements of great antiquity were found adhering to the roof-
matrix, mingled with remains of hyaenas now extinct in Europe. (Quart.
Journ. Geol. Soc. 1859.)        Thus in 1859 the subject of the antiquity of
the human race, which      had   previously been generally discredited by men
of  science,  was  launched   upon fresh evidence.      Since then it has been
actively followed up by     numerous   inquirers,  and Dr.  Falconer himself was
                                                                   ' On Primeval
contemplating, and had indeed actually commenced, a work
Man.'      In  1863 he took an active share in the singularly      perplexed dis
cussion concerning the human jaw of Moulin-Quignon ;           and in the confer
ence of English and French men of science held in France,            he expressed
 doubts as to the authenticity of the specimen, but in that guarded and
cautious manner which was characteristic of him. In the spring of 1864
 he published a notice on the remarkable works of art by "primeval man,"
 discovered by Messrs. Lartet and Henry Christy in the ossiferous caves of
 the Dordogne ; and in September he accompanied his friend Mr. Busk to
 Gibraltar, to examine caves in which marvellously well-preserved remains
 of man and mammals of great antiquity had been discovered. A joint
 report of this expedition by himself and Mr. Busk was afterwards published.
     But his valuable life was drawing to a close.     In January 1 865 he was
 seized with a severe attack of acute rheumatism, from which he had formerly
 suffered in Cashmeer, and which on the 31st of the same month termi
 nated fatally.
     At the time of his death Dr. Falconer was a Vice-President of the Royal
  Society, and Foreign Secretary of the Geological Society ; and as a proof of
 the high esteem in which he was held by his many friends, it may be men
 tioned that the sum of nearly two thousand pounds has been collected for
 founding a Fellowship in Natural Science in the University of Edinburgh,
 to be called "The Falconer Fellowship," and for the execution of a marble
 bust which has been presented to the Royal Society.
     From what has been said, it is obvious that Falconer did enough during
 his life-time to render his name as a palaeontologist immortal in science ;
 but the work which he published was only a fraction of what he accom
 plished.     The amount of scientific knowledge which perished with him was
 very great, for he was cautious to a fault ; he always feared to commit
  himself to an opinion until he was sure that he was right ; and he died in
  the prime of life and in the fulness of his power.       Lovers of science and
  those who    knew  him well can best appreciate his fearlessness of opposition
  when truth was to be evolved,     his originality of observation and depth of
  thought, his penetrating and discriminating judgment, his extraordinary
  memory, the scrupulous care with which he ascribed to every man his due,
  and his honest and powerful advocacy of that cause which his strong intel
  lect led him to adopt : they also have occasion to deplore the death of        a
  staid adviser, a genial companion, and a hearty friend.

                                       xxi
     Vice-Admiral  Robert FitzRoy, bom         at Ampton Hall, Suffolk, Jiriy
 5, 1805, was youngest son of General Lord Charles FitzRoy by his second
 wife, Frances Anne, eldest daughter of the first Marquis of Londonderry.
 He entered the Royal Naval College at Portsmouth in 1818 ; and from
 1819 to 1828 served on board the Owen Glendower, Hind, Thetis,            and
 Ganges in the Mediterranean and on the coasts of South America,           and
became flag-lieutenant at Rio Janeiro.
    In the year last mentioned, on the  decease of Captain Stokes, who, under
Captain King, had been employed in surveying the shores of Patagonia and
Tierra del Fuego, Lieutenant FitzRoy was selected by the commander-in-
cliief on the station, for the command of the Beagle, one of the two ves
sels engaged in the survey.     He entered on his new duties with the zeal
and conscientiousness which through life characterized his professional and
official services.  Of the importance of the task even a non-professional
reader may judge by a comparison of the charts of the South American
coasts published since 1826, with those previously existing. Of the greater
portion of the shores, from the La Plata on the east to the north of Peru
on the west, especially the broken and intricate outlines of the lower lati
tudes, little was known, and that was imperfectly laid down on early charts
in a way which has been aptly described as "confused."           The Chonos
Archipelago was completely omitted, and the Spanish charts of Chiloe
were twenty-five miles in error.
    In the winter of 1829, while surveying the tortuous channels which
ramify   so bewilderingly  in the rugged region to the rear of the Land of
Desolation, Lieutenant FitzRoy discovered two large inland seas (Otway
Water and Skyring Water) connected by a channel twelve miles in length,
to which Captain King gave the name of FitzRoy Passage.           During this
exploration, Lieutenant FitzRoy with two boats was away from the ship
thirty-two days, exposed to the rigours of a severe and stormy climate,
yet no opportunity was lost of making observations and taking notes of
remarkable objects.     At the end of 1830 the two vessels returned to Eng
land, " having added charts of the south-western and southern shores of
Tierra del Fuego, besides those of a multitude of interior sounds and pas
sages," to the results of the first two years of the survey.       Among his
specimens of natural history, Lieutenant FitzRoy brought four native Fue-
gians, and expended largely from his private resources in endeavouring to
improve their condition.
    At the end of 1831, the Beagle having been thoroughly re-equipped,
was again commissioned with Lieutenant FitzRoy as commander to renew
the survey.     On the voyage out a partial examination was made of the
Abrolhos Bank, of which      a brief account was read before the Royal Geo
 graphical Society and published in their Journal.      Other papers from his
 pen are printed in the same periodical, in one of which he sums up in few
 words the results of the additional survey, accomplished with not less spirit
 and intelligence than the former.     "Beginning," he remarks,
                                                                    " with the

                                     xxii
right or southern bank of the wide river Plata, every mile of the coast
thence to Cape Horn was closely surveyed, and laid down on a large scale.
Each harbour and anchorage was planned ; thirty miles of the river Negro,
and two hundred of the Santa Cruz, were examined and laid down, and a
chart was made of the Falkland Islands    .... Westward of Cape Horn, as far
as the parallel of 47° S., little has been added to the results of the Bea
gle's first voyage, because nearly enough was then done for the wants of
vessels in those dreary regions.   But between 47° and the river Guayaquil,
the whole coasts of Chile and Peru have been surveyed ; no port or road
stead has been omitted."
   During this survey (in 1834) Lieutenant FitzRoy was promoted to the
rank of Captain.     In 1835, while he lay at Valdivia, the great earthquake
took place, of which he has given a circumstantial and interesting account.
The Beagle afterwards sailed for an examination of the Galapagos, and
thence for England, touching at fourteen stations from Tahiti to the Azores
to measure meridian distances, for which purpose a large number of chro
nometers had been placed on board. The vessel arrived at Greenwich in
November 1836, having, in the course of her lengthened cruise, circum
navigated the globe.
   Captain Fitzltoy's anxiety to make his work as complete as possible, led
him to hire two vessels and purchase a third at his own cost to fill up the
details of the survey, and include the Falkland Islands. This outlay, how
ever, involved him in embarrassments which hampered him for many years.
The Royal Geographical Society hastened to recognize his merits by award
ing him their Gold Medal for 1836, "for the zeal, energy, and liberality
shown by him in the conduct of the survey ;" and, " acknowledging the
                                         " which he
importance of the mass of information                brought home, declared
it to have been " perhaps not exceeded by any expedition since the time
of Cook and of Flinders." 1 When we remember that Mr. Charles
Darwin was on board the Beagle during the whole of her voyage, and
there gathered the materials for his « Journal and Remarks,' and geologi
cal works since published, the expedition may, indeed, be regarded as me
morable. A full account thereof, written by Captain FitzRoy, was published
in three volumes in 1839.
   In 1839 Captain FitzRoy was chosen an Elder Brother of the Trinity
House; in 1841 he sat in the House of Commons as Member for North
Durham ; in 1 842 he was appointed Acting Conservator of the Mersey ;
and in the following year he went out to New Zealand as Governor, which
post he held for three years. He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society
in 1851 ; in 1854 he was placed at the head of the Meteorological Depart
ment of the Board of Trade ; in 1857 he became Rear- Admiral, Vice- Ad
miral in 1863, and in 1864 the Academy of Sciences of the Institute, Paris,
elected him a Corresponding Member of their Section of Geography and
Navigation.
   In carrying out the duties of his appointment at the Board of Trade,

                                          xxiii
  Admiral FitzRoy displayed the earnestness which had always distinguished
  him. Indeed the severe attention he bestowed on the details of his func
  tion, the originating of storm-signals, the publication of ' Reports ' and the
  ' Weather Book,'
                       brought on a severe mental strain which eventually occa
  sioned his death on the 30th of April, 1865. The manner of his death was
  a shock felt far beyond the circle of his friends, and to them exceedingly
  painful.   But they remember him as a man of kindly nature, courteous
  and considerate in no common degree, inspiring those who knew him best
  with affectionate attachment.
     The life of Benjamin Gompertz is given at length in the 'Assurance
 Magazine' for April 1866, a journal in which original investigations on a
 branch of mathematical application make their first appearance, and
 which, therefore, must remain accessible        to the scientific world.   He was
 of a Dutch Jewish family, of which the original name was Cohen, and his
 father was a diamond merchant, whose means left several sons in affluence.
 He was born March 5, 1779. He had an early turn for mathematics, and
 at the age of eighteen became a member of the old Mathematical Society
 of Spitalfields, of which he was President when it merged in the Astro
 nomical Society.      The ordinary biographical details of his life are very
 simple.    He married (in 1810) the sister of Sir Moses Montefiore, so well
 known for his benevolent exertions : he had previously started in life on
 the Stock Exchange.          The loss of his only son (in 1823) occasioned his
retirement     from  this   pursuit, and produced a depression which made his
friends    anxious that     he should   divert his mind by engaging again in
business. . They persuaded him to take the Actuaryship of the Alliance
Office ; and common rumour stated that the office itself was founded by
his friends to procure him employment.             On his retirement in 1848 he
continued to apply himself to mathematical subjects, even long after he had
fallen into a state of bodily debility.     He died on the 14th of July, 1866.
    Mr. Gompertz's writings, especially those on imaginary quantities and
on mortality,     show decided inventive power, and that strong aspiration
after rigour which characterizes the old English school.            Of this school
he may be called      the   last.   We do  not  except Lord  Brougham, an older
man and an older mathematician, who is still left to us : his early writings
are   of the mixed type   ;   they show that combination of the old English and
the Continental which was made in Scotland before it was made in
England.      Mr. Gompertz was the genuine disciple of the ' Ladies' Diary,'
the 'Mathematical Companion,' and that tribe of periodicals supported by
all grades, from the man of business to the artisan, which were read and
written in by many mathematicians of power to whom the Philosophical
Transactions were unknown.            Mr. Gompertz contracted some marked
peculiarities.    He was the last of the fluxionists : to the day of his death
he used the notation of Newton, and he held that respect for Newton's
memory demanded this adherence,          while at the same time he maintained

                                           XXIV
the superiority of the system. He never would permit himself the abbre
 viations log x, sin x, &c; it was always logarithm of x, sine of x, &c.
This, and some other consequences of isolated thought, in the mind of a
 man who was not thrown among his equals in power until he was an old
student, will be looked at with interest.
      The thing by which Mr. Gompertz will always be remembered, is the
 discovery of the function which' so nearly gives the law of human life,
                      1
 published in our Transactions.'           His recent developments of his own law
 are as yet sub judice, but they show the continuance of youthful energy to
 a very late period.        Those who know the state of the writer when his last
 papers were published, will wonder at the vigour of mind which remained
 untouched by bodily weakness. The law above mentioned stands alone as
 capable of physiological enunciation : tell a mathematician that it is
                                                                                " the
 power to oppose decay loses equal proportions in equal times," add that
 the constants undergo nearly sudden changes, and he will be able to re
 establish the whole theory.
'
      In the memoir to which we have alluded will be found a full account of
 Mr. Gompertz's connexion with the Royal Astronomical Society and other
 Associations.      He   became a Fellow     of this Society in 1819.
     Sir Benjamin Heywood, Bart., born the 12th of December,             1 793, of an
 ancient Lancashire        family,  was   the eldest son of Nathaniel Heywood,
 banker in Manchester.          His mother was the daughter of Thomas Percival,
 M.D., elected in 1/65, at the age of twenty-five, a Fellow of the Royal
  Society, and the author of ' Medical Ethics.'
     After receiving a good school education, Benjamin Heywood completed
 his studies in the University of Glasgow, where he distinguished himself
 in the Logic Class of Professor Jardine, as well as in the Moral Philosophy
  Class of Professor Mylne.         In 1811 he entered on his hereditary calling
 the bank at Manchester.           He married in 1816 the daughter of the late
 Thomas Robinson, Esq.             Of this marriage, six sons aud two daughters
 survive him.
      The Manchester       Mechanics'    Institution  was founded   in 1824 by   the
 active exertions of     Mr. Heywood, who for twenty years held the office of
  President, and on his retirement from the presidential chair, the Directors,
  impressed with the suggestive and practical character of his addresses,
  collected and published them.
      Scientific  pursuits   were  always encouraged in the Institution by Mr.
  Heywood.       In 1838, after a conversation with Mr. Leonard Horner, F.R.S.,
  he recommended certificates of proficiency to be granted to meritorious stu
  dents when they had completed an allotted course of study.               This plan
  was subsequently adopted with benefit to the Institution.
      In 1831 a large majority of the inhabitants of Lancashire        were greatly
  nterested in the Reform        Bill, which conferred on many of their towns the
   right of representation in parliament.           At the general election of that

                                           XXV
year, Mr. Heywood was chosen without opposition one of the members
for the county of Lancaster to support the government measure of reform.
 His    courtesy, integrity, and determined adherence to principle,             gained for
him general confidence, but parliamentary life did not suit his health, and
on the dissolution of parliament, after the passing of the Reform Act in 1832,
 he retired from the arduous duties of         a public career.
      Statistics were    always an interesting science to Mr. Heywood.                  He
 earnestly supported the formation of the Manchester Statistical Society,
 conducted a valuable inquiry into the condition of the working classes in
 Manchester, and as one of the officers of the Statistical Section, presented
 the results of this investigation (in 1834) at the Edinburgh Meeting of the
British Association for the Advancement of Science.
      In 1838, at the accession of Her Majesty Queen Victoria, Lord Mel
 bourne being Prime Minister, Mr. Heywood was created a baronet.                        In
 1813 he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society, and twice held the
 office of a Vice-President of the British Association, on the successive
                                                                                            '
 •visits of that body to Manchester.         He died on the 1 1th of August, 1865.
      Sir William Jackson Hooker               was    bom   at  Norwich    on the 6th    of
 July, 1785. He was descended of a family which aforetime had given birth
 to men of eminence, and among them the author of the ' Ecclesiastical
  Polity.' Born to affluence, and educated at a school of reputation, he as a
 young man was enabled to devote his life to science, without the need of
  following a special calling.     Circumstances brought him early into relation
 with     some    distinguished  naturalists,   and among the rest Sir James Ed
  ward Smith, the most eminent British botanist of his day ; and the influ
  ence of this acquaintanceship combining with his own taste, no doubt, helped
  to decide his choice of a pursuit.          In 1809, through the encouragement
  of Sir Joseph Banks,        to whom    he had become          known,    young Hooker
  visited Iceland, which he extensively explored, making large collections in
  all branches of Natural History ; but these, together with all his notes and
   drawings, were totally lost on his way home, through the burning of the
   ship in which he was returning.        His escape, by the opportune arrival of
  another vessel in mid-ocean, was almost miraculous.              An account of it will
                                                   '
   be found    in the modest narrative called        Recollections of Iceland.'
      In  1810-11 he made preparations for accompanying Sir Robert Brown-
  rigg, who had been appointed Governor of Ceylon, to that island, then but
  little known to naturalists.      With this design, he disposed of his estates,
   and   invested    the  proceeds in  securities, which were unfortunately ill-
   chosen, and afterwards much decreased          in value.     As an illustration  of the
   zeal with which he prepared for his enterprise, the fact is recorded that he
   made pen-and-ink copies of the plates and descriptions of the entire manu
   script series of Roxburgh's Indian plants, preserved in the India House.
   His plans, however, were frustrated by the intestine troubles in the island
   followed by the Candian war which soon afterwards broke out.

                                           xxvi
         In  1814 he made a botanizing expedition     into France, Switzerland, and
      the north of Italy, which extended over a period of nine months, and in
      the course of which he became acquainted, at Paris and elsewhere, with the
      principal botanists of Europe ; thug laying the foundation of a scientific
      intercourse and correspondence which lasted until his death.
         In 1815 he married the eldest daughter of Mr. Dawson Tomer, a banker
     in Yarmouth, and settled at Halesworth, in Suffolk, where his house at
     once became the rendezvous of British and foreign botanists, and where
     he commenced the formation of that great Herbarium which is now the
     finest in the world.
         His first botanical work was that on the British Jungermanniae, which
     was completed in 1816'.       This, which is a model of skilful microscopic
     dissection and accurate description, is illustrated by engravings after draw
    ings by his own exquisite pencil.      The ' Muscologia Britannica ' was pub
    lished in conjunction with Dr. Taylor, in 1817, and was followed by the
    *
       Musci Exotici.' These and other works, added to an increasing home
    and foreign correspondence, fully occupied his time for the next five
    years of his life. Meanwhile his property had been rapidly deteriorating,
    and with an increasing family he found it necessary to look out for some
    remunerative scientific employment.         He therefore accepted the Regius
    Professorship of Botany in the University of Glasgow, at that time vacant,
   and removed to that city in 1820.
        His life at Glasgow was entirely devoted to botany ; he rose early, and
   went late to bed ; he visited but little, and devoted the whole powers of
   his mind and his pencil to his favourite science.       He was a most popular
   lecturer, his class being sometimes attended by as many volunteers as
   collegians ; he encouraged his students in the pursuit, by taking them on
  excursions, by giving them rare plants from his duplicates, and by furnish
  ing them with letters of introduction to all parts of the world when they
  went abroad.       He kept up    a close connexion   with the authorities of the
  Admiralty, Treasury, Foreign,        and Colonial Offices ; and it was mainly
  through his exertions that botanists were so frequently appointed to the
  various Government expeditions of that period.
       During the twenty years he resided at Glasgow he published his ' Flora
  Scotica,' in which     the plants of a great part of the British Isles were for
 the first time arranged according to the natural method ; the ' Flora Exo
 tica,' and (in conjunction with Dr. Greville) the ' Icones Filicum ; ' also
 the 'Botanical Miscellany,' the 'Journal of Botany,' the 'Icones Planta-
 rum,'     the ' British Flora,' the ' Botany of Ross's, Parry's, Franklin's,
                                              '
 Back's, and other Arctic Expeditions ;          the 'Flora Boreali- Americana,'
 and (in conjunction with Dr. Walker Arnott) the ' Botany of Beechey's
 Voyage,' and various other works of standard authority.            In 1826 he
 commenced the authorship of the 'Botanical Magazine,' which he carried
on for nearly forty years. His Herbarium in the meantime was
                                                                       constantly
receiving accessions,     mainly owing to the indefatigable correspondence     he

                                      xxvii
ltept up with all parts of the world, and to the number of trained Scotch
medical students who, when seeking their fortunes in foreign countries,
continued to send him plants, even up to the day of his death.
    During his residence in Glasgow he was twice offered knighthood,
which he accepted from William the Fourth in the year 1836 ; this honour
being bestowed on him in consideration of his scientific labours, and the
great services he had rendered to botany. His connexion with Scotland as
a Professor terminated in 1841, when he was appointed to the Director
ship of the Royal Gardens at Kew.
    It is worthy of being recorded that Sir William Hooker, who from the
commencement of his botanical career felt a strong interest in Kew, had
never abandoned the secret idea that the time might come when these Gar
dens should be made over to the nation, and become the head-quarters of
botanical science   for England, as well as its colonies and dependencies in
all parts of the world, and that it might be his fortune to be a chief
instrument in bringing about this end, and in rendering Kew an establish
ment worthy of the country. The idea of devoting the Gardens at Kew to
this great national and scientific purpose had been keenly cherished by
John Duke of Bedford, himself an ardent horticulturist. With that
nobleman Sir William Hooker was on terms of friendship and correspond
ence ; and the Duke did not fail to urge upon those in political power the
fulfilment of what was with Sir   William himself a favourite project. Upon
the Duke's death, his son, the    late Duke of Bedford, zealously carried out
his father's wishes ; but it was   upon the present Earl Russell, then Lord
John, that the chief weight of    the transaction fell ; and it is to him that
the nation owes these magnificent gardens.
    In 1841 Mr. Aiton, for fifty years the Director     of the Royal Gardens,
resigned his post at Kew, and was succeeded by Sir William Hooker, who
 entered upon his duties in command of resources for the development of
the Gardens, such aa had never been combined in any other person. Single
of purpose and straightforward in action, by his honest      zeal, and singular
 tact in making his plans clear and obviously advantageous to the public,
he at once won the confidence of that branch of the Government under
which he worked.       Another means which he at once brought to bear on
the work in hand, was his extensive foreign and colonial correspondence,
 especially that with students whom he had imbued with a love of botany,
and who, scattered over the most remote countries of the globe, gladly
 availed themselves of their opportunities of contributing to the scientific
 resources  of the establishment.   His views were further greatly facilitated
by his friendly intercourse with the Foreign and Colonial Offices, the Ad
 miralty, and the East India Company ; to all of whom he had been the
 means of rendering service, by his judicious recommendation of former
pupils to posts in their employment, and by publishing the botanical re
 sults of the expeditions they sent out.   Nor can we omit to mention here
the late curator of the Royal Gardens, Mr. John Smith, an officer of un

                                           XXV1U
usual botanical    and horticultural knowledge, by whom he was zealously
seconded  in all his plans.
  To describe the various improvements which have resulted in the pre
sent establishment, — including, as it does, a botanic garden of 75 acres, and
a pleasure-ground or arboretum of 270 acres, three museums, stored with
many thousand specimens of vegetable products, and a magnificent Library
and Herbarium (for the greater part the private property of Sir William),
placed in the late King of Hanover's house on one side of Kew Green, and
adjoining the Gardens,
                       — would rather be to give a history of the Gardens
than to sketch the life of their Director; it will suffice, therefore, to
record the following dates of the more interesting events which haTe
marked their progress.
    The first step was the opening of the Gardens to the public on week
days, which followed immediately upon Sir William entering upon the
Directorship.     Rather more than 9000 persons visited them during the
first year of   their being thrown open, and the number has steadily in
creased.       In 1864 the number of visitors amounted to 473,307-
   About 1843 the Queen granted from the contiguous pleasure-ground an
addition of 4 7 acres, including a piece of water, by the side of which the
Palm stove was afterwards erected.
   In 1846 the Royal Kitchen and Forcing Gardens, which ran along the
side of the Richmond-road, were added.     Upon this piece of ground stood
an old fruit-house, since memorable as the origin of the first Museum of
Economic Botany that ever existed.        Sir William requested that thi
building might not be pulled down, but that it might be fitted up to receiv
specimens of vegetable products illustrative of the nature and uses of
plants, and the whole thrown open to the public.     Through the exertions
of the indefatigable Director, aided by Mr. Smith, the Economic Collection
has now become important and well known.
    In   1861 was commenced  the large Temperate House in the pleasure-
grounds, often called the Winter Garden ; the last building wanting to
complete the establishment as representing horticulture.    This beautiful
building, which is not yet completed, was designed by Mr. Decimus Burton,
and is admirably adapted to its purpose ; the interior arrangement of the
beds, and of the plants in them, which have been so much admired,                         is,
however, wholly due to Sir William's judgment and taste.
    Itmight be supposed that the twenty-four years spent at Kew in con
triving and directing these public improvements, added to the daily cor
respondence and superintendence of the Gardens, would have left but little
time and energy for scientific pursuits  such, however, was far from being
                                              ;
the case.  By keeping up the active habits of his early life, Sir William was
enabled to get through   greater amount of scientific work than any other
                           a
botanist of his age.  The British Flora,' which has now reached the 12th
                               '

Arnott   ;   but his monthly   *

                                                           was recommenced   ;   first   ap

pearing as the London,' and afterwards as the Kew Journal of Botany ;'
which together extended to seventeen annual volumes, and was enriched with
papers of his own ; with letters from his correspondents in all parts of the
world ; with reviews of botanical works ; with contributions on physiolo
gical, structural, and systematic botany ; and with notices of the progress
of the science everywhere. With the exception of carrying on the ' Bo
tanical Magazine,' for the last fifteen years of his life most of his leisure
was devoted to the study of Ferns, and on this subject he published two
works of standard value, the fruit of great labour — the ' Genera Filicum,'
with illustrations by the late Mr. Francis Bauer, and the          '           Filicum,'
                                                                     Species
commenced           in the year 1846,    and  finished  only last year.     This work,
which is in five volumes, and contains the only complete systematic de
scription of the vast tribe of plants to which it is devoted, would of itself
have been sufficient to establish a botanical reputation, and is regarded as
a standard authority upon the subject.             During the last few years of his
life, he also published his ' Garden Ferns,' ' Exotic Ferns,' and ' British
            '
Ferns    ;    all beautifully illustrated, and with descriptions from his own pen.
                                                              '
At    the date of his death he was engaged upon a Synopsis Filicum,' of
which      one number only has appeared.
     In connexion with the scientific labours of Sir William Hooker, there
are two names which should be prominently mentioned.                   The one is that
of Lady Hooker, who for forty years was his able amanuensis and assistant
in literary work, and the other that of Mr. Walter Fitch, now                one of the
most distinguished botanical artists in Europe.               Up  to  about   1835, Sir
William made the drawings for his works with his own hand ; but about
that time he was fortunate in having the skill of this artist brought before
him, whose talents he encouraged, and whose services he eventually secured
for the illustration of his works.         Most faithfully has Mr. Fitch seconded
 his early patron and friend in his labours. Of their extent some idea may
 he formed from the fact that Mr. Fitch has executed in the last thirty
 years upwards of 4000 drawings of plants, all of which have been published
 by Sir William.
     Of Sir William Hooker it may be said, that an almost unbounded libera
 lity was one of his most prominent features; and scientific Botany is more
 indebted to him than to any individual since Sir Joseph Banks, for the
 progress it has made within the last half century.          In his dealings with the
 nation his conduct was as liberal as it was towards his fellow-botanists. For
 the first twelve years of his residence at Kew, his Herbarium and Library
 were not only kept up at his own expense for the use and benefit of the Royal
 Gardens, but were open to every botanist who applied at his house to make
 use of them.            To him we are indebted for the appointment not only of
 botanists but naturalists to the majority of the Government expeditions of
 discovery, survey, and research, which have been sent out during the last
 thirty years     ;   and it has been mainly through his energy that funds have
 been forthcoming from Government to meet the after expenses of publishing

                                         XXX
their results.     To young botanists he        was especially kind and helpful ;
indeed there are     few cultivators  of this   science in Europe or America who
have not borne cordial testimony to his generosity and encouragement.
Amongst his latest efforts has been the inducing of the Home and Colonial
Governments to grant the necessary funds for the publication of the Floras
of their possessions ; and within the two last years of his life he prevailed
upon Sir Charles Wood, the President of the Indian Board, in like manner
to support the publication of the Flora of British India ; while, through
the influence of his steady friend Earl Russell, he has also procured a grant
for the publication    of the Flora of tropical Africa.
    Sir William    was in person tall, athletic, and active   ; in features remark
 ably good-looking, animated, and cheerful ; his conversation had the charm
 of intellectual cultivation and refinement, and he had a ready power of
 conveying clear information.        As a scientific correspondent he was unri
 valled  ;   promptly answering    every letter  with his own hand    ; encouraging
 those who first addressed him, and stimulating those who flagged. Indeed
 he was wont to attribute his success in the creation of the National Gardens
 and the accompanying Museums to his habit of thanking every contributor
 at once, answering all their questions at whatever trouble, naming the
 plants they sent, and applying personally to residents in every part of the
 world for such plants or their products as he desired to have in the Gar
 dens.
     He  was an   LL.D. of  Glasgow, D.C.L. of Oxford ; a Fellow of the Royal
  Societies of London and Edinburgh, the Linnean, Antiquarian, Geogra
 phical, and other Societies; a Knight of Hanover, Companion of the
 Legion of Honour, a Correspondent of the Academy of France, and a
 member of almost every other learned Academy in Europe and America.
  The date of his election into the Royal Society was January 9, 1812.
     He died at Kew on the 12th of August, 1865, in the 81st year of his age,
  after a very short illness, of a complaint in the throat, then epidemic at
  that place.
     He    leaves a widow, two married      daughters,, and one son,     Dr. Joseph
  Dalton Hooker,     F.R.8.,  now Director of the Royal Gardens.
     John Lindley        was the son of a nurseryman of considerable ability,
  who was the author of a manual of horticulture.           He was born at Catton,
  near Norwich, on the 5th of February, 1799, and was educated at the
  Grammar School of Norwich under Dr. Valpy.               He left school at the age
  of sixteen, and was employed for three or four years in his father's nursery,
  devoting all his leisure time to the study of botany and horticulture with
  that remarkable energy and untiring perseverance which characterized his
  whole life.     His father failing in business shortly before he came of age,
  young Lindley was thrown on his own resources, not only for his own sup
  port, but for the discharge of his father's debts, which he took upon him
  self.    Proceeding to London in 1819, he obtained from Sir Joseph Banks

                                       xxxi
(to whom he was introduced by Sir William (then Mr.) Hooker, his earliest
scientific friend) the position of his assistant librarian, and at this early age
began the long series of works with which his name will be for ever iden
                                                             '
tified by the publication of a translation of Richard's Analyse du Fruit,'
made at Mr. Hooker's house at Halesworth in Suffolk at one sitting, which,
however, lasted two days and three nights.
      In 1822 Lindley became Garden Assistant Secretary to the Horticul
tural Society, an appointment which influenced his whole career, as he re
mained connected with that Society, in one capacity or other, throughout
his whole working life. The gardens at Chiswick were at that time in
process of formation, and to their development he devoted all his energy.
In 1826' he became sole Assistant Secretary, conducting, under the Hono
rary Secretaries Joseph Sabine, Bentham, Henderson, Gowen, and Royle, all
the proceedings of that active Society, which has for so long a time taken a
 prominent part in advancing horticulture to the position it now holds in
 this country both as a science and an art.
       Not satisfied with these laborious duties, which would have tasked all
 the energies of a man of ordinary capacity for work, Lindley became in
 1829 Professor of Botany in University College, an appointment which he
 held for upwards of thirty years. He was a remarkably exact, clear and im
 pressive lecturer, possessed an admirable faculty of lucid exposition, and
 was most copious in illustration. He never read his lectures, but they were
 always carefully studied beforehand.
       Nor were these various occupations enough for his ever active mind.
 Thoroughly versed in the literature of Botany and its kindred sciences, he
  found time to prepare a series of general works on almost every branch of
  the science, all of great value, and many of them still standard books of
  reference in the hands of students.     Beginning his career as a naturalist at
  the time when the natural system of Botany was acquiring its highest de
  velopment in France, though known only to a few in England, where the
  Linnean system was still universally taught, Lindley brought all the weight
  of his teaching and all the force of his controversial powers to the support
   of the new system, and was, if not the leader, at least the most prominent
   advocate of a change now universal.      His ' Synopsis of the British Flora,'
                                            '
   published in 1829, was followed by an Introduction to the Natural System
   of Botany' in 1830, which passed through a second edition in 1836, and
   took the form of * The Vegetable Kingdom,' probably the best known of
   all his works,    in 1846.   To Medical Botany    he contributed    an excellent
    Flora Medica,    to Palaeontology   the well-known    Fossil  Flora, in which
   Mr. Hutton     was his coadjutor, and to Horticultural Science    a work on the
   Theory and Practice of Horticulture, which     he himself regarded as perhaps
   his most important work, probably because it contained the greatest amount
   of original matter.
       To  these general works must be added a long series     of monographs and
    isolated descriptions of plants in a great many periodicals. From his posi

                                        xxxii
  ticm at the  Horticultural Society, he had the earliest opportunity of seeing
  novelties, and made it his business to describe all that came before him.
                                               '
  He edited for a long series of years the Botanical Register,' a periodical
  devoted to figures and descriptions of new or rare plants of general interest,
  and contributed a large portion of many other serial works.             His earliest
  monograph     was that  on  Roses, published   in 1820  in  his  twenty-first year.
  This was followed in 1821 by 'Collectanea         Botanica,'   an illustrated work
  published at the expense of Mr. Cattley, an eminent amateur cultivator.
  Soon after he became connected with the Horticultural Society he began
  to devote himself specially to the study of Orchidese, a family the investi
  gation of which is extremely difficult unless from living plants, and which
  from the multiplicity of its forms and the minuteness and intricacy of its
  flowers, tasks to the utmost the powers of observation of the naturalist
 With this family his name will be for ever associated, not only as the de-
 scriber of a very great number of new genera and species, but as the author
  of a series of general works, the last of which, ' Folia Orchidacea,' to the
 regret of all naturalists, was left unfinished at his death. It was with spe
 cial reference to the important service he rendered to science by these great
 works that the Royal Medal of the Society was awarded to him in 185",
 though the value of his other labours was also duly recognized.
      Till he was past fifty, Dr. Lindley was wont to say that he never knew
 what it was to feel tired either in body or mind.             His first illness was
 the result of his arduous duties as a juror of the Great Exhibition of 1S5I,
 but a few months' rest seemed to restore him to his usual health. Unfor
 tunately, much against the wish of his family, he undertook the charge of
 the Colonial Department of the Exhibition of 1862, and though constantly
 ailing he refused to abandon his post, and carried its duties successfully to
 a close.    The effort  was too great.    His mental and physical powers re
 ceived a shock from which they never recovered.            He was compelled to
relinquish all active employment, though his bodily health remained good
till the 1st of November in 1865, when he was carried off by apoplexy
in his sixty-seventh year. The date of his election into the Royal Society
is January 1/, 1828.
     John William Lubbock was born March 26, 1803. His father, the
second baronet of his name, was at the head of the banking and mercantile
firm of Lubbock and Co.         The son, though of a tender constitution, was
partly educated at Eton, and was then placed under the care of Dr. (after
wards Bishop) Maltby. Here he might have made progress in the classics,
but his turn had been towards exact science from his earliest years.            His
father had intended him for Oxford, but, at his own earnest request, he
was placed at Trinity College, Cambridge, in 1821.           The continental ma
thematics had been recently introduced into general study, and Mr. Lub
bock, perceiving their superior power as means of investigation, spent his
first long vacation at Paris, and became a confirmed follower of that

                                         xxxiii
school.      Even in his own path, his reading was very much directed to the
subjects of his subsequent career ; and he had no motive to seek univer
sity honours as a means of success in life.          Accordingly, in the Tripos of
 1825, he obtained no higher place than that        of first of the senior Optimes,
though      his   power   and  reading  as  a mathematician were well known*.
This commencement was of a character which lasted. Sir John Lubbock
was throughout life engaged in following up a special scientific pursuit,
which     was his main business      as an investigator, as   it had been his main
study at the University.
     On leaving college he spent a short time in travelling, and on his return
commenced a life of business as a partner in his father's house, and a life
of scientific inquiry. He joined the Astronomical Society in 1828, and our
 Society in 1829.        In this year he was also a member of the committee for
the Diffusion       of Useful Knowledge, on which he worked for many years.
The establishment of the ' British Almanac ' in 1827 owed much to his
superintendence ; and this work stimulated his attention to the theory of
the tides.      In the ' Companion' for 1830 appears his first scientific writ
ing, a descriptive memoir on the tides.          It is the most precise account of
the existing state of the subject ; its history has dates, and its explana
tions have formulas.          Mr. Lubbock was the colleague of Whewell and
 others in calling attention to the necessity of observation of the tides.         In
 1 834 the Royal Medal was awarded to him for his researches on the subject.
     In 1833 he married a daughter of Lieut.-Col. Hotham.               He was the
 first Vice-Chancellor of the University of London, a Treasurer of the Great
 Exhibition of 185 1, a Visitor of the Greenwich Observatory, and a member
 of various scientific commissions. He was Treasurer and Vice-President
 of the Royal Society from 1830 to 1835, and again from 1838 to
 1845.      At his father's death    he was left the only working      partner; and
his reign      of  sole  management    included   the  panics   of 1847  and 1857.
 His entrance into the house was marked by the panic of 1825, in which
 the firm weathered with honour a run of unprecedented severity ; the
 severest competitive examination, says one of the journals, which a bank
 ever stood.       Sir J. Lubbock never liked business, but he attended to it
 with perfect regularity.        His early mornings and evenings were devoted
 to science, but not without exciting remark.              In the day which has
 gone by, a man of business, or a professional man, was required to abstain
 from everything useful in private life or ornamental in society. He might
 spend leisure in sporting, in cards, in smoking, in eating and drinking, or
in talking politics ; but not in promoting science, nor in any unselfish
 addition to social pleasure. He might listen to music, but woe to the banker
 or the physician who should sing or play the violin in company.               Sir J.
 Lubbock is one of an eminent band who have driven this paltry prejudice
    * It is necessary to explain to those who are not connected with Cambridge that
 this triple superlative, First Senior Opiime, means the head of the second class of
 university honours.

                                              xxxiv
out of society.                              of his (Oct. 30, 1840) to a busi
                      There is extant a letter
ness associate,      who had remonstrated in the usual way.   "There is," he
says,
        " one circumstance which     gave me much pain             in   a letter   you wrote   to
mv late father some time since. You alluded to my position as Treasurer
and Vice-President of the Royal Society . . . But if by rising early and
late taking rest, or if in hours which others devote to society or sports
of the field,    I
                choose to investigate questions in astronomy, or in any
other science, I do not consider that any of the correspondents of the
house are warranted in addressing to me any reproach.       submit these     I
remarks to your friendly consideration."
   After his father's death he withdrew almost entirely from society, and
resided at High Elms, in Kent.     Here he showed that there was time left
from the wants   both  of business  and of science. He was a farmer, and
his southdowns and shorthorns (in which Lord Althorp himself did not
take more pride than he) carried off many prizes.     He planted choice
shrubs and trees, especially conifers ; he kept up three village schools ; and
he instructed his own children in mathematics.      The old man of (nothing
but) business might shake his head and say, Ah! that house will never stand
what it stood under old Sir John: but, nevertheless, it kept up both credit
and confidence, and joined another old bank in 1860. The firm of Ro-
barts, Lubbock, and Co. has fully answered all expectations. By this junc
tion Sir J. Lubbock had intended to give himself comparative leisure ; for
fifteen years he had never been away from business for three consecutive
days. The leisure was gained, but the power of using it was gone ; the
work of two lives was a run upon the strength of one which ended in
failure.    He    became a sufferer from gout, and the last five years                  of his
life were marked by increasing debility.  He died January 20, 1865, the
immediate cause being valvular disease in the heart. He often said he had
done his work and was quite ready to go.  He leaves behind him the memory
of an upright and benevolent man, utterly free from selfseeking, and devoted
to high pursuits by high moral motives and strong intellectual impulses.
   Sir J. Lubbock's researches in the lunar and planetary theories date
from the year 1832 ; his separate work, ' On the Theory of theMoon and on
the Perturbations of the Planets,' was published, the principal portion, dur
ing the years 1834 to 1838, but there are supplementary parts up to 1850.
   In the lunar theory, as originally established by Clairaut, the true longi
tude of the moon is taken as the independent variable ; and Laplace was
of opinion that, on account of the magnitude of the lunar inequalities, this
was,    in fact, the only   safe course   ;   it         adopted by him in
                                                   was accordingly
his own    researches,   and also in Damoiseau's memoir, in the unpublished
memoir     of Carlini and Plana, and               great work on the lunar
                                                   tin   Plana's
theory.   The time or mean longitude of the moon, and the radius vector
and latitude, are in the first instance obtained in terms of the true longi
tude of the moon, and then by reversion of series, the true longitude,
the radius vector, and the latitude are
                                            expressed in terms of the time.

                                             XXXV
But in the theories of Laplace and Damoiseau,       the coefficients of the
several inequalities are presented in an unreduced form, involving denomi
nators and auxiliary quantities, which it is assumed are to he calculated
numerically, and by means of them the final numerical values of the coeffi
cients are obtained. In Plana' s work, on the contrary, the coefficients are
presented completely developed in powers and products of e, e, y, m (the
excentricities of the two orbits, the tangent of the inclination, and the ratio
of the mean motions)           with coefficients, which     are,   of   course,   absolutely
determinate numbers.
     The results     so presented constitute,       to the degree of approximation
preserved, a complete algebraical solution           of the problem ; they are deter
minate results, in no wise dependent for their truth on the convergency of
the series, and they are of course absolutely independent of the particular
process made use of for obtaining them.       They are consequently results
obtainable by the adoption of the time as the independent variable ; and
this    in fact, the course followed by Lubbock — viz., taking the time as
        is,
the independent variable, he obtains directly the expressions of the true lon
gitude, latitude, and radius vector in terms of the time
                                                       expressions strictly
                                                                   ;
comparable with those of Plana, and which, but for the different significa
tions of the and
               e  in the two theories, would be identical therewith.

advantage of Lubbock's method       its directness the expressions for the
                                        is                 ;
solar coordinates are in both theories given in the first instance by the
elliptical theory in terms of the time, and in Lubbock's theory they are
used in that form    whereas, in the theory of Clairaut, they have to be
                         ;
transformed into functions of the true longitude of the moon, and the so
transformed expressions are used in the calculation of the time and the
radius vector and latitude of the moon in terms of the true longitude and            ;
there    is,
          finally, the laborious reversion of series whereby the co-ordinates
of the moon are expressed in terms of the time.
   The researches on the tides are not easily described. They consist in the
main of the application of the existing theory to masses of observation.
Sir J. Lubbock was the first who introduced to the fullest extent the plan
of consolidating the results of all the observations Laplace took chiefly
                                                               :
those made at the times when the irregularity  under investigation was near
its maximum.        clearAaccount of Lubbock's  mode of proceeding    given         is
by  Mr. Airy in his article on the tides       489-491) in the 'Encyclo
                                                      (§
paedia Metropolitana.'    We may mention  that  the man of business was in
this matter   valuable colleague of the man of science.
               a                                         Mr. Lubbock's
relations with the late Mr. Solly, Chairman of the London Dock Com
pany, procured him access to the observations made at the docks through
a golden number of years (1808-1826).    We should rather say, procured
him the knowledge of the existence of the observations.   Mr. Solly, we
are sure from knowledge, would gladly have communicated his information
to any    inquirer   ;   and the Board would        have given hearty assent.            But
                                                                            d2

many investigators might have passed a life in the subject without arriving
at the fact that the observations existed.
    In a separate work on the heat of vapours and on refraction (1840),
the assumption is that the absolute heat of a gas may be represented by
A    + B x (temperature).         A relation between pressure aud temperature
is then deduced, the constants of which can be determined by joint obser
vations of pressure and temperature.               The observations of Arago and
Dulong (Mem. Inst. x. 231), and of Ure (Phil. Traus. 1818), are thus
satisfied.    Employing the observations of Gay-Lussac (Conn, des Temps,
 1841), he deduces a formula for the calculation of heights by barometrical
observation, and then proceeds to the subject of refraction.                    In this
matter, to a great extent, he follows Ivory.               The investigation is never
theless new and peculiar, and the conclusions are remarkable.               The results
of Lubbock's theory and Bessel's Tables are almost identical.              Down to  65°
of zenith distance    the difference is not 0"-01     ; nor from thence to 87° does
it ever amount to l"-0 ;      at 88°  it  is 4"-0.     It would require a very large
number of observations       to discriminate between them.           It appears there
fore that, from the assumption that the differences of absolute heat in a gas
 are directly proportional to the difference of temperature, Lubbock has built
 up a theory agreeing with observation, all his constants, with the exception
 of one, being determined independently of astronomical observations.               His
 theory also gives a value of the horizontal refraction agreeing closely with
 the best determinations of that quantity.           His atmosphere is a limited one
 of about twenty-two miles.
     About the year      1830    Mr. Lubbock, jointly with Mr. Drinkwater
                                                         '             '
 (Bethune), wrote a tract of thirty-two pages on Probability in the Library
 of Useful Knowledge.          This most excellent little work ranks as the
 earliest, and, its size considered, the best of the modern English introduc
 tions to the subject.     Of late years it has become almost a rule, in citing
 this work, to insist on the authorship.           A binder put Mr. De .Morgan's
 name on the outside      of a large issue ; and though for more than fifteen

 years every   channel  of publicity, from the Times newspaper downwards,
 has been employed to correct the mistake, entire success has not yet been
 obtained.     This work, though perfectly elementary, has that taste of the
 higher methods which those who are familiar with them can infuse into
  common algebra.       Mr. Lubbock showed his familiarity with Laplace,
 before any one in Britain, by two papers in the Cambridge Transactions
  (vol. iii. part 1 ), on the calculation of annuities, aud on comparison of
  tables.    At the time of publication there          was   no  actuary, except Mr.
  Benjamin Gompertz, who could have read them : the state of things is
  now different, and the papers have been reprinted in the Assurance
  Magazine (vol. ix.).     In the same volume is an illustration of the way in
  which the doctrine of probability applies in every subject.             It is a paper
 contributed by Sir J. Lubbock, on the clearing of the London bankers.

                                        XXXVlt
By observation it   was ascertained that the daily difference at the clearing
house,  the money actually wanted to balance the demands of those who
are to receive and    those who are to pay, is only, one day with another,
.£29,000.     To meet daily contingencies, the banks keep in the Bank of
England balances which amount to from 2\ to 3 millions. Sir J. Lubbock
recommends that the clearing balance should be paid out of a common
fund, which would put the banks so far in the position of being one con
cern, and would enable them to employ a large part of the sums they
must now leave idle.        The goodness of the advice is manifest.              This
paper, the last we believe of Sir     J. Lubbock's writings, begins with
                Atque equidom, extremo ni jam sub fine laborum
                Vela traham, et terris festinem advertere proram, &c. itc.,
and   ends  with  a  similar prediction in English.        For some years he had
begun to feel that his end was approaching ; and though it turned out
that his life was to be preserved to his family and his friends for a few
years longer, the prophecy was        but too weli founded as to his scientific
career.
   John Richardson was born on the athof November, 1 787, in Dumfries,
of which town his father, Gabriel Richardson, was an influential and highly
respected inhabitant.      This gentlemau was a Magistrate of the county and
several times Provost of Dumfries.
   A great philosophical poet     has said,
                          " The child is father of the man."
   The sentiment, judging from what is recorded of young Richardson, is
peculiarly appropriate to him.
   The influences by which he was surrounded in infancy were all of a
happy kind, and well adapted to the development of those qualities for
which in his varied and adventurous life he was distinguished.                Some  of
these may be briefly adverted to.
   The rough sports and exercises of schoolboys tending to invigorate the
frame, and in which he was preeminent for activity and enterprise, may
have conduced to that bodily strength and power of endurance which served
him so well in manhood, — so well, indeed, that even beyond the middle
term of life he had been known to say he scarcely knew fatigue.
   Of the higher influences, those affecting the mind, the moral character,
the chief, no doubt, were such as were exercised over him by his nearest
relations : of these, his mother and maternal grandmother, women of
notable worth and ability, may deserve the first mention, they being his
earliest instructors.     The latter lived     at a charming      spot, Rosebank, in
the neighbourhood of the town.          There as a schoolboy he was always glad
to go on a holiday ; and there his love of the beautiful in nature appears
to have been formed.       Early he had been heard to express a hope that
there, where he had so much enjoyment, he might,               if  spared,  be able to
retire and end his days.

    A  great living example of high and fervid intellect cannot but affect
the mind of youth.        Such was Burns to him : Burns was often at Mr.
 Richardson's house, a welcome guest, both whilst he lived in Nithsdale
and later in Dumfries,      till his death in 1796. It happened that his
eldest son,   Rohert,  a boy of great intellectual promise, and young Richard
son, both of the same age, were entered at the grammar school on the
Bame day, and     it is remembered that the Poet on that occasion said play
fully, " I   wonder which of the two will be the greatest man."           It was
          his school-period that young Richardson first read the        ' Faerie
during
 Queene,' and it was of Burns that he borrowed the book.         Half a century
later he was present at the National Festival held in honour of the 'Poet
in Edinburgh in 1859 ; and he then expressed the great pleasure he had
in his recollections of him, particularizing how on one of the Sunday even
ings Burns, when at his father's house, called his attention to some of the
paraphrases in his Bible which he most admired, two of which he re
quested the boy to get by heart and repeat to him : of these, one was for
gotten, the other was      the 66th, beginning     " How  bright these glorious
spirits shine."
    Early he gave proof of a quick and precocious mind.          He could read
well, it is reported, at the age of four.      He was then placed at a prepara
 tory school, and two years later at the grammar school, taught by Mr.
 Gray, better known afterwards as a man of letters in Edinburgh, and one
 of the Masters there of the High School.         This was in 1793. In 1801,
when only fourteen, he was sent to the University of Edinburgh, where
 thus early he began his Medical Studies, which were continued during two
 years, and then, when only sixteen, he received the appointment of House
 Surgeon in the Infirmary of his native town, the duties of which he per
formed for nearly two years. He now returned to Edinburgh, and shortly
 after passed an examination before the College of Surgeons and received
the diploma of Surgeon.         In the following year, having just reached his
eighteenth year, he entered the Royal Navy as Assistant Surgeon.            The
war at that time was raging in all its intensity, and promotion then rapidly
 rewarded merit. In a year he was advanced to a Surgeoncy.        This was after
 he had been employed in a boat night attack, for which he had volunteered,
 on a French brig of war in the Tagus.         During the remainder of the war
 his services were various — in the Baltic in the second expedition against
 Copenhagen, on the western coast of Africa, in the Mediterranean, on the
 western coast of Spain, in the North Sea, and again in the Baltic, on the
 coast of America, on the Canadian Lakes ; and lastly, during the short
war with the United States in 1814, he was present, attached to a marine
battalion, at the taking of Cumberland Island and the town of St. Mary's
in Georgia.
    Shortly after the peace he retired on half-pay, and engaged in private
practice at Leith, where
                             (in 1818) he married the second daughter of W.
 Stiven, Esq., of that town.      The leisure he had there, and the vicinity of

                                          xxxix
Leith     to Edinburgh, enabled him to continue his medical and other allied
studies, of which Botany was especially a favourite. In 1817 he passed
his    examinations and took the degree of M.D. Two years later, when an
expedition was fitted out by Government to explore by land the northern
coast of America, under the command of Lieut. Franklin, R.N., he volun
teered his     services, and received the appointment      of Surgeon and Naturalist
to    the party.
      This  was the beginning   of that  career in which he    so distinguished him
 self   ; and it was also the beginning of that friendship with Sir John Frank
lin, of which,     twenty-nine years afterwards, he gave such a chivalrous proof
 in   taking the command, at his own request, of the overland expedition, at
                                                                                    '
 that time fitted out. by the Government, to         go   in quest of the ' Erebus
 and 'Terror,' the melancholy history of which ships, of their gallant crews,
 and heroical commander can never be forgotten.
      The account of the first Expedition, under the title of "Narrative of a
 Journey to the Polar Sea in the years 1819,1820, 1821, 1822," by Franklin,
 amply shows what an important part Richardson took in it: and the indebt
  edness of its commander to him for the manner in which he performed his
  duties and afforded his Chief assistance is most amply acknowledged. Apart
 from the varied, valuable, and curious information collected relative to
 regions and tribes of people before little known, much of the narrative,
  especially that pathetic portion descriptive of privations and sufferings, and
  that part contributed by Richardson relative to the stern duty of depriving
  a fellow creature of life, who, there was the strongest proof, had forfeited
  it by the murder of an officer of the party, with a further design on the
  lives of others, cannot be read without a feeling of emotion blended with
  admiration for what was endured and done.
      During   the remainder   of his long period of service as a Naval Medical
  Officer, terminating in his retirement in 1855, he never was employed
 afloat.    He had first charge of the Melville Hospital at Chatham, and
 afterwards, when promoted to the rank of Inspector of Naval Hospitals and
  Fleets, that of Haslar Hospital.        His position now was peculiarly favour
 able ; first, in affording facilities for prosecuting his studies — be was always
  a student — especially in natural history ; and secondly, as contributing to
 his comfort, and probably health ; for he was the victim of sea-sickness, a
 malady from which he had increase of suffering with advancing age, lat
 terly even to the endangering of life.      Always remarkable for industry and
 power of application, these qualities were         strikingly displayed whilst in
 medical charge of each of those hospitals.          His special duties were not a
 little onerous, yet by making the most of his time, he was able to contri
 bute largely to the advancement of science in its natural history and geo
 graphical departments, of which his successive publications afford the best
 proof — those publications for which a Royal Medal was awarded him by the
 Council of this Society in 1856, ten years after he had received the honour
of Knighthood conferred on him by the Queen in acknowledgment of his

distinguished service; he had previously, viz., in 18.31, had the honour
conferred on him of Commander of the Bath.                It would be out of place
here to dilate on his professional attainments ; but it should not be passed
over, as showing how he blended science and medicine, that to him chiefly
the Medical Department of the Navy is indebted for the Museum which
is established at Ilaslar, and to which he largely contributed.
    If fortunate in his position, he was not less so in the estimation in which
he was held by the authorities in power.          Ilence, when Sir John Franklin
had to prepare for his second expedition to the shores of the Polar Sea, he
again received the appointment which he had in the first. In consequence
moreover of the great confidence placed in him, he was entrusted with a sepa
rate and important charge, that of exploring the coast between the Mac
kenzie and Copper Mine rivers, and later, with the sole command of the party
sent to the same region in quest of his friend on the occasion of Sir John
Franklin's last and fatal exploring enterprise.        A just appreciation of what
he accomplished in both instances can be formed only by the perusal of the
two works in which these Expeditions are described ; one, "The Narrative
of   a second  Expedition   to the Shores     of the Polar   Sea in the years 1825,
1826,    and  1827;" the other entitled "Arctic Searching Expedition:               A
Journal of a boat's voyage through Rupert's Land and the Arctic Sea in
search of the Discovery Ships under the command of Sir John Franklin,
with an Appendix on the Physical Geography of North America."                   Both
which works, one by Franklin, the other by Richardson, were published
by authority.
   This    second  expedition, under the command of Sir John Franklin,
affords a remarkable contrast to the first, — that so disastrous in its results
as regards human suffering and loss of life, this so successful, at least in
these relations and the amount        of information obtained, — mainly owing to
the better arrangements made for the provisioning and conveyance of the
party, forewarned by the experience gained in the first ; during the whole
time not a life was lost, nor was there any amount of privation experienced
even temporarily endangering health*.
    In his last expedition in quest of his friend, in which greater difficulties
and dangers were encountered than in the preceding, the same good
fortune as to the preservation of health and life was experienced.               The
engaging iu this undertaking by Richardson was, indeed, as before said, a
chivalrous act and the strongest proof that could be given of devoted
friendship.     It should be remembered that he was then entering his sixty-
first year, that he separated himself from a happy home and from children
he tenderly loved, and this, let it not be forgotten, with the entire sanction of
his wife, she fully entering into and appreciating his noble sense of duty.
That the Government should have accepted his offered services was what
might be expected ; for whom could they have selected for zeal and knowledge
   * After Franklin had left his
                                  party, on his return he was informed of the death of
one man belonging to it from            and of another from pulmonary consumption.
                              accident,

                                            xli
better qualified for the   search   ?   —resting   on the belief
                                                           they had come to,
that Franklin, according to his instructions, would, as was afterwards proved
(proved by the relics discovered, and as Richardson was confident),
attempt the North-west Passage by Lancaster Sound — that passage which,
after Franklin, was more happily accomplished first by Sir Robert M'Clure,
and then by Sir Leopold M'Clintock — this the crowning reward of the vast
efforts which for a series of years and at an enormous cost had been so
heroically made, to the enduring credit of our country, for determining the
great geographical problem of the Northwest Passage.
     The account of this search, as published in two volumes in 1851,        is, in
 accordance with its title of Journal, minute in details, and, from its minute
ness, very instructive and deserving of study, abounding, as          it does, in
 varied information in relation to the geology of the country passed through,
 its natural productions and inhabitants — model, in brief, of the journal of
                                                   a
a   scientific traveller well trained by laborious experience, and of which the
 value must increase as the regions       treats of, especially the Lake Districts
                                           it
 of Canada and the territory of the old Hudson's Bay Company, become, as
 they deserve, more resorted to         and colonized.
     On his return from this expedition he resumed his duties at Haslar Hos
 pital, where he continued until he tendered his resignation in 1855. He
 then retired with his family to the Lake District of Westmoreland, where,
 at Lancrigg, in Easedale, in the neighbourhood of Grasmere, — spot sura
 passing even in beauty the longed for retreat, Rosebank, the aspiration of
 his boyish days, — he passed the remaining years of his life, which, when
 he was apparently in perfect health, was suddenly terminated, by what was
  inferred to have been apoplexy, on the 6th of June, 1865, in his 77th year.
  He was buried in Grasmere churchyard, the burying-place of the greatest
  of the Lake Poets, Wordsworth.
      This period of his retirement, the complement of his distinguished career,
   was one of almost unchequered enjoyment, and would have been com
   pletely so, but for the loss of one of his children, his eldest daugh
   ter.   Active as ever with unimpaired faculties, whilst he recreated himself
   with gardening, he devoted much of his time to his favourite pursuits,
   natural history, and latterly philology, for which he had always         apre
   dilection.    Here  he   edited Yarrell's 'British Fishes,' the  last edition,
    which he enriched with many additions    and here he wrote his history of
                                                   ;
    Arctic and Antarctic research, bearing the title of "The Polar Regions,"
  a   work especially remarkable for erudition, candour, and mastery of the
    subject, and for undertaking which he was so eminently prepared             and
    qualified by the experience he had gained in his three exploring               ex
    peditions.  Though so occupied, he seemed always to have leisure            and
    time at command  ;he was always ready to give his professional aid to       any
    of the poor people in the neighbourhood wanting medical advice and      ;
    having been appointed  magistrate of the county, he performed the re
                           a
    quired duties in his habitual conscientious and zealous manner.

     If    one quality       more than another predominated iu the well-balanced
  faculties of     this   excellent man, it was his modesty with freedom from pre
  tension.       This is strikingly displayed in words of his own, written down,
  but never spoken, on the occasion of his receiring the Royal Medal
  awarded him, as already mentioned, in 1856. We give them with the
  hope that they may serve as an incitement to others, who think humblj
  of  themselves,       to follow his example.
     " More       than the usual period allotted to one generation has long passed
  away     since,   through the circumstance of my being appointed Surgeon to
  a small body of Arctic explorers,             I had to travel over a country reaching
  from the great American lakes to the islands of the Arctic Sea, and embra
  cing more than the fourth of the distance from the equator to the pole,
  which had never before been visited by a professed naturalist.                I perceived at
 once the magnitude of the field, and comprehended at a glance that it was
 far beyond my grasp.               The only previous training         I had was the little
 natural science that           I had learnt at my northern Alma Mater as a colla
 teral branch of my medical education, but I thought that                    I could at least
 record what         I saw ; and    I  determined so to do as intelligently as         I  could
 and without exaggeration, hoping in this way to furnish facts on which the
 leaders of science might reason, and thus promote the progress of Natural
 History      to the extent of my limited ability.            This was the rule    I followed
 during      the  eight years     that  I passed   in  those  countries  actually engaged in
 the several expeditions."              His concluding words, too, we are tempted to
 give,    distinctive     as  they are  of a quality of his illustrious friend, Sir John
 Franklin, which, with other gracious ones, gained him the regard of all
 who had the happiness of serving under him.
     " cannot forbear adding one word to my thanks for the very high
        I
 honour which          I have appeared before you to receive — it is an expression
 of mournful regret that your late member, my old and dear friend and
 commanding officer in the Expeditions of Discovery, does not survive to wit
 ness this day.          He would have rejoiced with unmixed satisfaction at your
 appreciation of my labours.              From him I received every assistance iu col
lecting specimens           that  was in  his power to give ; his sympathy encouraged
me, and his claims which, as commanding                     officer, he might    have to the
reputation of whatever            was done by one      of his subordinates,   he honourably
and cheerfully ceded to him who did the work, in my case as in others. So
that contributions were made to science, no personal interests were allowed
to interfere."
    Besides the works already mentioned, he was the author of the * Fauna
Boreali-Americana,'             of Zoological Appendices to the Voyages of Parry,
Ross, and Back,            of Zoological Reports and Contributions to the British
Association for the Advancement of Science, of which Association he was
an old member and n regular                 attendant at its meetings,      and the article
"Ichthyology" in the last edition of the Encyclopaedia Britannica.
    He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1 825 ; he received                    the

                                         xliii
honorary degree of Doctor of Civil Law from the University of Dublin at
the time of the Meeting of the British Association in that city in 1857;
he was an honorary Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh, and                 he
belonged to many foreign Societies, European and American.
      He was three times married, first, as already related, to .the daughter of
Wm. Stiven, Esq.,         who died in 1831 ; secondly, to the only daughter of
John       Booth, Esq,, the niece of Sir John Franklin; she died in 1845,
leaving him five children, of whom three are surviving, a daughter, mnrried
 since his decease to Charles Reynolds, Esq., and two sons, one, the eldest,
 a Captain in the Royal Artillery, the other a Lieutenant in the Royal En
 gineers ; thirdly, to the youngest daughter of Archibald Fletcher, Esq.,
 Advocate, of Edinburgh, in 1847, his surviving widow, to whom the place
 of his retirement belonged, and where she still resides.
       The life of Admiral William Henry Smyth comprises such            a field of
  arduous labour and successful result, that we must confine ourselves to the
 merest synopsis. Forty years a member of our Society (from June 15,
  1826), and all that time engaged in works which brought high reputation,
  his connexion with the Society was confined for the most part to personal
  exertion on the Council.       The benefits which he conferred on the naval
  service, on astronomy, on geography, and on arcbasology, must be recorded
  in detail in more appropriate places than this record.
       He -was born January 21, 1788. His father was an American loyalist,
   and a descendant of Captain John Smith, the colonizer of Virginia.           He
  entered the Navy in 1805, and was actively engaged until 1815 in the
   Indian    seas, and on the coasts of Spain and Italy. Here he had his full
   share of adventure and of danger ; and it was during this first period that
   his love of surveying developed itself, and attracted the notice of the
   Admiralty.       From 1817 to 1824 he was engaged in that great survey of
   the Mediterranean     — the greatest scientific survey ever planned and com
   pleted by one individual — which is now recorded in two hundred charts,
   and is the admiration of the naval world.        By this unexampled result of
   intelligence and industry he won high reputation and the approbation of
   the Government, shown by grant of permission to accept a foreign order.
    This was the only public acknowledgement which he ever received, so far
    as we can learn.
        His naval career ended in 1824 ; but for many years he was employed
    in the completion of his charts. In 1828 he settled at Bedford, and from
    thence until 1842, either at Bedford or Cardiff, he varied his pursuits by
    close attention to the astronomy of double stars and other extra-meridional
    pursuits.    His well-known "Cycle" has done much to quicken a taste for
    astronomy among naval men.
        The last years of his life were passed near Aylesbury. His friend the
     late Dr. Lee had purchased his instruments, and had attached a small ob
     servatory to Hartwell House.       Admiral Smyth's     residence, St. John's

                                         xliv
 Lodge, was within a short walk of this observatory ; and to the end of his
 life (September 9, 1865) he was engaged in occasional observation.             His
 long list of scientific titles might be supported by as long  a list of published
 works, independently of scientific memoirs.       His books on Sicily and Sar
 dinia, his life of Captain Beaver, his accounts of his own cabinet of Roman
coins and of that of the Duke of Northumberland, his works on the anti
 quities of Hartwell, his account of the Mediterranean, and others, are read
with pleasure and profit.        But perhaps the most remarkable, as the most
professional and the most characteristic, is the long series of articles which
lie contributed to the United Service Journal.      In this series, running OTer
more than twenty years, he has discussed almost every possible nautical
subject.    He was eminently a collector ; and a Nautical Dictionary, of a
very wide character, is now in the press under the care of a lady who was
for fifty years his scientific colleague as well as his devoted wife.
    An extended account contained in the last annual report of the Roval
Astronomical Society will render further detail unnecessary.           "We give a
few words to the personal qualities of our subject.        Admiral Smyth was
one of those men who are the cement of all the associations to which they
belong.     His genial manners, and the full reliance which all placed on his
good faith, his kindness, and his activity, did much to promote unity and,
when such a thing arose, to prevent misunderstanding from becoming
serious disagreement. The compound of the jolly seaman — no other word
will do — the educated scholar, and the kind-hearted gentleman, which ap
peared in Admiral Smyth is far beyond any character-painting but that of
the dramatist or the novelist.        A man is known by his associates ; and
when persons of the most different dispositions and temperaments are united
through life in pursuit of good objects, there must be a something which
keeps   them together; and that something must contain benevolence of
feeling in large measure.       If the world were searched, it would hardly be
possible to produce four specimens of mankind so very different as Francis
Baily, Richard Sheepshanks, John Lee, and William Henry Smyth, and it
would be as difficult to produce four men who lived in more cordial inti
macy and friendship broken only by death.
    Johann Franz Encke, For. Memb. R.S.,           was born on the   23rd of  Sep
tember, 1791, at Hamburg,         where  his father was pastor of St. James's
Church.      After  passing through the Gymnasium of Hamburg, he entered
the University of Gottingen in the autumn of 1811.           Here he remained
pursuing his    studies  under the direction of Gauss till the spring of 1S13,
when his patriotism impelled him to take part in the war.           He served in
Hamburg till the place fell, and afterwards in Mecklenburg, as Sergeant-
Major in the Horse Artillery of the Hanseatic Legion, in which he remained
till June 1814. He then resumed his studies in Gottingen, but was again
called away by the events of 1815. He now entered the Prussian service,
holding a commision as Second Lieutenant in the Artillery, and during the

                                        xlv
greater part of the time he remained in it was stationed in the fortress of
Thorn.      He quitted the Prussian service in March 18 16, and in the follow
ing July became assistant to von Lindenau in the Observatory of Seeberg.
     He was appointed Vice-Director of the Observatory in 1820, and Director
on the retirement of von Lindenau in July 1822.             His works on the
transits of Venus of 17G1 and 176!' were published in 1822 and 1824
respectively.    A   supplement to the latter, rendered necessary by the dis
covery made by von      Littrow, that Hell had tampered with the original ob
servations made by himself at Wardhus, appeared in the Transactions of
the Berlin Academy for 1835.          In 1819 he published his identification of
the comets observed by Mechain and Messier on the 1 7th of January, 1 786,
by Miss Herschel on the 1 7th November, 1 795, by Pons on the 20th of
 October, 1805, and again by Pons on the 26th of November, 1818. This
 comet, to which Encke's name has been given, having a periodic time of
about 1207 days, was observed on the 3rd of June, 1822, at Paramatta by
Riimker.      The discussion of all the observations led Encke to the conclu
sion that the only way of reconciling them was by the supposition of a
resisting medium by which the times of its revolutions are successively
 lessened.    One of the Royal Medals of the Society for the year 1 828 was
 awarded to him for this investigation.        He had already (in 1825) been
 elected a Foreign Member.
     In 1825 he was called to Berlin as Professor of Astronomy in the Uni
 versity and Director of the Observatory. In his hands the Berlin Ephemeris
 received many improvements, of which he gave an account in the Trans
 actions of the Berlin Academy for 1827. He superintended the publication
 of this work from the volume for 1830 to that for 1852, when he was
 assisted by Professor Wolfers till the publication of the volume for 1863,
 after which the latter became sole editor.     The volumes contain numerous
  supplements by Encke on the perturbations of planets, the method of least
  squares, mechanical quadratures, the solution of numerical equations, the
  form and dimensions of the earth, and many papers on the correction of
  the errors of astronomical instruments.
     The Observatory, a tower dating from 1711, being unsuitable for the
  reception of fixed instruments, and in a bad situation, at von Humboldt's
  suggestion a new Observatory was erected on a plan approved of by Encke ;
  and on the 11th of October, 1835, he observed the position of Halley's
  comet with the large equatoreal mounted in its place in the new Observatory.
  The observations   made here were published in four quarto volumes between
  the years 1840 and 1857.       He is the author of upwards of one hundred
  separate works and memoirs dating from 1812 to 1860.           The latter are
  contained chiefly in the ' ZeitschrhV of von Lindenau and Bohnenberger,
  von Zach's ' Correspondance Astronomique,' Bode's and Encke's ' Jahr-
  biicher,' the ' Astronomische Nachrichten,'
                                                                               '
                                                  and the ' Sitzungsberichte
  and  '                '
         Abhandlungen     of the Berlin Academy.
     In  1859 he suffered from an apoplectic attack, brought on, it is supposed,

                                        xlvi
by    excessive   mental exertion.     He obtained leave of absence from the
 Observatory in the spring of 1863, and resigned his post as Director early
in 18G-1.     lie passed the remainder of his life in the midst of his family
at Spandau.       His judgment and memory remained unimpaired             till witl .:
a few weeks     of his end. He died on the 26th of August, 1865.
   Adolf Theodor          von Kupffer, For.     Memb.   R.S., was born at Mi tan.
in Courland, where his father was a       merchant, on the 6th of January (Old
Style), 1/99.      At the age of sixteen he entered the University    of Dorpatas
a medical student, but remained there only a few months.                In  1816   he
entered the    University of Berlin,  also as a medical student, but the study
of medicine becoming distasteful to him, he applied himself to the ma
thematical and physical sciences, and to mineralogy, under the direction
of Weiss.     In 1819 he went to the University of Gottingen, and in 1 S20 to
Paris, where he attended Haiiy's lectures on Mineralogy.            He established
himself in St. Petersburg, where he lectured on mineralogy in the winter of
1821-1822.        In the spring of  1822 he was appointed Professor of Physics,
Chemistry     and   Mineralogy   in the University of Kasan, and at the same
time commissioned to visit Paris for the purpose of procuring a collection
of physical instruments.       While there he competed successfully for a prize
proposed by the Academy of Berlin for an essay on the measurement of the
angles of crystals.     In concert with Arngo he planned a series of observa
tions on the daily variation of the magnetic declination, and the disturb
ances of the declination, at Kasan.         He entered upon the duties of his
Professorship in June 1823, devoting the time not occupied in teaching to
crystallography and magnetism.         In April 1828 he was sent on a scientific
mission to the Ural, the results of which were published in 1834. They
consist mainly of geological observations, the discovery of new localities of
some scarce minerals, and of many determinations of the temperature of the
soil, made conjointly with Adolf Erman.
   Having    been elected a member     of  the Imperial Academy of Sciences, he
went to reside in St. Petersburg in August 1828. Early in 1829 he suggested
to the Academy the erection of a small magnetic observatory.           The project
was warmly supported by von Humboldt, who happened to be in St. Pe
tersburg on his way to the Ural and Altai.           It was approved of by the
Academy, and the building commenced before the end of the year.              In the
summer of       1829   he was placed at the head    of a scientific party engaged
in exploring     a part  of the Caucasus near Mount Elbrus, into which no
European had ever       penetrated before, and where, for the protection of the
travellers against the native tribes, they were accompanied by a strong
escort of troops under the command of General Immanuel, the General in
command of the Caucasus, who had planned the expedition.
   At this period he lectured at the School of Civil Engineering, the Pada-
gogische Institut, and the Academy for Naval Officers, and was engaged
in writing his ' Hnndbuch der rechncnden Krystallometrie,' which appeared

                                               xlvii
in     1 831.      In 1835, Count Cancrien, the Minister of Finance, at Kupffer's
suggestion, consented to the estahlishment of small magnetic observatories
at     Catherinenburg,       Barnaul,     Nertschinsk,   Sitka, and Helsingfors, subse
quently at Tiflis and Moscow, and lastly at Pekin. The                   observations for
the years 1835-1846 were published in the ' Annuaire                       magnetique et
 meteorologique         du corps   des  Ingenieurs   des  mines  de  Russie.'    All these
 observatories were placed in 1843 under the direction of a central institu
 tion, the Physical        Observatory of St. Petersburg, where the various obser
 vations       were reduced and edited, and magnetical and meteorological instru
 ments were kept for the          use  of members of scientific expeditions.      Kupffer
 was       placed   at the head     of this establishment, and      ceased  to lecture, in
 order that he might          devote all his energies    to the duties of his new office.
  The      collected observations for the years 1847-1858 have been published in
  the ' Annales de l'Observatoire physique central de Russie.' During the
  latter years of his life he was actively engaged in establishing telegraphic
  communication with foreign observatories, for the purpose of giving storm-
   signals at stations on the coasts of the Russian empire.
        In 1841 he edited an account of the labours of a Commission, of which
   he was a member, appointed to fix the standards of measure and weight of
   the Russian empire. Besides comparing the standards of Russia with those
   of many other countries, the commissioners redetermined the weight of a
   given volume of water, one of the most important constants of nature, with
    a precision, in all probability, hitherto unequalled.
        The first volume of his researches on the elasticity of metals (Etude
    experimental      de la flexion et des oscillations transversales des lames elas-
    tiques) was published in 1860. The second volume, containing experi
    ments on metals produced in the Russian furnaces, and the third, on the
    elasticity of torsion and rotatory oscillation, are, it is believed, still un
    published.      He  was elected     a  Foreign   Member of the Royal Society in
     1846.
         A chill, caused by exposure to cold while superintending the erection of
     a   self-recording anemometer on the roof of the Physical Observatory,
     brought on an attack of typhoid fever, of which he died on the 4th of June
     1865.
