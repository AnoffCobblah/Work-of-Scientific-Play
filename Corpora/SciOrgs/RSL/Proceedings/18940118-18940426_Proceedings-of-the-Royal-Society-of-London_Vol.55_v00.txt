  L   " On Homogeneous Division of Space." By LORD KELVIN,
                  P.R.S. Received January 17, 1894.
    § 1. The homogeneous division of any volume of space means the
                                                              I
dividing of it into equal and similar parts, or cells, as shall call them,
all same ways oriented. If we take any point in the interior of one cell
or on its boundary, and corresponding points of all the other cells,
these points form a homogeneous assemblage of single points, accord
ing to Bravais' admirable and important definition.*                The general
problem of the homogeneous partition of space may be stated thus : —
Given a homogeneous assemblage of single points, it is required to
find every possible form of cell enclosing each of them subject to the
condition that it is of the same shape and sameways oriented for all.
An interesting application of this problem is to find for a crystal
(that is to say, a homogeneous assomblage of groups of chemical
atoms) a homogeneous arrangement of partitional interfaces such
that each cell contains all the atoms of one molecule. Unless we

    VOL. LV.                                                             B

 knew the exact geometrical configuration of the constituent parts of
 the group of atoms in the crystal, or crystalline molecule as we shall
 call   it,
          we could not describe the partitional interfaces between one
 molecule and its neighbour.
    Knowing as we do know for many crystals the exact geometrical
 character of the Bravais assemblage of corresponding points of its
 molecules, we could not be sure that any solution of the partitional
 problem we might choose to take would give a cell containing only
 the constituent parts of one molecule. For instance, in the case of
 quartz, of which the crystalline molecule        is probably 3(Si02), a
 form of cell chosen at random might be such that           would enclose
                                                            it
 the silicon of one molecule with only some part of the oxygen belong
 ing to       it,
              and some of the oxygen belonging to a neighbouring
 molecule, leaving out some of its own oxygen, which would be
 enclosed in the cell of either that neighbour or of another neighbour
 or other neighbours.
    §   2.This will be better understood if we consider another illustra
 tion — homogeneous assemblage of equal and similar trees planted
         a
 close together in any regular geometrical order on a plane field either
 inclined or horizontal, so close together that roots of different trees
 interpenetrate in the ground, and branches and leaves in the air.
 To be perfectly homogeneous, every root, every twig, and every leaf
of any one tree must have equal and similar counterparts in every
other tree. So far everything is natural, except, of course, the abso
 lute homogeneousness that our problem assumes but now, to make
                                                       ;
 a homogeneous assemblage of molecules in space, we must suppose
 plane above plane each homogeneously planted with trees at equal
 successive intervals of height.   The interval between two planes may
 be so large as to allow a clear space above the highest plane of leaves
 of one plantation and below the lowest plane of the ends of roots in
 the plantation above.    "We shall not, however, limit ourselves to this
 case, and we shall suppose generally that leaves of one plantation
 intermingle with roots of the plantation above, always, however, sub
ject to the condition of perfect homogeneousness.          Here, then, we
 have truly wonderful problem of geometry — to enclose ideally each
        a
 tree within a closed surface containing every twig, leaf, and rootlet
 belonging to it, and nothing belonging to any other tree, and to
 shape this surface so that it  will coincide all round with portions of
 similar surfaces around neighbouring trees. Wonderful as        it is, this
is  a perfectly easy problem if  the  trees  are given, and if they fulfil
 the condition of being perfectly homogeneous.
    In fact we may begin with the actual bounding surface of leaves,
bark, and roots of each tree. Wherever there            a contact, whether
                                                       is
with leaves, bark, or roots of neighbouring trees, the areas of contact
form part of the required cell-surface. To complete the cell-surface we

 1894.]             On Homogeneous Division       of Space.                     3
 have only to swell out* from the untouched portions of surface of
each tree homogeneously until the swelling portions of surface meet
 in the interstitial air spaces (for simplicity we are supposing the
earth removed, and roots, as well as leaves and twigs, to be perfectly
rigid). The wonderful cell-snrface which we thus find is essentially
a case of the tetrakaidekahedronal cell, which           I  shall now describe
for any possible homogeneous assemblage of points or molecules.
    § 3. We shall find that the form of cell essentially consists of
 fourteen walls, plane or not plane, generally not plane, of which
 eight are hexagonal and six quadrilateral ; and with thirty-six edges,
 generally curves, of meeting between the walls ; and twenty-four
corners where three walls meet.        A cell answering this description
must of course be called a tetrakaidekahedron, unless we prefer to
 call it a fourteen-walled cell. Each wall is an interface between one
 cell and one of fourteen neighbours. Each of the thirty-six edges is a
 line common to three neighbours. Each of the twenty-four corners is a
 point common to four neighbours.          The old-known parallelepipedal
partitioning is merely a very special case in which there are four neigh
 bours along every edge, and eight neighbours having a point in common
at every corner. We shall see how to pass (§ 4) continuously from or to
this singular case, to or from a tetrakaidekahedron differing infini-
teaimally from it ; and, still continuously, to or from any or every
possible tetrakaidekahedronal partitioning.
    § 4. To change from a parallelepipedal to a tetrakaidekahedronal
cell, for one and the same homogeneous distribution of points, proceed
 thus : — Choose any one of the four body-diagonals of a parallelepiped
 and divide the parallelepiped into six tetrahedrons by three planes each
 through this diagonal, and one of the three pairs of parallel edges
which intersect it in its two ends. Give now any purely translational
motion to each of these six tetrahedrons. We have now the                    4x6
corners of these tetrahedrons at twenty-four distinct points. These are
the corners of a tetrakaidekahedron, such as that described generally
in § 3. The two sets of six corners, which before the movement coin
cided in the two ends of the chosen diagonal, are now the corners of
one pair of the hexagonal faces of the tetrakaidekahedron.               When we
look at the other twelve corners we see them as corners of other six hexa
gons, and of six parallelograms, grouped together as described in § 15
below.     The movements of the six tetrahedrons may be such that the
groups of six corners and of four corners are in fourteen planes as we
shall see in § 14 ; but, if they are made at random, none of the groups
will be in a single plane. The fourteen faces, plane or not plane, of
the tetrakaidekahedron are obtained by drawing arbitrarily any set
of surfaces to constitute four of the hexagons and three of the quadri
laterals, with arbitrary curves for the edges between hexagon and

     hexagon and between hexagons and quadrilaterals, and then by draw
     ing parallel equal and similar counterparts to these surfaces in the
     remaining four hexagonal and three quadrilateral spaces in the
     manner more particularly explained in § 6 below. It is clear, or at
     all events   I shall endeavour to make it clear by fuller explanations
     and illustrations below, that the figure thus constituted fulfils our
     definition (§1) of the most general form of cell fitted to the particular
     homogeneous     assemblage    of points corresponding to the parallele
     piped with which we have commenced.              This will be more easily
     understood in general, if we first consider the particular case of
    parallelepipedal partitioning, and of the deviations which, without
     altering its corners, we may arbitrarily make from a plane-faced
     parallelepiped, or which we may be compelled by the particular
     figure of the molecule to make.
        § 5. Consider, for example, one of the trees of § 2, or if you please
     a solid of less complex shape, which for brevity we shall call S, being
     one of a homogeneous assemblage.          Let P be a point in unoccupied
     space (air, we shall call it for brevity), which, for simplicity we may
     suppose to be somewhere in the immediate neighbourhood of S,
     although it might really be anywhere far off among distant solids of
     the assemblage.      Let PA, PB, PC be lines parallel to any three

  PC, AE, FQ, BD. These twelve lines are all in air, and they are the
  edges of our cnrved-faced parallelepiped.      To describe its faces take
  points infinitely near to one another along the line PC (straight or
  curved as may be) : and take the corresponding points in BD. Join
  these pairs of corresponding points by lines in air infinitely near to
  one another in succession.      These lines give us the face PBDC.
  Corresponding points in AE, FQ, and corresponding lines between
  them give us the parallel face AFQE.        Similarly we find the other
 two pairs of the parallel faces of the parallelepiped.       If the solids
 touch one another anywhere, either at points or throughout finite
 areas, we are to reckon the interface    between them as air in respect
 to our present rules.
    § 6. We have thus found the most general possible parallelepipedal
 partitioning for any given homogeneous assemblage of solids. Pre
 cisely similar rules give the corresponding result for any possible
 partitioning if we first choose the twenty-four corners of the tetra-
 kaidekahedron by finding six tetrahedrons and giving them arbitrary
 translatory motions according to the rule of § 4. To make this clear
 it is only now necessary to remark that the four corners of each
 tetrahedron are essentially corresponding points, and that if one of
them is in air all of them are in air, whatever translatory motion we
give to the tetrahedron.
    § 7. The transition from the parallelepiped to the tetrakaideka-
hedron described in § 4 will be now readily understood, if we pause to
consider the vastly simpler two-dimensional case of transition from a
parallelogram to a hexagon. This is illustrated in figs. 1 and 2 ; with
heavy lines in each case for the sides of the hexagon, and light lines
for the six of its diagonals which are sides of constructional triangles.
The four diagrams show different relative positions in one plane of
two equal homochirally      similar triangles   ABC, ATB'C; oppositely

hut in inverted directions).     The hexagon AC'BA'CB', obtained by
joining  A  with B' and C,   B with  C and A', and C with A' and B', is
clearly in each case a proper cell-figure for dividing plane space
homogeneously according to the Bravais distribution of points defined
by either triangle, or by putting the triangles together in any one of
the three proper ways to make a parallelogram of them. The corre
sponding operation for three-dimensional space is described in § 4 :
and the proof which is obvious in two-dimensional space is clearly
valid for space of three dimensions, and therefore the many words
which would be required to give it formal demonstration are super
fluous.
   § 8. The principle according to which we take arbitrary curved
surfaces with arbitrary curved edges of intersection, for seven of the
faces of our partitional tetrakaidekahedron,       and the other seven
correspondingly parallel to them, is illustrated in figs. 3, 4, 5, and 6,
where the corresponding thing is done for a partitional hexagon
 suited to the homogeneous division of a plane. In these diagrams
 the hexagon is for simplicity taken equilateral and equiangular.      In
drawing fig. 3, three pieces of paper were cut, to the shapes kl, tnn,
uv.    The piece hi was first placed in the position shown relatively to
AC, and a portion of the area of one cell to be given to a neighlxmr
across the frontier C'A on one side was marked off.         It was then
placed in the position shown relatively to A'C and the equivalent,
portion to be taken from a neighbour on the other side was marked.
 Corresponding give-and-take delimitations were marked on the fron
tiers C'B and B'C, according to the form mm; and on the frontiers    BA',
 AB', according to the form uv. Fig. 4 was drawn on the same plan

the primitive hexagon is, as shown clearly in fig. 5, divided into iso
 lated parts. But if we are dealing with homogeneous division of
solid space, the separating channels shown in fig. 5 might be sections,
 by the plane of the drawing, of perforations through the matter of
one cell produced by the penetration of matter, rootlets for example,
from neighbouring cells.
    § 9. Corresponding to the three ways by which two triangles can
be put together to make a parallelogram, there are seven, and
only seven, ways in which the six tetrahedrons of § 4 can be put
together to make a parallelepiped, in positions parallel to those
which they had in the original parallelepiped.       To see this, remark
first that among the thirty-six edges of the six tetrahedrons seven
different lengths are found which are respectively equal to the three
lengths of edges (three quartets of equal parallels) ; the three

 lengths of face-diagonals having ends in P or Q (three pairs of equal
 parallels) ; and the length of the chosen hody-diagonal PQ.           (Any
 one of these seven is, of course, determinable from the other six if
 given.)
    In the diagram, fig. 7, full lines show the edges of the primitive
 parallelepiped, and dotted lines show the hody-diagonal PQ and two
pairs of the face- diagonals, the other pair of face-diagonals (PF, QC),
not being marked on the diagram to avoid confusion.           Thus, the dia
gram shows, in the parallelograms QDPA and         QEPB,    two of the three
catting planes by which it is divided into six tetrahedrons, and it
so shows also two of the six tetrahedrons, QPDB and QPEA.                The
lengths QP, QD, QE, QF are found         in  the edges of every  one  of  the
six tetrahedrons, the two other edges of each being of two of the three
'engths QA, QB, QC. The six tetrahedrons may be taken in order of

three pairs having edges of lengths respectively equal to QB and QC,
QC and QA, QA and QB. It is the third of these pairs that is shown
in fig. 7. Remark now that the sum of the six angles of the six tetra
hedrons at the edge equal to any one of the lengths QP, QD, QE,
QF is four right angles. Remark also that the sum of the four
angles at the edge of length QA in the two pairs of tetrahedrons in
which the length QA is found is four right angles, and the same
with reference to QB and QC. Remark lastly that the two tetra
hedrons of each pair are equal and dichirally* similar, or enantio-
morphs as such figures have been called by German writers.
   § 10. Now, suppose any one pair of the tetrahedrons to be taken
away from their positions in the primitive parallelepiped, and, by
purely translational motion, to be brought into position with their
edges of length QD coincident, and the same to be done for each of
the other two pairs.          The sum of the six angles at the coincident
edges being two right angles, the plane faces at the common edge
will fit together, and the condition of parallelism in the motion of
each pair fixes the order in which the three pairs come together in
the new position, and shows us that in this position the three pairs
 form a parallelepiped essentially different from the primitive paral
lelepiped, provided that, for simplicity in our present considerations,
we suppose each tetrahedron to be wholly scalene, that is to say, the
seven lengths found amongst the edges to be all unequal.                      Next
shift the tetrahedrons to bring the edges QE into coincidence, and
next again to bring the edges QF into coincidence.                 Thus, including
the primitive parallelepiped, we can make four different, parallele
pipeds in each of which six of the tetrahedrons have a common edge.
    § 11. Now take the two pairs of tetrahedrons having edges of
length equal to QA, and put them together with these edges coinci
dent.    Thus we have a scalene octahedron. The remaining pair of
   • A pair of  gloves are dichirally similar, or enantiomorphs.   Equal and similar
right-handed   gloves are chirally similar.

tetrahedrons placed on a pair of its parallel faces complete a paral
lelepiped.     Similarly two other parallelepipeds may be made by
putting together the pairs that have edges of lengths equal to QB
and QC respectively with those edges coincident, and finishing in
each case with the remaining pair of tetrahedrons.        The three paral
lelepipeds thus found are essentially different from one another, and
from the four of § 10 ; and thus we have the seven parallelepipeds
fulfilling the statement of § 9. Each of the seven parallelepipeds
corresponds to one and the same homogeneous distribution of points.
    § 12. Going back to § 4, we see that, by the rule there given, we
find four different ways of passing to the tetrakaidekahedron from
any one chosen parallelepiped of a homogeneous assemblage.            The
four different cellular systems thus found involve four different sets
of seven pairs of neighbours for each point.       In each of these there
are four pairs of neighbours in rows parallel to the three quartets of
edges of the parallelepiped and to the chosen body-diagonal;          and
 the other three pairs of neighbours are in three rows parallel to
 the face-diagonals which meet in the chosen body-diagonal.           The
second (§ 11) of the two modes of putting together tetrahedrons to
form a parallelepiped which we have been considering suggests a
second mode of dividing our primitive parallelepiped, in which we
should first truncate two opposite corners and then divide the octa
 hedron which is left, by two planes through one or other of its three
diagonals.      The six tetrahedrons obtained by any one of the twelve
 ways   of effecting this second mode of division give, by their twenty-
¦four corners, the twenty-four corners of a space-filling tetrakaideka-
 hedronal cell, by which our fundamental problem is solved. But every
solution thus obtainable is clearly obtainable by the simpler rule of
 § 4, commencing with some one of the infinite number of primitive
 parallelepipeds which we may take as representative of any homo
geneous distribution of points.
    § 13. The communication is illustrated by a model showing the six
 tetrahedrons derived by the rule 4 from a symmetrical kind of primi
 tive parallelepiped, being a rhombohedron of which the axial-diagonal
 is equal in length to each of the edges. The homogeneous distribution
 of points corresponding to this form of parallelepiped is the well-
 known one in which every point is surrounded by eight others at the
 corners of a cube of which it is the centre ; or, if we like to look at it
 so, two simple cubical distributions of single points, each point of one
 distribution being at the centre of a cube of points of the other. [To
 understand the tactics of the siDgle homogeneous assemblage consti
 tuted by these two cubic assemblages, let P be a point of one of the
 cnbic assemblages, and Q any one of its four nearest neighbours of the
 other assemblage.      Q is at the centre of a cube of which P is at one
 corner. Let PD, PE, PF be three conterminous edges of this cube so

that A, B, C are points of the first assemblage nearest to P. Again Q
is a corner of a cube of which P is the centre ; and if QA, QB, QC are
three conterminous edges of this cube, D, E, F are points of the second
assemblage   nearest to Q. The rhombohedron of which PQ is body-
diagonal and PA, PB, PC the edges conterminous in P, and QD, QE,
QF the edges conterminous in Q, is our present rhombohedron. The
diagram of § 9 (fig. 7), imagined to be altered to proper proportions
for the present case, may be looked to for illustration. Its three face-
diagonals through P, being PD, PE, PF, are perpendicular to one
another.    So also are QA, QB, QC, its three face-diagonals through
Q.    The body-diagonal of the cube PQ, being half the body-diagonal
of the cube whose edges are PD, PE, PF, is equal to PD x v/f :
and PA, PB, PC are also each of them eqnal to this, because A, B, C
are centres of other equal cubes, having P for a common corner. —

   § 14. The tetrahedrons used in the model are those into which the
parallelepiped is cut by three planes through the axial diagonal,
which in this case cut one another at angles of 60". We wish to be
able to shift the tetrahedrons into positions corresponding to those of
the triangles in fig. 1, which we could not do if they were cut out of
the solid. I, therefore, make a mere skeleton of each tetrahedon,
consisting of a piece of wire bent at two points, one-third of its
length from its ends, at angles of 70£°, being sin-1 %</3, in planes
inclined at 60° to one another. The six skeletons thus made are equal
and similar, three homochirals and the other three also homochirals,
their enantiomorphs. In their places in the primitive parallelepiped
they have their middle lines coincident in its axial diagonal PQ, and
their other 6x2 arms coincident in three pairs in its six edges
through P and Q. Looking at fig. 7 we see, for example, three of the
edges CP, PQ, QE, of one of the tetrahedrons thus constituted ; and
DQ, QP, PB, three edges of its enantiomorph. In the model they are
put together with their middle lines at equal distances around the
axial diagonal and their arms symmetrically arranged round it.
Wherever two lines cross they are tied, not very tightly, together
by thin cord many times round, and thus we can slip them along
so as to bring the six middle lines either very close together, nearly
as they would be in the primitive parallelepiped, or farther and
farther out from one another so as to give, by the four corners of
the tetrahedrons, the twenty-four corners of all possible configurations
of the plane-faced space-filling tetrakaidekahedron.
   § 15. The six skeletons being symmetrically arranged around an
axial line we see that each arm is cut by lines of other skeletons in
three points.    For an important configuration, let the skeletons be
separated out from the axial line just so far that each arm is divided
into four equal parts, by those three       intersectional points.   The-

do not trisect one another, as the diagram clearly shows.

       shown in the Table of Natality compiled by the Author
       from Observations         made at Budapest."           By JOSEPH
       KoROSI, Member of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences,
       Director of Municipal Statistics.        Communicated by Sir
       James Paget, F.R.S. Received December 28, 1893.
                                 (Abstract.)
    Both branches of the science of demography — natality statistics as
well as mortality statistics — originated on British soil. It was in
1665 that the Boyal Society published the first work on these matters
              " Observations "), whilst in 1693 Halley, by establishing
(Graunt's
the first life table, laid the foundation of the scientific treatment
of mortality statistics.     These tables of mortality showed for the
first time how    to measure   the probability of death for each year of
human age.       The other branch of vital statistics is still in want of a
corresponding table of natality, showing the probability of birth for
each of the age-combinations of the parents.      The table of natality is
not of so great scientific importance as the life table, as the probability
of death depends on natural laws, whilst the fertility, at least par
tially, is influenced by 'voluntary causes also. But as the problems of
over-population or de-population are an effect of both forces, it is
worth while to study the law of these facts also.
   To reach this aim, I have tabulated the age of the 71,800 married
couples given in the Census of 1891, conforming to the single year-
combinations. The virtual number of these combinations — as 45 pro
ductive years of the male have to be combined with each of the
40 productive years of the female — is about 2000.      Knowing thus the
number of all age-combinations, I observed for four years (two before
and two after the Census) the 46,931 births amongst couples of
those ages ; I got thus, dividing the figures obtained by four, the
yearly probability of birth for each age- combination.
   As the legitimate natality is to be regarded as a resultant between
two distinct forces, the instinct of nature which urges towards multi
plication and the forethought which causes moral restraint, it was
also desirable to get an insight into the march of the physiological
fertility alone. For this purpose      I had to look out for couples in
whom the moral restraint is weakest or entirely absent. These con

1894.]       Natality     as shown from. Observations at Budapest.                       17
ditions are fulfilled in newly-married couples, where the physiological
factor is nearly exclusively active.               I  also thus found the degree of
physiological natality for different age-combinations.                    The two curves
are very different.         The legitimate natality declines after the first
child and its fall shows a regular slope. The physiological arrives
later at its maximum, remains for some length of time on this cul
minating height, and decreases only at a more advanced age.
   We get thus two degrees of fertility for each age. The difference
between the degree of physiological and that of the actual fertility
shows, the few cases of procreative exhaustion excepted, the influence
of the moral factor. In the somewhat advanced ages this moral re
straint exercises an influence exceeding all expectation. With the
mothers of 30 to 35 it reduces the fertility to 78 per cent, (instead of
100 per cent.), with those of 43 to 2 per cent., i.e., 98/100 of the
physiological faculty is suppressed. With men the influence is also
very great, though weaker than with women.
   Out of a large number of data here follow some figures to
characterise the results :

       Francis Galton, F.R.S. Received January 12, 1894.
   There are three variables in the statistics of natality.       The age of
the father is one, that of the mother is another, and the percental
offspring of parents of those ages is the third. These three variables
may be coordinated in the same way as that which is daily followed
at meteorological offices in dealing with (1) the longitudes of the
various stations, (2) their latitudes, and (3) the barometric height
at each.      After these data have been entered on a chart in their
proper places, contours, known .by the name of isobars, are drawn to
show the lines of equal barometric pressure.           In natality tables, the
ages of the father and the mother take the place of the longitudes
and latitudes in weather charts, and lines of similar birth rates, or
as I   would call them, " isogens," take the place of isobars.
   Table    I contains the means of each set of four adjacent entries as
Known by the arrangement below, the left-hand diagram showing
the four entries, and the right-hand one showing their mean.              The

entries themselves were copied to the nearest integer from Korosi's
tables. The means are recorded in Table         I to the nearest integer only,
subject to an allowance of correction not exceeding 0'30 for the sake
of slight smoothing ; thus 24'25, which would otherwise have been
entered as 24, might be treated as if it were 24-25 + 0-30 = 24"55 and
be entered as 25.         Similarly 24"75 might be entered either as 25 or
as 24.     It will  be seen  by the right-hand diagram that the position of
the mean corresponds to the first moment of the years shown at
the side and top ; therefore the interval to which the annual birth
rate corresponds is made up of the half year before and after that
epoch.

They are, of course, less trustworthy than the rest ; moreover, they
may depend on less than 100 families.
   The ages of married couples are distributed over only about one-half
of the squares of Table I, as there are too few examples of other ages to
be statistically available.   This partial distribution is well seen in the
diagram    of  isogens, where a dotted outline encloses all the material
that can be used with safety. The broken line AB corresponds to
the instances in which both parents are of the same age. The chart
is practically limited to marriages in which the wife is less than
five years older, and less than      seventeen   years younger, than her
husband.

   It will be noticed that the isogens    run in nearly straight, diagonal,
and equidistant lines across      the  greater part of the chart. If we
omit six squares in the upper left-hand corner where there is no room
for an isogen, we shall find these diagonal lines to cross 89 of the
total number of 118 entries, or between eight and nine tenths of
them. This indicates the existence of a very curious aud unexpected
law of natality, which is well bronght out by Table II, which shows
the values measured from the dots marked on the isogens. They have
been taken at convenient places to serve as examples, one at the
beginning, one at the end of the straight portion of each, and at some
other intervening places.
   In Table   II are given the ages of the father and mother that corre
spond to each of these dots.

ages  of the parents to which each point in the straight portion of the
same isogen refers are constant.      The difference between their ages is
of no account whatever in eight or nine tenths of the total number of
marriages ; it is only when the wife is older than the husband or when
she approaches the limit of the child-bearing age, that this curious

 law ceases to hold true. The connexion between it and the straight-
 ness of the isobar is easily understood from the equation to a straight
 line of x+y — constant, for if x represent the age of the father, /, and
 if y represent that of the mother, m, then f+m = constant. That
this is a fact is conspicuously evident from the columns headed B + C
 in Table II. This is the first curious law.
    Again, through a coincidence between the increasing age of either
parent and the decrease of fertility, it happens that the sum of the
three elements of (1) father's age, (2) mother's age, (3) percental
birth-rate in a year has a value that is itself approximately constant,
as is seen in the column headed A + B + C.               Its lowest limit is 90£
and its highest up to the isogen of 10 per           cent,  is 96, but it has in
creased to 98 at the isogen of 5 per cent.          If we accept for it a con
stant value of 93 or 94 we shall never be far wrong in the larger
part of the chart.
    From this follows the second curious law that if we wish to cal
culate the percental birth-rate per annum for a married couple within
the limits of the chart where the isogens run straight and parallel,
 we have only to add the ages of the father and mother and subtract
the total from 93 or 94, in order to obtain it with considerable pre
cision. The approximate limits within which this law obtains are :
(1) the wife is not to be older than her husband ; (2) she is not to
be less than twenty-three years of age, nor (3) more than forty.
     Example. — In any large number of husbands and wives living
under like conditions to the inhabitants of Budapest, whose re
spective ages at their nearest birthdays, to 21st June, 1892, were :
 that of the father, thirty-five, that of the mother, twenty-seven ; then
the number of children born to them during the year 1892 would be
 at the rate of 93— (35 + 27) per cent. = 31 per cent. ; the isogen makes
 it about 32 per cent.*
     I shall not now enter into the other salient peculiarities of the
 isogens further than to allude to the curious change in their course
 which occurs when the wife is older than the husband. When she is
from thirty to thirty-eight she certainly seems to be appreciably
more fertile with a husband of her own age or somewhat older than
she is with one who is yonnger.          I  should hesitate to ascribe this to
physiological causes without corroborative evidence derived from
breeders of stock. It is very possible that indifference on the part of
young husbands to ageing wives may have something to do with it.

applied to Kflrosi's tables fully discusses the distribution of mean
 birth-rates, those tables do not enable ns to determine the second
 postulate of paramount importance, namely, the degree of conformity
 of individual cases to the means of many cases. We know nothing
 thus far about the facility of error at the various positions in the
 chart, whether or no it conforms to the normal law of frequency ;
 still less, what is its modulus, or whether the modulus is constant
 throughout the chart or varies in accordance with some definite law.
    The answer to these questions admits of being obtained by a
 moderate amount of work on the original observations, selecting at
 first a few squares for exploratory purposes, such as are (1) dis
 tributed evenly about the chart, and (2) contain each of them not
 less than some 300 observations, and (3) whose means accord with
the smoothed isogens that pass over the squares, thereby affording
satisfactory centres of reference.

    In  a communication which           I  had the honour of making to the
Royal    Society  in   the  spring     of  this year, the following statement
occurs (p. 420) :   —   " We are (with the help of Mr. Callendar) now
entering on    a  careful   direct comparison of thermometer Ew with a
new form of air thermometer, which, there is every reason to believe,
will give very accurate results, but we are unable to assign any
definite limit to the time that this investigation may take."
    A great number of comparisons have been made during the
summer of this year by Mr. Callendar and myself between the mer
cury thermometer EOT used by me for determining the temperature of
the calorimeter, the Tonnelot thermometer, No. 11,048, described in
the above paper (pp. 426 — 433), the platinum thermometer N, by
which the mercury thermometer Em had been previously standardised,

and two air thermometers constructed by Hicks under Mr. Callendar's
direction.*
   The indications of these air thermometers are independent of ex
ternal pressure, and no difficulty was experienced in obtaining the
temperature of the bulb to 1/1000° C.              The results were, however,
not entirely satisfactory.         It was found impossible to maintain the
exterior portion of the tank (where the comparisons had to be made)
at a temperature constant to 1/1000° C, especially at higher tempera
tures. A reference to pp. 374 — 378 will show that the regulating
apparatus was designed to maintain at a constant temperature the
interior of the steel chamber there described, and this purpose it
fulfilled admirably.         Fluctuations, however, amounting to as much
as 1/100° at 50° C. occurred in the surrounding water, and an element
of uncertainty was thus introduced into our comparisons.                  I  am now
so modifying the apparatus as to eliminate these fluctuations in the
exterior temperature, and thus render the tank more suitable for
such observations.
   I  believe Mr. Callendar proposes to make a communication to this
Society in which the details of this comparison will be given, and he
has, with this object in view, taken with him to Canada the records
of our experiments.          I  therefore propose on this occasion to confine
myself to results.         I may, however, mention that extreme care was
taken with the cleaning and drying of the air thermometers ; obser
vations were made with the thermometers filled with air, hydrogen,
and nitrogen, and all the precautions observed which Mr. Callendar's
considerable experience of air thermometers could suggest.
   The conclusions, as far as they affect my previous determinations
of temperature, are that over the range through which the experi
ments were conducted (14° to 26° C.) the limit of error does not
exceed 0'003° C. of the nitrogen thermometer.                An error of such a
magnitude     would     affect my   final value of J  by   about  1 in 4000.
   Another possible cause of error, mentioned on p. 424, is the differ
ence caused by unequal lag of the rising mercury thermometer at the
beginning and end of the temperature range, and                    I have pointed
out on p. 424 that a possible error of 0"008° C. might be due to this
cause.
   I have recently                                                I
                       performed the experiments by which hoped to throw
some light on this point — using as a thermometer a naked platinum
wire immersed in pentane.            The experiments are difficult to conduct,
and I do not regard the results as entirely satisfactory. They agree with
my former experiments in indicating that the lag is greater at the
beginning than at the end of the range by a quantity between 0"002°
and 0"009° C. The mean result of my observations gives O'OOi" C.

 amount, although it would not affect the temperature coefficients of
 the capacity for heat of water or the specific heat of the calorimeter.
  I do not, however, feel that this point is sufficiently established to
 make it advisable to apply the correction to the previously published
 results.
                                  Section II.
     I regret to state that we have discovered a serious error in the
 arithmetic.
     On pp. 407 — 410 is given an account of the comparison of the coils
 in the resistance-box with the B.A. standards, and Table XI gives in
 full the numbers actually obtained during the comparison. In order
 to simplify our work we constructed a table for our own use which
gave the value of each coil in terms of a legal ohm, and afterwards
 transferred them (see p. 410) into true ohms.          Unfortunately the
 10-ohm coil in the bridge arm was entered in this private table as
 10 0077, whereas it ought to have been 9 9977— an error of 1 in 1000,
 having its origin in a mistake in addition. The experimental numbers
actually given in Table XI will show that the ratio of the bridge
arms was 9-9734/997-87, that is, 0 0099947, or, if expressed in legal
ohms, 9-9977/1000-30 instead of 10 0077/1000-30, as given on line 13,
p. 410.
    The mistake is obvious to anyone who compares the numbers given
in Table XI with the conclusion drawn on p. 410. The whole of the
arithmetic was carefully revised by both Mr. Clark and myself, but
an error of this kind in simple addition is precisely the one to escape
observation.     The annoying circumstance is that a similar mistake in
any of the other coils would have had no appreciable effect on our
conclusions, but occurring as it did in the ratio of the bridge arms
it affects all succeeding tables.
    I would venture to add that this incident shows how advisable it
is, in work of this kind, to give in full all the experimental numbers
on which the conclusions are based.
    In consequence of this discovery I have carefully again revised
nearly the whole of the calculations, but I am glad to say that with
the exception of two or three obvious misprints I am unable to detect
any further arithmetical mistakes.
    The effect of the correction thus rendered necessary is to decrease
the value of R, in all the tables where the reduction to true ohms is
given, by 1 in 1000 ; hence the value of T in Tables XXXVII, XL,
XLI must be increased in the same proportion. The resulting cor
rection is a simple one, for, as the value of    J varies directly as T, it
has only to be increased by 1 in 1000.       Fortunately the temperatures

ratio of the bridge arms, and are, therefore, unaffected. The values
of the temperature coefficients, of the capacity for heat of water and
 of the specific heat of the calorimeter, remain practically unaltered,
as the correction only affects the sixth significant figure.
   The corrected value of     J in terms of a thermal unit at 15° C. is
thus (4-1940+0-0042) x 10' = 4-1982 x 10', and             I  estimate the

      Schott, B.A. (Cantab.), B.Sc. (Lond.), formerly Scholar of
      Trinity College, Cambridge.            Communicated by R. T.
      Glazebrook, M.A., F.R.S. Received November 29. 1893.
                                (Abstract.)
   The object of this paper is to examine the consequences of suppos
ing the transition between different refractive media to be effected
continuously through a thin variable layer, to deduce expressions for
the amplitudes and changes of phase of the reflected and refracted
light, and to compare them with the results of experiments hitherto
made on that subject.
   The theories examined are the elastic solid theories, both those
assuming large velocities for the pressural wave, including Green's,
Voigt's, and K. Pearson's theories, and also Lord Kelvin's contractile
ether theory, and then the electromagnetic theory, in the form given
by Hertz, which, it may be remarked, leads to the same equations as
the contractile ether theory.
   The medium being continuously variable, the displacements and
stresses, or the electric and magnetic force components, are every
where continuous.      The method thus avoids all hypotheses as to
boundary conditions at surfaces of discontinuity.
   For convenience, the first constant portion of the medium, from which
the incidental light comes, is called the first medium, the second con
stant part, into which the light is in part refracted, is called the second
medium, the thin variable part is called the variable layer, and the
arbitrarily chosen planes, which include the whole of the variable
layer, are called the boundaries of the layer.      Since at those planes
the medium is continuous, the displacements and stresses have the
same values on both sides of each plane.

 1894.]                Reflection and Refraction          of Light.                27
     In   the   first medium are assumed an incident, a reflected, and a
 preBsural wave, and in the second a refracted and a pressural wave,
 the pressural waves, of course, disappearing on the contractile ether
 and electromagnetic theories. Taking account both of vibrations in
 and perpendicular to the plane of incidence, there are 6 amplitudes
 and 6 retardations of phase, in all, 12 constants, to be determined.
 From the continuity of the motion at the two boundary planes of the
 variable layer are obtained 12 pairs of equations, of which 6 pairs
 determine the motion inside the variable layer, and the remaining
 ones the 6 pairs of constants.     In the actual work, imaginaries are
 used in the usual way, reducing the equations by one half, the re
quisite number of equations being obtained at the end by changing
the sign of the imaginary.
   From the equations of vibration in the variable layer and one half
of the boundary conditions, solutions are obtained in ascending
powers of the thickness of the layer, which, on substitution in the
remaining boundary conditions, give sufficient equations to determine
the amplitudes and phases by simple though long algebraic analysis.
   The solutions are found to be convergent, provided 2irdj\ is less
than the reciprocal of the greatest value of the refractive index
occurring in the variable layer, d being its thickness, and A. the wave
length in vacuo of the light employed. This condition gives values
for d which are less than the thickness of a soap film producing a
red of the first order.    Thus the films for which the theory holds at
all cannot possibly produce colours of thin plates, which has been
stated as a possible objection by Lord Rayleigh.
   The solutions are taken as far as is necessary to give the values of
the amplitudes and phases correct to squares of d. The elastic solid
theories lead to Green's formula?, but the contractile ether and
electromagnetic theories give modifications of Fresnel's formulas,
somewhat of Cauchy's type. The corrections to the amplitudes are
of order cP, whilst the phases are of order d. If fio, fix, /i are the
refractive indices of the media and the layer, then these terms in
volve certain constants which are functions of ^u,,, /t, and of the
mean values of /t2, l/fi? and certain combinations of /ta, l/p*.
   The effect is considered of supposing the velocities of the pressural
waves to be large, but finite and different, the refractive index for the
pressural wave from the first to the second medium having any
value.   The resulting formula? deviate from Green's chiefly in that

solid theory, such as that of Voigt or of K. Pearson, can be made to
agree with experiment, if we suppose the ether incompressible.    The
alternative assumption of supposing the ether contractile, will be
found to agree with experiment, but there is no means of deciding
between it and the electromagnetic theory as regards refraction and
reflection.

   The expressions for (RJ./R//)2 and for tan (pi. — />//) show that the
change of difference of phase depends chiefly on E, being also slightly
modified by D, and that the alteration in amplitude depends chiefly
on B, being only slightly affected by A. The accuracy with which
the constants can be experimentally determined      thus very different,
                                                                       is

   The values of the four constants are independently calculated for
several pairs of media from experiments by Jamin, by Kurz, and by
Quincke, using the method of least squares and assuming that the
observations are equally exact at all incidences, which     only roughly           is
true.
   The numbers for the ratio intensities and the difference of phase
calculated with the values of the constants agree rather better with

  observation than the corresponding        numbers for Cauchy's formulte,
  even as modified by Quincke to explain his experiments.           For in
  stance,  in the case of Jamin's experiments on realgar-air, chosen at
 random, the probable errors of a single observation are — according
 to theory, in tan-'CRj./R//), 20' 82, according to Cauchy, 22'-96, and
 in the difference of phase pL—pll, measured in wave-lengths, accord
 ing to the theory, 0'0054, according to Cauchy, 0 0071.        This superi
 ority is due to the influence of the additional constants D and A ;
 but their effect is very slight, that of A especially so ; in some cases
 A may be put zero without greatly impairing the accuracy of the
theoretical    formula?.
    The values of B, as determined from the intensity experiments
agree within the limits of error with those deduced from the equation
B = (pilfia) E* ; in the one case of essence of lavender-air there is a
serious discrepancy, for B is 0 000027, while (^/^E* is 0-000065;
but here the error is due to the smallness of B, ten times less than
for any other pair of media ; in fact the minimum value of (RJ./R//)2
is only tan* 7' or 0-000004, and an error of only a few minutes in the
determination of the azimuth would make a great difference in the
value of B.      In cases of such difference between B and (^1//i0)EJ, it
is best to rely on the value of E, which can be determined with much
greater accuracy than B, in some cases with more than five times
greater accuracy.
    As regards the interchange of media, there were available three
sufficiently accurate sets of experiments by Quincke.       The. conditions
referred to above are satisfied     with  very good accuracy in the case of
flintglass-air, the values of B being 0 00533 and 0 0050, and of /t,E,
-OiE)', 0 0925, 0 093; for flintglass- water the numbers are, B,
00120, 0-0100, and ^E, 0 1490, -(^E)', 0 1426; but for crown-
glass-air the discrepancy is great, B, 0 00040, 0-00111, and ^E,
00237,     -(/»,E)',  0-0427.
    Jamin and Cauchy's        corresponding relation between the ellipti-
cities, — E'/E = fi\/ni , is not so nearly satisfied ; the observed values

                              Simplex Eolotropy.
   1. All  explanations of double refraction (proximate, not ultimate)
rest upon the hypothesis that the medium in which it occurs is so
structured as to impart eolotropy to one of the two properties,
associated with potential and kinetic energy, with which the ether is
endowed in order to account for the transmission of waves through
it in the simplest manner. It may be elastic eolotropy, or it may be
something equivalent to eolotropy as regards the density.          In Max
well's electromagnetic theory the two properties are those connecting
the electric force with the displacement, and the magnetic force with
the induction, say the permittivity and the inductivity, or c and ft.
These are, in the simplest case, constants corresponding to isotropy.
The existence of eolotropy as regards either of them will cause double
refraction.    Then either c or ft is a symmetrical linear operator, or
dyadic,   as  Willard   Gibbs calls it. In either case the optical wave-
surface is of the Fresnel type. In either case the fluxes displace
ment and induction are perpendicular            to one another and in a
wave-front, whilst the electric and magnetic forces are also per
pendicular to one another.         But it is the magnetic force that is
in the wave-front, coincident with the induction, in case of
magnetic isotropy and electric eolotropy, the electric force being
then out of the wave-front, though in the plane of the normal and
the displacement. And in the other extreme case of electric
isotropy and magnetic eolotropy, the electric force is in the wave-
front, coincident with the displacement, whilst the magnetic force
is out of the wave-front, though in the plane of the normal and
the induction.      Now, as a matter of fact, crystals may be strongly
eolotropic electrically, whilst their magnetic eolotropy, if existent, is
insignificant.    This, of course, justifies Maxwell's ascription of double
refraction to electric eolotropy.
                 Properties connected with Duplex Eolotropy.
   2. When duplex eolotropy, electric and magnetic, is admitted, we
obtain a more general kind of wave-surface, including the former two

 as extreme cases.       It is almost a pity that magnetic eolotropy should
 be insensible, becanse the investigation of the conditions regulating
 plane waves in media possessing duplex eolotropy, and the wave-
 surface associated therewith, possesses many points of interest.        The
 chief attraction lies in the perfectly symmetrical manner in which the
 subject may be displayed, as regards the two eolotropies. This brings
 out clearly properties which are not always easily visible in the case
 of simplex eolotropy, when there is a one-sided and imperfect
 development of the analysis concerned.
    In general, the fluxes displacement and induction, although in the
 wave-front, are not coperpendicular.        Corresponding to this, the two
 forces electric and magnetic, which are always in the plane perpen
 dicular to the ray, or the flux of energy, are not coperpendicular.
 Nor are the positions of the fluxes in the wave-front conditioned by
 the effective components in that plane of the forces being made to
 coincide with the fluxes.        There are two waves with a given normal,
and it would be impossible to satisfy this requirement for both. But
there is a sort of balance of skewness, inasmuch as the positions of
the fluxes in the wave-front are such that the angle through which
 the plane containing the normal and the displacement (in either
 wave) must be turned, round the normal as axis, to reach the electric
force, is equal (though in the opposite sense) to the angle through
 which the plane containing the normal and the induction must be
turned to reach the magnetic force. These are merely rudimentary
properties.     I   have investigated the wave-surface and associated
matters in my paper " On the Electromagnetic                  Wave-surface
                                                                            "

    3. The connexion between the simplex and duplex types of wave-
surface has been interestingly illustrated lately by Dr. J. Larmor in
his paper " On the Singularities of the Optical Wave-surface,"
(' Proc. London Math. Soc.,' vol. 24, 1893). He points out, inci
dentally, that a simplex wave-surface, when subjected to a particular
sort of homogeneous strain, becomes a duplex wave-surface of a special
kind. To more precisely state the connexion, let there be electric
eolotropy, say c, with magnetic isotropy. Then, if the strainer, or
strain operator, applied to the simplex wave-surface, be homologous
with c, given by c~"*X constant, the result is to turn it into a duplex
wave-surface whose two eolotropies are also homologous with the
original c ; that is to say, the principal axes are parallel. This duplex
wave-surface is, of course, of a specially simplified kind, though not
the simplest.      That occurs when the two eolotropies are not merely
homologous, but are in constant ratio. The wave-surface then re
duces to a single ellipsoid.

   Conversely, therefore, if we start with the duplex wave-surface
corresponding to homologous permittivity and inductivity, and homo
geneously strain it, the strainer being proportional to              c*,
                                                             we convert
it to a simplex wave-surface whose one eolotropy      homologous with
                                                           is
the former two.
   Remembering that the eqnation of the duplex wave-surface                        is
symmetrical with respect to the two eolotropies, so that they may be
interchanged without altering the surface,      struck me on reading
                                                  it
Dr. Larmor's remarks that a similar reduction to        simplex wave-
                                                                a
surface could be effected by a strainer proportional to /t*.  This was
verified on examination, and some more general transformations
presented themselves. The results are briefly these —       :
   Any duplex wave-surface (irrespective of homology of eolotropies),
when subjected to homogeneous strain (not necessarily pure), usually
remains a duplex wave-surface.    That is, the transformed surface                 is
of the same type, though with different inductivity and permittivity
operators.
   But in special cases it becomes a simplex wave-surface.                  In    one
 way the strainer     is   c*/[c*], where the square brackets indicate the
 determinant of the enclosed operator.            In another the strainer          is
 tLil\_Hi~\. These  indicate  the  strain operator to be applied to the vector
 of the old surface to produce that of the new one.
      Now, these simplex wave-surfaces may be strained anew to their
reciprocals with respect to the unit sphere, or the corresponding
 index-surfaces, which are surfaces of the same type. So we have at
least four ways of training any duplex wave-surface to a simplex one.
                     a
     Furthermore, any duplex wave-surface may be homogeneously
strained to its reciprocal, the corresponding index-surface, of the
same duplex type.        The strain is    pure, but
                                                  is    complicated, as    init
volves both     c and /*.      The strainer is    c_1(c^-1)', divided by the
determinant of the same.             This transformation   is  practically the
generalization     for the  duplex    wave-surface   of Pliicker's theorem re
lating to the Fresnel surface, for that also involves straining the wave-
surface to its reciprocal.
     Instead of the single strain above mentioned, we may employ three
successive pure strains.        Thus, first strain the duplex wave-surface to
a simplex surface. Secondly, strain the latter to its reciprocal.
Thirdly, strain the last to the reciprocal of the original duplex wave-
surface.     There are at least two sets of three successive strains which
effect the desired transformation.         The investigation follows.

where B/iS is as in (4), with ^1 written for c. Similarly as regards the
second form of (3). When the operators are not homologons, the
complication of the form of the constituents of the inverse operators
makes the expansion less easy.
    As regards the second form of (3), it is obtained from the first
form by interchanging /t and c. It l-epresents the same surface. The
 transformation from one form to the other, if done by ordinary
algebra, without the use of vectors and linear operators, is very
troublesome in the general case. But in the electromagnetic theoiy
the equivalence can be seen to be true and predicted beforehand.
For consider the circuital equations (2). If we eliminate H, we
 obtain
                          —curl fT1 curl     E=   cE,                   (7)
whilst if we eliminate E, we obtain
                          -curl  c-1 curl  H  = ^H.                     (8)
    These are the characteristic   equations of E and H respectively in
a dielectric with duplex eolotropy, and we see that they only differ
in the interchange of c and ft. When, therefore, we apply one of
them, say that of E, to a plane wave to make the velocity equation,
in which process E is eliminated, we can see that a precisely similar
investigation applies to the H equation, provided fi and c be inter
changed. So, if the E equation leads to the first form in (3), the H
equation must lead to the second form.        They therefore represent the
same surface.     The same property applies to any equation obtained
from the circuital equations with the electrical variables eliminated,
the equation of the wave-surface, for example. If we have obtained
 one special form, a second is got by interchanging the eolotropies.
    The index equation being what we are naturally led to from the
 characteristic equation, it is merely a matter of mathematical work
 to derive the corresponding wave-surface.          For S is the reciprocal
 of the perpendicular upon the tangent plane to the wave-surface, so

 and   its connexion with  r, we may derive the equation of r itself.       I
 have shown {he. cit., vol. 2, pp. 12 — 16) that the result is expressed
 by simply inverting the operators in the index equation. Thus, the
 equation of the wave-surface is

where, as before, two forms are given.  Now, the final equivalence of
this transition from the index to wave-equation to mere inversion of
the two eolotropic operators is such a simple result that one would
think there should be a very simple way of exhibiting how the transi
tion comes   about. Nevertheless,                  I
                                       am not aware of any simple in

no means obvious at first.             I
                                effected the transformation by taking
advantage of symmetrical relations between the forces and fluxes ;
in particular proving, first, that rE = 0 = rH, or that the ray is
perpendicular to the electric and magnetic forces, comparing this
with the analogous property sD = 0 = sB, and constructing a pro
cess for leading from the former to the wave-equation analogous to
that leading from the latter to the index equation.       It then goes
easily.   However, we are not concerned with these details here.
  A caution is necessary regarding the interchangeability of /a and c.
They should be fully operative as linear operators.    If one of them
be a constant initially, and therefore all through, we may not then
interchange them in the simplified equations which result.           For
example, let   /i be constant in (10).                 We have now

remembering that [/t] is now ft3. But the same interchange in the
first form does not produce the second, because it is more general.
So we have gained a relative simplicity of form at the cost of
generality.   The extra complication of the duplex wave-surface is
accompanied    by general analytical extensions which make the
working operations more powerful.        The equivalence of the two
forms in (11) may be established by the use of Hamilton's general
cubic equation of a linear operator, as done in Tait's work.  Though
not difficult to carry out, the operations are rather recondite. On the
other hand, the much more general equivalence (10) is, as we saw for
the reason following (7) and (8), obviously true.     This suggests that
some other transformations       involving the general cubic may be
made plainer by generalizing       employing a pair of linear operators.

We need not suppose that the strain is pure.                        Use (12) in the first

Now the use of vectors and linear operators produces such a concise
exhibition of the essentially significant properties, freed from the
artificial elaboration of coordinates, that a practised worker may
readily see his way to the following results by mere inspection of
equation (13), or with little more. I give, however, much of the
detailed work that would then be done silently, believing that the
spread of vector analysis is not encouraged by the quaternionist's
practice of leaving out too many of the steps.
   In the first place, 0~'q is the same as q0'~\ if 0' is the conjugate
of 0. So

and the postfactor 0,_1 may then be transferred to the denominator.
To do this, it must be inverted, of course, and then brought in as a
postfactor.  Similarly, the 0~l in the numerator may be merged in
the denominator by inversion first, and then bringing      in as a pre-        it.

 Consequently (20) represents a duplex wave-surface whose operators

    Now compare this with the second form of the same (26).               They
 are identical, except that    6  is now inverted.       Consequently (32) re
presents the index-surface corresponding to the wave-surface repre
sented by the second of (26), and therefore by the first, since they
are the same.      In a similar manner the strain (29) applied to the
second of (26) leads to the reciprocal of the first form.
    In like manner the simplex surface (28) is strained to its re
ciprocal by

Applied to the first form of (28), we get the second form with X in

inverted. These inversions of simplex wave-surfaces by homogeneous

wave-surface is its own reciprocal with respect to a certain ellipsoid

                   p        E_j        = o =p    _P_     ,           (45)
where X = <rVc_*.     Finally, the strain
                                 C0i]      [c^J
converts the simplex surface p to a duplex surface S, which is the
reciprocal of the original duplex wave-surface, the result being (40).
   The interchangeability of fi and c shows that we may also strain
from r to s by a second set of three successive pure strains, thus,
                           0 = yU-*(,i»c-y)y-1.                       (47)
This is the same as first straining the surface r to the simplex surface
 (26) ; then inverting the latter, which brings us to the simplex sur
face (32) ; and finally straining the last to the dnplex surface S.
           Transformation of Characteristic Equation by Strain.
   9.  In connexion with the above transformations, it may be worth
while to show how they work out when applied to the characteristic
equation itself of E or H. Thus, take the form (7), or

                             -cE   = Vv/t-'VvE,                          (48)
 and let           r =/V,       v=/"V,            E =/-'E',              (49)
 so  that (48) becomes
                      -c^'E' = V/-1vV-1V/-Iv'^'E'.                       (50)
 Now employ Hamilton's formula
                             Vmn = 0V0m0n                               (51)

0 being here any self-conjugate         operator.     Take 0  = f~\ and    we
transform (50) to
                 -cf->E' = V/-V/»_1/VVE' x         L/^1]                (52)
                          = V/-V/-1 C/A-1/) VV'E' x [/->].              (53)
 In this use Hamilton's formula again, with 0 =               and we obtain
                       =  fVV (ffrft VV'E'      x [/«]•                 (54)
Or, more conveniently written,
                                *=                    VV'E'.            (55)
    So far, / is any pure strainer ; we can now make various special
izations.    For  example, to get rid of        from the right side of (48),
and substitute c.    Take
which brings (55) to the form
                           -/i-'E'  = Vv'cVv'E',                        (57)
which should be compared with the other characteristic, that of H,
which is (8), or
                                   = Vvc-'VvH.                          (58)
   The above process is analogous to our transformation            from the
duplex   wave-surface   to  its reciprocal.    As   then, we have an  inver
sion of operators and also a crossing over from one form to another.
            Derivation of Index liquation from Characteristic.

  So far we have merely a changed form of the characteristic.   But

   Now throw away the operand NV3CH, and we get the velocity
eqnation pure and simple, and the index equation (3) then comes by
s = No-1.
   But, although the above manipulation of the characteristic equa
tion has some analytical interest, the process cannot be always re
commended on the score of simplicity. It is, on the contrary, usually
easier and simpler to work upon the component equations upon which
the characteristic  is founded.

    My purpose in the following note is to submit to the Royal Society
the results of experiments, made during the past year, relating to the
" intra-cranial               "
                   pressure      (i.e., the pressure to which the brain is
normally exposed in the cranial cavity), and the changes which can
be produced in it by alterations of the form and diminution of the
capacity of the cranial cavity.
    The experiments were undertaken at the suggestion of Professor
Burdon Sanderson, and have been carried out with his help and
criticism.
    The animals employed were cats or dogs.              Ether, chloroform, and
morphia were used       as anaesthetics.

   4. Methods of obtaining Records of the Cerebral Venous Pressure. —
The superior longitudinal sinus, with its tributaries, in the dog
opens into a large venous cavity within the occipital protuberance ;
the transverse sinuses lying within the bony tentorium cerebelli lead
out of this cavity. Part of the blood finds its exit by the post-glenoid
foramen, and reaches the external jugular vein, but a very large
portion passes into the large sinuses which run down the vertebral
canal.
   The methods are as follows : —
   a. A hole is drilled into the venous cavity within the occipital
protuberance.     Into the hole a tube is fixed, filled with sodium
sulphate  solution.   The tube is connected with a water manometer.
      The skull
    ft.               opened over the occipital protuberance, and a
                        is
venous cannula passed into the superior longitudinal sinus against
the direction of the blood flow. The cannula           connected with a
                                                          is
water manometer. This method gives the venous pressure with
obstructed flow.
   In either of these methods the manometer can be connected with a
light and delicate tambour, and the venous pressure recorded.
   Records of the blood pressure in the carotid artery, and of the
respiration, were taken simultaneously with the records of intra
cranial pressure.
                                  " the
   By the method of " worming           trephine holes before screwing
in the brass tubes the connexions were made (as tested) absolutely
air tight. The delicacy of the measuring apparatus was tested on an
artificial scheme, and found to be perfect.

     6. Salt solution (0'6 per cent.) can be slowly driven into the sub
 dural space at the rate of about 1 c.c. a minute, without raising the
 intra-cranial pressure or producing any physiological effects.              As
 much as 20 c.c. has thus been driven in during one experiment.
(Method      1 «.)
    7.  Salt solution can be driven through from the parietal hole to a
hole in the lumbar region of the spinal column.               The whole of the
subdural space can thus be syringed through.
   8. Salt solution cannot be driven from a hole in the lumbar region
out of a hole in the parietal region. The brain floats up and closes
the parietal hole as a valve.
   9. Salt solution, if driven in quickly with a higher pressure, pro
duces a momentary rise of intra-cranial pressure and momentary
physiological effects.     These disappear very rapidly as the solution is
absorbed.
   10. On introducing 0*5 c.c. of salt solution within a bag in the sub
dural space of a cat (Method 1 /3), no rise of intra-cranial pressure
occurs, and no physiological effects are produced.
   11. The introduction of more than 0'5 c.c. produces a lasting rise
of intra-cranial pressure and physiological effects.               These are :
(1) slowing      to stopping   of  respiration   ; (2) rise  of blood  pressure
and slowing of the heart ; (3) dilatation, or extreme constriction, of
the pnpil, and sometimes nystagmus.
   12. The cat may become habituated to the smaller degrees of
heightened intra-cranial pressure, and the physiological effects pass
off.
   13.   Greater amounts than 1 c.c. cause an enormous and maintained
rise of arterial pressure, with acceleration of the heart, inspiratory
gasps at long intervals, followed by fall of arterial pressure and
death.
   14. 0-5 c.c. is the largest     amount of displacement which can be
perfectly compensated for       in the cat, i.e., this is the reduction of the
cranial capacity which can be made np for by escape of cerebro
spinal fluid.
   15. The brain of the cat of ordinary size, measured up to the level
of the calamus scriptorius, equals in volume 26 c.c.
   16. The amount of compensation is reduced to nothing on repeating
the experiment a second time, and the effects which follow the intro
duction of the same quantity of salt solution into the bag are much
more marked.
    17. In the dog of the fox-terrier size the amount of compensation
is 1'5 c.c.
   18. The     brain of the ordinary fox-terrier, on an average, equals
64 c.c.   in volume.
    19.  The introduction of more than 15 c.c. in the dog produces

56                     On  Intro-Cranial Pressure.                 [Jan. 25,
a   lasting rise of intra-cranial pressure and physiological effects.
These are the same as in the cat, except that there is no rise of blood
pressure.
    20. On cutting both vagi in the dog, the rise of blood pressure
occurs as in the cat, and may reach enormous amounts.
    21. The compensation is reduced to nothing in the dog on repeating
the experiment a second time, and the effects are much more severe.
    22. The physiological     effects can be immediately removed by
emptying the bag, and the pressure in the intra-cranial cavity
recovers its old standard.
    23. Tf the displacement caused by the bag is large, and maintained
for a considerable time, there may be no relief and no expansion of
the brain on emptying the bag.
    24. Trephine holes made in various parts of the cranium and
vertebral column afford no relief to the effects produced by the bag.
    25. No fluid is to be found within the subdural space after the
".bag experiment."      The surface of the brain and the cavity of the
skull are quite dry.                                                          ,
    26. After the
                   "
                     bag experiment," salt solution (Method 1) can no
longer be absorbed, and can no longer be driven through to a hole in          ,
the lumbar region, but apts in the same way and produces the same
effects as the bag.
    27. Marked physiological effects occur in the cat when the intra
cranial pressure is raised 10 mm. Hg above the normal. The measure
ment is taken over the medulla oblongata.
    28. The venous pressure in the cavity of the occipital protuberance
falls to zero when the " bag " is distended over the parietal region,
i.e., the entrance of blood is obstructed ; the exit by the bony trans
verse sinuses remains open.       (Method 4 a.)
   29. The venous pressure in the superior longitudinal sinus rises
when the "bag" is distended, i.e., the exit is obstructed by the
cannula, and blood is forced out of the tributary veins into the sinus.
 (Method 4 /3.)
    30. The normal venous pressure in each case at once returns when
the bag is emptied.
                   Conclusion.     November 18, 1893.
    The capacity of the intra-cranial cavity can be diminished by the
introduction of a foreign body into the subdural space.             The first
 effect of the diminution is to expel the cerebro-spinal fluid. After its
disappearance, further diminution of the space can only take place
by equal diminution of the volume of the intra-cranial blood vessels,
particularly of the veins and capillaries.     The restriction or arrest of
the cerebral circulation thus produced is the efficient cause of the physio

   In the animals experimented on, any considerable increase of tho

minutes.      On post-mortem examination, the upper portion of the first
lymph gland in the cervical chain was found to be coloured blue ; in
the central nervous system the blue colour was found limited to the
cerebral hemisphere on the side of injection, the base of the brain,
and the cervical region of the cord. Conclusion — The blood vessels
form the pathway of absorption of fluid from the subdural space.

   The views that have been expressed as to the probable functions of
the cerebellum are briefly alluded to, and the results obtained by
previous investigators, as the direct outcome of experimentation, are
detailed at greater length.
   The objects of the present research were to determine :
   1. Whether each lateral half of the cerebellum is capable of acting
independently, or whether it is necessary for the connexions between
the two halves to be intact, in order that the functions of the organ
should be properly performed.
   2. If   impulses pass from one side of the organ to the other before
they are transmitted to the cerebrum or spinal cord.
   3. What is the nature of the impairment of movement which re
sults when portions of the organ are removed.
   4. What relationship exists between one half of the cerebellum

53              Dr. J. S. Risien Russell.    Experimental      [Jan. 25,
and the cerebral hemisphere of the opposite side, and what is its
probable nature.
   5. Whether one lateral half of the cerebellum is related mainly to
the same side of the spinal cord, to the opposite side, or to both, and
what the nature of the relationship is.
   6. What symptoms resulting from experimental lesions of the
cerebellum are mostly to be relied on for localisation.
   7. Whether any, and if so which, of the symptoms are dependent,
on interference with the labyrinth or 8th nerve when experi
mental lesions of the cerebellum are produced.
   The procedures adopted in attempting to elucidate these problems
were :
   1. Median vertical section separating the two lateral halves of the
cerebellum from each other.
   2. Extirpation of one lateral lobe.
   3. Removal of half the organ, i.e., of one lateral lobe together with
one lateral half of the middle lobe.
   4. One or other of the last two methods of procedure as a pre
liminary, and subsequent comparative investigation of the excitability
of the two cerebral hemispheres.
   5. Similar preliminary methods as in the last instance, followed
 by the administration of the essential oil of absinthe, and comparison
of the effect of the resulting convulsions on the muscles of the two
sides of the body.
   6. Removal of both lateral lobes of the cerebellum.
   7. Extirpation of the whole or half of the posterior part of the
middle lobe.
   8. Ablation of the whole organ.
   9. Control   experiments on the labyrinth and       8th nerve, which
consisted in  :
             (o) Extirpation of the labyrinth.
             (6) Intracranial section of the auditory nerve.
             (c) Chemical irritation of the auditory nerve.
   The results detailed refer chiefly to dogs, but the effects of similar
lesions of the cerebellum in monkeys are contrasted with these. The
qnestion as to whether the cerebellum exerts any trophic influence
is separately considered, as is a case of defective development of the
cerebellum in a cat.
   The investigation of the excitability of the two cerebral hemi
spheres, as tested by the induced current, yielded results of more
than ordinary interest, for, whereas the excitability was equal on the
two sides when the cerebellum was intact, the opposite hemisphere
was the most excitable after unilateral ablation of the cerebellum,
which difference in the excitability persisted, and was still present

  1894.]     Researches into the Functions   of the Cerebellum.         59
  even three months after the     half of the cerebellum had been re
  moved.    The results obtained when absinthe was administered to
  animals which had been deprived of half the cerebellum also yielded
 highly interesting and instructive results.    The increased excitability
 of the opposite hemisphere was evidenced by the exaggeration of the
 convulsions on the side of the cerebellar lesion ; and it became also
 evident that the convulsions on the opposite side were diminished.
 Further, the curves obtained from the extensor muscles of the
 anterior extremity on the side of the cerebellar lesion showed that
 there was a marked alteration in the second stage of the convulsive
 seizure, for the tonus characteristic of this stage of similar convul
 sions evoked in dogs whose central nervous system was intact was
 either replaced by clonic spasms, or a large element of clonus was
 superimposed on the tonus. The curves from the muscles of both
anterior extremities showed this alteration in the second stage of the
convulsions when the whole instead of the half of the cerebellum
had been previously removed.
    The chief conclusions which appear to be warranted are that the
one half of the cerebellum does not, in any great measure, depend on
the cooperation of the other half for the proper performance of its
functions.     The bulk of the impulses pass from one half of the organ
to the cerebrum, or spinal cord, without passing to the other half.
Three factors are responsible for the defective movements which re
sult on ablation of different .parts of the organ — incoordination,
rigidity,   and motor paresis.      The last of these is probably di
rectly due to the withdrawal of the cerebellar influence from the
muscles, while the exalted excitability of the opposite cortex cerebri,
which results after unilateral ablation of the cerebellum, is probably
a provision for compensation in this and other connexions.      The one
half of the cerebellum controls the cells of the cortex of the opposite
cerebral hemisphere, and those of the anterior horns of the spinal
cord on the same side chiefly, and on the opposite side to a slight
extent.    It is further suggested that either the cerebral hemisphere
whose excitability is increased inhibits the opposite hemisphere, or
that, under normal conditions, one half of the cerebellum inhibits the
other half, which inhibition being no longer operative, owing to
ablation of half of the organ, allows the remaining half to exert an
increased control on the opposite cortex cerebri, or on the spinal
centres of the same side, or possibly in both directions ; but which is
the most probable explanation of the phenomena observed is at pre
sent left an open question.
   The symptoms characteristic of unilateral ablation of the cerebellum
are   :
    1.  Rotation and reeling to the opposite side.
    2.  The side of the face corresponding to the side of the lesion is

fiO       Researches into the Functions  of the Cerebellum.    [Jan. 25;
directed tip, and the spinal column is arched with its concavity to the
side of the lesion.
   3. Incoordination, chiefly in the limbs of the same side.
   4. Rigidity, most marked in the extremities of the side of the lesion,
and preponderating in the anterior extremity of the side.
   5. Exaggeration    of the tendon reflexes most marked on the same
side.
   6. Motor paresis affecting both extremities on the side of the
lesion, and the posterior extremity of the opposite side.
    7. Anfflsthesia and analgesia having the same distribution as the
motor paresis.
   8. Deviation of the opposite eyeball downwards and outwards,
¦while that of the same side, if deviated, looks upwards and to the
side of the lesion.
   9. Lateral nystagmus, the jerks being from the opposite side to
wards the side of the lesion.
   The phenomena which characterise ablation of different parts of
the middle lobe, and of the whole organ, are similarly described.     In
coordination is next discussed, and it is urged that, instead of looking
on the cerebellum as a distinct organ which has a special function,
distinct from those subserved by other parts of the central nervous
system, it would be more correct to look on it as a part of that
system, having many functions in common with other parts of it, the
chief difference between one part of this great system and another
being the degree in which different functions are represented in any
given part : e.g., with regard to motor power, the anterior extremity
is maximally represented in the cerebrum and minimally in the
cerebellum, whereas the trunk muscles are minimally represented in
the cerebrum and maximally in the cerebellum.        Arguments are ad
duced in favour of looking on the ocular deviations which result
from ablation of parts of the cerebellum as paralytic rather than
irritative phenomena, and two forms of nystagmus are recognised as
consequent on cerebellar lesions, one which is spontaneous, and the
other which is only evoked on voluntary movements of the globes,
and the probable difference in their astiology discussed.        Finally,
the phenomena characteristic of unilateral ablation of the cerebellum
are contrasted with those the result of extirpation of the labyrinth,
and it is shown that no single phenomenon is the same in the two.

   The author of the paper brings forward evidence to show that,
whilst the effect upon respiration of exciting the cerebrum in a
non-anaesthetised    animal is probably a complex one, yet, by careful
regulation of the anaesthetic state, four constant effects can be ob»
tained upon respiration by stimulation of the cortex, and these can be
traced down each in a course of its own from the cortex to the
medulla oblongata.        In the production of the anaesthetic state the
author lays stress not only upon the drug (ether) used, but also upon
the following general conditions — apncea, loss of blood, exposure of
the brain, extravasation of blood, general exhaustion of the animal, and
departure from health prior to the experiment.
   The four effects upon respiration obtained in this research are as
follows : —
                           A. Diminution of Action.
   Slowing and Arrest of the Respiratory Rhythm. — The cortical area
where this result was obtained is situated just outside the olfactory
tract in front of the point where the tract joins the temporo-
sphenoidal lobe.        On exposing successive and vertical sectional
surfaces of the hemisphere the same result was obtained by exciting
in the line of the strand of fibres known as the olfactory limb of the
anterior commissure.         After decussating at the anterior commissure,
the tract is continued backwards on either side of the infundibulum
into the red nucleus below and external to the aqueduct at the plane
of exit of the 3rd nerve.
                              B. Increased Action.
   1. Acceleration. — Commencing from a point on the convex surface
                                                 "
of the cortex within the " sensori-motor            area, the effect may be
followed back just below the lenticular nucleus where it borders on
the outer and ventral portion of the internal capsule ; the strand runs

  capsnle, and 80 reaches the tegmentum. The lines from the two sides
   meet in the interpeduncular grey matter at the level of and just
   behind the exit of the 3rd nerve.
     2. Hyperinspiratory Clonus ("snuffing movements"). — This effect
   was obtained by excitation at the junction of the olfactory bulb and
  tract, and then carrying the stimulation backwards along the olfactory
  tract ; the same result was found when the uncinate convolution of
  the temporo-sphenoidal lobe was irritated.         Followed from the uncus
  this excitable region passed behind the optic tract to the eras, and
  then lay ventrally to the crusta. The excitable tract on each side
  thus converged towards the middle line at the upper border of the
  pons.
     3.  Hyperinspiratory Tortus. — This experimental result is of such
  frequency and constancy as to be clearly an important general
  phenomenon. It can be elicited in various ways : e.g., excitation of
  the descending motor tract in the corona radiata and internal capsule
  yielded this result ; so did excitation of the 5th nerve and dura mater,
 as well as the sciatic nerve, both before and after complete removal
 of the cerebrum at the tentorium cerebelli.
     The author finds medullated fibres in prepared microscopical
 vertical (frontal) sections of the brain running in the same course as
 that indicated by faradic excitation of the living surface of the
 section of the hemisphere.       For his conclusions he has relied solely
upon tracings of the respiratory movements. Fifty-six tracings are
 included as illustrations, together with thirty photographs of brains
 and brain sections to show the precise points excited. The author
records his thanks to Mr. Horsley for help, and to Dr. Howard Tooth
for the loan of excellently-prepared sections.

                                 (Abstract.)
    The author reviews the literature       of the subject, and points out
that    the question   of time  has   not  been sufficiently considered by
previous investigators.
    He examines the view which, at present, is usually accepted, and
which explains the oedema accompanying passive congestion upon
purely mechanical principles.

 1894.]     tlte (Edema which accompanies Passive    Congestion.        63
    He estimates the occurrence or non-occurrence of oedema by the
 specific gravity of the blood and blood-plasma, arterial and venous,
of muscle and of skin, regarding these as more delicate tests of the
presence or absence of cedema than the rougher methods of inspec
tion, measurement, and pitting on pressure.
    Having raised the pressure in the femoral vein to 50 mm. of
mercury, he finds that there is no alteration in the specific gravity of
the blood or blood-plasma of the muscle or of the skin, nor is
there any increase in the amount of the lymph-flow, though such a
pressure be maintained constant for an hour.
    In the affected limb only is any change to be noted, and here there
 s a rise in the specific gravity of the venous blood and blood-plasma,
which depends upon the longer sojourn of the blood in the limb and
the consequent greater removal of the more watery portion from a
given volume of blood.
    Inasmuch as it is essential upon a purely mechanical explanation
that the exudation from the blood-vessels should be increased in
amount synchronously with the increase of pressure, and no such
exudation is found to take place during an hour after the pressure
in the veins has been raised, the author considers that the mechanical
explanation is not supported by facts.
    Since all forms of oedema, are accompanied by an insufficient supply
of blood to meet the requirements of the tissues, the author investi
gated the effect of different varieties of aneemia upon the occurrence
of oedema. The varieties investigated were : —
    1.  Prolonged complete anromia, lasting three hours.
    2. Haemostasia,   or cutting-off of the limb, with whatever blood
         and lymph it may contain, from the rest of the circulation,
         by means of a tight ligature, for one hour.
     3. Complete anemia combined with stimulation of the sciatic
         nerve, and persistence, in situ, of the products of muscle-
         metabolism, the whole lasting one hour.
    After   each of these three varieties of anaemia the effects of active
congestion, and of venous obstruction, were separately considered.
    It was found that oedema occurs, as shown by a fall in the
specific gravity of the muscle and skin, and a rise in the specific
gravity of the blood, after all these conditions of aneemia, and the
author concludes, therefore, that starvation of the tissues plays an
important part in the occurrence of oedema.
    The amount. of oedema obtained, however, was found to be greater
in those cases in which the limb had been subjected to the action of
 venous blood, and the longer the action of the venous blood was
 allowed to obtain, the greater the amount of cedema. The author
 concludes that the presence of the products of tissue metabolism at

the site of their formation plays a part in the occurrence of oedema
even more important than that played by starvation.
   The greatest amount of oedema was obtained with venous obstruc
tion after anaemia and stimulation of the sciatic nerve.
   The author shows that stimulation of the nerve of a muscle
normally produces changes which lead to an absorption of water by
the muscle, and he concludes that the oedema which accompanies
passive congestion depends upon an excess of the normal process
whereby the nutrition of the tissues and the removal of the waste
products of their metabolism are carried out, the supply of lymph
being    excessive    only because      the demands      of the    tissues   are
excessive.
   The part played by the blood-vessels the author regards as some
what uncertain. Sharing in the general starvation of the limb, their
function must be modified in some as yet unrecognised way ; never
theless, he considers that the part played by them is subordinate to
the part played by the tissues outside the blood-vessels.

    On Copper       Electrolysis in Vacuo."            By WILLIAM GANNON,
          M.A., "1851 Exhibition" Scholar, Queen's College,
          Galway.     Communicated by Arthur Schuster, F.R.S.
          Received November 14, — Read December 7, 1893.
     The following research upon the electrolysis of copper sulphate in
 vacuo was commenced nearly two years ago, at the suggestion of
 Dr. Schuster, and the experiments were made in the Physical
 Laboratory of the Owens College.
     The electrolysis of copper salts is interesting, not only theoretically
 as affording a verification of Faraday's Law of Electrolytes, but also
  practically on account of its constant use in the graduation of current-
  measuring instruments, such as tangent galvanometers and ammeters.
  It is known that copper sulphate in solution does not conform
 rigorously to the simple form in which Faraday's law is generally
  expressed.     Gray,* who made a detailed examination of the electrolysis
  of copper sulphate, fonnd that the weight of the deposit is very
  variable in neutral solutions for the same current and the same
  interval of time ; and he also showed that, in solutions containing a
  little free sulphnric acid, this inconstancy was removed, but that the
  weight was a function of the temperature of the solution and of the
  current density at the cathode. His results with acid solutions are
  graphically represented by curves (partly reproduced at the end of
                     • ' Phil. Mag.,' vols. 22 and 25 (1880-88).

this paper), an inspection of which shows that the deposit is heavier
the   higher the current density and the lower the temperature.
(" Current density" is defined as the ratio of the value of the current
in amperes to the total immersed surface of the cathode plate.) A
very possible explanation of this anomaly is furnished by the work
of Gore* and Gray,t who independently found that copper dissolves
to a very appreciable, though variable, amount in solutions of copper
sulphate.
   The secondary chemical reactions which follow — chiefly the forma
tion of basic salts — complicate the electrolysis. This corrosion of
copper plates in the sulphate solution is much diminished if a little
free sulphuric acid is present, with the result that the electrolysis of
acid solutions yields more consistent results than are obtainable with
nearly neutral solutions.         Now, Schuster        J  found that the loss in
weight of copper plates in a solution of copper sulphate does not
occur if the air be removed from the solution.                It is therefore very
probable that it is the oxygen of the air present in the solution that
causes this chemical corrosion ; and hence it was of interest to
examine if any difference could be found between the weights of the
deposits of two copper voltameters, one of which would be placed in
vacuo.     Schuster and Crossley§ showed that the silver deposit is
slightly greater in vacuo than in air ; and the experiments tabulated
in this paper point out, with certain limitations, a similar result.
   The plan of these experiments was simple.                   The same current
passed through two voltameters connected in series, one being under
the ordinary atmospheric pressure and the other in a partial vacuum.
The voltameters, in most of the experiments, consisted of ordinary
glass beakers, containing the solutions of copper sulphate, into which
dipped three parallel copper plates of the same size, the centre one
acting as the cathode, and the side ones forming a double anode.
The plates were held in position by means of German silver clips
pressing against vertical brass supports which were attached to an
ebonite framework.        One voltameter was placed in an inverted bell-
jar, into the neck (lower part) of which was fitted an india-rubber
cork. Through the cork, which was coated with Faraday cement,
passed three glass tubes, one connected with an exhaust pump and
the remaining two containing the leads.                  In some of the experi
 ments another tube was introduced, through which was passed into
 the jar a stream of nitrogen gas previous to exhaustion ; but as this
 did not give any better results, it was discarded. At the bottom of the
 bell-jar inside was a support for the beaker, and on the latter rested

the framework with the three plates.       In addition to the voltameter,
the jar contained a small mercury gauge.        The upper rim of the jar
was ground, and previous to exhaustion was coated with grease,
upon which pressed a ground-glass plate.         The current was derived
from storage cells, and was measured by a tangent galvanometer or a
Thomson's magnetostatic centiamperemeter ; it was adjusted to the
proper value, and kept constant throughoat an individual experiment
by having in circuit a carbon rheostat and a set of specially prepared
resistances of different values.      The copper plates were made of
commercial sheet copper (24 B.W.G.) : they were cleaned with
emery paper, nitric acid, caustic potash, tap water, and, finally, dis
tilled water, and a deposit was laid on them before being weighed
for an actual experiment.        The deposit was treated in the way
recommended by Gray ; I found it advantageous to have the distilled
water hot, as on removing the plate the deposit dries more quickly,
and consequently the possibility of oxidation occurring is diminished .
The plates, after being in the balance case for a variable period —
never less than three hours, generally over night — were weighed on a
16-in. Oertling balance, which weighed accurately to 1 tenth-milli
gram.      The solutions were made by dissolving ordinary commercial
sulphate in distilled water and filtering ; the solutions with no free
acid added were used immediately, so as to conduct the electrolysis
before the formation of basic salts ; the acid solutions contained 1 per
cent, free sulphuric acid.     When all the joints were air-tight, by
being closed with cement, no difficulty was experienced in retaining
the partial vacuum constant throughout each individual experiment.
Leakage of the current at either voltameter was tested for throughout,
the experiments, and this point was considered satisfactory when,
both voltameters being under atmospheric pressure, the deposits did
not differ by more than 1 or 2 tenth-milligrams. Particular atten
tion was paid to the handling of the plates before and after each
experiment, especially in the replacing in, or removal from, their
clips. By means of a small rod, acting as a lever, friction was pre
vented between the clips and plates, and hence the slight danger of
loss of copper prevented.        Immediately     after the current was
stopped   in   each experiment, the framework holding the plates was
quickly removed from the solution and plunged into distilled water
so as to remove all solution from the plates — oxidation occurs very
rapidly if any solution remains on the plates, even for a very short
time.
    My first object was to ascertain if any difference in the weight of
the deposit was caused by placing one voltameter in vacuo, without
any special regard to the current density (which throughout all the
experiments was the same at both cathodes).            The experiments
arranged    in  Table I show  an  appreciable, though inconstant, differ

ence.     In ten experiments, with the sulphate solution containing no
free acid, nine gave a greater deposit in vacuo than in air, one giving
a negative difference.     In this experiment (February 18) the deposit
•was not of the usual colour, and it is possible it was oxidised.   Great
care was necessary in washing the vacuum deposit, as often the
copper was deposited in a loose form at and near the edges ; in the
experiments of March 17 and 18 a little of the vacuum deposit was
lost in drying between the folds of blotting paper.        It was not to
be expected that the experiments in this table would show very con
cordant results; as, even presuming that the deposit in vacuo is
constant, the inconstancy of deposits in air from neutral solutions
would cause an inconstant difference.
                                                I
   In order to get a constant deposit in air, next added acid to the
air solutions and compared the deposits from these with the deposits
from a neutral solution in vacuo.        Table  II includes experiments
conducted in this way : in the experiments of February 24 and 29
some of the vacuum deposit adhered to the blotting paper and was
lost.    I cannot account for the negative result of February 25. The
remaining experiments show fairly concordant differences.       It will be
observed from Tables        I and  II that, with the exception of those
experiments in which some of the deposit was mechanically lost, the
percentage difference is greater with acid solutions in air than with
 neutral solutions, which agrees with Gray's observations that the
 deposit (in air) in neutral solutions is generally higher than in acid
solutions.
    I  have brought together the experiments included in Table        III,
although the results are very inconsistent and puzzling.        It will be
 seen that, if the neutral solutions have been used in previous experi
 ments and acid added to them for a fresh experiment, the difference
 between the weights of the two deposits varies not only in amount
 but also in sign. An explanation of this may be that electrolysing a
 neutral solntion changes its chemical constitution, and that adding
 acid afterwards does not remove all basic salts. Accepting this possi
 ble explanation,   I abandoned for the present using neutral sulphate
 in either voltameter. In all the remaining experiments described in
 this paper, both solutions were freshly prepared, not previously used
 in any experiment, and contained 1 per cent, free sulphuric acid.
 The results    I  have obtained in this way are more concordant and
 very interesting.    A deposit obtained from a neutral solution in vacuo
 shows the same looseness in deposition as in air ; but the addition of
 a little free acid causes the copper to be deposited in a compact form,
 which is not liable to be lost in the washing or drying.

                       On Copper Electrolysis   in Vacuo.                 73
     The following tables are not arranged in the order in which the
  experiments were made.
    Table  IV  inclndes four experiments in which the current density
                                                                            "
 was   approximately 0'007 ampere per square centimetre of " active
 cathode, or 1 ampere to 135 sq. cm.          All the experiments gave the
 vacuum deposit higher than the air deposit, and the percentage differ
 ences agree fairly.      The mean value = 0"16 per cent, at a mean tem
 perature of 18°1.
    Table V includes three experiments in which the current density
 was 0-006 ampere per square centimetre.         It will be seen the vacnum
 deposit is higher than the air deposit in the three experiments. Mean
 value of difference = 010 per cent, at a mean temperature of 16°5.
   Table VI includes four experiments at a current density of
 0 005 ampere per
                        square centimetre.    Again the vacuum deposit is
 higher than the corresponding air deposit.        Mean value of difference
 = 0-14 per cent, at a mean                   of 17°'5.
                                 temperature
   Table   VII     includes five experiments at a cnrrent density of
0004 ampere per square centimetre.            All the vacuum deposits are
higher than the corresponding           air deposits.    Mean value of the
difference = 0'17 per cent, at a mean temperature of 19°.
   Table   VIII     includes  five experiments at a current density of
(J"0033  ampere per square centimetre.          Again deposit in vacuo is
higher than the deposit in air.       Mean value of difference = 0'14 per
cent, at a mean
                     temperature of 150-5.
   Table   IX    includes seven experiments at a current density of
0 0027 ampere per square centimetre.            The same results obtained
here as in the preceding tables ; but the experiments of April 12 and
13 do not agree very well with the others.         Mean value of difference
= 0'16 per cent, at a mean temperature of 160-6.
   Table X includes nine experiments in which the strength of curreut
was approximately 0-01 ampere per square centimetre.            This table is
very interesting,       as showing    that near this particular current
density the previously observed differences cease to exist.         The nine
experiments never gave a greater difference between corresponding
deposits than 1 tenth-milligram.           The voltameters were carefully
tested for leakage before and after these experiments ; and the
experiment    of April 7 (Table IX), in which there was a percentage
difference of 0'12, follows that of April 5, without any alteration in
the  arrangement of the apparatus.          In addition, the experiments of
December 2 and 3 were made         with a different bell-jar and a different
arrangement from that used in the previous experiments.            It may be
fairly concluded that at this density no difference in the deposit exists.
   Table  XI  includes three experiments at a density of 0-02 ampere
P«t square   centimetre.      It will be seen that there is practically no
difference between the deposits.

    Table  XII  includes three experiments at a density of O013 ampere
 per square centimetre.     The deposits show no difference in weight.
    It would thus appear that, at current densities above O'Ol ampere per
 square centimetre, there is practically no difference in weight of the
 deposits obtained from solutions of copper sulphate (made acid), one
 of which is under ordinary atmospheric pressure, and the other under
 reduced pressure ; but at densities below this there is a very appre
ciable difference, the deposit in a partial vacuum being always
greater than the corresponding deposit in air.        No experiment with
acid solutions ever gave the vacuum deposit less than the air deposit.
Why this difference should exist at certain densities and not at
others is not very clear.      The chemical corrosion above referred to
will be more marked in the air solutions at weak current densities,
where the duration of the experiments is three to four hours, but it
would not be expected that it would be altogether missing at densi
ties where the duration of the experiments is less than forty minutes
and less.
   My experiments do not completely reveal the cause of the relations
existing between the deposit and current density.            They clearly
show,   however,   that the oxygen present in the solution has a certain
diminutive action on the weight of the deposit, and that this action
is prevented (partly or wholly) by conducting the electrolysis in
vacuo.    The removal of the oxygen of the solution prevents the
copper plates, and more particularly the copper deposit, from dis
solving in the solution ; but it does not prevent (apparently) what
some physicists speak of as an electrical corrosion, which occurs only
when the current is passing through the solution.
   It is of interest to draw a curve representing the deposits obtained
in vacuo with different current densities.        This  I  have done by

reduced the observed differences to a temperature of 15* C., and then
calculated the values in vacuo.    The curve thus obtained is more
uniform in its course than the curves for air.

     The results of my experiments may be briefly summarised                                :   —
     1.     With two copper voltameters containing freshly                        made neutral
solution of copper sulphate, one of which is under reduced pressure,
the  copper deposit in the partial vacuum is higher (for the same
current, current density, and temperature) than the deposit under the
atmospheric pressure ; but the percentage difference is not constant.
  2. If a little free sulphuric acid be added to the air solution, the
percentage difference is more constant and higher than in 1.
  3. The addition of acid to both voltameters causes the percentage
difference to be constant within experimental errors.     The experi
ments conducted under this condition show that —
      i. For current densities above O'Ol ampere per square centimetre
          of active cathode, there is no practical difference between the
          two deposits.
     ii. For current densities below O'Ol ampere per squaro centimetre,
          the vacuum deposit       very appreciably higher than the air
                                        is
             deposit.

             and for densities below O'Ol ampere per square centimetre                                 is

84       Action of Copper Sulpluxte, fyc, on Metallic Copper.
" Note on the      Action of Copper Sulphate and Sulphuric Acid
      on Metallic Copper."         By Arthur Schuster, F.R.S. Re
       ceived November 14, — Read December 7, 1893.
   Mr. Gannon in the foregoing paper refers to some unpublished
experiments made by me a few years ago.                     These experiments
wore conducted for the purpose of satisfying myself that, as
seemed a priori probable, the diminution of weight observed when
metallic copper is exposed to the action of sulphuric acid or sulphate
of copper is due to the presence of free oxygen in the liquid.              Copper
gauze   was  taken  in order to  deal  with as  large  a surface  as  possible, and
rolled up so as to fit into a piece of glass tubing. After the copper had
been carefully washed, dried, and ignited in hydrogen, it was immersed
in dilute sulphuric acid, the air above the acid was removed as far as
possible, and the tube containing the gauze was then sealed hermeti
cally. At the end of a fortnight a few tubes prepared in this way
were opened and weighed after being subjected to exactly the same
treatment as previous to immersion, that is to say, the copper was
washed, dried, and ignited in hydrogen.- The diminution in weight
observed under these circumstances was insignificant.                I cannot, un
fortunately, now find the record of the actual weighings, but the
quantities involved were about the samo as in the next set of experi
ments.     On January 26, 1891, four spirals of copper gauze were placed
in a solution containing 20 per cent, of cnpric sulphate, 5 or 10
per cent, by weight of sulphuric acid being added to the aqueous
solution.     The conditions thus approximated to the solutions which
are used in the electrolysis of copper.             The tubes were exhausted
and scaled up : two of them were opened on February 2, and the two
remaining ones on February 9 ; the weighings were taken after drying
and ignition in hydrogen.         The results are shown in the accompany
ing table : —
        Time of           Amount of          Weight before      Weight after
       immersion.       sulphuric ucid.         immersion.       immersion.
         7  days         10 per cent.             17-512           17 510
         7   „            5      „                14-357           14356
        14   „           10      „                14267            14-265

    It will  be seen that the diminution       in weight is quite insignificant
 compared to what takes place in the presence of air, and may be due
 to some remnant of oxygen left.           The late Mr. Hoskyns Abrahall,
 however, suggested that it might also be due to the formation of
 copper sulphide ; and this suggestion was supported by the fact that
 traces  of sulphuretted hydrogen were given up when the copper, after

I. " Insect Sight      and the Defining Power of Composite Eyes."
        By A. Mallock.          Communicated by Lord Rayleigh,
        Sec. ft.S. Received November 28, 1893.
     The optical arrangement of the simple eyes of Vertebrates is well
 understood, but as regards the action of the composite eyes of Insects
 and Crustacea less certainty has hitherto prevailed.
     In the former class of eye a single lens, or its equivalent, forms an
 image on a concave retina, built up, as a sort of tesselated pavement,
 of the sensitive terminations of the fibres of the optic nerve, and, if
 the lens is perfect and the pupil large enough, the definition is limited
 by the distance apart of the nerve-terminations, for, in order that two
objects may appear as two to the eye, they must subtend at least such
an . jgle that their images as formed by the lens shall not fall on the
same nerve-termination.
     In the hnman eye the distance between the sensitive points on the
 retina is such that it subtends about a minute of arc at the optic
 centre of the lens, and in good eyes the optical part of the apparatus
 is sufficiently perfect to allow of this degree of definition being
 attained over a small part of the field of view.
     For reasons, however, which will be given presently, such defini
  tion as this is not to be looked for in composite eyes.
     The general plan on which all composite eyes are constructed is
  that of a convex retina having a separate small lens in front of each
  sensitive part, together with an arrangement of screens which allows

 only that light coming from the immediate neighbourhood of the axis
 of the lens to reach the nerve.
     The theory of " mosaic vision " put forward by Johannes Miiller
 has been opposed by some physiologists, who appear to have con
 sidered that each lens of a composite eye formed a complete image
  which was taken cognizance of by the nerves as in the vertebrate eye,
 and that the whole of these images were in some way added together
                                   I
 and arranged by the brain ; here hring forward some optical reasons
 which show that Miiller's view is the true one.
     On the supposition, therefore, of " one lens, one impression," the
 definition obtained by a composite eye will be measured by the total
 solid angle of view -f- whole number of lenses in the eye.
     The simplest form of composite eye would be a spherical shell,
 AB, fig.   1, perforated with radial holes,       c, c, c, the diameter of these
                                       Fig.  1.

 holes being small compared with the thickness of the shell.
    If sensitive paper were placed in contact with the inner surface of
 the shell, it would be impressed with a picture of surrounding objects,
 for the light which reaches the bottom of any hole is limited to that
making an angle less than £DEF with the axis of the hole, which
angle is of course equal to the diameter of the hole               half its length.
    It is interesting to see what proportions would have to be given to
an eye of this kind if the definition is to be as good as that of the
human eye.
    The limit of definition in this case being 1 min., the holes would have
to be 7000 diameters long (since 1 min. is nearly 1/3500) and in order
that diffraction may not interfere materially with the result,* the
   *  It may be shown that the hole should not be much smaller than the first
Huyghens zone of a system for which, if X/r = r/R, E = the length of the hole,
X and r being the wave-length of light and the radius of the zone respectively. How

   diameter  of the holes should not be less then 2000 wave-lengths of
  light,  say        in.     Hence the thickness of the shell will be
  7000 x       A
              in., or 23 ft.
     The radius of the sphere may be determined by the condition that,
  if the picture is to be continuous, the adjacent holes must just be in
  contact at the internal surface of the shell, that is to say the diameter
  of the hole, viz. : -Jj- in., must subtend 1 min. at the internal radius of
  the       which makes this radius, therefore, 11 ft. 6 in.
        shell,
    Thus an eye  of this construction and power of definition would
  consist of some part of a spherical shell of 34 ft. 0 ins. external
  radius,  and 23 ft. thick, perforated with radial holes          in. in
  diameter, and with their centres about         apart  on     J

 surface.
    If still keeping 1 min. as the limit of definition, we substitute the
 arrangement     actually found in composite eyes, and in place of the
 long tunnels in thick shell, we use short tunnels with a lens at the
 outer end of each tunnel, and a diaphragm at the inner end, pierced
 with a small central hole (fig. 2), the proportion of the eye will be

just define   1 min., and secondly by making that diameter subtend
 1 min. at the centre of the
                               sphere.
    Now the size of the image of a point formed by a lens (as seen
 from the optic centre of the lens) is inversely as the diameter of the
 lens, and it takes a lens 4 ins. in diameter to define 1 second, i.e., to
 separate points 1" apart ; hence the lens which will just define 1 min.
18     or 0'066 in. in diameter.
    The radius at which 0-066 in. subtends 1 min. is about 19 ft.
    It is evident, therefore, that no composite eye of practicable
dimensions, acting as supposed above, could be made to give defini
tion even approaching that of the human eye.
ranch   less  than r the diameter of the hole may be     to some extent, a matter of
                                                               is,

      If the diameter of the lenses is reduced, not only is the size of the
  sphere on which a given number of them would lie reduced, but,
  since the definition of each lens decreases with the diameter, a less
  number of lenses will be required to give the maximum definition
  attainable under the changed circumstances.         Thus the radius of the
  sphere proper    for  the  surface of a composite eye decreases as the
  square of the defining power of the separate lenses of which it is
  composed.
      Let A and B (fig. 2) be two adjacent lenses, C and D the sensitive
  spots of the retina.    Let 0 be the angle between the axes of A and B,
  and x *ne limit of definition of the lens.       Then, if x =   the image
  of a distant object in the axis of A will just fall clear of the sensitive
'
  point D, but, if x > both C and D will be illuminated by light from
  the same object.
      Supposing, however, x is less than 0, nothing will be gained in
  definition unless each lens has more than one sensitive point to
  operate on. If, then, we find that in actual composite eyes x and 0
  are nearly equal, that is, that the difference in the direction in which
  the adjacent lenses point is nearly equal to the defining power of the
  lens itself, it becomes almost certain that each lens has only one
  sensitive point behind it.
      The following table contains measures, recently made by me, of
  the diameters and angles between the axes of the lenses of various
  insect eyes, and, although the measure of the angle of view was
  necessarily rather rough, the agreement of the results, in the lai-ger
  number of cases, with the supposition above made seems to me
  sufficiently remarkable.
      In estimating 0 there were two difficulties, one of which was that
  in many eyes the curvature of the surface was sharp at the margin
  and that the definition was probably bad there, and another that the
  1 ine of sight of each lens was not always normal to the outer surface
  of the eye (fig. 3). Generally,    I  took the angle between the tangents

so that the surface outside it should have fairly uniform                                curvature.
The length of the chord was usually about three-quarters,                                or a little
more, of that of the eye.

    On the whole, I think it must be concluded that Insects do not see
 well, at any rate as regards their power of defining distant objects,
 and their behaviour certainly favours this view ; but they have an
 advantage over simple-eyed animals in the fact that there is hardly
 any practical limit to the nearness of the objects they can examine.
 With   the composite eye, indeed, the closer the object the better the
 sight, for the greater will be the number of lenses employed to pro
 duce the impression ; whereas in the simple eye the focal length
 of the lens limits the distance at which a distinct view can be
 obtained.
    The best of the eyes mentioned in the table would give a picture
 about as good as if executed in rather coarse wool-work and viewed
 at a distance of a foot ; and, although a distant landscape could only
 be indifferently represented on such a coarse-grained structure, it
 would do very well for things near enough to occupy a considerable
 part of the field of view .
II.  " The Action of Heat upon Ethylene." By VmAN B. LEWES.
       Professor of Chemistry in the Royal Naval College, Green
       wich.      Communicated         by Professor            THORPE, F.R.S.
       Received December        6,  1893.
    The decompositions of the simpler forms of hydrocarbons at an
elevated temperature have always been recognised as a question of the
greatest importance, as upon them is dependent a true conception of
many of the actions taking place in the manufacture of coal gas and
other kindred processes of destructive distillation.
   Ethylene has in most cases been chosen as the hydrocarbon which
wonld lend itself most readily to experimental researches upon this
point, as, besides being one of the simplest, it is easily prepared, and
is moreover found as one of the products in nearly all cases where
organic compounds are subjected to distillation at high temperatures.
   No sooner had the difference between ethylene and methane been
recognised, than experiments were made by Deimann, Van Troostwyk,
Lauwerenburg, and Bondt* to ascertain the action of heat upon the
newly-formed compound, and the conclusions which they came to
were that on heating no contraction in volume was observed, but that
the tubes in which the decomposition was effected became coated
with a black deposit, and drops of an oily body were formed, the gas

at the same time losing its property of forming an oily liquid with
chlorine.
    These experiments were afterwards repeated by Fourcroy, Hecht,
and Vauquelin,* who showed that when heated, ethylene yields
hydrogen with deposition of carbon, whilst in 1805 William Henryf
showed that ethylene was formed during the destructive distillation
of organic bodies, and that on further heating the gas, other changes
were observed, and the gas was eventually converted into carbon and
                                                                     J
hydrogen. The deposition of carbon was also noticed later by Qaet, who
on passing sparks through ethylene found that carbon was deposited,
and formed a bridge between the poles used for the discharge, whilst
Dalton showed by the continuous action of the electric spark that
ethylene yielded double its own volume of hydrogen, carbon being
deposited.
   Marchand§ came to the conclusion that at a red heat this gas splits
up into methane and carbon, but at a white heat into carbon and
nearly pure hydrogen, whilst Magnus, in 1847, made the important
observation that on leading ethylene through a red-hot tube a con
traction in volume followed ; the residual gas consisted of methane,
hydrogen, and unchanged ethylene, whilst carbon was deposited, and
fluid and even solid hydrocarbons were obtained.
   In 1860 H. Buff and A. W. Hofmann|| published a paper on the
   Dissociation of Gaseous Compounds on Heating by Electricity."
   They found that when a platinum spiral is heated by the galvanic
current in pare ethylene there is at once a visible separation of
carbon, which covers the sides of the tubes with a black deposit,'
whilst hardly any expansion in the volume of the gas takes place,
from which they assume that the ethylene has split up into methane
and carbon.
   If the action on the gas, due to the incandescent platinum wire, is
allowed to continue, then an increased amount of the gas undergoes
dissociation, and soon after the separation of carbon commenced, they
observed an expansion which is rapid at first, and in ten minutes
reaches a maximum. Similar phenomena were noticed with the spark
current ; at first the spark had a pale reddish tint which gradually
turned to violet, immediate separation of carbon taking place, the spark
being frequently stopped by scales of carbon which formed a bridge
between the poles. They found that under these conditions the volume
of gas expands very rapidly at first but afterwards more slowly,
and that after twenty to twenty-five minutes, the point of niaxi-

mum expansion is reached, so that 7 c.c. of dry ethylene gave, after
decomposition, 12"25 c.c. They noted also that the residual hydrogen
had an unpleasant smell, and burnt with a slightly luminous flame.
   Berthelot,* in 1869, claims that ethylene breaks up under the
influence of heat into acetylene and hydrogen, as expressed by the
equation
                                 C2H4  = C2H:t-r-H2,
 and shows that the acetylene then polymerises into benzene, styrene,
and other liquid products of higher boiling points. Naphthalene was
also formed by the direct condensation of styrene and acetylene. He
also points out that during the heating of ethylene a large propor
tion of ethane was formed, and his final conclusion is that the heating
of ethylene results in the splitting up of 2 mols. of ethylene into
acetylene and ethane, and that the formation of solid and liquid pro
ducts is due to the subsequent condensation of the acetylene.
   In 1886f Day made a number of experiments in order to determine
the lowest point of temperature at which the constitution of ethylene
undergoes alteration, and the nature of the changes taking place at
that temperature.          In order to do this, he devised an ingenious ap
paratus   in   which the ethylene could be heated for very long periods
in a hard-glass tube. From these experiments he concluded that
when the action is continued over a long period the gas undergoes
change at much lower temperatures than had been previously ob
served. The alteration in constitution commences at about 350° C,
at which temperature the change is one of condensation without the
formation of members of any series of hydrocarbons having a per
centage of hydrogen and carbon different from ethylene, whilst if
ethylene is maintained at 400° for a sufficient length of time, it is
 entirely decomposed, marsh gas, ethane, and liquid products being
obtained.
    In the same year Messrs. Morton and NojesJ made an elaborate
 investigation with the object of determining whether crotonylene,
 C4H4, which is present in small quantities in illuminating gas and
 other products of the distillation of organic matter, is formed as a
 primary product of decomposition by heat, or as a secondary product
 of the action of heat upon ethylene.
    Coal gas was passed slowly through a hard glass tube 15 mm. in
 diameter, which was maintained at a low red heat for a distance of
60 cm.     The products issuing from this tube were first passed
 through a series of \J -tubes surrounded by a freezing mixture ; the
 products which were not condensed were passed through an am-
 moniacal solution of cuprous chloride, to absorb hydrocarbons of the

acetylene   series, whilst samples of the gases escaping absorption were
finally collected   over water.   Carbon was deposited in the decomposi
tion tube, and at the end of one month 15 c.c. of liquid had been
slowly condensed in the (J -tabes, and in this liquid they detected
benzene, naphthalene, anthracene,' and some other aromatic hydro
carbons, present in quantities too small for determination.         Faint
traces only of precipitate were found in the ammoniacal cuprous
chloride solution, whilst among the bodies absorbed by bromine they
identified crotonylene tetrabi-omide, and the gas collected over water
proved to be a mixture of methane and ethane.             The absence of
acetylene from the products obtained led them to the view that these
products are formed directly by the action of heat upon ethylene.
   From the work of the earlier observers, the text-books have
accepted the equation
                            1.   C,H<  = C,+2Ha
as  representing the decomposition which takes place at a very high
temperature, whilst, on the evidence of the work done by Marchand,
and Buff and Hofmann, they represent the change taking place at a
lower temperature by the equation
                            2.   C8H4  = C + CH,.
 During   my attempts to trace the actions taking place in the inner
zone   of luminous flames,     I  was struck by the complexity of the
changes, and the absence of any evidence which would tend to con
firm the second equation, and       I have made the experiments detailed
in the following paper in the hope of being able to trace the decom
 position effected by heat in such simple hydrocarbons as ethylene,
ethane, and methane.
   The first step was to make experiments to corroborate the state
ment made by Day that, if ethylene is heated at 400° C. for a sufficient
length of time, it is entirely decomposed, with formation of methane,
ethane, and liquid products.
   In order to do this an apparatus of the form used by Day in his
experiments was employed, the only difference being that instead of
 niing an air thermometer, the temperature was taken by means of a
 platinum and    platinum-rhodium couple — as introduced by LeChatelier,
and fully described by Mr. C. Roberts-Austen — which had been pre
 viously carefully calibrated, employing salts of known fusing points.
 The ethylene was prepared for this and for all the following experi
 ments by making a mixture of 25 parts by weight of rectified methyl
 ated spirit and 150 parts of strong sulphuric acid.     The mixture was
 heated in a flask containing a layer of sand, and the gas evolved was
 washed by contact with strong           sulphuric acid, and by passage
 through several bottles containing a strong solution of caustic soda.
 The gas was stored in a glass gas-holder for several days over water

The gas was then passed through the combustion tube, until it was
considered that all air had been displaced, and the tube was main
tained for 100 hours at 400° C. Oil and a very small quantity of
carbon deposited in the tube, and the volume decreased from 100
to 61. The gas was then removed from the tube and analysed.
    In all the analyses described in this paper the following procedure
was adopted. Carbon dioxide was absorbed by means of a 50 per
cent, solution of sodic hydrate, the oxygen estimated by absorption
with alkaline pyrogallate, the unsaturated hydrocarbons next ab
sorbed by means of a solution of bromine in potassium bromide, care
being taken to remove bromine vapour from the gas by agitation with
caustic soda before measurement, the carbon monoxide was next
estimated by acid cuprous chloride, and after removal of any acid
fumes the residual gas was treated with paraffin oil, previously
prepared for use by heating it over a water-bath for at least an
hour.
    Experiments show that in the case of mixtures of methane with
higher members of the same group, agitation with paraffin prepared
in this way, or mere standing in contact with it with occasional agita
tion for twenty to thirty minutes, will remove the ethane and any
higher saturated hydrocarbons which may be present, together with
a small proportion of the methane.      The amount of residual methane
can then be determined by explosion with oxygen, and subsequent
estimation of the carbon dioxide formed, the volume of gas absorbed
by the paraffin plus the volume resulting from explosion giving the
total volume of saturated hydrocarbons.       Details of the results ob
tained by this method of procedure when dealing with gaseous
mixtures of known composition will be found, ' Jour. Soc. Chem.
Industry,' vol. 10, p. 407.

 the oxides of carbon and increase on the nitrogen showing that
 some   air had remained in the tube.
    A second analysis was now made, but instead of estimating the
 saturated hydrocarbons by first absorbing the higher members and
 some methane by paraffin, they were exploded with oxygen, and the
 methane calculated from the carbon dioxide amounted to 112-5 per
 cent., showing that ethane and probably even higher members of the
 series were present, results which fully bear out the statement
 made by Day as to the decomposition of the ethylene taking place at
 a temperature of 400°  C,  and also the statements made by Berthelot
 and by Day, that under the conditions of this experiment ethane or
at any rate higher members of the CiHm+j series are formed as well
as methane.
    It would, however, be manifestly wrong to assume that the forma
tion of the higher paraffins was a primary action, as keeping the
 hydrocarbons formed by the primary changes at a temperature of
400° C. might easily lead to the formation of secondary products by
 interaction between the gases.
    It seemed much more probable that the character of the primary
 decompositions would be ascertained by rapidly heating the gas, and
 as  rapidly removing the products of decomposition from the influence
 of heat, and that this would be effected by passing a regular current
of the gas through a very narrow tube heated for 140 mm. to a known
 temperature.
    The necessity for heating this tube to temperatures above 1000° C.
practically limited the choice of material of which it could be made
to fire-clay or platinum. It was at first feared that the use of the
latter might interfere with the changes taking place, but a long
series of comparative experiments, in which ethylene was decomposed
by passing through (a) a pipe-stem glazed with borax, and (b) a
platinum tube 2 mm. in diameter, both being heated to the same
temperature, showed that the platinum tube was free from experi
mental objection unless a considerable percentage of oxygen was
present, and that, even with a new tnbe, the decompositions were of
the same nature as when the pipe-stem was employed.
    Under these conditions the platinum tube possessed so many
advantages over the clay pipe that in all the subsequent experiments
a platinum tube, 2 mm. in diameter and about 40 cm. in length, was
used, and, in order to accurately measure the temperature to which
the gas in the tube was heated, the following arrangement was
devised : —
    Ethylene was stored in a gas-holder, and, after passing over calcic
chloride to dry it, entered the platinum tube.        In this tube the
platinum and the platinum-rhodium thermo-couple was arranged in
the following fashion : —

    The two wires are twisted together for a length of 3 mm., and the
wires on either side of the twist are then passed through thin glass
tubes, which are fused on to them ; having been in this way coated
with glass so that only the twist is exposed, they are passed through
the platinum tube, the glass insulating the wire from the tube, and
also keeping the thermo-junction in such a position that it registers
the temperature of the gas in the tube, not that of the wall of the
tube.
    To each end of the platinum tube glass "|"-piece8 are fitted, down
the stems of which the wires pass to mercury seals ; from the metal
seals    conducting wires lead to the resistance coils, the key, and a
reflecting galvanometer.      The products, after leaving the platinum
tube, pass through a \J -tube, cooled in ice and salt in order to con
dense any liquids, and then through a collecting tube, from which the
sample of gas for analysis for gas is taken, thence to Volhard ab
sorption flasks (containing ammoniacal silver nitrate for the estima
tion of acetylene), the flow of the gas through the apparatus being
regulated by means of the aspirator bottle.
     In the following set of experiments the ethylene, after purification
 from oxygen by standing over a dilute solution of sodic pyrogallate
 and sodic hydrate, was passed through the tube at the rate of about
 10 c.c. per minute.
     These experiments are of considerable interest, as they throw
 some light upon the changes taking place during the heating of
 ethylene.
     The gas being passed through 140 mm. of heated tube, no change
 takes place until a temperature of 800° C. is reached, when traces
 of acetylene are observed ; between 800° and 900° C. the acetylene
 increases in quantity, and large quantities of methane are gene
 rated, accompanied by liquid products.      This action increases until
 just below 1200° C, when hydrogen begins to appear amongst
 the products of decomposition, whilst the moment the liberation of
 hydrogen commences, carbon also is deposited ; and the formation of
 011   decreases until close upon 1500° C, when the decomposition of
 the ethylene is practically complete, and the products of decompo
 sition are mainly hydrogen with some undecomposed methane, and a
 copious deposit of carbon.
     In each experiment the products of decomposition were examined to
 see if any member of the C»H2n+, group other than methane was
 present, and in no case could any be detected. This seems to point
 strongly to the conclusion that the ethane formed in the previous
 experiment, in accordance with the experiments of Day and Ber-
 thclot, had its origin as a secondary, and not as a primary, product
  of decomposition, but it was clear that to determine this point other
  experiments must be made, to see if under these conditions of tern

saturated hydrocarbons higher than methane.
   In order to do this, the same arrangement of apparatus was em
ployed, but the rate of flow of ethylene was diminished to 4-2 c.c. per
minute, the gas, after heating, being collected as before, and an
analysis made in which the saturated hydrocarbons were calculated
from the results of the paraffin absorption and subsequent explosion.
A second analysis was then made of the heated gas without any
paraffin absorption, and the volume of carbon dioxide formed on
explosion calculated as methane. If the volume so obtained is found
to be greater than that originally given by the combined paraffin
absorption and subsequent explosion, it is held to be evidence' that
some higher member of the paraffin series must be present.                      In order
to ascertain if any unsaturated hydrocarbon                     other than ethylene is
present in the gas after heating, a sample of the gas is exploded
with oxygen, and the carbon dioxide estimated ; should the amount
formed exceed the carbon dioxide calculated from the second analysis,
it may be taken as evidence that an unsaturated hydrocarbon higher
than ethylene is present.

   In the same way a small trace of some unsaturated hydrocarbon,

   The next step was to see if the action of heat upon ethane under

   These results show that, even below 900° C, ethane decomposes
with liberation of hydrogen and formation of unsaturated hydro
carbons, which on examination prove to consist of ethylene with
small quantities of acetylene, rise of temperature completing this
decomposition, and also causing the ethylene to decompose as before.
   It is evident that, if ethane had been a primary product in the
decomposition of ethylene, it would in turn have decomposed with
liberation of hydrogen at or below 900° C, and hydrogen would have
been found at that temperature as a product of the decomposition of
the ethylene instead of its appearance being coincident with the
deposition of carbon at 1200° C.
   The fact that with a rapid flow              I  was unable to detect a trace of
free hydrogen until carbon has begun to deposit, or vice versd, shows
the fallacy of the text-book equation
                                  C2H4   =— CH4+C,
and on examining the evidence upon which the statement is based we
find that Marchand,* who originated it, passed ethylene through glass

products by passing them over heated copper oxide, and estimating
the carbon dioxide and water vapour formed. At first the proportion
of carbon to hydrogen was 100 to 17'236, which corresponds to
nearly pure ethylene, and on heating to a higher temperature the
ratio altered to 100 carbon to 30771 hydrogen, which nearly
corresponds to methane, carbon being at the same time deposited ;
but this is manifestly no proof of the gas being methane, as a mixtnre
of nndecomposed ethylene and hydrogen, or mixtures of ethylene,
methane, and hydrogen, such as those formed at 1200° C, would give
the same result.
   His results were to a certain 1 extent confirmed by Buff and
Hofmann, who noticed that when the platinum spiral was heated in
pure ethylene there was at once a deposition of carbon, whilst the
gas scarcely expands, from which they concluded that methane had
been formed at the same time.            When, however, the experiments
tabulated in Table    I  are examined, it will be seen that as soon as
1200° C. is reached and carbon is deposited expansion takes place ;
but that at all temperatures short of that there is contraction due
to some of the gaseous products undergoing polymerisation and
yielding liquids.       In Buff and Hofmann's experiment the gas in
contact with the incandescent wire was decomposed with liberation of
hydrogen and separation of carbon ; but the expansion caused by
this action happened to be nearly equalised by the contraction due to
polymerisation in the less heated portions of the gas.
   The simultaneous appearance of carbon and hydrogen indicates
clearly the liberation being due to the splitting up of a hydrocarbon,
and the proportion in which these elements are liberated point to
acetylene as being the body concerned.
   In a paper read before the Chemical Society*             I showed that in the
interior of a luminous flame the olefines are to a great extent con
verted into acetylene, which decomposes at about 1200° C. with
liberation of carbon, which, being heated partly by its own combus
tion and partly by the combustion of methane and hydrogen, becomes
incandescent, and gives luminosity to tho flame, and in the experi
ments which      I  have described      I   fully expected to find a higher
percentage of acetylene ; but the great tendency towards polymerisa
tion which that body exhibits seems to at once determine its conversion
into benzene, which can readily be distinguished among the liquid
products, whilst a number of other more complex hydrocarbons are
produced, among which crystals of naphthalene are conspicuous.
   In order to ascertain if the behaviour of acetylene when passed
through the heated tube under the conditions of these experiments
gave results which support this view, acetylene was prepared by the
action of dilute hydrochloric acid on acetylide of copper.

showing that even under these conditions nearly three quarters of the
acetylene had undergone polymerisation, so that it is probable that in
the case of nascent acetylene, liberated from ethylene by the action
of heat, the condensation of    the acetylene molecules to form benzene
would be practically instantaneous, unless the temperature were
sufficiently high to cause dissociation to carbon and hydrogen at the
moment of liberation.
  The unsaturated hydrocarbons consisted chiefly of ethylene with
some benzene vapour, the ethylene probably having been formed by
the direct combination of acetylene and hydrogen, an interaction first
noticed by Berthelot,

This also accounts for the small quantity of free hydrogen found on
analysis, which, having regard to the amount of carbon deposited,
should have been considerably higher.
  It will be noticed that with the rate of flow employed in the ex
periments shown in Table I, the largest amount of acetylene found
in the gas after heating was 3'60, which occurs just at the tempera
ture when carbon begins to deposit freely, and is therefore sufficiently

high to check the polymerisation of the acetylene, and many attempts
were made to find conditions under which the acetylene could be
liberated and prevented from polymerising, and it was found that                           •
this could apparently be, to a certain extent, effected either by dilut
ing the ethylene with a considerahle volume of an inert gas, or else
increasing the rate of flow through the heated tube.
    On passing a mixture of 75 per cent, hydrogen and 25 per cent,
ethylene through the tube, heated as before, 3'43 per cent, of acetylene
was produced, which would be equivalent to 13-72 on the ethylene
present, whilst the following results show the effect of increasing
the ^ate of flow of the gas through the tube. The original gas taken
was a had sample containing 87'49 per cent, of ethylene and 12 51 of

    Before it was possible to trace the primary action taking place
during the heating of ethylene, it was necessary to find how the
temperatures and methods               I was employing affected pure methane,
which plays so important a part amongst the products of decom
position.
    Methane was prepared by acting on methyl iodide by means of the
 copper zinc couple in the presence of alcohol and water.

    These results show how much more stable methane is under the in
fluence of heat than any of the other gaseous hydrocarbons studied.
    It probably decomposes at first into acetylene and hydrogen,
according to the equation
                             2CH4    = CaH,+ 3H„
and then the acetylene either polymerises or decomposes to carbon
and hydrogen, according to the temperature.
    These results also explain why it is that the flame of methane
 when burning at an open tube is practically non-luminous, as, under
 these conditions, the maximum temperature of the flame is below
 1100° C, and no formation of acetylene takes place ; whilst with
increase of temperatnre the flame becomes rapidly more and more
 luminous, so that when burnt in a regenerative burner at 1500° C.
 the light emitted is of considerable illuminating value.
    As a further step in securing factors by which to trace the decom
 position, it seemed advisable to attempt to trace the action of heat
 npon the benzene vapour formed by the polymerisation of the acetyl
 ene ; and in order to do this, pure hydrogen was allowed to pass
 through benzene at a known rate and a constant temperature, the
 amount of benzene in the gas being determined.

  which shows that the diluted benzene breaks down to acetylene,

 reaction on heating ethylene is the splitting up of 3 mols. into
acetylene and methane,

and that these compounds, by further polymerisation and interac
tions amongst themselves, of the kind studied by Berthelot and
Carnelley,* give rise to a large number of others. As the temperature
rises, the methane formed in the primary action splits up into acetyl
ene and hydrogen,
                           2CH4     = C2HJ+3H1;
and when the temperature has reached the decomposing point of the
acetylene, which varies with the degree of dilution, polymerisation
takes place no longer, but the acetylene splits up directly into carbon
and hydrogen, and all the products formed at lower temperatures
doing the same thing, the final reaction is
                            CH4 = Ca+2H,.
An attempt was now        made     how far analytical results would
                                   to    see
quantitatively bear out the inferences deduced from the foregoing
experiments.
  To do this, the method adopted was as follows : — The whole ap
paratus was filled with ethylene. The platinum tube and condensing
tube were weighed, and the amount of ethylene in the gas holder
measured. The platinum tube was heated to the required tempera
ture, and the gas aspirated through it at a uniform rate of 4'2 c.c.
per minute. When sufficient gas had passed throagh (about 250 c.c.)
the stopcocks were turned off, and the amount of gas left in the
holder measured. The amount of water displaced from the aspirator
was also measured, and in this manner the change in volume was
determined.    The tube was again weighed, and the gain in weight
noted. The platinum tube was also weighed, and then slowly heated
to dull redness in a stream of hydrogen, in order to drive off any oil
that might have been condensed in              it,
                                      and again weighed.    The tube
was now heated to bright redness in     stream of oxygen,
                                                  a       in  order to
burn off carbon, and again weighed. The sample tube was closed,
and the contents analysed the acetylene in the absorption bottles
                               ;
was also determined in the usual way.
   Ethylene was first heated to 700—800° C, but no acetylene was
formed, no alteration in volnme took place, and the gas seemed
unacted upon.
   The temperature was then raised to 800 — 900° C, and the following
results obtained.

III. " An     Instrument for grinding Section-plates and Prisms
       of Crystals of Artificial Preparations accurately in the
       desired directions."      By A. E. Tutton, Assoc. R.C.S.,
      Demonstrator      of Chemistry at the Royal College of
       Science, South Kensington. Communicated by Professor
       THORPE, F.R.S.     Received January 11, 1894.
                                (Abstract.)
    This instrument has been devised in order to replace by a method
of precision the difficult, wearisome, and, at the best, only approxi
mate current method of grinding by hand, upon a slightly convex
plate of ground glass lubricated with oil or a solvent, the section-
plates and prisms of the relatively soft and fragile crystals of arti
ficial preparations which are required for the determination of the
optical constants. It is possible by means of it to grind and polish
a truly plane surface in any desired direction in a crystal accurately
to within ten minutes of arc, an amount of possible error which
would exercise no appreciable influence upon the values of the optical
constants. This result may be achieved in a small fraction of the
time hitherto required by the most successful hand-grinding, and,
owing to the provision of a delicate arrangement for suitably modi
fying the pressure with which the crystal bears upon the grinding
plane, with only the very slightest risk of fracturing even a friable
crystal.    An arrangement is, moreover, provided by which a second
surface may be ground parallel, with a like degree of accuracy, to
the first.    The sections and prisms furnished by the instrument
possess the further advantage of being, so highly polished as to enable
them to be employed directly without cemented cover-glasses for the
determination of the optic axial angle and refractive indices, and the
values of these constants derived from them are no longer only ap
proximate but precise.
    A short but relatively wide hollow cone, differing but slightly from
a cylinder, is rigidly supported vertically above a heavy base by three
stout pillars and a triangular cross-plate.        Within it rest three
movable inner axes.      The first carries at its upper end a horizontal
circle divided into half degrees, reading, with the aid of a vernier, to
 minutes, and provided with a fine adjustment ; the axis and circle
are capable of rotation by a milled ebonite disc carried at the lower
 extremity of the former.     The bore of this axis is cylindrical, and
 within it the second axis is capable of vertical motion, rotation in the
socket being prevented by a rib and groove. The weight of this
second axis and all that it carries may be wholly or partially counter
balanced by a pair of levers whose fulcrum supports rest upon the

 1894.]      Section-plates and Prisms of Artificial Crystals.       109
circle-plate, whose power-arms are weighted, and whose short, curved
arms terminate in blnnt knife edges which press upwards against a
collar fixed to the axis. The levers may be thrown out of action
¦when desired, and the weight of the axis added to by placing small
shot or weights in a brass cup carried at the upper end of the axis.
This arrangement enables the weight above the crystal to be modi
fied to any extent. Within the second axis slides without rotation
the third one, which carries at its lower end the crystal and its means
of adjustment. The upper portion of this axis is tapped with a fine
screw thread, and the axis can' be raised or lowered by a correspond
ing milled nut. A collimator and telescope, arranged in a horizontal
plane at a suitable height for observing the crystal, are provided ;
they are movable over circular guiding arcs, whose centre lies in
the vertical axis of the instrument.      Just below the plane of the
optical tubes the horizontal grinding disc is supported in a friction-
less bearing carried by an adjustable tripod.     It is capable of rota
tion by a suitable whirling apparatus arranged equally on each side
of the axle so as to minimise the strain of the band. The disc is of
moderately finely-ground, truly plane plate-glass, suitably mounted in
a brass frame, and lies upon a second, from which it is readily de
tachable, so finely ground as to be almost transparent, and which is
employed exclusively for giving a final polish to the surface ground
by the removable disc. The grinding is under best control when the
driving pulley, which is provided with a suitable handle, is rotated
 by hand, each revolution producing two revolutions of the grinding
disc.
   The means of adjusting the crystal so that any desired direction in
it may be brought perpendicular to the grinding surface are afforded
by two circular motions in the form of movable segments rotated by
tangent screws, which, in addition to a pair of centering movements,
are carried at the lower extremity of the inner vertical axis, and the
common centre of which is occupied by the crystal.        These circular
movements are graduated to read directly to degrees, and easily by
estimation to ten minutes.     Two interchangeable pairs of them are
provided ; the planes of motion of one pair are fixed at right angles,
while the planes of the other pair, designed for use in more compli
cated cases of symmetry, may be adjusted at any desired angle to
each other by means of a small graduated horizontal circle carried by
one of them.
   The crystal is attached to the small cross-grooved disc of the
crystal holder by a hard and rapidly-Betting wax. It is adjusted so
that the zone of faces perpendicular to which it is desired to grind a
surface, if such a zone is developed, is parallel to the vertical axis.
If such a zone is not present, as will happen in monoclinic and tri-
clinic crystals, a prominent zone, whose position with respect to the

110      Instrument  for grinding  Section-plates of Crystals.   [Feb. 1,
principal directions of optical elasticity is known from goniometrical,
stauroscopical, and convergent light observations, is first adjusted,
parallel to the axis and with one or two pairs of faces parallel to one
or both of the planes of circular motion, and subsequently by move
ment of one or both of the segments over the calculated arc or arcs,
the desired direction can be adjusted accurately perpendicular to the
grinding disc.      Provision for setting any face exactly parallel to
a circular motion is provided in a special crystal holder which per
mits of the requisite amount of rotation after the holder is fixed in its
socket. The grinding disc is lubricated with a mobile oil incapable
of attacking the crystal, so that the reference faces may be preserved
for checking the adjustment after grinding.       The crystal is brought
down near to the grinding disc by lowering the inner axis, and it is
then lowered into contact with the disc and the pressure with which
it bears during the grinding regulated by manipulation of the levers.
   For grinding the parallel surface the crystal, mounted by its
ground surface upon a very small glass disc, is enclosed in a recep
tacle for it in a special crystal holder consisting of two parts screwed
together, the crystal downwards so as to pass through a central
aperture in the lower portion in which the disc is supported by a
very thin annulus.      The broad under surface of the upper portion of
the holder, against which the glass disc is pressed when the two
parts are screwed together, is made trnly plane, and can be adjusted
accurately parallel to the grinding disc.         The disc and crystal
may    be  removed   from  time  to time during the grinding without
disturbing the adjustment, so that grinding may be stopped when
the section exhibits small rings in its interference figure. Half an
hour is ample for grinding and polishing the two surfaces, and it is
unusual to break a crystal, provided the left hand is used to control
the nearest lever, and thus ascertain by the delicate sense of touch
how the crystal is supporting the strain, when the lever may be
manipulated, almost involuntarily, accordingly.
   Prisms are quite as readily ground and polished. It is possible
in most cases to grind two surfaces symmetrically inclined to a plane
of optical elasticity and with the edge of intersection parallel to an
axis of optical elasticity, by suitable adjustment of the crystal with
the aid of the movements provided and with reference to existing
faces.

       municated by Professor Thorpe, F.R.S. Received January
       11,   1894.
                                    (Abstract.)
    This instrument      enables the whole field of any optical instrument
 whose     aperture  does not exceed 2 ins. to be evenly and brightly
 illuminated    with monochromatic light of any desired wave-length.
 It  has been    devised especially for use in connexion with the axial
angle     polariscopical goniometers, spectrometers, stanroscopes, micro
scopes, and other instruments employed for the investigation           of the
optical properties of crystals, but is capable of much more extensive
application.      It was suggested by the apparatus described by Abney
 ('Phil. Mag.,' 1885, vol. 20, p. 172), but differs from that arrange
ment in most of its details, and particularly in the employment of a
fixed instead of a movable exit slit, of a rotatory instead of a fixed
dispersing apparatus, which is capable of accurate graduation for the
passage of rays of definite wave-lengths        through the exit slit, and in
the manner of utilising the issuing          line of monochromatic light,
which, instead of being directed upon an opaque white screen, is
diffused so as    to be evenly distributed over the field of the observing
instrument when that instrument is placed directly in its path.
    The instrument resembles a compact spectroscope in appearance,
and is constructed to pass a large amount of light.         Upon a strong
stand, furnished       with levelling screws, a fixed horizontal circle,
carrying     a  vernier,   is supported.    About this circle two exactly
similar optical tubes are capable of counterpoised rotation ; they
carry at the ends nearest the centre of rotation corrected lens combin
ations of 2 ins. aperture and only 9 ins. focal length, and at the
other ends a special form of slit, capable of accurate adjustment to the
foci of the lenses by rack and pinion movement.          Tbe lenses of each
combination are not cemented together by balsam, but are held in
metal    frames,   separated by a small air-space, so that they cannot be
injured by the heat rays from a powerful source of light, and no
alum cell is required.        The slit-jaws are capable of equal movement
on each side of the central line, so that, however wide the aperture, its
centre remains fixed.        They may also be removed altogether and re
placed by a slider carrying two or three slits whenever it is desired to
ise composite    light ;  upon replacement they are made to fall exactly into

 their former places, so that their adjustment is unimpaired.           A large
width of slit,   1 in., is provided for use when imperfectly transparent
 crystals are under observation whose dispersion of the optic axes for
 different colours is small, so that a slight curvature of the lines of
 light vibrating with the same wave-length is immaterial ; but stops

                 \
 which are intended for general nse, and furnish lines apparently
 perfectly straight.     Above and parallel with the fixed circle a second
 one, which is divided and carries the dispersing apparatus, is capable
 of rotation.    The latter consists of a single 60° prism with trnly
 worked and specially large faces,        4c\
                                           ins. by   2|  ins., in order to fully
 utilise the light from the 2-in. objective. A single prism               is  of
 advantage for the purpose in view, affording more light and the
 minimum curvature of spectral lines in order that the dispersion
                                                ;
 shall not suffer thereby, the prism            isconstructed of dense glass
possessing the highest dispersion compatible with perfect freedom
 from colour, and which will enable the whole of the visible spectrum
to be brought between the edges of the exit slit by rotation of the
 prism without materially sacrificing light by reflection.
    As the optical tubes are exactly similar, either may be chosen as
 collimator.    To a tapped annnlus projecting from the slit frame             of
 the one chosen the carrier of an adjustable mirror          is   attached, and
 sunlight  reflected   along the  axis of the  tube.    The other optical tube
is  then converted into a telescope by the similar attachment of one
 of three provided eyepieces, which are constructed to focus the edges
 of the slit immediately in front.         The clearly-defined edges thus
serve the purpose of a pair of cross-wires between which any solar
line may be adjusted.           By arranging the prism and telescope so
 that the beginning of the ultra-violet         isadjusted centrally for mini
mum deviation,    it   is possible by rotation of the prism to bring the
whole of the spectrum past the exit slit. The readings of the prism
circle are then taken for the positions when prominent solar lines are
adjusted between the closely-approximated             edges of the slit, and
these readings supplemented by those for the red lithium and green
thallium lines, and the whole expressed in a table and by a curve.
The mirror and eyepiece are then removed.
    Upon illuminating the receiving slit with any artificial source of
illumination, light of any wave-length may be made to issue from the
exit slit by setting the circle to the reading corresponding to that
wave-length.      Either the elective arc, limelight, or improved burner
                                                                "
and zirconia mantle of the " incandescent gaslight                 may be em
ployed, best in  a   lantern, the condensers of which are sufficient for
condensing the rays upon the slit.         The opening of the latter need
not exceed ^ in. with the feebler      of the   three sources, and that of the
exit slit may be still finer.        If either of the two first-mentioned

sources are     employed, the apertures may be exceedingly fine, and the
monochromatism is of very high order.
    To diffuse the issuing light, a tube of 2 ins. diameter and equal
length, carrying within it either of two diffusing screens of ground
glass, of fine and extremely fine texture respectively, is attached to
the tapped annulus of the frame of the exit slit by a suitable carrier,
which enables the tube to be approached as near to the slit as desired
 by sliding along a bar.       The instrument to be illuminated, the polari-
 Kope of the axial angle goniometer for instance, is brought close up,
so    that the end of the polarising      tube enters the diffusing tube and
almost touches the ground glass screen, which is best distant about
\\ ins. from the slit ; the axes of the optical tubes of the two in
struments should of course be made continuous.             The illumination
of the field of the polariscope, when carrying an adjusted crystal
section-plate between its convergent lens systems, is so bright that
measurements of the optic axial angle can be carried out with light
as far as G, and is greatly superior to that obtained by the use of
coloured flames. The interference figures are wonderfully sharp upon
a homogeneously         coloured and illuminated background.
    Cases of crossed axial plane dispersion can be completely traced
from the extreme separation of the axes for red in one plane to their
extension for blue in the plane at right angles, and the exact wave
 length for the crossing point when the biaxial crystal simulates an
 uniaxial one at once determined.
     The instrument is equally adapted for use in the determination of
refractive indices by the methods of refraction or total reflection ; the
refracted images of the slit of the spectrometer are immensely
brighter than when coloured flames or a hydrogen Geissler tube are
employed.        A great saving of time is effected in all these measure
 ments, and this is especially advantageous in observations for dif
 ferent temperatures.         Full details of the mode of employing the
 instrument for these various observations, and for its use in stanro-
scopical determinations of extinction angles, are given in the memoir.

     I. The Lava Cavern, SurtsheUir. — At a visit to the lava cavern,
 Snrtshellir (Iceland), in June, 1892, the farthest recess, which con
  tains ice   stalactites and an ice pond, was found to be covered on walls
  and    ceiling with ice crystals in the form of hollow hexagonal

 pyramids, analogous in shape to the well-known cubic crystals of rock
 salt. The hollow ice pyramids were, roughly speaking, built in the
 proportion of base 1 to height 2, and ranged up to about 1 in.
 diameter of base.      They were attached to the wall by their spices,
 turning their hollow bases towards the interior of the cave.             They
 were only found on those parts where stalactites did not occur.           The
 temperature     was  +05°  C.  (+ 33°  F.),  and, as the  cave forms a cul-de-
 sac, the air is perfectly calm.       The crystals, having thus evidently
 been formed from the moisture of the atmosphere, had to be con
 sidered as a kind of hoar frost.
    II. Hoar Frost. — During Christmas week, 1892, similar forms of ice
 crystals, though on a smaller scale, were found in an unusually fine
 hoar frost.      These forms comprised simple aud compound hollow
 hexagonal pyramids, which were sketched at the time.
    III. Artificial Soar Frost. — Experiments had been planned already
 before Christmas, 1892, for the artificial production of hoar frost.
 Before so doing, however, it was thought advisable to search for any
 possible traces of artificial hoar frost in the refrigerating chambers
 used for the frozen-meat trade in Liverpool.             This visit rendered
 experiments unnecessary, as it yielded a rich harvest of simple and
 compound forms of similar hollow pyramidal ice crystals.                  The
 chambers having been cooled down to —13° C. ( + 9° F.), it was
 possible to examine the forms minutely without danger of melting,
and photographs and microphotographs were taken by magnesium
light.
    Similar forms of artificial hoar frost were found in the refrigerating
ss. " Hellopes," in Liverpool,        and also in the cooling cellars of
breweries in Berlin.
    [IV. Dnring a severe frost in January, 1894, we found in various
parts of Cheshire the same hollow pyramidal ice crystals occurring
on the under surfaces of ice crusts covering hollow ruts in clayey
soil, and small pools where an air space divided the ice from, the
water. No ice crystals were found on the sides and bottom of the
ruts.    There was no trace of hoar frost on adjacent objects. Micro-
photographs were obtained. — January 31.]
   V. Comparison toith other Skeleton Crystals (e.g., Rock Salt). —
Like the "                       " of rock salt, the hollow,
                hopper-crystals                                     hexagonal
pyramids of ice have to be considered as skeleton crystals. A study
of the conditions under which these are formed leads us to dis
tinguish three different types of skeleton crystals :
   o. Those due to overgrowth,      e.g., KC1.
   b.  Those due to growth at the upper edge in swimming              crystals,
         e.g., NaCl.
   c.  Those due to starvation growth,      e.g., hoar frost.

   VI.  Literature. — 1. In 1697 Camerarius described, amongst hexa
gonal plates of hoar frost, some slightly depressed in the middle.
   2. In 1874 Krenner described and illustrated hollow hexagonal ico
crystals found in the ice cave of Dobschau.        His remarks on their
formation and attachment are, however, quite at variance with our
observations.
   3. In 1889 Assmann described and illustrated the forms of hoar
frost ; but his illustrations only show flat fronds growing in one
dimension.
   VII. Conclusions. — 1. Water, when changing direct from the gaseous
into the solid state, is highly crystalline.
   2. The tendency to crystallisation is so strong that in those cases
where the area of supply is limited by a wall or other heterogeneous
surface, skeleton crystals — hexagonal " hoppers " — are formed, grow
ing away from that wall, even under circumstances of excessively slow
growth.
   3. Calmness of air seems to be an essential condition for their
formation.
   4. The natural example of crystallisation of water limited to
certain directions is given in hoar frost, showing a very marked
tendency to form hexagonal hoppers.
   5. From our observations, there can be no doubt as to the identity
of the ice crystals of Surtshellir, of the refrigerating chambers and
ships in Liverpool, and of the cooling cellars of the Berlin breweries,
with natural hoar frost.

   1. Galamites. — The  first part of the paper gives a detailed account
of the vegetative structure of Galamites, on the basis of a renewed in
vestigation, in which special attention has been directed to develop
mental questions.
   The petrified specimens which have formed the chief material for
our observations have their structure preserved in great perfection,
and it has been possible to make a thorough study of their organisa
tion at various stages of development.
   The primary structure of the young stem, before growth in thick
ness has begun, bears a striking resemblance to that of Equisetum.
The stem was jointed, with a whorl of leaves at each node.      Although
in the specimens showing structure the leaves have not been found
in connexion with the stem, yet their position is evident, from that
of the leaf-trace vascular bundles, the course of which can be clearly
traced. Their distribution follows the same general lines as in
Equisetum, but shows some additional complications.
   In the internode, a single circle of collateral vascular bundles
surrounds a relatively large pith, which is solid in some of the smallest
twigs, but became fistular in all the larger stems.
   In comparing the vegetative organs with those of Equisetum, it is
 evident that only the primary structure of Catamites can be taken
into consideration.

118          Prof. W. C. Williamson and Dr. D. H. Scott.            [Feb. 8,
     One important point to be decided was the nature of the canal,
 which in both genera accompanies each vascular bundle on its inner
 side.   In Equisetum these canals, as is well known, mark the posi
 tion of the first-formed trachero of the wood, which have become dis
 organised owing to the growth of the surrounding tissues.
     We have now proved that the " internodal " canals of Catamites
 are of precisely the same nature.      Here also the canals have been
 constantly found to contain the annular and spiral tracheal of the
 protoxylem, which in longitudinal and oblique sections can be re
 cognised with perfect distinctness.
     At the nodes the canals are usually interrupted. The primary
 nodal xylem consists of a girdle of short, often reticulate, tracheal, and
closely resembles the corresponding structure in an Equisetum.
    The/ foliar bundles pass out horizontally at the nodes. Their
trachea? are spiral, scalariform, or reticulated.
    In many of the specimens the primary cortex is preserved. Its
outer layers are usually more or less sclerotic, and in a few cases
alternate hypodermal bands of sclerenchyma and parenchyma can
be distinguished, as in many Equiseta.
    On the whole, the primary structure of the stem of Catamites is
substantially that of Equisetum.
    In Catamites, however, secondary tissues were always added, and
are only absent from the youngest branches.           We have no evidence
for the existence of any Calamite without secondary growth.              The
process, which went on essentially as in normal Dicotyledons, or
Gymnosperms, has been observed at all stages.                 In the best-
preserved specimens       the cambium,    with    the   thin-walled   phloem
outside it, can be recognised.
    The primary medullary rays separating the bundles are in some
specimens      prolonged, as parenchymatous           tissue, through the
secondary wood.       In the type previously described as Calanwpitus
the principal rays consist of prosenchymatous cells, and the structure
approaches that of Calamodendron.
    In the majority of the typical stems of Calamites (= Arthropitys of
Goppert) the principal rays become bridged over by interfascicular
wood. In this case most of the radial series of parenchymatous
elements die out towards the exterior, and are replaced by series of
tracheal.     The exact manner in which this change takes place is
discussed in the paper.
    The wood consists of tracheae, and of small secondary rays, the
cells of which are usually upright. The tracheal elements appear
not to be vessels, but tracheides ; they may attain a length of 4 mm.
 The pits, which are bordered, are limited to the radial walls of the
tracheae, except in the most internal layers of the wood.
    The innermost cells of the primary medullary rays underwent con

  1894.]        On the Fossil Plants of the Coal-Measures.           119
siderable tangential dilatation, allowing of a certain increase in the
 diameter of the pith.
    The cortical tissues attained a great thickness in the older stems,
 owing to the formation of abundant periderm. In one specimen the
first origin of the periderm, by tangential divisions of the inner corti
cal cells, could be clearly traced.
    A periderm-like layer was also formed on the surface of the dia
phragms, cutting them off from the medullary cavity.
    A number of specimens show the insertion of branches, on a rela
tively main axis. The branches were placed immediately above the
node; often there were several in a whorl. Each branch usnally
lies between two of the leaf-trace bundles next below. The pith of
the branch tapers towards the base, almost to a point, so that it is
connected with the medulla of the parent stem by a narrow neck of
tissue only.    This gives rise to the characteristic conical form of
those medullary casts which represent the pith-cavity of the basal
portion of a branch.
    In favourable specimens the continuity of the primary wood of the
branch with that of the main stem can be demonstrated with
certainty.
    The branches were no doubt normal, not adventitious, appendages,
and arose near the growing point. Subsequently both the base of
the branch and the parent stem became coated by a common zone of
secondary wood.
   As the branch is traced, from below upwards, the diameter of the
pith becomes larger, the number of the vascular bundles increases in
the successive internodes, and the characteristic Calamitean structure
 is assumed. At a certain distance above the base the dimensions
become approximately constant.
   Many of the branches were abortive, or were at least cast off at an
early age. This is proved by the fact that in many specimens the
pith of the branch is enclosed towards the exterior by the secondary
wood of the main stem.
    From specimens shown to one of us by M. Renault, it appears that
the roots, which were borne at or below the nodes, had the structure
of Astromyelon.      This fact necessitates a re-investigation    of the
fossils described under the latter name.
   2. Galamostachys. — The homosporous C. Binneyana is first con
sidered.
   The morphology of the strobilus is well known. The axis bears
alternate whorls of bracts and of sporangiophores.       The bracts are
coherent for a considerable distance from their base, forming the hori
zontal disc. Their free limbs turn vertically upwards, and extend at
least as far as the second bracteal whorl above.        The number of
bracts in each whorl is about   12.
                                                              k 2

 120          Prof. W. C. Williamson and Dr. D. H. Scott.        [Feb.  8,
    The sporangiophores are in verticils, placed midway between those
of the bracts, and are usually about half as nnmerons in each whorl
as the latter.
    The sporangiophores are peltate, resembling those of Equisetum ;
each bears [four sporangia on its lower surface, attached near the
edge.
    The structure     of the axis of the strobilus has  been  studied in
detail.
    The central cylinder, or stele (which may be either obtusely
triangular or quadrangular, as seen in transverse section), has a
parenchymatous pith, of considerable relative size, around which are
the collateral vascular bundles.
    In the triquetrous form their number is 3 or 6; in the quad
rangular type it is 4. The bundles are always placed at the pro
jecting corners of the stele. On the inner side of each bundle is a
gap, or irregular canal, in which the annular and Rpiral trachea? of
the protoxylem are contained.
    The phloem is very rarely preserved, but in one specimen could be
clearly recognised.
    The structure of the bundles, both in the internodes and nodes,
is essentially similar to that of Calamites, the chief differences con
sisting in their small number and less definite canals.
    In many of the axes a zone of secondary wood, of considerable
thickness, was formed.
    Vascular bundles pass out into each bract and sporangiophore.
    In the latter the bundle forks twice, and each of the four branches
runs out, throngh the peltate expansion, to the base of a sporangium.
    The sporangial wall, as preserved, is usually a single layer of cells,
which have their walls thickened in a manner resembling that of the
 " fibrous         " of
            layer       some anthers.
    The spores are all of one kind. No trace of macrospores was
found in any of the numerous strobili of this species which were
examined.
    The spores attain a diameter of about 0"09 mm. In some speci
mens they are isolated ; in other sporangia they are still grouped in
tetrads, each tetrad being enclosed within the wall of the mother-
cell.
    It is rare for all the four spores of a tetrad to be equally deve
loped. As a rule, one or more of the sister-spores remained very much
smaller than their neighbours, and were, to all appearance, abortive.
The abortion of these spores must have allowed of an increased
nutrition of the survivors, and thus have been of considerable
physiological    importance.
    Calamostachys Cashcana, Will., is the heterosporons species.    Only
 two specimens are at present certainly known.      The general morpho

 1894.]         On the Fossil Plants of the Coal-Measures.             121
logy and anatomy of the strobilus are similar to, but not identical
with, those of the homosporous 0. Binneyana.
    The macrosporangia and microsporangia were borne in the same
strobilns, and in one case both kinds of sporangia were found on the
same sporangiophore.
   The diameter of the microspores is about 0'075 mm. ; that of the
macrospores is just three times as great.
    In the macrosporangia, but never in the microsporangia, numerous
abortive spores are constantly found.          They are of variable size,
but are always much smaller even than the microspores of the same
plant.    Their invariable presence in the macrosporangia, and equally
constant absence from the microsporangia, leave little doubt that
they were the abortive sister-cells of the macrospores.
   These facts appear to throw some light on the origin of the phe
nomenon of heterospory in the genus Calamostachys.        In G. Binneyana
the abortion of certain sister-cells of the spores, involving the better
nutrition of the survivors, had already begun, but still took place
equally in all sporangia. In G. Gasheana the same process, carried
further in certain of the sporangia, rendered possible the development
of specially favoured macrospores, which attained their relatively
large size at the expense of their neighbours, which remained rudi
mentary.    All analogy leads us to suppose that to these macrospores
the formation of a female prothallus was entrusted.         In the micro
sporangia no abortion appears to have taken place, and the spores
attained a uniform small size.
   The axis of the strobilus of G. Gasheana has a well-marked zone of
secondary wood, thus affording direct evidence of the occurrence of
secondary growth in a heterosporous Cryptogam.
   The affinities of Calamostachys are discussed at length. In neither
of the species in question has the strobilus been found in connexion
with vegetative organs.       Other species however, e.g., G. Ludwigi,
were borne on undoubtedly Calaaiarian stems.
   The fructification of a true Galamites has been described in a pre
vious memoir (Williamson, " Organisation of the Fossil Plants of
the Coal-Measures,    Part XIV,"   '
                                     Phil. Trans.,' 1888). This strobilus
differs from Calamostachys      in the  position of the sporangiophores,
which were approximately axillary (instead of being placed in inde
pendent verticils, midway between those of the bracts), and also in
the anatomy of the peduncle and axis, which was identical with that
of the stem of a typical Calamites.      To this fossil we now propose to
give the name of Calamites pedunculatus.
   The position of its sporangiophores is that characteristic of Weiss's
genus Falceostachya.
   The only certain fructification of a Calamites thus differs consider
ably from a Calamostachys.       The differences, however, are not such

122         Prof. W. C. Williamson and Dr. D. H. Scott.         [Feb. 8,
as to preclude a near relationship.     A form described by M. Renault,
under the name of Bruckmannia          Orand'Enryi, unites the external
morphology    of a  Gulamostachys  with the anatomy of a Calamites.   It
is therefore possible that the species of Calamostachys considered in
this paper may have been borne on stems with Calamitean structure,
but this cannot be proved until the strobili are found in actual con
tinuity with the vegetative organs.
   3.  Sphenophyllum. — The habit of these plants is well known.    The
rather slender, jointed stem bore verticils of superposed leaves, the
number of leaves in each verticil being some multiple of 3. The
leaves were sometimes cuneate, sometimes dichotomously subdivided,
sometimes linear.
   The anatomy of several undoubted species of Sphenophyllum is now
known, and there is no longer any doubt that some of the fossils
described in previous memoirs under the name of Asterophyllites
really belong to Sphenophyllum.
   The first species described is Sphenophyllum plurifoliatum = Astero
phyllites sphenophylloides of the former memoirs.
   The number of leaves in each whorl was large, not less than 18.
They were linear in form.
   The axis is traversed by a solid vascular strand, triangular, as seen
in transverse section, without any pith. The strand is triarch, with
a group    of narrow    spiral and reticulate elements (protoxylem) at
each angle.     The primary wood of the stem was thus centripetal,
and so far resembled that of most recent Lycopodiacese, with which,
however, the genus has otherwise little in common.
   Secondary growth in thickness took place constantly, and has been
observed at every stage.      The secondary wood consisted of radially
arranged trachea) (whether vessels or tracheides is doubtful) with
strands of parenchyma between them. The longitudinal paren
chymatous strands are connected by radially elongated cells, which,
however, seldom form continuous medullary rays.
   The cambium is excellently preserved in some specimens, a fact
which removes all doubt as to the truly secondary character of the
tissues in question.
   The primary cortex and leaves were soon cast off by the formation
of internal periderm.      The older stems have a large amount of
secondary tissue to the outside of the cambium.        This is shown to
consist partly of true phloem, partly of internal peridermal layers,
which in extreme cases formed a regular scale-bark.
   A second species, Sphenophyllum insigne (= Asterophyllites insignis,
Will.), is described. Its general anatomy agrees with that of the
former species, apart from differences of detail. The most important
structural peculiarity of S. insigne consists in the constant presence
of continuous medullary rays in its secondary wood.

1894.]           On the   Fossil Plants of the Coal-Measures.                123
    In the phloem of this species large elements, closely resembling
sieve   tubes, are found.
    The   larger specimens, 'which have lost their primary cortex owing
to    the formation of periderm, have a very root-like transverse
section.     Some authors       have therefore denied that they belong to
Sphenophyllnm, and have supposed               that they are roots of some
unknown plant. This is a mistake,              for the large specimens have
essentially    the same   structure    as the  smaller  ones, which still retain
the characteristic cortex and leaves of a Sphenophyllnm.              The inter
 mediate conditions are also known.
     Leaves had not been discovered in this species when the former
account of its structure was given, in the earlier memoirs.
    The recent researches of M. Zeiller have proved that the fmcti-
  ication    previously     described (Williamson, " Organisation,           &c,
Part XVIII,"        ' Phil. Trans.,' 1891) as Bowmanites Bawsoni, is that
of a Sphenophyllnm.           In his specimens, strobili, agreeing in all
respects     with  those   of  Bowmanites, are borne on the stems of the
well known Sphenophyllum cuneifolium, Sternb.              The fructification in
question must therefore be transferred to the genus Sphenophyllum,
and is here described under the name of Sphenophyllum Bawsoni.
     The strobilus consists of an axis bearing numerous whorls of bracts,
 which are coherent for some distance from their base.            The very long
sporangiophore8       arise from   the  upper surface  of the bracts,  near their
 insertion, two sporangiophores corresponding to each bract.              At the
end     of each sporangiophore a single sporangium is borne, which
 hangs down, parallel to the pedicel, somewhat resembling an ana-
 tropous ovule in position.
     The axis of the strobilus is traversed by a triarch or hexarch
 vascular cylinder, essentially similar to that of the vegetative stem
of Sphenophyllum.          At every node vascular bundles are given oft to
 the bracts.     Each of these bundles, on entering the verticil of bracts,
 subdivides into three. The dorsal branch passes straight out into one
 of the free bracts.       The two ventral branches of the bundle supply
 the two sporangiophores         corresponding to the bract in question.
     The bundle of the sporangiophore extends through its whole length,
 becoming thicker towards the apex, where it terminates at the base
 of the    sporangium itself.
     The cells of the sporangial wall are of great size near the base, and
 are very narrow at its opposite end, where dehiscence probably took
  place.
     The spores are numerous         in each sporangium, and are all of the
  same   kind.    There is at present no conclusive evidence for the exist
  ence of a heterosporous Sphenophyllum.
     The morphological nature of the sporangiophore cannot be deter
   mined with certainty.       The various possible views are stated in the

124          Prof.   J.   R. Green.     On the Germination   of the   [Feb. 8,
paper. For the present it seems best to regard this organ as simply
a sporangium-pedicel,  though there is no analogy among known
Cryptogams for the presence of a vascular bundle in the stalk of a
sporangium.
   It appears that all species of Sphenophyllum in which the fructifica
tion is known, had essentially similar strobili, with pedicellate
sporangia.
   The genus Sphenophyllum cannot be placed in any existing family
of Vascular Cryptogams.         Anatomically there are some striking
points of resemblance to Lycopodiaceae, but the habit and fructifica
tion are totally different from anything in that order.  Sphenophyllum,
in fact, constitutes a group by itself, which is entirely unrepresented
at the present epoch, and the affinities of which cannot be deter
mined until additional forms have been discovered.
   The paper is illustrated by numerous photographs from the actual
preparations and specimens, and by a long series of camera-lncida
drawings, executed by Mr. George Brebner.

                                      (Abstract.)
      Manyobservers, especially Van Tieghem        and Mangin, have
established the fact that the growth of the pollen tube is a process of
true germination, strictly comparable to that of the growth of the
prothallus from the spore in the groups of Vascular Cryptogams.
The germinative process is carried on at the expense of various
reserve materials deposited partly in the pollen grain itself and partly
in the conducting tissue of the style, down which the pollen tube
makes its way.
   The existence of certain enzymes in the pollen grain has also been
proved by Van Tieghem and by Strasburger.        The former has shown
that when the pollen of several genera, especially Crocus and
Narcissus, is cultivated in cane-sugar solutions, a certain amount of
grape-sugar is produced in the culture, suggesting the presence of
invertase ; while the latter has shown similarly that certain pollens,
when cultivated in starch paste, can liquefy      with the formation of
                                                     it,
maltose.

 1894.]    Pollen Grain and the Nutrition of the Pollen lube.          125
    The object of the present research was to isolate these enzymes
and to investigate any changes in the amount of either of them during
 the progress of the germination.      Further, to ascertain something of
the metabolism going on in both the pollen grain and the style in the
interval between pollination and fertilisation.
   Both the enzymes were prepared from bruised grains by the use of
the ordinary solvents — water, glycerine, and solutions of common
salt — the latter being, perhaps, the most efficient. Details of the
experiments, and the conditions of extraction, are given in the paper
of which this is an abstract.       Diastase was found in the resting
pollen  of various species  of Lilium,   Helianthus, Gladiolus, Anemone,
Antirrhinum, Tropceolum, Pelargonium, Crocus, Brownea, Helleborus,
Almis, Tulipa, and Olivia, and in that of Zarnia after germination had
begun.     The diastase is in the form of the translocation diastase of
Brown and Morris. Invertase was found in the pollen of Helleborus,
Narcissus, Richardia, Lilium, and Zamia.          Some of these species
contained both enzymes.
   During the germination of the pollen grain the quantity of both
enzymes was found to show a considerable increase in amount, in
some cases even four or five fold.      This increase was estimated by
noting the diastatic or invertive power of extracts prepared side by
side, from weighed quantities of pollen, and from equal quantities
allowed to germinate in various culture fluids. Control experiments
were carried ont to show that the increase of enzyme action was not
due to a more complete extraction of the ferment from the thin-
walled tube than was possible from the thick-walled grain, but that
there was an actual total increase of the enzyme.        In one case there
was noticed a diminution of ferment         in  the earliest stages of the
germination, which may probably be correlated with the digestion of
the starch grains of the grain, or of some portion of them, before the
output of the pollen tube. It was found, further, that when the
power of germination of the pollen grain was becoming feeble, from
its being kept for some weeks, there was a very considerable diminu
tion of the amount of diastase that could be extracted.        Full details
of these experiments are given in the paper.
   The mode of growth and nutrition of the pollen tube was investi
gated by culture of the grain in hanging drops of fluid in a moist
chamber, and by chemical analysis of the contents of various pollen
grains and styles.
   The microscopic examination of pollen tubes revealed general
granularity of their contents, with the formation of certain large and
refringent granules, that were apparently extruded regularly by the
tube at definite places near the top.       This appearance has already
been noticed by Van Tieghem, to whose work reference is made.
The extrusion of these granules suggests that they are the medium

126         Prof.    J.   R. Green.   On the Germination   of the   [Feb. 8,
of excretion of the enzyme, which can readily be detected in the
culture fluid.
   The reserve stores of the pollen grain differ in various species.
They include starch, possibly in some cases dextrin, cane sugar,
maltose, and glucose.   The intracellular action of diastase can be
noticed in the cases in which it is present, by the transformation of
the starch granules as they pass along the tube, iodine staining
them blue in the grain and upper part of the tube, then purple, and
finally almost red as the tip is approached ; indicating thus the
gradually increasing formation of dextrin, one of the accompaniments
of starch    digestion.  Quantitative estimations of the sugars are
quoted in detail in the paper.
   The distribution of starch in the style of the Lily was found to have
a close relation to the progress of the pollen tube.     The cells lining
the cavity of the style, and the cells of the loose conducting tissue
abutting on      were found to contain starch grains, in greater or less
               it,
amounts, varying with the species and with the age of the individual
style. The outer soft tissue of the fibro- vascular bundles of this,
organ were also charged with crowds of starch grains, indicating a
transport of this reserve material from the leaves.          Cane sugar,
maltose, and possibly glucose, were found to be the sugars present
in the various styles examined.
   In longitudinal preparations the starch was found to stop short
some few mm. below the stigma, suggesting the view that the
reserves in the stylo are intended to supplement those in the pollen
grain, the latter being utilised in the early stages of germination.
   Not only reserve materials can be found in the style, but in certain
cases diastase also exists.
   The action of the enzymes of the pollen       thus found to be partly
                                                 is
intracellular, digesting the contents of the pollen grain, and partly
 extracellular, being excreted into the tissue of the style to work
 upon the external reserves. This        particularly noteworthy in the
                                         is
case of Narcissus, where the grain contains invertase, but, according
to Van Tieghem, no cane sugar. The latter          found in considerable
                                                   is

                                is
   The absorption of food material often leads to an increase of starch
in the grain and in the tube.
   The increase of enzyme noted in certain cases lends a certain
amount of support to the view that the enzyme exists in the pollen
grain in the form of a zymogen. Some evidence bearing out this

1894.]     Pollen Grain and the Nutrition of the Pollen Tube.         127
view is derived     from some experiments on the pollen of Zamia.        A
watery extract of this pollen was found to have no diastatic power,
but on heing warmed with a little malie acid for some hours, and
then neutralised, it was found to have acquired a feeble one, very
slowly hydrolysing      some thin starch paste.    Further experiments
upon  this  point are, however,  necessary before pronouncing decidedly
that the zymogen exists.
   The whole of the researches may be summarised as under : —
   1. Diastase   and invertase are both present in pollen grains, and
        can be extracted from them by the same treatment as has been
        found effectual in the cases of seeds and foliage leaves.     The
       relative quantities vary a good deal ; while some pollens con
        tain both, others possess only one, which may be either of the
        two.
   2. At the onset of germination     the amount of both diastase and
        invertase is usually considerably increased.      In one species
        examined this increase was preceded by a primary diminution.
        When the pollen grain has lost the power of germinating, the
        quantity of diastase has considerably decreased.
   3. The pollen      tube is nourished during its growth by plastic
        reserve material derived from two sources, the store of material
        in the grain itself, and a further store deposited in the style.
   i. The reserve store of the pollen grain consists of different
        materials in different species : starch, dextrin, cane sugar,
        maltose, and glucose being the forms in which it is found.
   5. The store in the style consists usually of the same carbohydrates,
        with the exception of dextrin.
   6. The style itself contains     enzymes to assist in preparing the
        reserve materials for absorption by the pollen tube, while the
        latter excretes the same ferments during its progress down
        the conducting tissue.
   7. The absorption     of food material appears to be one cause of the
        increase of enzyme found to occur during the germination.
  8. This absorption      of food material is usually so active that the
        reserve store of the pollen grain is often largely increased by
        a temporary deposition, either in the grain or its tube, of
        some of the absorbed sugar in the form of starch.
  9. There is a certain amount of evidence pointing to the existence
        of zymogens in some pollens, particularly such as germinate
        in a faintly acid medium.

   In Part VII* it has been shown that whilst cadmium can act as
" solvent " metal towards either of the immiscible pairs — lead and
zinc, bismuth and zinc — this is not the case when aluminium is sub
stituted for zinc, because cadmium and aluminium (contrary to the
usual statements in the text-books) are not miscible in all propor
tions, unlike cadmium and zinc. Accordingly, it becomes of interest
to examine the behaviour of ternary metallic mixtures where
cadmium and aluminium are the two immiscible metals, more especi
ally when a "solvent" metal is employed also capable of use in
similar fashion with the immiscible pairs, aluminium and lead,
aluminium and bismuth, so as to trace out the effect of substituting
cadmium for lead or bismuth.                  Such a solvent metal is tin; the
volatility   of cadmium,      however,   precludes the possibility of employing
elevated temperatures above the boiling point of that metal (about
770° C.) ; but, thanks to the physical attraction of molten aluminium
for cadmium (comparable with that of water for gaseous hydrochloric
acid), it is possible to keep molten in long narrow crucibles metallic
mixtures containing simultaneously aluminium and cadmium, with
out any material amount of volatilisation of the latter metal taking
place from the surface of the lighter alloy that floats up (of which
aluminium necessarily constitutes the majority), so long as the

temperature does not exceed 700° to 750°. At temperatures of 800°
and upwards, however, so much cadmium vapour is given oft from
the heavier alloy (in which cadmium predominates) as seriously to
interfere with the experiment, not only because of the alteration in
composition thereby produced, but also because of the intermixing
effect  tending to prevent proper separation by gravitation              of the
lighter and heavier alloys from one another.
                Binary Alloys of Aluminium and Cadmium.
   A series of observations was first    made to determine the composition
of the binary alloys formed when aluminium                and cadmium are
melted together and well stirred, and then allowed to stand at a
temperature of 700 — 750° (averaging about 725°) for several hours.
The following figures resulted as the averages from twelve tolerably
concordant experiments : —

   The alloys were prepared by melting the aluminium, then adding
the tin, and finally the cadmium, well stirring as soon as the latter
was fluid, pouring quickly into the red-hot clay test-tubes, and main
taining these at 700 — 750° (averaging about 725°) for from six to
eight hours in the lead bath. The analysis was made by dissolving in
hydrochloric acid solution containing nitric acid, diluting and pre
cipitating with sulphuretted hydrogen, and separating the tin and
 cadmium sulphides by means of ammonium sulphide, the tin being

the sulphides was precipitated by ammonia, the weight of the
Ala03 finally obtained being corrected for traces of iron and silica
present. As in all previous experiments, the percentages         were
calculated on the sum of the weights of the three metals found
as 100.

   As regards the direction    of slope of the tie-lines, it ib noticeable
that they are similar in this respect to those obtained with alumininm-
bismuth-tin alloys, always sloping downwards to the right (i.e., the
heavier alloy containing a larger proportion of "solvent" than the
conjugate lighter alloy) ; with aluminium-lead-tin alloys, the lower
alloys exhibited a slope to the left, and the upper ones to the right,
presumably owing to the formation of a definite compound of tin
and lead (probably Pb3Sn), no analogue of which appears to be pro
duced with either bismuth and tin or cadmium and tin.

 applies to the corresponding alloys where aluminium is used instead
 of zinc, with only this difference, that when the proportion of anti
 mony present exceeds a certain amount the mixtures employed no
 longer remain completely fluid when kept for several hours at
 temperatures n ear 850 — 900° C. ; more or less of the difficultly fusible

 out in the solid state ; so that in certain cases where the proportion

 the constituents still occurs in consequence of this action, the com

 critical curve indicated by plotting as usual the compositions of the
 lowermost and topmost portions of the compound ingot ultimately
 obtained exhibits a sort of excrescence or horn in the central portion,
 where this abnormal separation occurs. A similar separation by
 solidification of aluminium antimonide is also observed in the case of
 alloys containing (in suitable proportions) aluminium, antimony, and
 some third metal miscible in all proportions with either of them
 separately ; thus with zinc as the third metal, under proper condi
 tions, solid aluminium antimonide separates, the fluid mother liquor,
 so to speak, consisting of the zinc, together with whatever ulnminium
 or antimony may be present in excess, and such an amount of AlSb
 as this fused mixture of metals may be capable of permanently dis
 solving at the particular temperature of the experiment.

     The following average values were obtained on examination of
 twenty compound ingots (forty alloys), prepared by fusing together
the weighed metals at a temperature above the melting point of
silver, and well stirring, pouring into a nearly white-hot clay test-
tube, and keeping this for six to eight hours in a lead bath at the highest
temperature practicable with the appliances used.                This temperature
varied between about 850° and 920°, averaging near 880° ; even at the
 hottest, fragments of pure silver did not run down to a liquid,
although they fritted together (melting point of silver near 950° C).
The analysis was made in the same way as that of the zinc-lead-
antimony alloys described in Part VII, excepting that the acid
filtrate from the precipitated sulphides of lead and antimony was
directly neutralised with ammonia, the precipitated alumina being
weighed, and corrections made for small quantities of P8Os and SiO,
present.

   Fig.  2  represents these values depicted graphically on the tri
 angular system, the outer dotted line, No. 1, being the curve obtained
with aluminium-lead-tin       alloys at about 800° (Part VI), and the
inner dotted line that for zinc-lead-antimony alloys at 800° (Part
VII). Obviously, the first five tie-lines belong to a perfectly regular
curve, which, by analogy with the other two dotted curves, might be
expected to follow approximately the course indicated by the middle
dotted line No. 3 ; so that the tie-lines 8, 9, and 10 doubtless represent
simply the effect of the separation of solid aluminium antimonide

taking place partly during the period of tranquil fusion, and partly
 during the short time requisite to cool down the resulting compound
ingot.    In the case of tie-lines 6 and 7, the mixtures of metals used
appear to have corresponded with ideal alloys, and the heavier alloys
that were obtained did not widely differ from such as would be
 expressed by points on the normal critical curve ; but this was not
 the case   with the lighter alloys, where the quantities of aluminium

and antimony present relatively to the lead are abnormally increased
 through the formation of solid AlSb and its admixture with the fluid
lighter alloy.
    As regards the direction of slope of the tie-lines, it is noticeable
that they all slope downwards to the left, as in the case of zinc-lead-
antimony alloys.       Obviously, the substitution of aluminium for zinc
in these raises the critical curve, as in all other similar cases so far
examined.       On the other hand, the substitution of antimony for tin
depresses the curve (so far as the normal portion is concorned, at any
rate), just as in the case of zinc-lead-tin and zinc-bismuth- tin alloys.
              Mixtures of Aluminium,        Bismuth, and Antimony.
    A parallel   series of experiments     with aluminium-bismuth-antimony
alloys gave the following         results as the averages from       the examina
tion of twenty-five compound ingots (fifty alloys). The analysis was
made as in the case of zinc-bismuth-antimony alloys (Part VII), except
that the acid filtrate from the precipitated sulphides of bismuth and
antimony was precipitated with ammonia, the Al2Oa ultimately
weighed being corrected for FejOs and SiOa (p. 138).
    Fig. 3 represents these values plotted on the triangular system, the
dotted line No. 1 representing the corresponding resnlts obtained
with aluminium-lead-antimony alloys, and the inner dotted line,
No. 2, those obtained with zinc-bismuth-antimony alloys (Part VII).
Obviously, the substitution of bismuth for lead depresses the critical
curve, as usual; the uppermost portion shows precisely the same
ii regularity in the form of a central hornlike excrescence, due to the
separation of solid SbAl, as was observed with aluminium-lead-
antimony alloys ; whilst the lower portion of the right-hand branch
shows the same kind of sharply-marked inward depression as was
previously observed with zinc-bismuth-antimony                 alloys, due to the
formation of the definite compound of bismuth and antimony, SbjBia,
aluminium (like zinc) being capable of dissolving this compound to a
greater extent than mixtures of the two metals where one or the
other predominates beyond this proportion.

   This communication consists of a discnssion of the photographic
arc spectra of the Nejed and Obernkirchen        meteorites, the wave
lengths of the lines being based upon those determined by means of
the photographic arc spectrum of electrolytic iron, a paper concerning
which has been recently communicated to the Society. The portion
of the spectrum covered by the photographs extends from K to D.

140              On the  Arc   Spectrum of Iron   Meteorites.      [Feb. 15,
   The wave-lengths, intensities, and origins of the lines in the
spectra are given in tabular form.
   The following general conclusions have been arrived at : —
   1. The spectra of the two meteorites closely agree, both as regards
the number and intensities of the lines, the slight difference in
number being probably due to a difference of exposure.
   2. The meteoritic spectra and the solar spectrum show considerable
similarity. The iron lines in each have about the same relative
intensity, thus indicating that the temperature of the iron vapour in
the sun which produces the majority of the iron lines is about the
same as that of the electric arc.
   3. The results of the inquiry into the origin of the lines, in addition
to those of iron, may be thus summarised : —
        Substances certainly present.      Substances probably present.
               Manganese.                          Strontium.
               Cobalt.                             Lead.
               Nickel.                             Lithium.
               Chromium.                           Cerium.
               Titanium.                           Molybdenum.
               Copper.                             Vanadium.
               Barium.                             Didymium.
               Calcium.                            Uranium.
               Sodium.                             Tungsten.
               Potassium.
   4.  Of the few faint lines in the tables, for which no origins have
been found from the Kensington maps of metallic arc spectra, the
majority are apparently coincident with lines mapped by Messrs.
Kayser and Runge in the iron spectrum. These do not appear in the
Kensington photographs, probably on account of insufficient exposure.
   5. By noting the difference in intensity of identical lines in the
two spectra, a rough approximation can be made to the relative
quantities of the different substances present in the meteorites. Thns
it is found that the chief chemical difference between the two meteor
ites is that there is a preponderance of calcium in the Nejed, and of
nickel, barium, and strontium in the Obernkirchen, meteorite.

       Master at King Edward's High School, Birmingham.
       Communicated by Professor Poynting, F.R.S. Received
       January    10, 1894.
                                 (Abstract.)
    If  the coefficient of dilatation (e) and the conductivity («c) are
constant at every point -within the earth, and if the temperature (V)
was initially the same throughout, the depth of the surface of zero-
strain after 100 million years is 2-17 miles, the total volume of the
crust folded and crushed above that surface is about 184,500 cubic
miles, and the mean thickness of the crushed rock spread over the
 whole surface of the earth is 4 95 ft. (taking e = 0-0O00O57, k = 400,
 V = 7000° F.). The smallness of these figures has been claimed by
some geologists as a new and strong argument against the contraction
theory of mountain evolution.
    In the present paper the problem is reconsidered on the supposition
that the coefficient of dilatation is not constant, bat increases with
the temperature, the change in the former varying as the correspond
ing change in the latter.       It follows, from experiments made by
 Fizeau, that, for a rise of one degree in temperature, the coefficient of
dilatation increases on an average by abont 1/888.         Adopting this
value, and taking the other constants as above, it is found that, after
100 million years, the depth of the surface of zero strain is 7-79 miles,
the total volume of crust-folding about 6,145,000 cubic miles, and the
mean thickness of the layer formed by spreading it over the whole
earth 164-7 ft.
    If the conductivity increases with the temperature, or if the
material which composes the earth's interior be such that the con
ductivity and coefficient of dilatation are greater in it than in the
surface rocks, or if initially the temperature increased with the
depth, the figures given in the preceding paragraph must be still
further increased. It follows, therefore, that calculations as to the
alleged insufficiency of the contraction theory to produce mountain
ranges are at present inadmissible.

    As the preliminary investigation of the Makariwa stone had
already indicated to Professor Ulrich* the presence of mineral con
stituents having the physical characters of olivine, enstatite, glass, a
substance resembling glass, nickel-iron, troilite, magnetite, hydrous
oxide of iron, and possibly chromite, the quantitative chemical analysis
presented difficulties, among which may be specially mentioned the
fact that one chemical element (iron) enters into the composition of
each of the above fine-grained and closely intermingled           constituents.
This chemical examination        I was invited to undertake by Professor
J. W. Judd, F.R.S., throngh whom the two fragments of the stone
sent to this country by Professor Ulrich have been generously pre
sented to the British Museum.
    The composite method adopted for the analysis was as follows : —
    It was found advisable to make a preliminary separation of the
powder by means of a magnet into attracted and unattracted
material.   Treatment of a portion of the attracted material with a
solution of mercuric ammonium chloride, as recommended by Dr.
Friedheim,f revealed the fact that the proportion of rust was
too large to be negligible, and indicated the necessity of a pre
liminary reduction of the rust of the unattracted material, and of a
subsequent extraction of the reduced metal with mercuric solution ;
this prevents the unattracted oxide of iron due to rusting of the
alloy from passing into the hydrochloric acid extract with the oxide
of iron of the silicate decomposed by the acid. Accordingly, after
the sulphur and phosphorus of the unattracted material had been
determined, mercuric solution was employed both before and after
heating the material to low redness in a current of hydrogen (as
recommended by von Baumhauer), the residual unrusted and rusted
nickel-iron being thus separately removed.               Analysis of the post
 reduction mercuric extract showed that there had been a small, but
appreciable, action on the silicate portion of the meteorite during the
reduction.    Further, it became obvious that the troilite was largely
affected by the heating in hydrogen, and in such a way that the
 greater part of the iron of that constituent, and practically all the
 iron and nickel of the schreibersite, had gone into the mercuric

  solution.    Hence, determinations of the sulphur and phosphorus in
  the mercurialised residue were made, so that the iron and nickel
  which had passed into the mercuric solution from the affected troilite
 and schreibersite might be allowed for. The mercurialised residue
 was next treated with hydrochloric acid, and the solution analysed ;
 the silica was extracted from the undecomposed residue by sodium
 carbonate solution containing some caustic soda, and the small
 amounts of bases simultaneously extracted were likewise determined ;
 the undecomposed residue itself was then separately analysed.
  Further, various determinations of the alkalies were'made.
     The microscopical examination made by Professor Ulrich having
 suggested no character or constituent different from those previously
 met with in meteoric stones, the interest of the chemical investiga
 tion was rather in the study of an analytical method than in the
 numerical results to be obtained. As pointed out by Dr. Friedheim,
 in the memoir already referred to, recent analyses of fragments of
 the Alfianello stone show enormous variations : they are probably in
great part due to the incompleteness of the separations of the con
stituent minerals from each other.
    Asa result of the observations made in the course of the analysis
 of the Makariwa stone, the following points may be emphasised : —
    1. It is advisable to first effect, as far as practicable, a magnetic
separation of the mineral constituents : otherwise, owing to the
malleability of the nickel-iron, the powdered material may be neither
sufficiently fine, nor sufficiently homogeneous as a mixture. Further,
without this separation, the appreciable proportion of the iron-rust
may escape observation.
    2. The solntion of mercuric ammonium chloride, suggested by
Dr. Friedheim, is very satisfactory in being without appreciable
action on any other constituent than the nickel-iron, if used as
directed.
    3. If the attracted material be treated with acid without previous
extraction by means of mercuric solution, the composition deduced
for the nickel-iron may be completely wrong, owing to the solution of
iron-rust simultaneously with the nickel-iron.
    4. After reduction of the rust in the unattracted         material by
heating    to low redness  in hydrogen, and  after subsequent treatment
with the mercuric solution, no troilite or schreibersite will be left in
the residue if the operations are sufficiently prolonged. There is an
appreciable effect on the silicate portion during the operations.
    5. The enstatite can be completely freed from olivine by three
extractions with hydrochloric acid (sp. gr. 1'06) on the water-bath —
probably by two.
    6. The Deville- Cooke method is very advantageous for the separa
tion of the small quantities of aluminium and chromium from the iron.

   It  may be added that the microscopical characters of minerals
have now been so minutely investigated that, for mere determination
of the mineralogical species of the constituents, the microscopic
examination of a thin section of a meteorite by the petrologist              is
more complete and expeditious       than a   chemical  analysis.

         100 parts of the original nickel-iron would consist of 78'94 of

   This corresponds approximately with the typical formula of an
olivine, 2R"0-Si02. The deviation from the typical formula is prob
ably chiefly due to solution of part of the finely-divided enstatite
during the separation of the olivine by means of hydrochloric acid,
and may partly arise from the solution of the other constituents

indicating that the alkali present is essentially soda, and that the soda
is almost wholly, if not solely, present in a mineral constituent which
is only slightly attacked by water, alcohol, ether, or dilute hydro
chloric acid.

                 V. Chemical Relationship       to other Meteoric   Stones.
     For the olivinic silicate, the ratio of the oxygen in combination
 with the iron and manganese to that in combination with the mag
 nesium and calcium is 1 : 2-9 ; in this respect the Makariwa stone
 resembles those of Gopalpur (1 : 2'75) ; Mezo-Madaras                         and Eich
stadt (1 : 2-8) ; Montrejeau and Pultusk (1 : 2"9) ; Borkut and
 Chantonnay (1 : 3).*
     For the enstatitic silicate, the corresponding ratio is 1 : 2'7. This
approximates to those of Eichstadt (1 : 2"2) ; Manegaum, Waconda,
 and Tjabe (1 : 2-3) ; Seres (1 : 2'4) ; Georgia and Montrejeau
 (1   :   2-5) ; Grosnaja (1   :  2 6) ;  Utrecht (1   : 27) ;  Ski  (1  :  2 8)  ;  Borkut
 (1    :  3).
     Of the above meteoric stones, that which stands nearest in this
respect for both silicates is Montrejeau; other stones approximating
to Makariwa in both ratios are Borkut, Eichstadt, Tjabe, Utrecht,
and Linn County.
     In the proportion of the olivine to the enstatite, there is                      also a
close       similarity  : in Makariwa the proportion            is 56  :   44  ;   in Mon
trejeau, 54 : 46.
     The proportion of nickel (18 — 21 per cent.) in the alloy is higher
than the average, and approximates to that of Middlesbrough (23
per cent.).

      Nature."     By T. E. Thorpe, D.Sc, F.R.S., and J. W.
      Rodger, Assoc. R.C.S. Received February 22, 1894.
                               (Abstract.)
   The purpose of this paper is to throw light upon the relations be
tween the viscosity of homogeneous liquids and their chemical nature.
It is divided into three parts.
   Part I contains a summary of the attempts which have been made,
more particularly by Poiseuille, Graham, Bellstab, Guerout, Pribram
and Handl, and Gartenmeister, to elucidate this question. Although
it is evident from the investigations of these physicists that relation
ships of the kind under consideration do exist, it must be admitted
that they are as yet not very precisely defined, mainly for the reason
that the conditions by which truly comparable results can alone be
obtained have received but scant consideration.
   For example, it seems futile to expect that any definite stoichio
metric relations would become evident by comparing observations
taken at one and the same temperature. Practically, nothing is known
of a quantitative character concerning the influence of temperature
on viscosity.
    Prom the time which a liquid takes to flow through a capillary
tube under certain conditions, which are set out at length in the
paper, a measure of the viscosity of the liquid can be obtained.
   An apparatus was, therefore, designed on this principle which ad
mitted of the determination in absolute measure of the viscosity, and
for a temperature range extending from 0° up to the ordinary boiling
point of the liquid examined. In this way instead of finding, as has been
the usual custom, relative times of flow in the same apparatus under
the same external conditions of temperature and pressure, and which

  might or might not be taken as measures of a single physical magni
  tude of the substance, i.e., its viscosity, the physical magnitude itself
 could be measured, and the various influences which are found to
 affect its value could be allowed for.        The physical constants thus
 obtained could then be treated from the point of view of the
 chemist, and the comparison would then be of the same kind as that
 employed in connexion with other physical magnitudes.
     Full details of the conditions determining the dimensions of the
 apparatus and of the modes of estimating these dimensions, together
 with the methods of conducting the observations, are given in the
 paper.
     The corrections to be applied to the direct results are then dis
 cussed.
     The question of the mathematical expression of the relation of
 viscosity of liquids to temperature is considered, and reasons are
 given for preferring the formula of Slotte —
                               ,  = c/(l + 6f)",
 i} is here the coefficient of viscosity in dynes per square centimetre,
 and c, b, and » are constants varying with the liquid.
     With a view of testing the conclusions set out at length in the
 historical section of the paper, and, in particular, of tracing the influ
 ence of homology, substitution, isomerism, and, generally speaking, of
changes in the composition and constitution of chemical compounds
upon viscosity, a scheme of work was arranged which involved the
determination, in absolute measure, of the viscosity of some seventy
liquids, at all temperatures between 0° (except where the liquid
solidified at that temperature) and their respective boiling points.
    Part  II  of the memoir is concerned with the origin and modes of
establishing the purity of the several liquids ; it contains the details
of the measurements of the viscosity coefficients, together with the
data required to express the relation of viscosity coefficients to tem
perature by means of Slotte's formula, and tables are given showing
the agreement between the observed and calculated values.
    In Part   III  the results are discussed. In the outset the factors
upon     which   the magnitude of the viscosity probably depends are
dealt with. The influence of possible molecular aggregations, as in
dicated by observations of vapour densities, boiling points, and
critical densities, and, more especially, by measurements of surface
energy, made by Eotvos in 1886, and more recently by Ramsay and
Shields, are taken note of.
    The deductions which may be made by considering the graphical
representation of the results, showing the variations of viscosity
coefficients with temperature, are then set forth.
    For liquids which probably contain simple molecules, or for which

tliere is little evidence of association of molecules at any temperature,
the following conclusions may be drawn : —
    1. In homologous series the coefficient of viscosity is greater, the
greater the molecular weight.
    2. An iso-compound has always a smaller viscosity coefficient than
the corresponding normal compound.
    3. An allyl compound has, in general, a coefficient which is greater
than that of the corresponding isopropyl compound, but less than that
of the normal propyl compound.
    4. Substitution of halogen for hydrogen raises the viscosity coeffi
cient by an amount which is greater, the greater the atomic weight
of the halogen ; successive substitutions of hydrogen by chlorine in
the same molecule bring about different increments in the viscosity
coefficients.
    5. In some cases, as in those of the dichlorethanes, substitution
exerts a marked influence on the viscosity, and in the case of the
dibromides and benzene, it may be so large that the compound of
higher molecular weight has the smaller viscosity.
    6. Certain liquids, which probably contain molecular complexes, do
not obey these rules.        Formic and acetic acids are exceptions to
Rule 1.       The alcohols at some temperatures, but not at all, are
exceptions to Rule 2 ; at no temperatures do they conform to
Rule 3.
    7. Liquids containing molecular complexes have, in general, large
values of d^jdt.
    8. In both classes of liquids the behaviour of the initial members
of homologous series, such as formic acid and benzene, is in some
cases exceptional when compared with that of higher homologues.
    As regards the influence of temperature on viscosity, it is found
that the best results given by Slotte's formula are in cases where,
the slope of the curve varies but little with the temperature..
 From the mode in which the values of the constants n and b are
 derived, it cannot be expected that their magnitudes will be., related
 in any simple manner to chemical nature. With the exception of
 certain liquids, such as water and the alcohols, which are character
 ised by large temperature coefficients, and in which there is reason
 to expect the existence of molecular aggregates, the formula
                             7=c/(l+/9H-7<'),
 obtained from Slotte's expression by neglecting terms in the deno
 minator involving higher powers of t than t\ gives a close agreement
 with the observed results, and in this formula the magnitude of fi
 and 7 are definitely related to the chemical nature of the sub
 stances.
     In order to obtain quantitative relationships between viscosity and

chemical nature, and to compare one group of substances with another,
it is necessary to fix upon particular temperatures at which the
liquids may be taken as being in comparable conditions as regards
viscosity, and to compare the values of the viscosities at those tem
peratures.
  The first comparable temperature which suggested itself was the
boiling point.
  A second comparable temperature was obtained by calculating
values    of corresponding       temperatures by the method of van der
Waals with such data as could be obtained.
 The third basis of comparison consisted in using temperatures of
equal slope, i.e., temperatures at which the rate of change of the
viscosity coefficient is the same for all liquids.
   At each of the different conditions of comparisons, the experimental
results have been expressed according to the same system, in order to
show at a glance relationships between the magnitudes of the viscosity
constants and the chemical nature of the substances.     The liquids are
arranged  so that chemically related substances are grouped together.
Tables are constructed which give the values of the three different
magnitudes derivable from measurements of the viscosity of the sub
stances.

     1.
   2. Values of rj x molecular area, i.e., molecular viscosity.
   3. Vaioes of if X molecular volume, i.e., molecular viscosity work.
   The coefficient rj is the force in dynes which has to be exerted per
unit-area of a liquid surface in order to maintain its velocity relative
to that of another parallel surface at unit distance equal to unity.
It   seemed,  however, that relations between viscosity and chemical
nature would best be brought to light       if,instead of adopting merely
unit-areas, areas were selected upon which there might be assumed to
be the same number of molecules.          The molecular viscosity  is propor
tional to the force exerted on       liquid molecule in order to maintain
                                     a
its velocity equal to unity under the unit conditions above defined.
With the units chosen      it the force in dynes exerted on the molecular
                                is
area in square centimetres uuder unit conditions.             The molecular
viscosity work may be regarded as proportional to the work spent in
moving a molecule through the average distance between two ad jncent
molecules under unit conditions.        In ordinary unitsit   is the work in
ergs required to move a surface equal to the molecular area in square
centimetres through the molecular length in centimetres.
   In the case of the comparison of the viscosity coefficients at the
boiling point,   it  found
                      is    :

series the coefficients diminish.    In one series the coefficients increase ;
                                                                   u   2

152          Prof. T. E. Thorpe and Mr.      J. W. Rodger.     [Feb.  22,
in the case of the alcohols the coefficients vary irregularly with ascent
of the series.
    2. Of corresponding compounds, the one having the highest mole
cular weight has in general the highest coefficient (the aliphatic acids,
and to a much greater extent the alcohols, do not conform with this
rule).
    3. Normal propyl compounds have, as a rule, slightly higher values
than aJlyl compounds ; in the case of the alcohols, propyl compounds
have much the higher value.
    4. The effect of molecular weight in some cases may be more than
counterbalanced by that of constitution, or of complexity.
    5. The lowest members of homologous series frequently exhibit
deviatioDS from the regularity shown by higher members.
    6. An iso-componnd has in general a larger coefficient than a
normal compound, and the differences reach their maximum in the
case of the alcohols.
    7. In  the case of other metameric substances, branching in the
atomic chain and the symmetry of the molecule influence the magni
tudes of the coefficients ; the ortho-position, in the case of aromatic
compounds, appears to have a more marked effect on the coefficient
than either the meta- or para-position.         Acetone and ether have
coefficients that are less than half the values given by the isomeric
alcohols.
    8. One of the most striking points thus brought to light is the
peculiar behaviour of the alcohols, and to some extent of the acids,
as contrasted with that of other liquids.
    Comparisons of molecular viscosity at the boiling point show—
    1. That, with the exception of the alcohols, dibromides, and the
lowest members of homologous series, an increment of CH, in chemical
composition corresponds with an increase in molecular viscosity.
    2. With the above exceptions, it is also apparent that the corre
sponding compound having the highest molecular weight has the
 highest molecular viscosity : the difference in molecular viscosity be
tween the corresponding members of two correlated series is fairly
constant.
    3. The relationships shown in the other tables are substantially of
the same nature as those given by the viscosity coefficients.
    The comparisons which give the largest deviation from regularity
contain those substances which, as already shown, exhibit a pecu
 liar behaviour, namely, the alcohols, acids, propylene dibromide,
ethylene dichloride, &c.
    In order to indicate how molecular viscosity at the boiling point is,
quantitatively connected with chemical nature, attempts were made
to calculate the probable partial effects of the atoms on the molecular

            Double-linkage
            Ring-grouping
    As regards the meaning to be attached to fundamental viscosity
 constants in general, the following points- may be noted. Viscosity
 may be taken as a measure of the attractive forces in play be
 tween molecules, i.e., of intermolecular attraction.         From the fact
 that an increment of CH2 in chemical composition, or the substitu
 tion of an atom of chlorine, bromine, or iodine for an atom of
 hydrogen, brings about a definite change in the viscosity, it is evi
 dent that intermolecular attraction is really a property of the atoms
 forming molecules.          Bat, besides change in molecular weight,
 change    in the  mode  of  grouping of the same atoms also affects the
 magnitude of the viscosity.          The observations show that iso-com-
 pounds have values differing from those of isomeric normal com
 pounds ; ring compounds have not the values which, by the study of
 straight chain compounds, they might be expected to have. Com
 pounds containing hydroxyl oxygen give values of the viscosity
 differing widely from those of compounds containing carbonyl
 oxygen.      The same atoms must, therefore, exert different effects
 when differently linked together. That the effects of all1 the atoms
 in the molecule are not altered by ehange in the mode of linkage is
 proved by the fact that the effect of CH2, of iodine, of bromine, &c,
 is the same in normal and in iso-compounds.
    In the present state of the question it is impossible to say what
  particular atoms are affected by change in the mode of linkage.
  Hence the method adopted in deducing fundamental constants is to
  assume that certain atoms retain the same values under all conditions,

154         Prof. T.   E   Thorpe and Mr.     J. W. Rodger.       [Feb. 22,
whilst the change in the values of those atoms which are affected by
the mode of linkage is, when possible, expressed either by a new con
stant — the value of an iso-linkage, a double linkage, &c, or by saying
that a particular atom has assumed a new value, e.g., carbonyl oxy
gen, hydroxyl oxygen, &c.       In some cases the method of calculation
 may lead to the result that a negative constant is ascribed to a particular
 atom.    In deducing the values of carbon and hydrogen, for example,
 it is implied that in a CHa group and in the molecule of a paraffin
 the individual effect of each atom of carbon or of hydrogen is the same.
 The above facts, and the reasoning based upon them, show that this
 is not the case, and although the absolute effect exerted by each atom
 upon the viscosity is positive, the fundamental constant of an atom
 may be negative, as it may involve a constitutive effect, which at
 present cannot be localised in a particular region of the molecule.
 For these reasons fundamental constants are to be regarded as em
 pirically ascertained magnitudes, which are merely intended to indi
 cate how far the observed results may be represented as the sum of
partial values which are the same for all substances.        They have no
reference to the possible behaviour of the elements when in the free
state ; they simply show how far definite changes in chemical nature
correspond with definite changes in viscosity.
    Tables are given which show the concordance between the observed
molecular viscosity and those calculated by means of these constants.
In the case of forty-five liquids the difference between the observed and
calculated values rarely exceeds 5 per cent. In the case of the isomeric
ketones and aromatic hydrocarbons, the differences are in part due to
constitutive influences, which cannot at present be allowed for in ob
taining the calculated values.
    In a second table are given those substances for which the differ
ences exceed this 5 per cent, limit. These may be roughly classed as
unsaturated hydrocarbons, polyhalogen compounds, formic and acetic
acids, benzene, water, and the alcohols.
    Similar fundamental constants for molecular viscosity work at the
boiling point have also been deduced.       These are given in the table
on p. 15.5.
    Tables are also given showing the comparison between the observed
and calculated numbers, the substances being classified into two
groups, as in the case of molecular viscosity, according as the differ-
ences are less or greater than about 5 per cent.
   On taking a general survey of the comparisons at the boiling point,
it is evident that for the majority of the substances examined— the
paraffins and their monohalogen derivatives, the sulphides, the
ketones, the oxides, and most of the acids and the aromatic hydro*
carbons — molecular viscosity and molecular viscosity work may be

stances — unsaturated hydrocarbons, di- and poly-halogen compounds,
formic acid, benzene,       water, and the alcohols — present marked ex
ceptions to the foregoing regularities.
   As regards the comparison of the viscosity magnitudes at the Corre
sponding temperature, it is found that, although the critical data are
too unsatisfactory to warrant us in laying any particular stress on
the relationships obtained under this condition of comparison, these
relationships are Bimilar to, even if less definite than, those obtained
at the boiling point.      For a property like viscosity, which alters so
rapidly with temperature, a corresponding temperature is no better
as a condition of comparison than the boiling point.
   On comparing the viscosity curves of those substances which give
the best physicochemical relationships at the boiling point, it was at
once seen that the general shape of the curves towards the boiling
point was practically the same.           If tangents were drawn to the
curves  at  points corresponding     with  the boiling points of the liquids,
the inclinations of the tangents to the axes, that is, the slopes of the
curves, varied but little. On the other hand, the curves for liquids
such as the alcohols, or the lowest members of homologous series,
which gave little indication of physicochemical relationships, had in
variably a different shape ; the inclinations of tangents drawn at the
boiling point were markedly different from those of the majority of
substances.      It seemed probable, therefore, that the discrepancies
were related to this difference in the value of the slopes, and that, if
the temperature of comparison was chosen so as to eliminate this
difference, better relationships ought to be obtained. This idea led

156          Prof. T. E. Thorpe and Mr.     J. W. Rodger.       [Feb.  22,
to the adoption of temperatures of equal slope as comparable tempera
tures, and, indeed, apart altogether from considerations such as the
above,   which refer to the particular case of viscosity, much may be
said, from a theoretical point of view, in favour of employing such
temperatures for physicochemical comparisons in general.
    To begin with, at the temperature of equal slope, the effect of
temperature upon the property examined is the same for different
substances.     In the case of viscosity, for instance, dy/di, or the rate
at which viscosity is being altered by the temperature, has the same
value for all liquids, and this equality might be taken as sufficient
justification for supposing that at temperatures of equal slope the
substances, so far as viscosity is concerned, are in comparable states.
   Another argument which may be advanced in favour of such a
method of treatment is that the comparable temperatures are chosen
by means of a study of the effect of temperature on the property
actually examined. The main objection which can be urged against
the boiling point as a comparable temperature, even when, as in the
case of such a property as density, it gives comparatively definite
stoichiometric relationships, is that these relationships may not be
general. If, however, comparable temperatures be chosen, as in the
case of slope by a study of the property considered, the generality of
the relationships obtained can be ascertained without the study of
other properties of the substances.
   Comparisons were made, therefore, at temperatures at which dy/dt
is the same for the different liquids. Or, graphically, the temperatures
may be defined as those corresponding with points on the viscosity
curves at which tangents are equally inclined to the axes of co
ordinates. The temperatures are therefore those at which temperature
is exercising the same effect on viscosity, and for shortness may be
termed temperatures of equal slope. The temperatures were obtained
by means of Slotte's formula.
    It was apparent from the shape of the curves that all the liquids
could not be compared at any one value of the slope, because the
effect of temperature on the slope varied so much from substance
 to substance.   In some cases — the whole of the alcohols for example—
 the slope at the boiling-point was considerably greater than that at
0° in the case of some of the less viscous liquids. A slope was, there
fore, selected at which as many liquids as possible could be com
pared.     Another slope was then obtained at which the outstanding
liquids   could  be compared with as many as possible of the liquids
used at the original value of the slope. The relationships between the
magnitudes of the viscosities of these liquids which could be com
pared at the two slopes were then found to be the same at either slope,
so that general conclusions regarding the behaviour of all the liquids
could be deduced. These are as follows : —

1894.]    The Viscosity of Liquids and their Chemical Nature.          157
   1. Temperatures        of equal slope tend to reveal much more definite
relationships between the values of viscosity coefficients and the
chemical nature of the substances than are obtained at the boiling
point.
   2. In all    homologous series, with the exception of those of the
alcohols, acids, and dichlorides, the effect of CH, on the value of the
coefficient is positive, and tends to diminish as the series is ascended.
   3. Of corresponding compounds the one of highest molecular
weight has the highest coefficient.
   4. Normal propyl compounds have slightly larger coefficients than
the corresponding allyl compounds.
   5. An iso-compound has invariably a larger coefficient than a
normal compound.
   6. In the case of other isomers the orientation of the molecule and
branching of the atomic chain influence the magnitudes of the
coefficients.    Similar effects of constitution are also exhibited on
comparing saturated and unsaturated hydrocarbons, and the variable
effects produced by successive substitution of halogen for hydrogen.
   7. The alcohols, and to some extent the acids, still give results
which are peculiar when compared with other substances.
   As regards molecular viscosity at equal slope the following con
clusions may be drawn : —
   1. For the great majority of the substances molecular viscosity at
equal slope can be calculated from fundamental constants which
express not only the partial effects of the atoms existing in the
molecule, but also those due to different atomic arrangements. These
are given in the accompanying table           : —

   The large effects which can be attributed to the ring-grouping of
atoms, to the iso-linkage, to double-linkage, and to changes in the
condition of oxygen in its compounds, as well as the smaller effects
due to the accumulation of atoms of halogen in a molecule, render
evident the quantitative influence of constitution.
   2. Of the remaiuing substances the chlormethanes, tetrachlor-
ethylene, ethylidene chloride and carbon bisulphide give deviations
from the calculated values on account of constitutive influences not
allowed for in obtaining the fundamental constants.
   3. The alcohols and water exhibit no agreement with the calculated
values. The mode in which deviations vary indicates, in the case of
the alcohols, that the disturbing factor is related to their chemical
nature.
  The results obtained from the consideration of molecular viscosity
work at equal slope, are of precisely the same nature as those dis
cussed under molecular viscosity.
  The fundamental constants are as follows                 :   —

   The substances which give deviations from the calculated values
fall into two classes. In the first the deviations are to be attributed
to chemical constitution, inasmuch as similar disturbing effects may
be detected in the magnitudes of other physical properties which afford
no evidence of being influenced by molecular complexity.
  In the second are substances like the acids, water, and the alcohols,
for which the disturbing factor             is,   no doubt, molecular complexity.
  The question of the generality of the results obtained                is   next dis
cussed.    It   is   evident   :

   1. That over such temperature ranges as the observations extend
the results obtained at a particular value of the slope may be
regarded as general for all liquids, with the exception of the alcohols,
for which the relationships vary slightly as the slope alters.           A
general expression connecting the viscosity coefficient with the slope
is given.
   2. It is farther indicated, from comparisons made by the use of
slopes which varied from liquid to liquid, and which were chosen
according to definite systems, that in the present state of the question
equal slope is the most suitable condition at which to compare the
viscosities of different liquids.
   With respect to the relationships existing between the magnitudes
of the comparable temperatures of equal slope, it appears : —
   1. That these vary in a regular way with the chemical nature of
the substances, except in the case of liquids like benzene and propylene
dibromide, giving viscosity curves which are abnormal when com
pared with those of their homolognes.
   2. The temperature relationships may also be regarded as general
and thus independent of the value of the slope, except in the case of
the alcohols, which, in this respect, as in that of viscosity at equal
slope, are anomalous.
   The rest of the memoir is concerned with the discussion of certain
general conclusions regarding physicochemical comparisons ; and it
finally deals with other possible methods of obtaining and comparing
viscosity magnitudes.

   Note on some Changes in the Blood of the General Circula

        Superintendent of the Brown Institution, London. Re

                                       [PlATB  L]
   In result of an acute inflammatory process of even limited local
extent alterations, that have been long recognised, take place in the
blood of the general circulation. These alterations are (1) hyper-
inosis, or increased yield of fibrin ; (2) leucocytosis, or numerical
increase of leucocytes.
   Of all the phenomena of inflammation the most fundamental, apart
from the local degeneration of the involved tissue, is, without doubt,
abnormal exudation of intravascular fluid.               The latter process must
produce changes in the blood in general circulation, as well as in that
in  the vascular       area locally disturbed.       It is these general heeraic
changes incident on local inflammation with which my experiments
deal, especially with certain features of the inflammatory leucocy
tosis.
                                      I. Methods.
   The inflammatory lesion           I  have established by trauma of one or
other     kind,  induced     generally by thermal means.           When the seat
 chosen for the lesion has been in the limb, the procedure has been as
 follows.

162        Prof. C. S. Sherrington.           On Changes       ir the  Blood
    The animal being deeply anssthetised, the nerves to the limb hare
been carefully severed, in order to destroy sensation in the limb.
Then the main artery to the limb (femoral or brachial) has been
occluded by digital compression, and the extremity of the member
immersed in water at 52° C. for five minutes.                    The limb has then
been wiped dry, the animal allowed             to recover from anaesthesia, and
replaced in its stall.
    The blood was examined at least once before establishment of the
lesion. Afterwards a series of examinations were made, and these,
with records of body-temperature and respiration, furnish the chief
observations obtained from the experiments.
    When the site of the lesion has been in an abdominal organ the
same general plan has been followed, except that, as a rale, no nerve
has been severed. Sponges steeped in 0-6 per cent, aqueous NaCl solu
tion at 52° C. were applied for five minutes to a knuckle of intestine,
brought to a small incision in the linea alba ; the gut was then care
fully replaced, and the wonnd closed, the whole performed with strict
precautions for asepsis.         In several instances, instead of the above
plan, mechanical trauma was employed in the form of ligation of the
knuckle of intestine. In several experiments where inflammation,
primarily of a mucous surface, was requisite, use was made of specific
 chemical irritants in the form of cathartics administered by the
 stomach ; but I have for the present endeavoured to avoid the use of
 chemical and bacterial irritants.
     For the examination of the blood " drop " methods have been used
throughout ; the withdrawal of even quite small quantities of blood
 from the circulation induces rapid alteration in the circulating blood
 itself.    By "drop" methods this source of error is avoided. More
         "         " methods have the
 over      drop                              advantage of not necessitating any
 binding down or tying of the animal, and it has by several authori
 ties* been shown that these fixations of the animal, especially when
 continued over longish periods, induce of themselves severe changes
 in the composition of the blood. The animals employed have been
 the dog and cat, and occasionally the rabbit.                   The drop of blood
 required for examination has been almost always taken from the pinna
 of the ear.
    For the counting of corpuscles    I  have used a selected pair of previously tested
 Thoma-Zeiss " counters."      The instruments are guaranteed to vary in capacity by
 less than 1 per cent, of the capacity of each, i.e., by less than 0 001 ram.. My pair
 showed no difference measurable under the magnification of the Zeiss Objective D.
 I  have therefore discarded enumerations which have not tallied on the two counters
 within 10 per cent.    I have not used the Thoma-Zeiss pipette, but one by Hawksley,
 containing no bead, and of a different Bhape from the Thoma-Zeiss pipette.      Objec-

 tions to the Thoma-Zeiss      pipette   are, the large surface relatively to cubic content,
 the   difficulty of drying the bead quickly enough for use in successive observations,
 and the presumption that leucocytes will adhere to the bead.
    I  have always counted both chromocytes and leucocytes in. the same film of the
diluted blood, and in the taunt film enumerated the representatives of the various
kinds of leucocytes distinguishable,        e.g., finely granular, coarsely granular, large
hyaline, small hyaline.        I   imagine the carrying out of the enumeration of all
the elements on one and the same film to be a point of importance.              The methods
of counting in which the enumeration of chromocytes is carried out in one film,
that of leucocytes in a second, and the determination of the numerical proportion
between varieties of leucocytes in a third and fourth, let a number of possible and
probable variants into the observation which are excluded in carrying out the whole
operation upon one and the same large film. Certain countings it is naturally
impossible to combine in one and the same film ; for instance, those dependent on
the colour reactions introduced by Ehrlich cannot be combined with enumerations
on a living film ; but it is possible to translate the one results into the other, and to
make in that way the two modes of counting yield, as it were, control observa
tions.
    For diluting   the blood,  I have   used the following solution    : —
                      Distilled water                     »     300 grams.
                      Sodium chloride                             I'2 „
                       Neutral potass, oxalate                     1'2   „
                      Ehrlich's purified methyl blue . .          O'l gram.
    The chromocytes are not laked in it for several hours at the ordinary tempera
ture of    the room. The leucocytes of the dog, cat, and rabbit are not lulled by
immersion in it for several hours ; they are reduced to a sluggish condition, and at
the   ordinary temperature of the room do not locomote over the floor of the counter.
This fluid is preferable to Thoma's 0 3 per cent, acetic solution, which soon kill*
the leucocytes outright, and rapidly destroys much of their finer structural charac
ter.    The object of the acid solution is to render invisible the chromocytes by
lairing them.      When blood is diluted only ten times, as is usual for counting leuco
cytes in the Thoma-Zeiss apparatus, the number of chromocytes present tends to
obscure the leucocytes.        Myself, I met that difficulty in my earlier countings
(although chromocytes       and   leucocytes were always, both of them, enumerated in
one and the same film), by rendering                the chromocytes, after counting them,
invisible by freezing, and proceeding to count the leucocytes.             The freezing was
done by     placing the counter on a carefully levelled freezing microtome, freezing the
film   for a few seconds, and then letting it thaw again. Most of the chromocytes
 are thus laked, and the leucocytes are most of them little altered.           The difficulty
 arising from condensation of moisture on the cover glass is met by using the water
 immersion objective.      It seems better, however, to dilute the blood more freely than
 ten times, and not to freeze the film.       I have latterly always used the solution in the
 proportion of 48 parts to 1 part of blood. This admixture allows of the chromocytes
 being easily counted, the normal blood of the dog offering then about 33 chromocytes
 per square on the floor of the counter.
    In counting leucocytes one of the most serious mishaps that can occur is for
 the leucocytes to cluster or " ball."         It is obvious that where this has happened
 the enumeration is useless.           The hyaline leucocytes seem less sticky than do
 the granular leucocytes.         There is always, however, a tendency for all leuco
 cytes to clump in this way.          In the above fluid in the above proportion, I have
 had to reject very few observations on account of clumping.               The basis obtained
  for numerical calculation is, of course, reduced by increase of dilution.              This

164          Prof. C. S. Sherrington.               On Changes         in  the  Blood
I   have remedied        by increasing the area for enumeration on the floor of the
counter.       I have always counted all the leucocytes found on the whole ruled floor-
tpace of the two countert, i.e., not merely on the squares, but outside them, as far
as the ruled lines extended.         The area thus obtained was in one of the counters
 (Counter A)       6} that of the squared area. In the other counter (Counter B) it was
4 j g j , the size   of the squared area ; this I have treated as 5. As basis for calcula
         I
tion, have had, therefore, instead of the usually ascertained actual number of leuco
cytes in 0 01 mm. of blood, the actual number in 0"0215 mm. of blood, a basis
more than twice as wide.          The counting has been made on the Zeiss movable stage
on his Stativ IV, 1, with the dry 4 mm. apoohromatic objective, usually combined
with ocular 8. Countings have been occasionally carried on on the warm 8tag«
 (Israel's).

     The specific gravity of the blood is estimated by Roy's* method,
as in the observations by Copeman and myself .f                         The specific gravity
of the blood serum is also observed by Roy's method. The blood is
previously centrif uged in capillary tubes. Havilland and Lloyd Jones}:
have both employed the centrifuge for separating corpuscles from
fluid in minute quantities of blood received into capillary tubes.
    The exact procedure with me has been as follows.                    A drop of blood, as it
 exudes from a prick in the skin, is taken by capillarity into a fine, freshly drawn
 glass tube, like a vaccine tube, but longer, and bent into a U shape.             The capillary
 (J -tube is then placed with its bent end downwards into a "bucket" on the centri
fuge, or in a radial slot on a vulcanite disc ; the two open ends will then lie toward
the centre of rotation, and in a few minutes a clear layer of serum or plasma is
obtained in each limb of the tube. The specific gravity of the supernatant fluid
can be readily ascertained by Boy's method.                I  say serum or plasma, because it
is surprising how often no trace of fibrin seems             to exist in the clear layer, even
on standing for a long time.
      The clear fluid       I   have often found to be absolutely cell free.                   I
                                                     I
 shall refer to the fluid as serum, but suspect that in several instances
it was pure plasma.                            •
    Where the temperature          is recorded, the rectal temperature in degrees centi
grade is meant.         By respiratory rate is meant number of inspirations per minute.

tinguish are explained more fully on pp. 186 — 194.                            The nomencla

   The number of chromocytes per unit volume blood           greate" in                  is
cat's blood than in dog's blood. Tlie individual chromocytes are
smaller in the former according to Gulliver,* the average diameter
                                  ;
in cat    1/4404 in.; in dog, 1/3542 in.

chromocytes in normal cat's blood       distinctly lower than in dog's

         ;     probably
                      is   result of the greater number of the smaller

chromocytes per unit volume of cat's blood.
   In the blood of nearly one half of the dogs        have examined, a  I
few nucleated chromocytes have been met with. It has been so in
some instances with old dogs (in half-grown puppies they are found in
numbers)    in all instances the dogs were not known to be ailing
                  ;                                                                                       ;
some were certainly very active and well-nourished.    The nucleated
chromocytes were always of the kind called normoblasts.      In adult
cats the blood seems to contain nucleated chromocytes less commonly,
but have met with them.

   The specific gravity of the serum of cat's blood has in my experi
ments averaged distinctly higher than that of doer's blood.
  The coarsely grannlar leucocyte appears rather more numerous in
cat's blood than in dog's. Certain differences between the coarsely
granular leucocytes in the two species will be mentioned in a short
description of the leucocytes (p. 189.)

  Under the conditions       of experiment the changes in the blood
generally circulating were as follows : —
    1. The specific gravity of the blood was increased.
    2. The specific gravity of the serum was slightly lessened or re
mained not obviously altered.
    3. The hemoglobin     content of the unit volume of blood was
increased.
    4. The number of chromocytes in the unit volume of blood was
increased.
    5. The numerical ratio of leucocytes to chromocytes in the unit
volume of blood was always increased, sometimes after a preliminary
decrease of the ratio.
   (5.  The number of leucocytes in the unit volume of blood was at
 firHt slightly diminished and then increased much later there was
                                                            ;
 sometimes a fall to below normal.
  7.    The numerical ratio of coarsely granular leucocytes to chromo
cytes in the unit volume of blood was diminished.
    8. The number of coarsely granular leucocytes in the unit volume
of blood was diminished.
        The numerical ratio of coarsely granular to the rest of the leuco
cytes was diminished.
     10. The numerical ratio of finely granular to the rest of the leuco
 cytes was greatly increased after a certain time.
     11. The number of hyaline leucocytes in the unit volume of blood
boeame less.
  12.  Haemoglobin in solution appeared in the plasma of the blood,
and of the lymph in the thoracic duct, and of the exudation fluid in
tje limb.
  13.     There    seemed     to be    a   certain    small     nnmber   of   nucleated

         consequent upon Inflammations             of  acute local Character.     171

                                  I
this was always the case am not certain,
    14. The rapidity of clotting of the blood was increased, and the
lymph also clotted well.
  (2.) The Seat of       the  Local Inflammation is in the Abdominal Cavity.
     The inflammation          was induced as above described in a tract of
the small intestine.            The following are examples of the experi

     One coarsely granular leucocyte met in counting through 2,000 leucocytes in
       cover-glass preparations.      The films, both fresh and dried, show obvious but
       not extremely severe leucocytosis.
   Under these conditions of experiment the changes in the blood of
the general circulation resembled in their main features the results
observed in the experiments of series (I).                     I   will not therefore
recapitulate the results.             I will merely add that the addition of
nucleated chromoblasts to the blood seemed less uncertain in these
experiments than in the experiments on the limb.
   A modified form of the experiment consists in simply ligating the
knuckle of intestine, and returning it with aseptic precautions into
the peritoneal cavity.           This modification, although the same main
changes in the blood were as before brought about, did not give quite
the same sequence of events.              I  quote examples.

   The results         in this series have followed in their broad features
those of the previous.           The difference from those seems one of degree
rather than of kind.
   Heidenhain* has observed that in the intestinal mucous membrane
of the dog the number of cells with oxyphil granulation is increased
by a purgative.          He leaves it open whether his cells are the same as
the oxyphil cells of the blood, and Ehrlich could not give a definite
opinion on the point. A notable feature in my experiments, of this
series as of the others, has been the great numerical reduction
of the oxyphil (^-.-granulation, coarsely granular) leucocytes in the
circulating blood.          I believe that a similar though much less marked
diminution of these cells follows the ingestion of a full meal, and also
that abstinence from food causes in the blood a higher percentage of
the cell (vide infra, p. 205).

          consequent upon Inflammations          of acute local Character.         181
              III.   .Remarks on the Hjemic Changes observed.
    In this   note   I propose   to remark briefly on the significance to be
 attached to the above haemic changes.
                          (I.) The Apoplasmia of the Blood.
    The measurements shew that consequent upon an acute local in
flammation, the circulating blood becomes inspissated in the sense
that it loses some of its plasma, while its chromocy tes do not escape,
or at least not in direct proportion to the loss of plasma.                     There
results, therefore, an apoplasmia of the blood, referable, doubtless, to
increased exudation through the vascular membrane in the inflamed
area.      The amount of flnid lost to the circulation by the vascular
leakage at the locus Icesionis is thus shown to be not equalised by in
creased entrance of lymph into the circulation, via thoracic duct, &c.
The local tumor itself consists partly of flnid exudation, whence it is
obvious that not all the actual fluid exuded is returned forthwith by
the lymph drainage system.            It is conceivable that the loss of fluid
from the blood, threatening as it must, an upset of various mechanical
arrangements in the pircnlation, would be remedied at once or very
soon by call upon the tissue lymph of various other regions, especially
as Heidenhain has shown that such a call can be made by chemical
means appealing through the circulation. The above observations
negative this idea. The plasma of the blood as regards quantity is
neither maintained nor speedily re-established.              The facts show that
the call on the lymph of other parts, if made, does not at least suffice
to speedily restore to the blood its normal quantity of fluid.                 Nor is
the phenomenon simply a case of lost time between the escape of the
fluid from the circulation and its return again into the circulation ;
it persists for too considerable a period.              In one experiment the
Wood for more than sixty hours was apoplasmic to the extent that its
specific gravity remained heightened 0,021 (water                    TOOO)      above
normal, while the specific gravity of its serum (plasma) was not
heightened at all, indeed was 0-002 less than at outset of experiment.
Nor need it be extreme in order to be long-lasting, as the following
exemplifies     : —

   Although never extreme in degree, the apoplasmia of the                           blood
here lasted through five days, in consequence of a carefully-conducted
surgical operation accompanied by no untoward event, and soon
ending favourably.
   The degree of apoplasmia appears to depend in some measure upon
the extent of the vascular area involved in the inflammation. For
example, when both feet are involved in the lesion the apoplasmia is
more severe than in experiments affecting one foot only.
   Such an apoplasmia must notably increase the friction-coefficient of
the blood.
   Whether apoplasmia of the blood is an accompaniment in appre
ciable degree of all extensive local inflammation                  I  cannot yet *ay.

   Autopsy made at 7 p.m. revealed no haemorrhage ; I suspected the
fall in the specific gravity might be due to haemorrhage, and so per
formed autopsy at once to see the seat of it. There was a not very
copious exudation into the pleural cavity ; the pleural surface showed
patches of inflammatory cells, but among these not many coarsely
granular were found in my examination of them.
    It is noticeable that, although the apoplasmia of the blood was here
absent, there was, nevertheless, a great reduction in the number of
ooarsely granular leucocytes, not merely relatively to the rest of the
leucocytes, but absolutely per unit volume of blood.
    In the experiments with the ligation of a piece of intestine and
mesentery, the apoplasmia developed later than in the other series.

184         Prof. C. S. Sherrington.              On CJumges in the Blood
of ligation of the vessels of the spleen, and varions other forms of
experimental interference with the contents of the abdominal cavity,
including even the simple opening of the cavity by an incision through
the linea alba, are all followed by increase in the specific gravity of the
blood.        In these eases there occurred increase in the specific gravity
usually detectible In thirty minutes or less from the completion of
the operation.           I was therefore somewhat surprised to meet so long a
latent period for the reaction in the case of the ligation of the in
testine or mesentery of the dog.                 But in the rabbit interference with
the abdomen so disturbs the normal respiration (in rabbits respiration
is almost entirely abdominal) that complications arise which are far
more considerable than in the dog ; e.g., in the rabbit the blood
pressure often exhibits under these conditions a considerable tempo
rary depression, and the respiratory rate is very greatly hurried.
W. Hanter*has observed in this animal an increase of specific gravity
of the blood to follow interperitoneal transfusion.                 By Copeman and
myself it was suggested that this inspissation of the blood is a con
comitant, or even a symptom, of " abdominal shock."                         Subsequent
observations by          Mr.  Griinbaum      and  by  myself, but  especially by Pro
fessor Roy and Dr. Cobbett, have confirmed its association with
abdominal operations, but              I  would now extend its scope to a large
number of other inflammatory lesions.
              (II.)    Changes    in the Total Number of      the Leucocytes.
    That the number of leucocytes per unit volume of circulating blood
is increased in many cases of acute local inflammation is a fact estab
lished by the researches of numerous observers. Some of the most
recent and detailed observations on this point are by v. Limbeckt
and by Rieder.J             They supply careful measurements of the degree of
        "
this inflammatory leucocytosis."                   With a number of their observa
tions my own are fully in accord. In two respects, however, our
observations do not agree.
    V. Limbeck states that leucocytosis always commences prior to the
occurrence of any inflammatory exudation ; the exudation is a result
of the leucocytosis ; to my mind his observations do not prove the
fact.       Certainly, from a number of my experiments,                   I should con
 clude      rather      the reverse, because the blood became obviously
 apoplasmic prior to any increase of the number of leucocytes in it.

that, although the fact is not mentioned by them nor obtainable from
their measurements, he would expect a diminution in the number of
leucocytes in the circulating blood to precede the leucocyjtosis.              I have
a number of observations which demonstrate the accuracy of this
supposition by Lowit. It seems the rule for inflammatory leucocytosis
to be preceded by a leucocytopenia (Lowit's term).                   This preliminary
leucocytopenia of the blood is the more remarkable when, instead of
the number of leucocytes per unit volume of blood, the numerical'
ratio of leucocytes to chromocytes is studied. If the total number of
leucocytes remained the same there would, as a result of the apo-
plasmia at this time, appear to be an increased number of them per
unit volume of blood.
     The degree of leucocytosis whieh occurred in the experiments
was often very considerable.               The number of leucocytes per unit
volume of blood was in some instances increased sevenfold. A small
part only of such an increase aa this can be accounted for by the co
existing degree of apoplasmia of the blood. The highest ratio of
leucocytes to chromocytes observed in my experiments has been
 1 :   136,  a proportion    corresponding very closely with the highest
observed in Lowit's* experiments, dealing with another form of
leucocytosis, viz., that following intravenous injection of albumoses,
 Ac. But the ratio 1 : 136 was observed in the dog, and is not nearly
so abnormal a ratio as the ratio- 1 : 140 observed in one of the experi
 ments on the pleural cavity of the cat.                   Lowit experimented on
 rabbits, so that my ratios are not strictly comparable with. his. The
 largest number of leucocytes met with per c. millimeter of blood has
 been in my experiments 55,000, the number at the outset of the par
 ticular experiment being 7,750.
     The statement by v. Limbeck^ supported by Gottlieb' Pick, J
 that inflammatory leucocytosis does not appear in inflammations ac
 companied by slight exudation, but accompanies those causing marked
 exudation, has not been found to hold good in my experiments, e.g.,
 in case of inflammation in pleural cavity hardly any exudation but
 marked leucocytosis.
     Frequently the leucocytosis is followed by a final leucocytopenic
  phase (<;/. Example on page 175).               This does not always occur; but
  it is occasionally very marked.           I have only seen it happen when the
  temperature    has  fallen  below    normal, and the exitus lethalis is not far
  off.   In one instance the leucocytes fell to less than 2000 per c. milli
  meter.

   Before attempting to consider the nature of the upset produced in
the ratios normal between the various sets of leucocytes in the blood, it
seems necessary to give some characteristics of the different sorts of
heemic leucocytes         I  have endeavoured to distinguish.             The confused
condition of the terminology applied to the subject has led of late
more than once to the misapprehension of an ebserver's descriptions.

This would hope to avoid by prefacing my summary with a short
account of 'the "varieties of hsemic leucocytes which               I  have studied.
   I  have for the present confined the observations requiring the sort
ing of the leucocytes to experiments on the dog and cat.                        I wish it
to be understood "that, except where distinctly otherwise stated, this

corroborated Wharton Jones' separation of the two kinds of cell,
and through the work of the last authority the distinction be
came widely known.               M. fjichultze noted besides the ahove certain
other "smallest" and "small" kinds of leucocytes.                         These    I   have

activity of the cell.            If the cell is allowed to quiet slowly down be
fore it is killed, I have shownf that the nucleus then very usually re
turns to spheroidal form.              Of course the cell body becomes spheroidal
much sooner than the nucleus. In the slowly killed cell the nucleus
usually becomes excentric in situation as well as spherical in shape.
It    m also especially liable to smear.              In the counting solution          the
nucleus of this cell does not tinge so readily as does that of the
hyaline leucocyte. Under certain circumstances, when kept for a
number of hours in vitro, the nucleus of this leucocyte frequently
presents a curious appearance                 I  have not found described.             The
appearance is shown in figs. 6 and 7 (Plate 1). A number of portions
of the nucleus are set in a wreath-like manner around the approxi
mate centre of the cell.            I  have never observed this arrangement in
the nucleus of the coarsely granular or hyaline leucocyte.

under the prolonged action of aqueous methyl blue solutions, some
granules, especially in the neighbourhood of the nucleus, take on a
bright rose tint, and ultimately                  a considerable amount of rose-
coloured substance in rounded masses, some of large size, appears in
the cell.       But the cell is much altered when this happens, and a good
deal of plasmoschisis has gone on.                   With less departure from the
normal a good deal at least of the granulation of this cell can by
pushing eosin or rnbin be coloured by these acid dyes; Kanthack and
Hardy consider them, strictly speaking, oxyphil.

the coarsely granular leucocyte.                   If kept for an hour or so in

between these kinds of leucocytes.
   The cell can ingest particles, even honrs and days after its removal
from the body. In oxalated blood these cells can often be seen with
crystals inside them as well as adherent to them.       Rarely       I
                                                                   have
seen them contain a chromocyte.        Both crystals and chromocytes,
when contained in the leucocytes, lie nsually in obvious vacuoles. I
have occasionally seen in some of these cells fresh from the circula
tion some sparse small vacuoles, but they are quite uncommon in
blood freshly drawn.    On the other hand after some hours, or better,
one or two days in vitro, the cell frequently becomes riddled with,
small vacuoles (see figs. 2 and 3, Plate 1), so as even to resemble a
flake of froth.    The nucleus is then hard to discover in the fresh cell,
but on staining with basic dyes becomes at once obvious, and is
then found to be no longer markedly polymerous.            The cell in this
frothed condition is still amoeboid, although not very actively, so far
as I  have seen. On the warm stage it however travels fairly in this
condition.    In a great number of the vacuoles fine particles can be
seen, and these show that the vacuoles contain fluid, for the particles
inside them exhibit Brownian movement. Most of the vacuoles are
spherical and small, some are large, as these are for the most part
oval in outline.     In a number of the vacuoles no particles are visible.
                                                      I
    The granules in the normal cell never, so far as have seen, exhibit
Brownian movement, but, when the cell is dead or dying, Brownian
movement often affects its granules in a most marked degree, the cell
body acquiring a shimmering appearance from the dancing of the
 granules.   This is doubtless due to lowered vitality, or perhaps
lethal acidification of the cell giving its protoplasm over to imbibition
 of the aqueous surrounding.      Brownian movement of the grannies of
 a leucocyte    is,in my experience, one of the signs that the cell is
 nearly dead, and have been interested to find
                      I                             it  present in many of
 the cells of certain exudation fluids and pus, although invariably
 absent from the leucocytes of normal blood and lymph.
    In these samples of pus leucocytes with spherical excentrically set
 nuclei occur, and the nuclei have an especial tendency to smear, just
 as in leucocytes which have slowly died in vitro (see fig.      Plate 1).
                                                                4,
    By irrigation of such weakened cells with various saline solutions
 that affect the normal leucocyte but little and leave     it still actively
 amoeboid, the cell body, and very often the nucleus as well, can be
 burst with an explosive discharge of the cell contents, the nucleus
 remaining as   a  shrunken film attached to a fragment of cell-body.
    The finely granular leucocyte forms in the dog and cat about
 70 — 90 per cent, of the hsemic leucocytes.     The vast majority of the

the scanty basophil cells which are so rare as hardly really to be
considered        normal hsemic leucocytes. It must be remembered that
Howell* and Gullandf have shown that in its earliest history the
blood is devoid of all leucocytes.              Essentially all the hemic leuco
cytes are therefore vagrants wandering through blood as through the
other tissues ; thus it becomes difficult to set a sharp line between
leucocytes normally hsemic and leucocytes only abnormally bremic.
Ehrlich includes the basophil cell as an occasional hemic leucocyte.

the intestine       I  found often contain large numbers of these cells.
                         B. The Coarsely Granular Leucocyte.
    This is among the largest of the leucocytes.
    Nucleus is usually somewhat less deeply stained by nuclear dyes
 than the nucleus of the finely granular leucocyte ; is often reniform,
 often irregular, and appearances intermediate between the reniform
 and completely irregular are common.                The nucleus is always more
 or less obvious even when the living cell is spheroid because of ab
 sence of the characteristic granulation in its region.
    Cell-body, in its greater part, contains a number of granules, more
 or less    regularly arranged. The granules are highly refracting (es
 pecially in the cat, but much less so in the horse) ; the granules vary
 in size considerably           in the same individual cell, but usually the
 largest is not more than thrice the size of the smallest.                The shape
 of the granules is usually in the rabbit and dog spherical, in the cat
  cylindroid, in the horse roughly cuboid, but in the cat and horse
  many spheroid grannies are often present.              The average size of the
  cell is about the same in these three types, but the cylindroid grannie
  of the    cat is larger than the spheroid of the dog, and the cuboid
  granule of the horse i3 much larger (diameter about 2/t — 4/<) than the
  cylindroid of the cat.          In the normal cell the granules never exhibit
  Brownian       movement,       but in abnormal conditions Brownian move
  ment sets the particles dancing freely. Under imbibition the granules
  usually lie trembling in the surface-sheet of the cell-body, but some-

 190        Prof, C. S. Sherrington.            On Changes in tlie Blood
times they are withdrawn in a mass to the neighbourhood of the
 nucleus which is often excentric in the cell. It is possible, with care,
when the granules are dancing at the surface of the cell, to so hold
the cell between object slide aDd cover-slip that the dancing of the
 granules at the upper and under poles of the cell is arrested while
the dancing in the equatorial region is unhindered.                  This proves, I
think, not only that the granules are then very close to the surface of
the cell, but that they lie not free under a cell membrane as Ranvier*
suggests, but actnally in a thin cortical layer of the cell.
     As to the nature of the substance composing these granules, the
idea put forward by A. Schmidt,f that it is closely allied to haemo
globin, has by PouchetJ and Hayem§ been pushed so far as for them
to consider the granules to be hremoglobin and pieces of broken chromo-
cytes.      That it is not actually haemoglobin is proved by the absence
of colour from it. Ehrlich and Schwarze|| have also found it does
not give the staining reactions of the chromocytes. The granules
tinge yellow over osmic vapour, but various reactions show that they
are not fat.          They contain a certain amount of water (Ehrlich
and Schwarze) ; they are not soluble in alcohol or ether.                     In the
dried corpuscles they melt (?) and run together, but at a very high
temperature only (Ehrlich). As the water is driven off from them
by slow heat they display a greater and greater affinity for acid
stains (Schwarze).           In the living cell they, in rabbit's blood, became
deeply tinted (to a maroon colour) on irrigation with dilute Ehrlich-
Biondi stain. In the fresh condition in the cat's blood, mixed with
dilute aqueous methyl bine, it has often appeared to me, when using
powerful systems, that each granule is coated with a thin film of sub
stance which becomes bine-violet with this basic dye, and also will
stain with acid fuchsin, a film, in fact, of amphophil substance.                   I
find the granule is soluble in acetic acid, but not in distilled water.
It appears to give the ammoniomolybdate reaction used to reveal
phosphorus by Lilienfeld and Montilf.                The granulation of the finely
granular leucocyte does not yield this reaction, though the cell-body
of the hyaline leucocyte does usually give a faint reaction.                     The
granules of the coarsely granular leucocyte yield the reaction readily
without previous treatment to liberate the phosphorus. The granules

as Renant* concluded, the granules are albuminous, perhaps they
are of the nature of nucleo-albumin.                 Ranvierf has suggested that
they are similar to the yolk-granules in ova, but I find those granules
for by far the most part basophil.
    In the description appended by Strieker to his well-known " Photo-
gramm eines farblosen Blutkorpchen "J (a coarsely-granular leuco
cyte of Proteu3), he states that the particles sometimes show branching
processes, which occasionally unite forming a network of which he
sees evidence in his photogram.                 The granules are always really
absolutely        discrete,  as  shown     in the   photogram appended (Plate 1,
fig.   1).
    The n amber of granules per cell varies considerably. In the dog
and cat it averages between 30 and 60; in the latter animal I have
counted 78 granules and 97 granules in individual cells.                          In the
                                                        —
horse the number is smaller, usually 12 20, but the granules are
much larger (up to 4ft) approaching in size the huge mucin granules
discovered by Reid§ in the slime glands of Myxine.
                      I
    In the dog observe four morphological varieties of this leucocyte,
detectable chiefly by the granulation.
    1. The typical large cell, the body packed with granules, 30— 60 in number.
    2. The ceU contains, instead or granules of fairly uniform size, one or two large,
highly refracting masses, with a scanty number of the usual granules :             I  have
found the larger masses oxyphil, and reacting to the Lilienfeld-Monti method like
the usual granules.
    3. The -cell contains, in addition to the highly refracting granules, a few some
 what smaller rounded granules that appear in the fresh and unstained condition
 indistinguishable      from spherical vacuoles, because the substance they contain
 hardly refracts more than the cell plasma.       These also are oxyphil, like the highly
 refracting     grannies, and sometimes are amphophil.
    4. The cell is quite small ; contains a simple vesicular nucleus ; the nuoleus is
 rather large in proportion to the cell body.          In the latter are coarse, highly
 refracting oxyphil granules, and these are distributed throughout.         Dekhuysen has
 recently pointed out similar cells in amphibian blood.       He looks upon them as the
 young form of the coarsely granular leucocyte ; hut he points out that, if I under
 stand him rightly, the granules are amphophil, not oxyphil.         In this connexion we
  must remember that Ehrlich has himself pointed out that the granules of his
  typical oxyphil cell are sometimes amphophil.
     Varieties       2,  3, and 4 are,     in my experience, uncommon in the
  blood ; when 2 does occur it seems usual for the examples of it to
  bo fairly numerous in the blood of the animal at the time; but in
  most dog's blood it is not to be found at all.

192         Prof. C. S. Sherrington.             On Changes in the Blood
   In cat's blood       I would note three varieties of the cell.
   1. The typical large cell, with its cell body packed with large cylindroid grains.
   2. A cell resembling in all respects the former, except that the granules are not
of the same highly refracting quality, and are generally smaller.       These granules
are oxyphil, like the typical ones.       Variety 2 is not so frequent as 1, but it not
unfrequently forms 10 per cent, of all the coarsely granular leucocytes.
   3. A variety, small, and like 4 of the dog, but with granules tending to be
cylindroid, instead of spheroid.
    The coarsely granular leucocyte is amoeboid.                Myself, from what      I
have seen of it on the warm stage,              I should incline with Lavdowski,*
to consider it the most actively amoeboid of all heemic leucocytes, were
it not for two difficulties. 1. At and below the ordinary temperature
of the room, the cell is usually less actively amoeboid than the finely
granular leucocyte. 2. As a rule, when fixed immediately after with
drawal from the circulation the nucleus is less distorted from a
regular figure than is that of the majority of the finely granular
leucocytes, it is very usually of a simple horse-shoe shape ; now the
degree of irregularity of form of the nucleus may be taken as a rough
index of the amoeboid activity of the cell at the time of fixation.
    I have never, either in freshly drawn blood or in blood kept for a
time in vitro, seen an unmistakable vacuole in the coarsely granular
leucocyte. This stands in. striking contradistinction to one's expe
rience of the finely granular leucocyte. Related to this absence of
vacuolation appears the fact that a number of observers, including
Metschnikoff,f admit the want of evidence that the coarsely granular
hffimic leucocyte is phagocytic.             In my own preparations, when, after
being fed with bacteria in vitro, the great majority of h»mic leuco
cytes have ingested the bacteria (and other particles besides), the
coarsely granular leucocytes have not contained any.
    I   think there is little doubt that, as MiillerJ says, this coarsely
granular cell is Ehrlich's cell with a-granulation — Ehrlich's true oxy
phil cell — the only question is whether his amphophil cell is not also
included.         I gather from Ehrlich's papers, that both his cells witb
a-granulation (true oxyphil) and his cells witb ^-granulation must
really be included in Wharton Jones's " coarsely granular leucocytes,"
and therefore       I  have included both of them together under that head
in my countings.
    It   is a little difficult to assign to this cell a normal percentage in
the blood, because it appears especially subject to numerical variation.
                      I
 In cat's blood have found the cell usually rather more numerous
 than in dog's blood. Considering the two kinds of blood together,                     I

                                   C. The    Hyaline Leucocytes.
     This
        class is probably a less homogeneous collection     than either of
the other two.    Two subdivisions of it are important.     I. Small cells,
lymphocytes.      II. Larger cells, myelocytes. One however often
meets with individuals in whose cfise one feels hesitation before de
ciding as to which of the two subdivisions they shall be assigned.
   I. Small Cells. — These are, for the most part, M. Schultze's
"smallest" cells; the nucleus is spherical, and stains deeply; the
cell body is small, sometimes a mere film coating the nucleus.        The
cell body is apt to stain deeply with methyl blue and other basic dyes.
I agree with Schultze that this cell is not amoeboid in the blood. It
also seems less sticky than the other leucocytes.         In the counting
solution the nucleus of this cell is the first living structure to become
tinged with colour.      When platelets (precipitate) are present these
tinge even earlier, but of a violet colour, whereas the nucleus of the
small hyaline cell takes at first a pure light blue ; and there is no
evidence that the platelets are living structures.
    II. Larger Cells. — Some are among the largest of haamic leuco
cytes.    The cell body encloses a spheroid, ovoid, or reniform nucleus,
the chromatin of which is patchily distributed, and not so condensed
as in the partinucleate leucocytes.       The cell body tinges in many
individuals deeply and evenly with basic dyes, but in other indi
viduals, as Everard, Demoor, and Massart* have especially pointed
out, hardly at all. This cell is, in my experience, sluggishly amoeboid.
It   is,
       however, phagocytic.
I     have very frequently noted that in specimens in which the large
hyaline leucocyte     numerous the small hyaline
                            is                         also more numerous
                                                                     is
than in specimens in which the large hyaline cell         scanty. The two

varieties seem to vary in the same direction.      The number of hyaline
leucocytes varies greatly in normal blood          estimate ;I    to average        it

cytes.    When their number          large the blood

for hours in sealed cells in which the hemoglobin    of the chromocytes
exists in a reduced condition.
   Having thus attempted to state definitely some characters on which
I have depended for distinguishing one variety of hemic leucocyte
from another, I will proceed to a more detailed summary of the
alteration in the numerical relations of the varieties, resulting from
various forms of acute local inflammation.
   As already pointed out, there occurs a diminution of the total
number of hoemic leucocytes (a leucocytopenic phase), followed by
an increase of the total number of heemic leucocytes (a leucocytotic
phase) ; finally, in some experiments there is again a leucocytopenic
phase.
                    First. — The Leucocytopenic Phase.
   This phase has in my experiments always been observable when
the blood analysed was taken within a short time, e.g., less than an
hour, after the establishment of the lesion.
   The decrease in leucocytes affects the finely granular more than
the hyaline, indeed, my countings do not show any absolutely in
dubitable decrease of the hyaline leucocytes. Remembering, how
ever, that the apoplasmia of the blood is being established at this
lime, and that were the hyaline leucocytes to remain undiminished
their number per nnit volnme of blood would be thereby increased,
the actually slight fall of their number in my countings looks as if
they did actually diminish in number, although to a less extent than
do the granular varieties. The fall in their proportion to the chromo-
cytes supports this belief, and seems larger than attributable to the
errors inherent in estimations by sample.
   Interpretations of the significance of the lencocytopenia seem to be
Btill but doubtful inferences.      The term leucocytopenia has been
introduced by Lowit,* and expresses conveniently any relative
scantiness of leucocytes such as that observed.    Whether this inflam
matory form of leucocytopenia is really the same in nature as the
form consequent on binding down the animal, prolonged exposure,
cooling, Ac, described by LOwit, is not clear. Under those circum
stances Lowit discovered the decrease of leucocytes to be especially
due to decrease of the mononuclear variety (= broadly, the hyaline, in
my countings).      Whether, further, the inflammatory leucocytopenia
is related to  the other   form of leucocytopenia (called, on theoretical
grounds, leucolysis), admirably studied by LOwit, demands more
attention here.

bacterial proteins (Buchner),^[^f filtered yeast oultures,§§ carmine in

immediate — diminution of the number of leucocytes in the blood of
the general circulation. This diminution has been shown by Lowitfft
to be preliminary to a subsequent increase, and the phase of leuco-
cytopenia, on account of its short duration, seems to have escaped the
Attention of many observers who have well recognised the much
longer lasting subsequent leucocytosis. The diminution is sometimes
enormous in degree.                  In some of Lowit's experiments the number of
leucocytes          fell    in   five   seconds from the time of injection to less
than one-twentieth the number circulating immediately previous to
 the injection.             Lowit has discovered that the diminution, whether
 great or small, is at expense of the polynuclear leucocytes (the
 granular leucocytes of my countings). He opines that the diminution
 is due to destruction (he says the dissolving up) of these leucocytes.
 His conclusion harmonises with the view of the Dorpat school,
 according to which haemic leucocytes are easily destroyed by a
 number of experimental procedures, some not obviously severe. As to

    Rieder* has, however, urged that the leucocytes are not destroyed;
 but are merely collected or collect in some region of the circulation.
 This region they leave after a time, and then become again distributed
 generally through the circulation, when, according to Rieder, sub
 stances inducing positive chemotaxis reappear in the blood.                        Lowit
 points out that the locus of collection of the leucocytes is not made
 out by Rieder.' Werigo,t on the other hand, has suggested that the
 leucocytes, after the intravenous injection of particulate material,
 crowd into and remain for a time in the liver, spleen, and lungs ; for
 the lungs this has been proved by the recent work of Goldscheider
 and Jacob (Verhandl. der Physiol. Gesellsch. zu Berlin, six, 1893).
 Everard, Demoor, and MassartJ point oat that the medulla of bone
 must be included in the loci of collection, and that the view can be
 extended to the results of injection of substances dissolved, as well as
 particulate.        The recent experiments of Verhoogen§ are particu
 larly interesting in this connection. Moreover, Wright|| has lately
 shown that in the case of admixture of peptone with blood this dimi
 nution of leucocytes does not occur when the admixture is made, not
 in the circulation, but in blood withdrawn from the circulation. We
 cannot consider it as proven that the phenomenon of disappearance
 of leucocytes from the blood of the general circulation is really due
 to direct disintegration and dissolution of them, although the manner
 of their withdrawal from the general circulation has not yet been
.elucidated.        Until the dissolution is proven, it is obvious that leuco-
 cytopenia is a better term for the observed phenomenon than is
 leucocytolysis.
    A relation between the above " injection lencocytopenia " and the
 " inflammatory leucocytopenia " of my experiments seems indicated
 by the fact that in both the diminution is chiefly of the irregularly
 nucleate or granular cells. The connection is rendered still more prob
 able from observations by Everard, Demoor, and Massart.^f                          These
 investigators find a leucocytopenia (their hypoleucocytosis) usually
 precede the leucocytosis induced by subcutaneous and intraperitoneal
 injections, in considerable quantity, of bacterial cultures and culture
 fluids.    This they attribute not to destruction of leucocytes, but to
 the leucocytes crowding into the blood vessels of the liver, spleen, and
 marrow, in virtue of chemotactic reaction. They conclude, further,
 that in their experiments, the lencocytopenia was chiefly due to
 diminution of the irregularly nucleate leucocyte, another point of
 resemblance between the leucocytopenia of the two procedures.

     It is important in interpreting the significance of the inflammatory
 leucocytopenia to remember that the granular (= irregularly nu
 cleate) hsemic leucocytes appear more adhesive than the hyaline
                                                     " balling " of leucocytes
 (mononuclear, regularly nucleate). In the
                                                I
 which so readily occurs in peptone blood, have often noticed that the
clumps of leucocytes may be formed almost exclusively              of granular
leucocytes, while many hyaline leucocytes are free in the plasma. In
oxalated blood the granular leucocytes adhere to the masses of plate
lets disproportionately    in comparison with the lymphocytes ; they
are not merely adherent to the surface of the masses but many are
entangled and often remain for a time hidden in the masses. It is in
teresting to watch how those temporarily buried work their way to
the surface. At first they appear like fusiform fibroblasts directed so
as to radiate from the centre of the ball-shaped mass as it lies flat
tened between object-slide and cover-slip.          The elongated nucleus is
the chief sign of the cell, and this can be noted slowly slipping
toward the periphery of the ball. As it approaches the free surface
of the mass the cell glides more quickly, and finally it emerges with
an almost sudden plunge and ranges itself beside the other similar
leucocytes already sticking to the surface of the clump. Had one not
seen the'steps of the process one might have imagined that the cells
covering the mass of precipitate had wandered to it on account of
its nutritive nature (proteid) and in obedience to positive chemo-
taxis. As a fact however most at least of the cells have been merely
mechanically entangled in the mass and gradually get out of it
and then stick for a while to its free surface.
    It must be remembered also that the hyaline leucocytes are not so
amoeboid as the granular ; the small variety of them not at all.
Emigration will remove from the circulation more individuals of the
granular than of the hyaline types. The granular leucocytes tend
disproportionately numerously to adhere and escape in the vascular
region of the local inflammation.       This would increase the relative
number of hyaline cells to granular in the general circulation.
   Other possible factors may be briefly alluded to. Many of the
 substances that when injected into the circulation cause lencocyto
penia are the lympJiagogues of Heidenhain.*             They belong to that
class of lymphagogues which increase the flow of lymph from the
thoracic duct by hastening the transfer of fluid from the blood into
the lymph spaces.      Heidenhain showed that in the dog these lympha
gogues, although increasing the volume and organic richness of the
output of lymph, via thoracic duct, reduce the volume and organic
richness of the serum of the blood itself.        LOwitf has shown that in
the rabbit, as result of intravenous injection of albnmose, &c, the

lencocytopenia and the lyrophorrhcea occur together ; hut he does
not find the apoplasmia of the blood noted by Heidenhain.           In my
experiments throughout the leucocytopenic phase of the blood the
apoplasmia of it was obvious and steadily progressive.           have not          I
yet systematically examined the flow of lymph from the duct in my
form of experiment, but                I
                              have noted that the flow is sometimes
increased, and that the lymph may contain bfemoglobin in solution.
The absence of obvious increase, indeed the estimated decrease, of the
ratio of hyaline leucocytes to chromocytes, as well as of hyaline
leucocytes to granular leucocytes, indicates that any increased addition
of hvaline hwmic leucocytes that may occur, vid the thoracic duct, is
out-balanced during the leucocytopenic phase by increased conversion
of hyaline leucocytes into granular.    There is,   take            I

that many of the granular leucocytes are developed from the hyaline
form (Kolliker, Virchow, &c.) and an increased rate of development

   The time of onset of leucocytosis varied. It became obvious in
something later than three-quarters of an hour after the establish
ment of the local lesion. In the ligation experiments         was par              it
ticularly late.    did not detect any very constant relation between
                       I
it and body-temperature or respiratory rate.
   Its duration varied. It may be prolonged for several days and
without much abatement.
   The anatomical details of inflammatory leucocytosis have been re
cently reviewed and studied by Rieder.f          will merely point out
                                                             I
that in my observations as in his the increase in the total hemic
leucocytes has been accompanied by upset of the normal numerical
ratio of granular to hyaline (in his observations polynuclear to mono
nuclear) in favour of the granular leucocytes. Rieder saw the pro
portion rise sometimes             to 20   :   1.   I   have seen   it   rise from      6*2   :   1   to
19-4     :   1.

pointed out that the leucocytosis after bacterial injections is chiefly
dne to increase of the granular leucocytes ; Lowit* has since shown the
same thing for the leucocytosis following injections of albumose,
nuclein, Ac. In one of his experiments the polynuclear were to mono
nuclear leucocytes as 87 to 13. V. Limbeck, t and Everard, Demoor,
and MassartJ note the same feature in the leucocytosis resulting from
subcutaneous injections of bacterial cultures.
    As to interpreting the meaning of the leucocytosis, R6mer§ has
asserted that the increase of leucocytes is dne to rapid multiplication
of the leucocytes in the blood, especially in the blood of the veins.
Kanthack|| was, however, unable to confirm Romer's statement that
the venous blood showed greater leucocytosis thau the arterial ; and
Lowit^f has recently pointed out well-founded objections to- Romer's
observations. Liiwit considers the leucocytosis due to increased supply
of young leucocytes to the blood, these developing into the polynuclear
form. Lowit supposes that the excessive production, of leucocytes
following their diminution (in his view their dissolution) is due to
chemical stimulation, of leucocyte-forming organs (lymph-glands, &c.)
by substances shed into the blood plasma at the time of disintegration
of the      heemic leucocytes.        He considers this explanation applicable
to all forms of leucocytosis, and from it argues the probability that
"  inflammatory         leucocytosis
                                       " will be found to be
                                                                      preceded     by  a
diminution of hemic leucocytes. My experiments bear him out in
that point ; bntr as to basing inflammatory leucocytosis on a previous
dissolution of hemic leucocytes my observations lend no help, and are
capable of interpretation in other ways.
     I think in- my experiments the degree of leucocytopenia has not
always been similarly proportioned to the succeeding leucocytosis.
Since reproductive division of leucocytes,, inclusive of the granular,
polynuclear, or adult form, has now been shown to occur in the blood,
the finely granular leucocytes may, therefore, increase in number by
reproduction within the circulation.
               Third, —Behaviour of the coarsely-granular Leucocyte,
     A  striking and      I believe  hitherto unrecorded feature of the change
in the leucocytic elements of the blood relates, to Wharton Jones's
 " coarsely-granular cell."

 200      Prof. C. S. Sherrington.       On Changes   in  the Blood
 reduction   in the leucocytopenic phase, indeed it would appear to
 undergo even greater numerical       decrease than the ordinary granular
 leucocyte with fine granules.       But when the leucocytopenic phase
 passes off and the   total  number of granular leucocytes in the blood
 becomes greatly increased, their increase is due entirely to the
 " finely granular " cell, and there is no accompanying increase of the
 " coarsely granular " cell. On the contrary the number of the latter
 becomes still fewer, not merely in comparison with the rest of the
 polymorphic, but also in proportion to the number of chromocytes
 and, more striking still, absolutely as measured per unit volume of
 the steadily concentrating blood.
    The diminution proceeds to such a degree that usually after the
 seventh hour from the time of establishment of the local lesion this
 species of leucocyte has been in my experiments only with some diffi
 culty demonstrable in the blood. It disappears from the small samples
used in the Thoma-Zeiss counters, and often from the larger samples
employed in fresh and dried films spread on § in. circular cover-slips.
 If the blood be examined by drawing 3 c.c. into a test-tube, oxalating,
centrifuging, and making films from the separated layer of leucocytes,
 examples can usually be then found without very prolonged search,
but at the ninth hour and later     I have several times failed to find any,
 even by prolonged search, after separation by the centrifuge.
    It seems, therefore, that in consequence of severe local inflammation
the " coarsely -granular
                            " hsemic
                                       leucocyte of Wharton Jones may
practically disappear from the general circulation, although at the
same time his " finely granular
                                   " hsemic
                                             leucocyte may be enormously
increased in number.
   As to the significance of this disappearance, two possibilities arise
at once for consideration.
    1. The cell may have become caught and so to say hidden in some
part or parts of the vascular system, or have wandered out of the
blood circulation altogether.
    2. The cell may have become so altered in appearance that it is not
recognisable by the criteria     I  adopt for distinguishing it. Or its
resistance to the procedures employed in looking for it may have
become so lowered that it is destroyed in the process of search.
   To take the last hypothesis first.           I  consider the coarsely
granular   haemic                                        I
                  leucocyte of the mammalian blood have examined,
to be normally one of the most resistant and easily preserved cells in
the body.    It can be frozen and thawed again, irrigated with 33 per
cent, alcohol, with saturated ammonium molybdate solution, with
strong aqueous solution of pyrogallic acid, with ammonium sulphide
solution, with 0 3 per cent, acetic acid ; it can be heated after partial
drying to 120c O, and higher, and yet its granulation not be lost or
characters distinctive of them destroyed, or the cell itself altered

         consequent upon Inflammations         of acute local  Character.     201
beyond recognition.       Now when the cell is discoverable only in scanty
number in the blood, those individuals still present offer the same
strikingly resistant quality as do the similar cells obtainable from
normal blood. Yet in order on the above view to explain its dis
appearance from the blood, we have to suppose that in the simple
process of the shedding of a drop of blood direct upon a clean cover-
glass, and the spreading of the drop into a film under the action of
capillarity when the cover-glass is dropped upon the glass slide,
the cell forthwith disappears to leave behind no recognised trace.
This seems improbable, the more so as the search for the cell was in
my case often commenced less than twenty seconds                after it left the
circulation.
    The supposition that the appearance of the cell is altered, and that
for that reason the cell, although still circulating, escapes recognition,
merits more consideration.
                    I
    Ehrlich was, believe, the first to suggest that the coarsely granu
lar leucocyte is a unicellular gland. From this suggestion one passes
by a step, which is easy in the light of Heidenhain's and Langley's dis
coveries of phases of granularity in secreting cells, to the supposition
that the granules of the coarsely granular leucocyte may disappear from
it at certain periods of its activity.        Recently Kanthack and Hardy*
have most importantly extended some suggestive work by Hankin,
and have proved that under bacterial irritation the coarsely granular
 leucocyte of the frog does actually change its appearance, and that
the granules disappear from it more or less completely, while the
 surrounding microbes suffer damage.
     Although bacteria were certainly never in the blood in my experi
 ments it is impossible to suppose that this coarsely granular leucocyte
 discharges itself of granules under irritation of a bacterial kind only.
 The local inflammation in my experiments it is conceivable adds sub
stances to the blood which may irritate these cells in the same way.
 If so it might be expected that in the frequent and prolonged
 examinations of these cells in living films, in hanging drops, &c ,
 some good and indubitable evidence of the phenomenon should have
 met me.     In the blood, say at the fifth hour, when the numerical dis
 appearance of the cell is already advanced, there might have been
  expected, unless the disappearance of the granules is almost moment
  ary, a certain number of cells in which the removal of the granules is
  incomplete.    I   have never observed any such appearance.             In this
  connection   I  have especially borne in mind the occurrence of the
  snbvarieties of the cell already mentioned.           It is obvious that these
  subvarieties may be merely phases of development or degradation of
   charging or discharging of the cell ; one of them certainly seems an

the individuals of a snbvariety became more namerons or less
numerous in proportion to the typical cell.                    All of these forms
appeared to be removed together.
    Nor do     I  'believe that the cell without its granules would have
in most cases 'escaped recognition and passed muster with the
other leucocytes. As stated above, the granules are far from being
 the only distinctive feature of the cell.
    It is quite certain that, when the cells are being or have been
reduced to a minimum in the blood, the remaining individuals are
usually of perfectly normal granular appearance, active and unim
paired in <heir amoeboid action.             I have, in the stage just previous to
the disappearance of the cell from ordinary films, made a dozen such
films and left them, at ^various temperatures, protected from evapora
tion, and then examined them at different intervals of time to see if
they did ilose their granulation.
    Many hsemic leucocytes, under certain circumstances, live a
long time after removal from the body (frog's leucocytes nine weeks
in vitro* dog's leucocytes three weeks, kept cool, in vitrof). It might
therefore 'have been expected that, if Mood containing leucocytes
 which 'had freed themselves of their secretion granules were removed
and kept ailive in vitro for a time, the granules might be reformed.                   I
 placed -samples of blood in w'hich          I was unable to find any leucocytes
 containing coarse granules in vitro under appropriate conditions, and
 examined it tft repeated intervals ; but          I  did not succeed in obtaining
 any reappearance df 'the coarsely granular cell. A great number of
 the leucocytes do, and before very long, become 'granular with fine
 nnd medium sized granules, and these granules are highly refractive
 and not basophil (i.e., not micrococci).             I have not satisfied myself
 that they are fatty.           The mode of their appearance seems to           be, as
 follows : —
     A   great number of the finely granular leucocytes 'gradually become,
 as above mentioned, vacuolated. The vacuoles contain fluid, and are for
 the most part small and spherical, but some are larger and oval in
 shape. In most of the small vacuoles a single, fine, highly refracting
 particle, the size of a small micrococcus, is to be found, dancing under
 Brownian movement. In many of the vacuoles no particle at all is
'discoverable. In (The larger >vacnoles are obvious ingesta, bnt the
Tirig'ht particles in the small vacuoles do not seem to be ingesta
 because the plasma in which Dhe cells lie is generally quite free from
 particles.     The cells seem to exhibit the same vacuolation whether
 they have remained spherical «nd inactive as regards amoeboid move-

ment or not.     The evidence rather indicates that the particles in the
fine vacuoles are produced within the cells and not ingested.           But
that the particles are related to the granules of the coarsely granular
cell there is no evidence to show.         In cat's blood, where the true
a-granule is cylindroid, the small round particles appearing in the
leucocytes in vitro are not cylindroid nor are they so highly refracting ;
besides, they are much smaller, and their fineness leaves me in doubt
over the phosphorus and oxyphil reactions of them.
    If substances produced at the seat of local injury and inflammation
leak into the circulation and there irritate the coarsely granular cell
and produce lysis of its granules, some imitation of the process might
be expected from the following experiment.         Blood from which, when
it circulated, the coarsely granular leucocytes were disappearing at
an estimated rate of more than half a million per minute, was drawn
and centrifnged, and the plasma obtained from it was added to normal
blood containing plenty of coarsely granular cells.           The coarsely
granular cells 6, 12 and 24 hours afterwards, did not seem appreciably
 altered in number.    In one instance two particular individuals of the
 cell were observed at intervals for 32 hours, sketched, and their
 granules counted ; no change in size or number of their granules
 occurred.
    I feel justified in believing, therefore, that the disappearance of
 the coarsely granular cell in inflammatory blood does not go on in
 such blood when placed in vitro.
    Some observers hold that the various forms of hsemic leucocytes are
 not distinct species or varieties, but that they merely present the
 various aspects of one pleomorphic organism.        If all kinds of hasmic
 leucocyte are thus transitionally related, it is possible that the coarsely
 granular cell can become actually one of the other ha?mic cells.
 Unless this transition is wont to be effected very suddenly, the argu
 ments   I have adduced against, in the present instance, the disappear
 ance of the cell from the circulation being due to lysis of its granules,
 apply for the most part against explanation by the pleomorphism
 hypothesis also.
     An explanation that may be suggested is that chemical substances
  generated at the locue lozsionis act on the blood just as Lowit* believes
 albumoses, &c. act when injected intra venam, i.e., altogether destroy
  and dissolve certain of the leucocytes.      The substances produced in
 the particular inflammations studied might destroy especially the
 coarsely granular forms. Does the coarsely granular form of leucocyte
 suffer even more severely than the finely granular when albumoses
 are injected intravenously ?                  I

aqueous      NaCl solution) into the jugular vein of a small dog weighing
6  kilos.     The countings showed the diminution of leucocytes to fall,
as Lowit describes, chiefly on the polynuclear (granular) leucocytes,
but the ratio of coarsely granular to finely granular forms did not
appear indubitably altered.
   Ehrlich* suggested that the haemic leucocytes which contain his
                         "                       "
a-granulation (the coarsely granular of this Note) arc derived from
the oxyphil cells of bone-marrow.             In one form of lencocythsemia the
blood seeras certainly to be laden with the oxyphil marrow cells. But
the coarsely granular cell of the blood is not exactly an oxyphil marrow
cell, for the latter is, as Riederf and MuirJ have pointed out, not an
amoeboid cell.        That the granulation is in both the cells oxyphil does
not establish the identity of the cells, nor even of the granulation ; a
variety of substances are of the eosiuophiloas class.                     Dekhuysen§
failed to find any connexion between the haemic leucocytes with
a-granulation and the oxyphil granular plasma cells and connective
tissue corpuscles.
   Yet Ehrlich's view is supported by several facts. Thus find the            I
oxyphil granules of the marrow yield the Lilienfeld-Monti reaction
to the same extent as the coarse granules of the hemic cell. There is,
too, correspondence between the shape of the granules in the cells
from both sources ; thus         I find
   In    the dog and rabbit, small spheroid granules in the coarsely
       granular leucocyte and in the oxyphil marrow cells.
   In the horse, huge gramdes, spheroid, occasionally almost cuboid in the
       coarsely granular leucocyte and in the oxyphil marrow cells.
   In   the cat, cylindroid granules       in the coarsely granular leucocyte
       and in the oxyphil marrow cell.
   But     I  have not been able to satisfy myself in my experiments that
the oxyphil cells of the marrow are affected even when Ehrb'ch's
a-granulation practically disappears from the blood.
   As the coarsely granular leucocyte is not destroyed, or altered so as
to escape preparation or recognition, it must be withdrawn from
the general circulation, either by becoming fixed in some particular
vascular region or by passing out of the blood vessels altogether.                   I
have not yet sufficiently examined the anatomical character of the
exudations to criticise these possibilities.                 The cellular characters
of the exudation have seemed to vary greatly ; sometimes many
 cells closely resembled the coarsely granular hemic leucocyte, but
 Bometimes only a few.

         consequent upon Inflammations       of acute lecal Character.      205
      The duration    of the period of extreme poverty of the blood in
  this cell has varied in my observations between 18 hours and 6 days.
  In prolonged inflammation they may probably be scanty for much
  longer periods.
     The degree of numerical elimination of the cell is     illustrated by the
 following reckoning.       In one experiment the cells      fell from 13 per
 cent,  of all leucocytes to less than 1 per 100 in the course of 12
 honrs.     The animal was a large cat. Steinberg estimates the blood
 in the cat at 9 per cent, of the body weight ; the animal weighed a
 little over 4 kilo.    This would give 360 c.c. blood. In each mm. of
blood there were at beginning of experiment about 15,300 leucocytes
or 1,200 of the coarsely granular kind, making a total of 432 millions
of the coarsely granulate in the circulation.           Nine hours later no
coarsely granular were found in the specimens examined on either of
the two Thoma-Zeiss         counters, nor were any found in several cover-
glass preparations,      but  in specimens of blood centrifuged two of
 the cells were found in films of leucocytes from the leucocytic layer.
 In counting at random through these films 10,000 leucocytes were
met with without meeting one coarsely granular               cell.   Allowing,
however, that one existed for every 12,000 of the leucocytes, and
knowing that the number of leucocytes had then risen to 36400 per
mm. of blood, the number of coarsely granular leucocytes in the cir
culation may be estimated at 1,080,000.           On this calculation more
than 400 millions of them had been withdrawn from the circulating
blood in the course of nine hours.          In the above example no allow
ance is made for the diminution         in volume of the total blood (the
speciSc gravity had increased from T056 to T061) which must have
occurred but cannot have amounted to many c.c.            The example is an
extreme one, because the original percentage of these cells in the blood
was high.     But it gives an idea of the degree of impoverishment of the
Wood    in these cells, and of the rate of their withdrawal (average rate
of more than half a million per
                                     minute) from the general circulation.
I detect at present no clear relation between the diminution of the
number of coarsely granular leucocytes and the apoplasmia of the
blood.     When the apoplasmia developed late (ligation experiments)
the withdrawal      of coarsely granular leucocytes seemed hardly de
ferred.     In the three experiments on the lung and pleural cavity
apoplasmia was not produced, but the numerical reduction of the
coarsely granular cells, though not so marked as usual, was unmis
takable.
      Under certain conditions, other than the above experimental ones,
I  have  found the blood to contain very few coarsely granular leuco
cytes.    I  have already noted that fasting does not appear to decrease
the number of them, but appears rather to increase it.             At the same
time, if prolonged      to starvation point, fasting certainly appears to

206        P&f.     C. S. Sherrington.             On Clianges in the Blood
greatly reduce the number of these cells.                        I   judge so from their
practical absence from the blood of three animals admitted into the
Brown Institute in a destitute and starving state. Two of these
animals did not recover, and autopsy revealed nothing but evidence
of starvation, and slighter cases of the kind are not infrequently ad
mitted at the Institution.                I  have also found the cell abnormally
scarce in the blood at a late stage after thyroidectomy.                        The cell was
scarce    in   the blood of bitch which had thrown puppies twenty-four
                                 a
hours previously, though her temperature was normal. In a dog -with
a large subcutaneous abscess and in a horse with submaxillary
abscess,     I  had great difficulty in finding any coarsely granular leuco
cytes, but the last two examples come under the same category as my
own experiments, except that the local inflammatory conditions were
subacute.
    Canon* has concluded that the number of eosinophilous cells
in the blood is increased in all diseases of skin. In a dog admitted
                                               I
with a severe scald of the back found the blood almost destitute of
these cells (coarsely granular), and it remained so for the first four
days after admission. In the experiments in which skin was involved
in the lesion (Series I) the diminution of the cells was as marked as
in experiments where skin -was not involved. Felsenf noticed in
                                                                                              "
three cases of croupous pneumonia that at the height of the " fever
eosinophilous cells seemed absent from the blood. Noorden,J on the
other hand, has seen a great increase in the number of eosinophilous
cells in bronchial asthma at the time of the attack.                                      «
    Hankin§      has     made     an   interesting   observation       that  the   blood  clots
rapidly when the coarsely granular cell is scanty in the blood.                        I  have
pointed out||      that    the    coarsely granular      cell does     not  initiate  clotting
in dog's blood. In the present experiments the blood, at a time when
almost (perhaps actually) free from coarsely granular leucocytes,
clotted very speedily and firmly, as is well known for blood in inflam
mation.

 I. " Preliminary Note on Bilateral Degeneration in the Spinal
      Cord of Monkeys (Macacus sinicus) following Unilateral
      Lesion of the Cortex Cerebri."             By E. L. Mellus, M.D.
      Communicated by Professor V. HORSLEY, F.R.S. Received
      December 22, 1893.
        (From the Pathological Laboratory of University College, London.)
    Having for some time been engaged in an investigation of the
 question as to how far the fibres of each pyramid descend both halves
 of the spinal cord, I am in a position to state that in the bonnet
 monkey (Macacus sinicus) the following arrangement prevails.
    Method of Investigation. — The animal being etherised, and the left
 hemisphere of the brain exposed by a single trephine hole (sometimes
 enlarged afterwards),    a small   portion of the excitable area of the

1894.]             Cord following Lesion of the Cortex Cerebri.             209
motor cortex was selected as detailed below, the selection being con
firmed in each case by electrical stimulation.   A small piece of the
cortex, about 0"4 cm. square,constitnting the focus of the movement
observed, was removed, care being    taken to remove also a little of
the underlying corona radiata to be sure that no cortex was left.
The wounds healed, without exception, within 24 hours by first
intention. Beyond slight paresis, which generally disappeared in
24 hours, no symptoms were observed to result from the excision.
Professor Horsley kindly did the operations for me. After three
weeks the animals were killed, the brain and cord hardened in
Miller's solution, and stained in osmic acid after the method of
Marchi.
                             Results of Investigations.                        ,
  Three foci of representation were selected for excision, the left
hemisphere being chosen in every case (vide Method of Investiga
tion).
             I. Focus for the movements of the thumb.
             II.   Focus for the movements of the hallux.
   The course taken by the descending degenerated fibres was as
follows : —
   I. Hallux Focus removed. — In this case the lesion consisted of the
removal of about 16 sq. mm. of cortex between the superior pre-
central aniens and the fissure of Rolando, and bounded below by
the level of the superior frontal sulcus.
   Degenerated fibres were found in both lateral columns of the
cord, the large majority being on the right side.      The degenerated
fibres were scattered throughout    the entire area of the crossed or
lateral pyramidal tract, not being restricted to any special part of          it,
though it might be said they were          little more dense posteriorly.
                                              a
Throughout the cervical, dorsal, and lumbar regions the total number
of degenerated fibres was not diminished, though, of course,          relatively
increased   in the lower cord. In the pons and medulla the degenera
tion was entirely confined to the left pyramidal tract (the side of the
lesion).    At the decussation in the upper cervical region the
degenerated tract divided; about one-third going to the lateral
colnmn of the same side, the remaining two-thirds crossing to the
lateral tract on the opposite side.  In the upper cervical region there
were     avery few degenerated fibres remaining in the direct tract
 (anterior column), and below the middle of the cervical enlargement
none could be seen.
   II. Thumb Focus removed. — In this case the lesion consisted of a
similar removal of cortex at a point just above the lower end of the
 intra-parietal sulcus, and between    and the fissure of Rolando, and,
                                         it
 eoneequently, just behind the inferior genu of the fissure of Rolando
                                                             Q    2

210       Mr. H. Wilde.   Variation   of Magnetic    Declination   [Mar. 1,
¦{Beevor  and Horsley). As in the case of the hallux focus, degenera
tion was also confined to the pyramidal tracts of the same side
 (left) as the lesion, throughout the pons and medulla. At the de
cussation of the pyramids there was also a slight division of the de
generated fibres, but in this case a few fibres only (less than one in
ten) went to the lateral column of the same (left) side of the
cord. There may have been two or three degenerated fibres left
in the direct tract after the decussation, but this could not be
positively stated.    In the cervical and upper dorsal regions the
degenerated fibres gradually decreased in number.     At the level of
the second dorsal there were a very few degenerated fibres still left
in each lateral column. At the third dorsal they had entirely
disappeared.
   It seems probable, from these observations, that a second decussa
tion lower down in the cord — recrossing — does not occur, and that
the bi-lateral degeneration observed by Pitres, Sherrington, Langley,
Muratoff, and others is a genuine bi-lateral descent of fibres from
one hemisphere.
II. " On     the Relations of the Secular Variation of the Magnetic
         Declination and Inclination at London, Cape of Good
         Hope, St. Helena and Ascension Island, as exhibited on
         the Magnetarium."     By Henry Wilde, F.R.S. Received
         February 19, 1894.
    In   a paperwhich was read before the Royal Society in June, 1890,
1 showed   that  the principal phenomena of terrestrial magnetism and
the secular changes in its horizontal and vertical components could
be explained on the assumption of an electro- dynamic substance
(presumably liquid or gaseous) rotating within the crust of the earth
in the plane of the ecliptic, and* a little slower than the diurnal
rotation.   By means of some electro-mechanism, new to experimental
science, which     I termed a magnetarium, the period of backward
rotation of the internal electro-dynamic sphere required for the
secular variations of the magnetic elements on different parts of the
earth's surface was found to be 960 years, or 22'5 minutes of a degree
annually.    It was also demonstrated that the inclination of the axes
of the electro-dynamic and terrestrial globes to each other of 20° 30',
was the cause of the inequality of the declination periods about the
same meridian in the northern and southern hemispheres ; as in
stanced in the short period of outward westerly declination at
London, and the long period of outward westerly declination at the
Cape of Good Hope and St. Helena.

direct comparison of the declination periods at London and at the
Cape of Good Hope than was set forth in my former paper ; and,
secondly, to show a further agreement between the indications of the
magnetarium and the results of recent observations of the dip and
declination at the Island of Ascension.
   The rate of backward rotation of the internal electro-dynamic sphere,
as I have said, is 22'5 minutes = 0-375° annually.        Now, the period
of the westerly march of the declination needle at London from zera
in the year 1657 to its maximum of 24° 30' in the year 1817 is
160 years;    therefore, 0375° X 160 = 60° of differential rotation of
the internal sphere. Again, the westerly march of the needle at the
Cape of Good Hope from the year 1609 to its maximum of 30° in the
year 1881 is 272 years. Therefore, 0 375° x 272 = 102° of differential
rotation of the internal sphere. Hence, 60° : 160 years : : 102° : 272
years ; the outward westerly declination periods at London and the
Cape of Good Hope respectively, as shown by observation and on
the magnetarium.      Subjoined are tables of the declination and in
clination at London, the Cape of Good Hope, and on the magnetarium
for the same epochs.

    The secnlar changes of the magnetic elements at St. Helena are
interesting from the fact that the declination period agrees well with
the geographical position of this island, which is west of the meridians
 of London and the Cape of Good Hope.
    The epochs of the zeros of the declination at these places are in         the
order of their longitudes respectively,

As St. Helena is south of the equator, the outward westerly march of
the declination     needle has a long period which is not yet completed
(prop. V).     The length of this period, as shown on the magnetarium,
is 256 years, and will arrive at its maximum in the year 1939.

 dynamic    substance within the earth's crust are afforded (1) by the
 dipping needle making only one downward or upward motion (out
 side the space comprised within the north and south limits of the
 magnetic equator) for the outward and return march of the declina
tion needle, as instanced in the continued diminution of the dip in
the British Isles during the westerly outward and return march of the
declination needle since the year 1723.           (2) From the secular changes
of the dip in opposite directions about the same meridian in the
northern and southern hemispheres, as instanced in the dip diminishing
in the British Isles and increasing at the Cape of Good Hope and
 St. Helena for the same epoch (prop. X). (3) The rapid increase of
the dip about the nodes of the magnetic equator, as first indicated by
 Sabine in the Gulf of Guinea and St. Helena.                 Before the time of
my     experiments     no   attempt    had been   made   to  assign a cause for
the large and rapid change in the dip (about 17 minutes annually)
on this part of the terrestrial surface until          I  found that the results
obtained on the magnetarium agreed very closely with the observations.
Subjoined are tables of the declination and inclination at St. Helena
and on the magnetarium.
    On working the inclination backwards on the magnetarium
chronologically, it will be seen from the Table VI that about the
year 1747 the dip changed the sign from south to north.                    As no
observations were made on the dip at St. Helena previous to the
year 1825, there is no record of this interesting fact, nor has it
hitherto been deduced from theory.
    A further confirmation of the agreement of the results obtained on
the magnetarinm with actual observations has recently been brought
under my notice in the bulletin issued by the United States Coast
and Geodetic Survey, No. 23, March 16th, 1891. In this publication

a table is given of the declination and dip at Ascension        Island for
the epoch 1834 — 1890, in which the change of the dip          from north
to south occurs between the years 1842 — 1839.        The same change is
not only shown on the magnetarium brat         also the amount of the dip
and declination for the epoch 1834 — 1890.
    The correlation of the maximum rate of change of the inclination
with the minimum rate of change of the declination about the nodes
of the magnetic equator is well seen in the observations, and is also
demonstrated in my paper (prop. XVIII) and on the magnetarium.
III. " Terrestrial     Refraction in the Western Himalayan Moun
       tains."    By General J. T. Walker, C.B., R.E., F.R.S.
       Received January 13, 1894.
    In the operations of the Great Trigonometrical Survey of India it
is customary to determine the coefficient of refraction by reciprocal
vertical observations between contiguous stations on the sides of all
the principal triangles, and also as many as possible of the secondary
triangles.
     [The sum of the reciprocal vertical angles, plus the angle at the
 earth's centre, would be exactly equal to 180° if there were no refrac
 tion ; the excess gives the sum of the refractions in both the angles,
 and half of it is taken as the amount for each angle. — March 2.]
     The values of the coefficient thus obtained for the operations in
 the Western Himalayas — between the meridians of 73° and 80° east
 of Greenwich — have been grouped together for comparison in succes
 sive ranges of 2000 ft. of altitude between the elevations of 5,000 and
 21,000 ft. above the sea level.      The operations happen naturally to
 have been divided into two sections ; for the regions lying between
 the great snowy ranges on the Eouthern face of the Himalayas and
 the plains of India were first completed, and some time subsequently
 the still higher regions to the north, extending np to the Karakoratn
 and Kuenlun Ranges, which look down on the plains of Turkestan.
  The first portion appertains to what is called the N.W. Himalayan
  Series, the second to what is called the Kashmir Triangulation. Thus
  the values of the coefficients of refraction were obtained separately for
  each section, and the results are shown in the following table, where
  the heights have reference to the middle points of the sides of the
  triangles, of which the number is given for each group : —

   These results show that at each range of altitude the coefficient of
refraction was greater in the Southern than in the Northern Section ;
also that from the height of 13,000 ft. upwards the coefficient de
creased in magnitude, as it theoretically should do, in the Northern
Triangulation, but, on the other hand, in the Southern it increased
until it became twice as great as in the Northern.                These differences
of behaviour in the two regions are very curious and difficult to
account for.       They point to some difference in the atmospheric condi
tions to the north and south of the outer Himalayan Range, and this
may possibly arise from the circumstance that the atmosphere to the
south is more heavily laden with moisture than the atmosphere to the
north ; for the great southern range is the first to receive the clouds
which come up from the Indian Ocean, and which are the chief
source of Himalayan moisture ; these clouds are mostly condensed
into rain on the southern face of the range, and thus only a compara
tively small portion of their contents is carried on beyond into the
more northerly regions.
    [Whatever the cause, the fact is very remarkable that the co
efficient of refraction has a minimum value at an altitude of 20,000 ft.
on the north side of the Himalayan ranges, and a maximum value at
the same altitude on the south side. — March 2.]

actions      for 1884, on
rotationally and part irrotationally, a certain case of motion symme
trical with regard to an axis was noticed (see pp. 403 —405).
    Taking the axis of symmetry as axis of z, and the distance of any
point from it as r, and allowing for a difference of notation, it was
shown that the surfaces
                         **    +         —     =  consta,nt'

where a, c are fixed         constants and Z any arbitrary function of the
time, always contain the same particles of fluid in a possible case of
                                 •
motion.
    The surfaces are of invariable form.         If  the constant be negative,
they are ring-shaped ; if the constant be zero, the single surface re
presented breaks up into an evanescent cylinder and an ellipsoid of
revolution ; if the constant be positive, the surfaces have the axis of
revolution for an asymptote.
    The velocity perpendicular to the axis of symmetry is
the   velocity parallel to the axis of symmetry is
where k is a fixed constant and         Z = dZjdt.
    These expressions       (which make the velocity infinitely great at in
finity) cannot apply to a possible case of fluid motion extending to
infinity.      Hence the fluid moving in the above manner must be
limited by a surface of finite dimensions.         This limiting surface must
always contain the same particles of fluid.
    Where, as in the present case, the surfaces containing the same
 particles of    fluid are of invariable form, it is possible to imagine the
 finid limited by any of them, provided a rigid, frictionless boundary,
 having the shape of the limiting surface, be supplied and the boundary

 be supposed to move parallel to the axis of z with velocity Z. Then
  the above expressions give the velocity components of a possible
 rotational motion inside the boundary.         So much was pointed out in
 the paper cited above.
    2. Eat a case of much greater interest is obtained when it is possi
 ble to limit the fluid moving in the above manner by one of the
 surfaces containing always the same particles of fluid, and to discover
 either an irrotational or rotational motion filling all space external to
 the limiting surface which is continuous with the motion inside it as
regards velocity normal to the limiting surface and pressure.
    3. It is the object of this paper to discuss such a case, the motion
 found external to the limiting surface being an irrotational motion,
 and the tangential velocity at the limiting surface as well as the
 normal velocity and the pressure being continuous.
    The particular surface containing the same particles which is
 selected is obtained by supposing that the constant vanishes and
also that c = a. Then this surface breaks up into the evanescent
cylinder
                                    r2 =  0,
and the sphere                r2 + (z— Z)s   = a2.
    The molecular rotation is given by m = 5ir/o', so that the mole
 cular rotation along the axis Vanishes, and therefore the vortex sphere
 still possesses in a small degree the character of a vortex ring.
    The irrotational motion outside a sphere moving in a straight line
is known, and it is shown in this paper that it will be continuous
with the rotational motion inside the sphere provided a certain rela
tion be satisfied.
    This relation may be expressed thus : —
    The cyclic constant of the spherical vortex is five times the product of
the radius of the sphere and the uniform velocity with which the vortes*
sphere moves along its axis.
    The analytic expression of the same relation is
                                   4k = 3Z.
   This makes                 w  = 16Zr/(4o3).
   All   the particulars of the motion are placed together in the table
on p. 221, in which the notation employed is as follows : —
   If the velocity parallel to the axis of r be t, and the velocity
parallel to the axis of s be w, then the molecular rotation is given by

   Also p is the pressure,   p  the density, and V the potential of   the
impressed forces. The minimum value of p/p+Y is Tl/p, where           II//)
must be determined from the initial conditions.
    Further R, 6 are such that
                                  r = R sin  9,
                             z—Ti   = Rcos   0.
   The whole motion depends on the following constants : —
      (1) The radius of the sphere o.
      (2) The uniform velocity Z
      (3) The minimum value of p/p+Y, viz., Tl/p.
   4.  If c be not equal to o, then the surface containing the same par
ticles when the constant vanishes breaks up into an evanescent cylinder
and an ellipsoid of revolution.
   Now, the velocity potential of an ellipsoid moving parallel to an
axis is known. This velocity potential with a suitable relation between
k and Z will make the normal velocity at the surface of the ellipsoid
continuous with the normal velocity of the rotational motion inside
the ellipsoid, but it does not make the pressure continuous.       Hence,
if a motion of fluid outside the ellipsoid exist continuous with the
rotational motion inside, then the motion outside the ellipsoid must
be a rotational motion.
   5. It cannot be argued that the application of Helmholtz's method
to determine the whole motion from the distribution of vortices
inside the ellipsoid must determine an irrotational motion outside the
ellipsoid continuous with the rotational motion inside, because Helm
holtz's method determines the irrotational motion by means of the
distribution of vortices only when that distribution is known through
out space. This is not the case of the problem under discussion.
For here the rotationally moving liquid has been arbitrarily limited
by rejecting all the vortices ontside the ellipsoid, and it is not known
beforehand that the rejection of these vortices is possible.
   6. Yet on account of the interest of the problem the paper contains
a calculation of the velocity components in Helmholtz's          manner,

 V. " Researches on the Structure, Organisation, and Classifi
       cation of the Fossil Reptilia. Part IX. Section 1. On
       the Therosuchia."         By H. G. Seeley, F.R.S. Received
       January 8, 1894.
                                    (Abstract.)
    This paper discusses the classification of reputed Permian and
 Triassic Reptilia which have been referred to the Anomodontia as
 Theriodonts.
    Lycosaurus, as the genus placed first on the Sir B. Owen's list, is
 accepted as the type of the Theriodontia.               The species Lycosaurus
curvimola is regarded     as the type      of the genus, being the only species
 in which its characters are fully shown. Galesaurus planiceps, which
 was the type of the Cynodontia, is probably distinct from Nythosaurus
larvatus, and from Sir R. Owen's second type of Galesaurus planiceps
 of 1887, which is referred to as Thrinaxodan liorhinus. JElurosaurus
felinus agrees with Galesaurus in having a transverse development of
 bones of the palate, regarded as palatine and transverse, which abut
toward the inner side of the lower jaw. The palate in this genus is
found to be covered with groups of small teeth with conical crowns,

 1894.]    Organisation, and Classification    of Fossil Reptilia.      225
 which are   unknown in Lycosaurus. The palate of Lycosaurus curvi-
 mola is found and described in the type specimen.       It shows a trans-
 Terse development of the palatine arch abutting against the lower
jaw, behind which is a long compressed sphenoidal keel flanked by
 narrow pterygoid bones.      The occipital condyles do not appear to be
 prominently   developed in  Lycosaurus. The genus is regarded as the
type of a division of the Theriodontia, defined by having the molar
teeth pointed and without cusps.          A snout from Tamboer, named
Pristerognathus polyodon, is referred to this group. It is characterised
by six incisor teeth in each premaxillary bone and three incisor teeth
in each ramus of the mandible,       followed by canine teeth and small
molars of   Lycosaurian type.
   Professor Cope's definition of the Theriodontia as distinguished
from the Anomodontia by characters of the post-orbital arch is re
garded as unsupported by evidence.           The author would limit the
Theriodontia to animals which conform to Sir R. Owen's original
definition based on the dentition (1876), and have temporal vacuities
and a small quadrate bone. It would then include the Lycosauria, with
type Lycosaurus curvimola ; the Cynodontia, with Gynognathus cratero-
notus (n.sp.) and Thrinaxodon liorhinus as types; and a group of
South African Reptiles named Gomphodontia, based upon new genera
Gomphognathus and Trirachodon, which have the molar teeth with
flattened cuspidate crowns more or less worn with use.       The palate is
formed on the type of Lycosaurus in these Theriodontia.
   Gorgonops is closely allied to Theriodonts in its dentition (though
no  molar teeth are known).       The skull is closed behind as in Kiste-
cephalus,  and  the temporal  vacuities  are roofed.  It appears to show
a palate formed on the same plan as in Theriodontia so far as its
transverse development is concerned, but it has not any hard palate
extending above the posterior nares as in Theriodontia.            It is re
garded as the type of a distinct group, named Gorgonopsia.
   The Pareiasauria have the same transverse palatine arch, abutting
against the lower jaw, but not developed downward to the same
extent, as in Theriodontia.       Its hard palate appears to be carried
back behind the teeth, so that the posterior nares are further back
than in the Theriodontia.       It differs from the Theriodontia in the
slight development of the coronoid process of the lower jaw, and in
having the temporal vacuities roofed ; and from the Gorgonopsia in
 having the skull open behind, and in having no canine teeth.
   The Endothiodont type is believed to show the transverse descend
ing palatal arch between the      rami of the mandible. Pristerodon is
regarded as possibly Endothiodont ; and Endoihiodon uniseries is
made the type of a genus Esoterodon.         A small skull from Molteno
 Pass, Cryptocynodon simus (n.sp.), is regarded as an Endothiodont
 with imperfectly-developed canine teeth.      The Endothiodontia have
                                                                B 2

226     Prof. H. G. Seeley.      Researches on the Structure,      [Mar.  1,
 no incisor teeth, have the hard palate imperfectly developed, and no
 coronoid process to the lower jaw.
    Another South African group is regarded as indicated hy Delphino-
 gnathus, Tapinocephalus, and a new genus named Dinocephalus, which
 has the largest tusks known in any South African genus, associated
 with small molars. In the typical genera the skull hones are very
 thick and the temporal vacuities small. JElurosaurus is probably to
 be placed in this group.    It is referred to as Dinocephalia.
    Thus there is a series of groups of South African Reptilia which
 appear to agree in having a palate which has some resemblances to
 Mammals but approximates to Sphenodcm, Lizards, and Crocodiles.
 All these sub-orders are combined as the Therosnchia. In this order
 or group may be included the Deuterosauria from the Permian rocks
 of Russia.
    The Deuterosauria is distinguished from the Theriodontia by having'
 palato-nares which open by oval vacuities on a concave surface in
stead of behind a hard palate. The transverse palatine arch is not de
 veloped downward.      The sphenoidal region is at an angle with the
palate, and in the same plane with the occiput.
   Finally, the names given by Professor Cope to allied American
types are examined. It appears that the Theromora as hitherto used
is a synonym of the Anomodontia, though it might be conveniently
limited to the American types, which appear to be distinct from
those of Africa and Europe.       But it is not possible to use either that
name or the names Pelycosauria or Cotylosauria till the characters of
the groups they indicate are adequately defined by good characters.
   The relation of the Therosuchia to other Anomodontia is shown in
the following grouping.

                               (Abstract.)
   The author re-examines the remains of Theriodesmus, and contests
the interpretation of the carpus given by Professor Bardeleben, pro
ducing specimens of South African Reptiles in which there is a
single bone beneath the radius, as in Theriodesmus.      This character
is shown in a small skeleton, at present undescribed, which the
anthor obtained from Klipfontein, Fraserberg, which, he regards as
referable   to a new genus. Other evidence is produced supporting
the interpretation   of three bones in the proximal row in the carpus,
in a specimen from Lady Frere. The author then compares the fore-
limb of Theriodesmus with that of Pareiasaurus, which was obtained
subsequently, and arrives at the conclusion that the types of limb
are too closely related to be referred to different orders of animals,
and therefore that Theriodesmus        must be transferred from the
Mammalia to the Therosuchia.
   The skull described as Tritylodon longmvus is examined, and its
close resemblance to the skulls of new Theriodonts is pointed out.
The author believes that it shows evidence of possessing both pre
frontal and post-frontal bones, which were situate as in Theriodonts,
and circumscribed the orbits in the same way ; so that, although the
post-frontal bones appear to have met in the median line to form a
crest, at the back of the frontal, there is no other character in the
skull by which it can be distinguished from the skull of a Theriodont.
It therefore appears to be reptilian, and thus would make known
divided roots to the molar teeth in Reptilia, and a more complicated
type of crown than in any Theriodont yet known.

than one genus ; bat, in absence of sufficient knowledge of the skull
to establish differences, the four species are referred to a new genus,
Diademodon.          Its hinder molar teeth have undivided roots, and low
crowns, which are subquadrate or transversely ovate, surrounded by a
diadem of low cusps, which are chiefly developed on the external and
internal borders, with crenulations or minute cnsps on the anterior
and posterior margins of these teeth. There is a low central cusp
in the middle of the crown from which slight ridges extend, chiefly
in the transverse direction ; but in the type species these ridges
take the form of a cross.             The species are distinguished by the form
of the crown and the details of the cusps.                     The upper and lower
teeth are opposed so as to be evenly worn, but the mandibular
teeth are narrower.
    These teeth are highly specialised, but distinct in plan from
 Tritylodon, and from all known Reptiles.                 They closely approximate
to some of the higher Mammalia.                   The author refers Diademodon
to a division of the Theriodontia in which the teeth become worn
 with use, which is named Gomphodontia.
 VIII. " On         the Effect of Magnetisation upon the Dimensions
         of Wires and Rings of Annealed Iron."                          By Shelford
         Bidwell, M.A., LL.B., F.R.S. Received February 14,
         1894.
     In  the year 1885         I submitted to the Royal Society the first of a
 series of papers* upon the changes produced by magnetisation in the
 dimensions of rods, &c, of iron and other magnetic metals. The
 chief, and perhaps the most interesting, subject of the paper was the
 observation that if the magnetising force were sufficiently increased,
 the extension which a magnetised iron rod at first underwent (a»
 originally noticed by Joulef) was followed by contraction, the rod
 ultimately becoming shorter than when it was nnmagnetised.                           The
 elongation was generally found to attain a maximum with a magnet
 ising force of from 80 to 120 C.G.S. units, and to vanish with a force of
 300 to 400, retraction occurring when still higher forces were applied.
     From that date until quite recently no accounts of similar experi
 ments by other workers have, so far as                    I  know, been published.
 About the beginning of last year, however, it was stated in the
 scientific journals that M. Alphonse Berget had investigated the
 magnetic dilatation of iron in strong fields, and had found that the
 length of his bar was still increasing when the magnetic field had

ment was not carried.             .
     On reference to the original paper in the ' Comptes Rendus,'* it
appeared that the experiment was made with a cylindrical bar,
measuring 5'2 cm. by l-95 cm., its length being less than three times
its diameter. The actual magnetising force must therefore have been
enormously less than that due to the coil itself, and it is very improb
able that it ever reached the value at which the iron (or the greater
portion of      it,
              for the magnetisation must have been far from uniform)
would attain its maximum extension.
   The Phil. Mag.' of December, 1893, contains an account of some
           '
experiments by Mr. Sidney Lochner, made, as he states, with the
express object of determining whether M. Berget's results or my own
were correct. Using a thin iron rod, he obtained      curve very closely         a
resembling those published by myself            but, as might have been
                                                                   ;
expected, he found that a short thick rod, like that of M. Berget,
gave no decided indication of having passed a maximum extension
within the limits of the magnetising force that he employed.

    Upon this point, Joule's observations are as follows — On

the metal.     It greatest of all in the well annealed iron bars, and

    The current belief, in which till quite recently      myself shared,        I                   is
in  accord with this statement.    It  appears, however,  as will be shown,
that  it  represents the reverse of the truth.     Joule's conclusion with
regard to iron seems to have been based entirely upon the results of
a   single experiment with an unannealed bar, and he may possibly
have been mistaken in supposing that         consisted of the same quality

length increased rapidly with the magnetising force, the maximum
increment which was obtained in a field (due to the coil) of about
140 units being as much as 45 ten-millionths of the length of tbe
wire. The same wire was then carefully annealed, and the experi
ment repeated, with the results indicated in enrve (2). It will be
seen that the maximum increment had fallen from 45 to about 8 ten-
millionths — less than one-fifth of its former value — and was reached
with a force of about 60 units. Finally, the wire was raised to a
bright red heat in a blowpipe flame, and dropped into cold water, its
subsequent performance being as indicated in curve (3). This last
operation was found to have raised the maximum elongation from 8
to 25 ten-millionths, while the corresponding magnetising force had
increased from 60 to about 110 units.

     Other experiments gave results of a similar character, and many
attempts were made to obtain an annealed wire which would not be
lengthened at all by magnetisation, but begin to contract from the
first, like nickel and cobalt. But              I  never succeeded in bringing a
wire into such a condition that its maximum elongation was less than
7  or  8 ten-millionths.
     Though I     failed with straight wires, however,          I was perfectly suc
cessful with      an iron ring.
     I have in     a former paper given an account of some experiments
made with         rings.*        The changes in the diameter of a ring were
found to be of just the same character as those observed in straight
rods. With a continuously increasing magnetising force the diameter
first increased in length, and, after passing a maximum, ultimately
became shorter than at starting.
     In those experiments three different rings were employed, not one
                                                              I
of which had been annealed before being used ; therefore had a new
ring made of good soft iron, and very thoroughly annealed. It was
afterwards fitted with a boxwood jacket, around which 515 turns of
 insulated wire were wound in the usual way. With this ring it was
found that the smallest currents which caused any effect at all pro
duced contraction ; there was no indication of the smallest prelimin
ary extension.
     The results of an experiment with the ring (which                   I  shall call
Ring I)        are    given    in   Table   II  and   in the  lower  curve   of fig. 2.
 The latter bears a close resemblance to the earlier portion of the
curve given by a rod of cobalt.                   The greatest retraction reached
 was nearly 75 ten-millionths (exceeding any that has been ever before
obtained with iron), and from the appearance of the curve there is
 reason to believe that this was still far from its limiting value, but
the heating effect of the magnetising current made vt impossible to
carry the experiment further.
     * 'Phil. Trans.,'   179, A, p. 205. A ring is prepared for the experiment in the
 following manner      : — Short  brass rods are attached to it at opposite ends of a
 diameter, forming prolongations, which serve to transmit the effect of changes in the
 length of the diameter to the measuring instrument. The ring is then covered
 ¦with  a loosely fitting boxwood jacket, also ring-shaped, and through holes in this
 the two brass rods protrude.          The magnetising coil is wound directly upon the
  wooden ring, the object of the latter being to protect the iron from the heat
  generated when a current is passing th rough the coil.

out to be difficult or impossible to replace.                     I
                                                  therefore had another
ring  made  of  iron from the  same  parcel, and  believed to have been
cut from the same bar as the first. As, however, there was some
doubt about this latter point,                  I
                                   thought it better in the first instance
to anneal the new ring, and test it with a few turns of wire wound
upon it. Its behaviour was found not to differ materially from that
of Ring I. A very small elongation — too small to be measurable —
was, however, observed with a magnetising force of only 3 C.G.S.
units, contraction beginning when the force was increased beyond this
value. The ring was then made red hot, and plunged into cold
water, with the object of hardening                     it,
                                            after which operation      was        it
replaced in its boxwood jacket and wound with 473 convolutions of
wire.
     This ring, called Ring II, was now found to give the                    same results
as       the old unannealed rings and straight wires.                      As appears in
Table        II    and fig.attained its maximum elongation of about
                               2,   it
33 ten-millionths in a field of 80, its original length was recovered in
a field of about 440, and    retraction of 11 ten-millionths occurred in
                                       a
a field of 560.
   It appears, therefore, that as regards magnetic changes of dimen
sions, an iron rod or ring     affected by annealing in very nearly the
                                         is

IX. "On       Correlation of certain External Parts of Pal/vmon
       serratus"    By H. THOMPSON. Communicated by Professor
       Weldon, F.R.S. Received January 25, 1894.
    In 1890 Professor    Weldon published (' Roy. Soc. Proc.,' vol. 47,
 p. 445)  the results of measurements of certain organs of the common
shrimp, with a view to establish by accurate data the degree of varia
tion existing in those organs. In a later paper (' Roy. Soc. Proc.,'
 vol. 51, p. 2) he determined, by Mr. Galton's method there described,
 the degree of correlation existing between four organs of the same
animal, and in a recent paper (' Roy. Soc. Proc.,' vol. 54, p. 318)
 similar determinations have been worked out by him for certain
 organs of Carcinus mcenas.
    Some time ago it was suggested to me by Professor Weldon that I
 should determine the values of correlated variations in a number of
 parts of the hard exoskeleton of the common prawn (Palaemon
 serratus). Accordingly, 1000 adult female prawns, chosen at random,
 were procured from Plymouth and measured. Twenty-two measure
 ments were made of each prawn, except in the case of two or three
 measurements which were made on part only of the sample.
     The parts measured were the following : —

   XIX6.    Similar measurement for the left side.
   Measurements      I to III were made with compasses, and may be re
garded as accurate to within about 0-5 mm., except No. I, the body
length, which is somewhat less accurate. The remaining measure
ments were made under a microscope, and are accurate to within
O-05 mm.
   For the purpose of comparison the measurements are all expressed
 in terms of the body length, which is taken as = 1000.

                numerals refer to the numbers of the measurements.
    Out of the 1000 prawns seven had a deformed rostrum, and six
had a deformed telson. In several of the numerical results set out
below these thirteen animals have been excluded because their deform
ities affected the body length to such an extent as to give a wholly
fictitious value to the reduced measurements of the other organs.
    The existence of a long rostrum in the prawn has proved a serious
hindrance, since its length in proportion to that of the body is very
 variable, and hence those parts in which the rostrum is an element
 present a degree of correlation which is very slight, and render im
 possible any real comparison with the corresponding parts in the
 shrimp, for instance, which has scarcely any rostrum at all.
    Selection was made of the female prawn as being larger than the
 male, and therefore more convenient for the purposes of measure
 ment.     The largest measured 111 mm. in total body length, the
 smallest 61'5 mm.
    All the measurements having been reduced, as above stated, to
 fractions of the total body length, they were next arranged in order
 of magnitude for each organ separately, and in almost every case the
 values were found to range themsolves with a fair degree of symmetry
 around the median value, and to correspond with more or less
 accuracy to calculated probability curves.            In one case, however
 (measurement      No.   VII),  the  curve  presented features of asymmetry
 ¦which have been investigated by Professor Karl Pearson (' Roy. Soc.
 Proc.,' vol. 54, p. 329).
    The next step was to determine the degree of correlation between
 various pairs of the organs measured. The method used was that
 originally suggested by Mr. Galton, and sufficiently explained by
 Professor Weldon in his paper above referred to, so that it is un
 necessary to repeat it here. .

    An examination of these values shows that, as might be expected,
the highest degree of correlation exists between the paired organs,
viz., between the right and left squames, 0'94. ; between the right and
left exopodites of the 6th pair of swimmerets, which, with the
telson, form the propelling organ of the prawn, 0'86 ; between the
distances of the spines on the telson from its posterior end, 0'76.
    Next, we observe that a strong correlation obtains between the
terga of adjacent abdominal segments; their values range between
0 58 and 0-71 ; while those of segments that do not lie next each
other range between 0"47 and 0'61.             A considerable fall occurs in
the degree of correlation between the telson and the segments of the
abdomen — it varies from 026 to 0-29, except in the case of the 6th
abdominal segment, which lies next to the telson, when the value
 rises to 0*51. It is interesting to note that Professor Weldon found the
corresponding value for the telson and 6th abdominal tergum in the

238               Mr. H. Thompson.           On Correlation      of       [Mar.  I,
common shrimp from Plymouth to be only Oil.                          Perhaps this
difference may in part be accounted for by the fact that the prawn is
essentially a swimmer, while the shrimp, in confinement at any rate,
spends most of its time standing or crawling on the surface of the
sea-bottom.      Tbe prawn is certainly a more powerful and rapid
swimmer.       It swims backwards, propelling itself by means of the
hinder part of the abdomen, the terminal portion of which is fan-
shaped, the fan consisting of the telson and the exopodites of the
last pair of appendages.          This hinder half of the abdomen starts
from the extended position, and is brought, with a rapid stroke, up
under the fore part of the abdomen and thorax, pushing the water
before it, and so propelling the animal backwards.                   The 3rd seg
ment acts as the hinge        of  the propeller, and    it may  be   assumed that
the exoskeleton is here exposed to the greatest strain, for here we
find the highest degree of correlation, as is shown by the following
figures  : —

   Professor Weldon determined three other values in the shrimp,
viz., the relations between carapace length and post-spinous portion of
carapace, between carapace length and tergum of abdomen vi., and
between carapace length and telson. Their values were (in Ply-
month specimens) 081, O09, and 0"18 respectively.                       It is not
possible   to institute   a  comparison with exactly       the  same organs in
the prawn, as, owing to the great variation in the length of the
rostrum, no appreciable degree of correlation exists between the
whole carapace including rostrum (measurement No.                    Ill)  and the
other organs. Bui if we take measurement No.                  II  (from orbit to
hinder edge of carapace) as an approximate equivalent to the cara
pace measurements of the shrimp, we find in the prawn the corre
sponding values are 059, 059, and 0-40. The difference in the first
measurement, viz., shrimp, 081 ; prawn, 0"59, may be accounted for
by the fact that the dorsal spines probably do not correspond in
nature or function in the two animals.               The shrimp has but one
median dorsal spine, situated far forward ; the prawn has a row of
them.
   But why the prawn should exhibit a so much higher degree of
correlation between the carapace and the two terminal segments
of its body than the shrimp is not,              I   think, readily to be ex

  I. " The Thermal Radiation from Sun Spots.                 Preliminary
        Notes of Observations made at           Dararaona,   Streete, Co.
        Westmeath, 1893."        By W. E.     Wilson,   M.R.I.A. Com
        municated by G. Johnstone           Stoney,   F.R.S. Received
        January   4, 1894.
     These observations were made by means of a large heliostat, lent
  by the Royal Society, and a Boys's radio-micrometer.      The heliostat
  consists of a plane silver-on-glass mirror of 15 in. aperture.     It is
  mounted equatorially, and driven by a clock.        When in use, it is
  adjusted to reflect the sunlight to the north pole, and, as long as the
  driving clock is kept in motion, the beam of light remains fixed in
. that position.   In the track of this beam, and about 12 ft. from the
  plane   mirror, is mounted a concave silver-on-glass mirror of 9 in.
  aperture, and about 13 ft. focus. Its axis points to the south pole,
  so that the cone of rays formed by it strikes the centre of the plane
  mirror, and a short distance inside the focus. A small plane mirror
  mounted on the end of an aim is then so placed as to intercept the
  cone of rays, and reflect it horizontally into the observatory window ;
  an achromatic lens enlarges the solar image which is formed on a
  screen in the room to 4 ft. in diameter.
     Behind this screen, and standing on a pier of concrete, is mounted
  the radio-micrometer.     The aperture through which radiant heat
  reaches the sensitive thermo-couple is a round hole drilled through
  a thick sheet of brass, and is only 1 mm. in diameter. A white card
  board screen is placed in front of the brass one to cut off heat from
  falling on the latter, and is provided with a hole slightly larger. A
  beam of lime light is thrown on the mirror of the radio-micrometer,
   and reflected on to the scale in the usual way. The diagonal mirror
  of the heliostat is provided with slow motions in two directions,
  which are moved by long rods and Hook joints inside the observatory-
  Thus any part of the sun's disc can be placed on the small aperture

of the radio-micrometer,      and the driving clock will                then keep     it
there.
  The observations are taken in the following manner.                       A      small
screen is placed over the aperture of the radio-micrometer,                 and the
zero position of the spot of light on the scale noted.   The screen is
then removed, and the umbra of a sun spot placed on the aperture.
The reading is then taken and entered in column u. The image is
then moved, so that a part in the neighbourhood of the spot,
but at (he same distance from the centre of the solar disc, is placed on
the aperture.   This reading is entered in column N. Finally, a
reading is taken at the centre of the disc, and entered in column C.
The throws of the instrument are then got by subtracting the figures
in columns «, N, and C from the zero. The deflections of the instru
ment have been experimentally proved to be strictly proportional to
the amount of radiant heat falling on the thermo-couple.            The
following is a typical observation taken August 7, 1893, of a large
sun spot then visible.     The umbra of this spot measured 0'8 in.
across  on the screen,  so  that the aperture of the radio-micrometer
was only covering about        of the apparent area of the umbra.

   This spot was at a distance from the centre of the disc of about
0'4 of the radius.
   As the radiation from the photosphere falls off from the centre to
the edge of the disc, it seemed an interesting point to determine if
any change in the ratio of tt/C would take place as a spot was
carried across the disc by the sun's rotation.    If the spot       as       is,      is
generally thought,    a depression, the absorption   of heat    ought to
 increase as

have to pass.      On the other hand, if the spot was floating above the
absorbing atmosphere the radiation from it would remain constant in
any position on the solar disc.

   It will be  seen by the following observations of spots, taken from
August 5     to  November 9, that there is distinct evidence that the
radiation from the spot does not fall off" as rapidly when near the
limb as the neighbouring photosphere ; in fact, the ratio «/C remains
nearly constant, whereas the ratio «/N gets nearer unity as the spot
approaches the limb.         The spot observed on the 22nd of October is a
good example, as the same spot was observed again on the 26th, 29th,
and on the 30th, when it had reached within a distance, D, of 95
from the centre.       It will be seen that on these four dates the ratio
w/C was respectively 0-338, 0 360, 0-313, 0-356, whereas the ratio «/N
was 0-349, 0-410, 0-706, 0-783.
    Langley,f in 1874 and 1875, measured the radiation from sun
spots. He used a thermo-pile and galvanometer, and obtained as the
mean of his results a ratio of 0-54 + 0-05.
   His method was first to take a reading in the neighbourhood of the
spot, but between it and the centre of the disc. He then took a
reading in the umbra, and, finally, a third reading in the neighbour
hood between the spot and the edge of the sun.

   The mean of the two photospheric readings he used as a divisor for
the umbral reading. He then says, " The decrement of heat as we
approach the limb is, though not exactly, yet so very nearly, in the
same ratio for photosphere and spots, that no correction is needed on
this account for the present observations."
   If Langley failed, through want of instrumental means, to notice
the difference between the absorption in a spot and the photosphere
near the limb, his method would make his umbral readings too high.
The mean of twenty observations here equals 0"356, against Langley's
0*54. This is a serious difference, and, I think, can only be accounted
for either by the use of superior instrumental means, or by a possible
variation in the radiation of spots in different years of the sun spot
cycle.
   It is difficult to   see how  too low a  value for umbral radiation could
be got, whereas too       high a one   might be found by want of definition
and trembling in the image, so that some of the penumbral radiation
would reach the thermo-couple.

      Experimental Investigations on the Effective Temperature

                                (Abstract.)
   The only tolerably complete series of investigations on this subject
up to the present time have been those of Bossetti and Le Chatelier.
The results given by other writers have depended more or less on
guesses   relative to the law connecting radiation and temperature,
and differences on this point alone have given values varying
between 1500° and 3,000,00u° to 5,000,000° 0.
   Rossetti worked with a thermo-pile, exposed directly to the heat of
the sun; the law connecting the deflections of the galvanometer with
the temperature of an artificial source of heat having been obtained
up to a temperature of about 2000° C, from the deflection produced
by the heat of the sun the solar temperature was calculated by extra
polation.
   Le Chatelier worked on an entirely different principle, measuring
the intensity of the light transmitted through a certain piece of red
glass, first from sources at known temperatures up to 1700° or
1800°, and, secondly, from the sun, the temperature of which was
then obtained, as in Bossetti's case, by a process of extra-polation,
which is, of course, necessary in any method, until we can raise
substances to a temperature actually as high as that of the sun, an
experiment at present impossible.
   Rossetti obtained finally a'temperature of 10,000° C, approximately,
while Le Chatelier gives 7600° ( + 1000°) as the mean of his results.
In the paper the difference between Rossetti's result and our own
(6200° C.) is discussed, and a possible explanation given.
   The method adopted by the authors is a zero method, and the
essential point is the balancing of the heat from the sun with that
from a platinum strip heated to a high known temperature.
   The artificial source of heat was a modified form of Joly's " meldo-
meter," the calibration of which can be performed with a very high
degree of accuracy.      The " radiation balance " is a form of Boys's
radio-micrometer containing a duplex circuit, so designed that the
heat from the sun can be made to exert a turning moment in the
opposite direction to that due to the artificial source of heat, and by
making the apparent area of the latter sufficiently great, the radia

tion from it may be increased so far as to equal that arriving at the
radio-micrometer from the sun.
    The following points are considered, after descriptions of the
method and apparatus have been given : —
    1.  The law connecting radiation and temperature.
             This is probably the most important factor in the value of
        '
          the final result. Numerous investigations on the point have
          been made, which are referred to in the paper.
             After a careful series of experiments we have come to the
          conclusion that (at least for bright platinum) Stefan's " law
                               " holds,*
          of the 4th power                 i.e., that for high temperatures (say
          over 600° or 700° C.) if R = the radiation from a source whose
          absolute temperature is T, then
                                      R«T4.
   2. The emissive power of platinum at high temperatures compared
          with that of lamp-black.
             On this point the value obtained by Rossetti was used,
          some considerations being given in support of his figures.
   3. The amount of the atmospheric absorption.
             This is fully discussed, and again the value obtained by
          Rossetti is used.
             Langley's theoretical value for percentage absorption of
          radiation from a body in the zenith, viz., 41 per cent., is shown
          to be possibly too great ; Rossetti obtained 29 per cent., which
          appears to be the value best supported by experiment.
             The climate of Ireland entirely prevents a systematic series
          of investigations on this particular point.
   Several subsidiary questions are also discussed, and, finally, the
results of about sixty-nine observations are given, which lead to a
final mean result for the effective solar temperature of 6200° C.
    It is pointed out, in conclusion, that the method would probably
give excellent results if adopted in some country in or near the
tropics, where atmospheric conditions can be trusted to remain more
constant for some weeks, or even days, together, and where a series
of observations taken at the same part of the year throughout the
 period of a sun-spot cycle might be hoped to settle the question of
 how (or if) the solar temperature varies during this time, as any
 error in the absolute value obtained may probably be considered con
 stant, so that comparative values from year to year might be trusted
 to indicate any change.

 surface of perfect emissive power.

 III.  "Experiments on a Fundamental Question in Electro-
        Optics : Reduction of Relative Retardations to Absolute."
        By John Kerr, LL.D., F.R.S.              Received March 9, 1894.
    To prepare the way, I begin by recalling these well-known facte :
 that when light passes through an electrostatically strained medium
 ia a direction perpendicular to the line of electric force, it undergoes
 a uni-axal double refraction, the optic axis coinciding with the line
 of force ; that with reference to this action, dielectrics are divisible
 into two classes, the positive* and the negative,t which are optically
 related to each other in the same way as the positive class of crystals
 to the negative ; that the intensity of the action, or the quantity of
 optical effect per unit thickness of the dielectric, is measured by the
 product CF4, where C is a constant which is characteristic of the
 medium, and P is the value of the resultant electric force : that the
 effects are generally observed and examined still as they were dis
 covered first, by simple experiments with a pair of Nicol's prisms and
 a slip of strained glass or other phase-difference compensator.
    In every such experiment the        effect   specified by the compensator
 is a difference of phases, or a relative retardation ; and we may there
 fore view it as a resultant effect— that is to say, as the resultant,
 or the difference, of electrically-generated absolute retardations of
two component lights, whose planes of polarisation are parallel and
perpendicular to the line of electric force. What, then, are the values
of these two absolute retardations in any given case ? What are the
two absolute components of any electrically-generated           relative retarda
tion ?     Such is the question here proposed for solution by ex
periment.
    As long ago as 1882, and several years following,               I  was much
occupied    at intervals  with  this interesting   question.      In  the  summer
of 1885, in some experiments with the dielectric CS2,                  I  obtained
results as decisive as    could  be  desired.     Other   dielectrics,   both solid
and liquid, were tried afterwards, but only with partial success, the
experimental difficulties being, in some cases, too much for my
methods and time. To these cases           I shall make no further reference,
as  I will keep to the one line of experiment, and to those experiments
in particular in which the indications were quite regular and unmis-
takeable. With these limitations, the inductions extend to four liquid
dielectrics, two positive and two negative ; and all the experiments
point clearly in one direction.

effect  of electric strain is a positive or negative retardation of the
one component light whoso plane of polarisation                is perpendicular
to the line of force, the sign of the retardation being, of course,
the same as the nominal sign of the dielectric.               Therefore, of two
vibrations which are (on Fresnel's hypothesis) perpendicular                and
parallel respectively to the line of force, it is only the latter that is
immediately affected by the electric strain, this vibration along the
line of force having its velocity of transmission retarded or accelerated
according as the dielectric is of the positive class or the negative.
   I  venture to regard this result as a general law of double refraction
in electro-optics, though the proof extends only to four different di
electrics.    As the best proof that      I  can offer,   I  will merely give a
condensed    historical sketch of the experiments. It will be seen in
this way how the law was first suggested and then confirmed by the
phases    of a new electro-optic effect.       It will be seen also that the
proof of the law is independent of all hypotheses, independent even
of everything previously known in electro-optics.

 The result of the arrangement is that, -when the pieces are properly
 placed, the bright vertical slit L, as seen from E in the direction EG,
 is crossed by a set of interference-fringes.        These are well defined in
 position by reference to a constant black line, the image of a fine wire
 which is fixed across the slit L. It may be assumed, without argu
 ment, that any small increase or decrease of velocity of one of the
 pencils BP, CG, will produce a positive or negative displacement of
the fringes, at the rate of one fringe- width of displacement for every
wave-length of relative retardation.            As far as the assumption is
required,     it is easily verified by the  introduction of thin plates of glass
into the course of the light, anywhere between the two thick plates ;
and   I   find in this way, definitely, that (as the pieces actually stand
in the diagram and in all the experiments) an ascent of the fringes
indicates a relative retardation of the pencil BP.
    There are two essential pieces that remain to be noticed, of which
the first is the electro-optic cell.      It is shown in the diagram how the
laterally separated component pencils pass through the cell, BF
through the electric field, and CG through the space electrically
screened by the second conductor, this conductor being always to
earth.      The last piece is a Nicol's prism N, which is placed in the
path of either of the single pencils GE, LB, with its principal section
laid (1) horizontally and (2) vertically.         The design of the apparatus
will now be apparent, which is to give the means of detecting elec
trically generated changes of velocity of the light BF in two succes
sive cases, when the plane of polarisation is (1) perpendicular to tho
lines  of force, and (2) parallel to the lines of force. But in actual
experiment there is a difficulty encountered at once, which appears at
first sigbt to be insurmountable.
   Disturbance of the Fringes. — Suppose all the pieces placed as in the
diagram, the cell nearly filled with carbon disulphide, the second
internal conductor put permanently to earth, and the fringes obtained
in good form and position.           When connexion is made between the
first internal conductor and       the knob of a charged Leyden jar whose
outer    coating is to earth, there is an immediate disturbance of the
fringes,* a set of large and irregular movements, with deformations,
ending in the disappearance of the whole system in one or two
seconds.      The effects are seen better when the first internal conductor
is connected permanently with the prime conductor and an attached
Leyden jar, for the potential can then be raised regularly and very
slowly from zero, and the full course of the disturbance takes a
longer time ; but in other respects the phenomena are the same as
before.
    When the fringes have been extinguished in this way by the
electric action, it is easy to recover them, either by putting tho prime
conductor to earth, or by keeping the potential at a sensibly constant

valae, high or low, for a little time.      If with this view the machine
be kept working at a constant rate throughout the experiment, the
extinguished fringes return gradually into the optical field, and in a
little time (twenty to eighty turns of the plate) they are as clearly
visible as they were before disturbance ; their forms also are good,
and their positions approximately constant, though they do not often
continue quite motionless in such circumstances, even for a fraction
of a second.     If the prime conductor be now put to earth for a little,
and the experiment be then repeated, the disturbance passes through
all the same phases as formerly, though it is more violent at starting
as the preceding interval of rest is longer.        All these effects come
out equally well with common light, and with light polarised in the
two principal planes.
    This optical disturbance is evidently a remote effect of the electric
action, produced immediately — not by electric strain — but by irregular
changes of density in the medium.           We know that in the present
cell, as in every like arrangement, the electric action throws the
liquid into currents, which pervade all parts of the cell and are very
intense at high potential.         These material currents explain tbe
changes of density ; for, at starting, they give rise to a rapid process
of mixture, forcing denser masses upward into the course of the
light, <fcc, and, afterwards, when the mixture is completed, they are
still accompanied by irregular variations of pressure in the liquid.
It should be easy, therefore, to imitate the effects by means purely
mechanical ; and of this     I can give an example from actual observa
tion.
   A plate cell, about an inch thick and open at the top, was charged
with water, and placed in the course of the pencils BF, CG, imme
diately behind the electro-optic cell ; and the fringes were obtained in
good form and position.        The stirring of this water gave a set of
optical  effects  that could  not  be distinguished from the former dis
turbance.     And when the fringes, extinguished in this way mechanic
ally, were well restored and made moderately steady by regular
stirring kept up for a time, I found that a disturbance of the same
kind could be obtained at pleasure, either by an interval of rest (the
longer the better), or by the addition of a little warm water.          But
leaving this and returning to the electro-optic experiments,      I proceed
to show how, in spite of these irregular movements of the fringes,
and in the midst of them all, it is possible to obtain a steady effect,
which corresponds perfectly to the known bi-refringent action of the
medium.
    Begular Dislocation of the Fringes. — The electric arrangements are
the same as formerly, the two internal conductors being connected
permanently, the first with the prime conductor, and the second with
earth. There is only one change made in the apparatus ; the nicol

 N   is withdrawn, and a small rhomb of Iceland spar (about 3 cm.
 long) is put in its place at E, with principal section horizontal.    In
 this way the two systems of fringes which were given by the nicol N
 in succession are now given simultaneously, side by side, and each
 the exact prolongation of the other ; the successive systems (a) of
the next diagram are changed into the double system (/3, 7).
    The machine is now set in motion. The system (/3, 7) is disturbed
as was the system («) formerly ; but in the midst of the disturbance,
and as long as the fringes are clearly visible, the sets (/3) and (7) are

Been to be relatively displaced, the system (/i, 7) being changed into
the system (i, e). The extent of the dislocation increases as the
potential rises ; that shown in the diagram, which is about three-
fourths of the fringe-width, is not much below the highest that can
be got with the apparatus.      The direction of the dislocation is con
stant, and indicates a relative retardation of that vibration in the
electric field which is parallel to the line of force ; and this agrees
with the known character of the medium CSj as a positive di
electric.
    It is very interesting to watch the two sets of fringes (£) and («),
and to see them sometimes moving rapidly and very fitfully, but
moving always as one system, with its two parts dislocated un
changingly, except so far as the extent of the dislocation varies
with varying potential. It is equally interesting to see the effect
of spark-discharge of the prime conductor, especially from high
potential.    At the instant of the spark there is a sndden disap
pearance of the dislocation, an extremely quick jump of the fringes
into line with each other, and this without perceptible check or sud
 den change of any kind in the disturbance-motion common to the
two seta at the time. The best way of observing the effect is to take
 sparks from prime conductor to earth at stated intervals, while the
 machine is kept working at some constant rate. The dislocation then

reappears immediately after each of the sparks, increasing regularly
from zero as the potential rises, and then increasing and decreasing
quickly or slowly as the potential rises and falls quickly or slowly.
Even when the potential falls most rapidly, as in spark-discharge,
the direction of the backward jump is always evident to tbe eye;
otherwise the disappearance of the dislocation in that case is so very
quick that one would call                    it instantaneous.
 Very little need be said upon the optical theory of these phenomena.
What must be remembered       that each of the sets of fringes {£) and
                                              is,
(e)  is due' to the interference of two such pencils as BP and CG re
united in GE, the vibrations being horizontal in one pair of interfer
ing pencils, and vertical in the other pair. With regard to changes
of refringent power which are due to mechanical disturbance,          may         it
be assumed that these are independent of the direction of the vibra
tion both pairs of pencils are therefore similarly and equally affected
      :
at each instant, and the corresponding displacements of the two sets
of fringes are at each instant similar and equal, however irregularly
they may vary from one instant to another.        It otherwise with the
                                                                    is

are differently affected at each instant, and the difference        deter       is
mined solely by value of potential, so that the corresponding effect
comes out steadily in the midst of all the irregular changes which are
produced by mechanical disturbance of the dielectric.
I    think    must be admitted that in this regular dislocation of the

ness with which      comes out in the midst of the disturbance.

   First Appearance       the Law. — Before leaving the present experi
                               of
ments must notice one or two facts observed, but not yet mentioned,
      I
that go towards a solution of the question with which we started.
The phenomena to which         refer were seen clearly enough in some of
                                     I
the earlier experiments       but     was only at a later stage that they
                                         ;          it
were well understood, and they were then obtained more regularly.
    Beginning with the last form of the experiment — that with the
rhomb of Iceland spar as eye-piece.         The spar,     should mention,
                                                                     I
 was always so placed that the plane of polarisation in the set of
fringes (c) was vertical.     What      have to notice now
                                                    I           a peculiaris
feature  of the jump   of  the fringes at the instant of discharge.   To               a
carefully strained, as to an unstrained, attention, this jump appeared
as a movement of the set of fringes (<¦) down to the level of the set
(5), never as a movement of the set (5) up to the level of the set (<•).
I  must say, however, that the accuracy of this perception or judgment
was to myself in some degree doubtful, not because of any expectation
that could have led to               it,
                              but because of the very fugitive character

 1894.]         Fundamental Question in Electro- Optics.               2,59
of the phenomenon, and its partial obscuration in many cases by dis
turbance.
    Returning, therefore, to the first form of experiment, that with the
nicol N as eye-piece.    When the principal section of N was horizontal,
and the vibration directed therefore along the line of force, there was
a perfectly regular jump of the fringes downwards at the instant of
discharge ; and at high potential the effect was large and strikingly
distinct.    When the principal section was vertical, there was nothing
regular of this kind seen in any of a large number of observations :
there were distnrbance-movements at or about the instant of dis
cbarge, as before and after, but nothing that could be accepted as a
regular jump of the fringes at that instant, always in one direction or
always in the other. The interpretation of these results is obvious.
I have already stated, as a matter of observation, that a rise of the
fringes indicates a relative retardation of the pencil BF which passes
through the electric field. From the downward jump of the fringes
in one of the two cases, we infer- therefore that the pencil BF is in
that case relatively accelerated in C9nsequence of discharge. But in
the present experiment,, and with reference to the pencil BF in rela
tion to the pencil UG, it is evident that relative acceleration and
absolute are equivalent ; because it is only in that division of the cell
through which the pencil BF passes that there is any sudden physical
change at the instant of discharge.         It appears, therefore, that to
reliere the liquid of electric strain, is to relieve one of the vibrations
(that along the line of force) of an absolute retardation, leaving the
perpendicular vibration unaffected.
   In several of the later sets of these experiments with CS3 as
dielectric, and with nicol N as eye-piece,    I got what appeared to be a
perfectly clean liquid. The potential also was made to vary regu
larly and very slowly ; and from both causes the disturbance was
very much reduced.       The effects then were these : — Principal section
of N horizontal : a slow ascent of the fringes during the process of
charge, pretty regular, bnt often obscured and sometimes over
powered by disturbance ; the contrary jump seen always at the in
 stant of discharge.    Principal section of N vertical : irregular, and
 generally very small oscillations of the fringes during the process of
 charge; bnt no regular motion in one- direction or the other exclu
 sively, either during the process of change, or at the instant of spark-
 discharge from high potential.
    From all these experiments with CS2, it seems to follow that of
 the two principal vibrations, the only one immediately and regularly
 affected by electric strain is that along the line of force.    This con
 clusion requires and well deserves to be verified ; and     I proceed to
 verify it by another method, or rather by the use of new means.

light. For a description of it I might refer to a paper already pub
lished ;* bnt I think I ought rather to describe the apparatus here
again. The essential pieces are shown in horizontal section in the
following diagram.

   R   and S are large blocks of Iceland spar, of equal thickness, their
principal sections horizontal, and their faces parallel. A pencil of
light from a vertical slit L, passes through a Foucanlt's prism H,
and is polarized by it at 45° to the vertical, and then enters the
rhomb R.          The two pencils emergent from R pass immediately
through a half-wave plate P, so placed as to interchange the two
planes of polarisation.           Ordinary pencil and extra-ordinary in the
crystal R become thus extra- ordinary and ordinary in S, and the bi-re-
fringement action of R is neutralised by that of S. The light enters
R and leaves S as a single pencil, bnt between P and S it passes as
a couple of pencils, BF and CG, about 14 mm. apart, and polarised
in planes vertical and horizontal.           The pencil emergent from S is re
ceived at. E through a Nicol's prism N, which is laid as for extinction
¦with    the Foucault H, When all the pieces have been properly
placed, the slit L is seen crossed by a set of interference-fringes,
and these are modified at pleasure by fine screw movements of the
spar S.
    The electro-optic cell is not given in the diagram. It is the same
piece as that shown in the diagram of the first arrangement, and is
placed here exactly as there, so that the two laterally-separated
component pencils pass normally throngh it, BF through the electric
field, and CG behind the second conductor.
    The only other optical piece employed in the experiments is a
Jamin's Glass Compensator^ which is placed immediately in front of
the spar S ; it enables the observer to specify small differences of re
tardation of the pencils BF and CG.
    The results obtained formerly (with nicol N as eye-piece) were
fully verified with the new apparatus. The method finally adopted
as the best was so similar to the former, and the effects also, that
any long description of the experiments wonld be superfluous.                    But
to give a fair view of the results        I  will describe one day's work.

    Final Experiments with CSj. — The first internal conductor         con
nected     permanently with prime conductor without Leyden jar, the
liquid quite clean, and the conditions of electric work perfect all day.
The observations were taken in five successive sets.
     First Set. — Plane of polarisation of the pencil BF (through the
electric field) vertical, or perpendicular to line of force : Rise of
fringes indicates relative retardation of that pencil.           When the
fringes    were  obtained   in good  form   and position, the machine   was
started, and kept working at a constant rate throughout the experi
ment.       As formerly, the first effect was    a large disturbance, the
fringes being displaced      and deformed,  and disappearing altogether at
the second or third turn of the plate ; but in a little time (thirty or
forty turns) they reappeared in good form and approximately con
stant position.        For distinctness of effect the central fringe was
brought back to the line of reference (generally downwards) by a
small screw movement of the spar S ; and then, at every spark from
prime conductor to earth, there was a quick downward jump of the
fringes, the effect being as distinct as possible from the irregular and
slow and generally small movements that went on before and after
the spark.         As the experiment proceeded the liquid was more
thoroughly mixed, the disturbance decreased, and the effect came out
 much more purely.        Sparks were taken repeatedly at every 3rd, 5th,
 10th, 15th turn of the plate, and the jump was there in every
 instance, and beautifully distinct.       The extent of the jump varied
from about one-third of the fringe-width at every 5th turn of the
 plate to about three-fourths at every 10th turn.         I should add that
 the disturbance movements, though they were greatly reduced at last,
 were still such as to prevent any good static observation of the
 fringes.
     It is   proved clearly by this set of observations that when the
 plane   of  polarisation is perpendicular to the line of force the light is
 absolutely retarded by electric strain.      The spars R and S were now
 turned round LE through 180°, and the pieces were moved across the
 optic bench into good position.
     Second Set. — Plane of polarisation of the pencil BF (through the
  electric field) horizontal : Rise of the fringes indicates a relative
  retardation of that pencil.      The method was the same as in the first
  set, sparks being taken from prime conductor to earth at regular
  intervals, long and short. When the initial disturbance was over,
  movements of the fringes were still seen, sometimes in one direction
  and sometimes in the other, but not exclusively or specially at the
  instant of discharge.      These disturbance movements were slow and
  generally small ; and as the experiment proceeded they became very
  faint, and were occasionally not seen at all for a little time.      As to
   the effect specially looked for,   I need only say that in several scores

 262                  Dr.  J. Kerr.   Experiment* on a            [Mar. 15,
 of observations, taken at different potentials, high and low, there was
 not a trace observed of a regular jump of the fringes at the instant of
 discharge. It appears, therefore, that when the plane of polarisation
 is parallel to the line of force, the light is neither retarded or accele
rated by electric strain.      The spars R and S were now turned back
throngh 180°.
    Third Set. — The same again as the first.      Many observations were
taken, and the former effects were obtained regnlarly ; but they were
 now more striking, because of the strong contrast with the negative
results of the set of observations immediately preceding.        The action
appeared also to be stronger than before, probably because of im
proved insulation.       The extent of the jump, taken at every 5th torn
of the plate, was now half the fringe-width ; and at every 10th or
15th turn it was clearly four-fifths.        I find in my notes that this
large jump     of the  fringes impressed   me   here, again and again, as a
thing peculiarly beautiful.
    Fourth Set. — The same again as the second.       The only question in
this case was, whether it might still be possible, by the most careful
work and under the best conditions attainable, to detect a very small
jnmp of the fringes at the instant of discharge.        Many observations
were taken at high potential, some at the highest, but without a
trace of effect of that kind.
    Fifth Set. — The same again as the first. The results of the first and
third sets were recovered regularly.        Sparks were then taken, some
times at every turn of the plato, sometimes oftcner. At every spark
there was a very small downward jump of the fringes, so small
sometimes as to be barely caught, but quite regular and beantifully
distinct.
    Remarks. — The jump of the fringes was chosen as the principal
object of observation, because it was never quite concealed, nor even
much obscured, by the mechanical disturbance of the liquid ; but           I
should add that the contrary motion — the gradual ascent of the fringes
during the process of charging — was generally evident enough in the
experiments, though not often undisturbed or quite regular in its
course.
    The best observations were got when the fringes happened to con
tinue at rest through a sensible interval of time, including the instant
of discharge.      The contrast between the two cases was then very
remarkable, especially at high potential ; in the one case, the beauti
fully clear jump so often mentioned; in the other case, no trace of
a jump in either direction, generally not even a perceptible shiver of
the fringes at the instant of strongest discharge.        Instances of this
kind occurred not very rarely in the experiments ; and there could
be no contrast more striking than that between the phenomena in
the two cases.

   1894.]         Fundamental Question in Electro-Optics.                    263
      From what    I know of   the apparatus and its performance       I am snre
  that no regular and abrupt retardation or acceleration amounting to
  as much as the hundredth part of an average wave-length could have
  escaped observation in the experiments.           It will be remembered also
  that the jump of the fringes at high potential extended to four-fifths
  of the fringe width.       With reference, therefore, to the dielectric CSS,
  and the two principal vibrations parallel and perpendicular             to the
  line of force, it appears that the regular effect of the electric strain
  upon one of the vibrations is a positive retardation, while upon the
  other vibration there is very probably no effect whatever, and cer
  tainly no effect as large as the eightieth part of the former.
      Second Positive Dielectric : A. paraffin oil, specific gravity 0 845. This
  liquid was far inferior to CSa electrically,         and also as an optical
 medium.       The method of experiment finally adopted as the best was
 a little different from that with CL2.         The prime conductor had its
 capacity enlarged by connexion with a Leyden jar ; the machine was
 kept working at a constant rate, and the prime conductor was
 partially discharged, at short and regular intervals, by sparks upon
 the knob of the first internal conductor, which was of course dis
 charged in each interval.       The phenomenon looked for was a quick
 motion of the fringes at the instant of the spark ; that is, at the
 instant of electric charging of the liquid.
     (1.) Plane of polarisation of the pencil BF (through the electric
 field) vertical : Rise of fringes indicates relative retardation of this
 pencil.    At the instant of the spark there was a quick upward jump
 of the fringes through something like one-fifth of the fringe width,
generally followed by a set of large and comparatively slow disturb
ance-movements.          In most cases also, immediately after the spark,
the observer was able to detect the contrary            jump quite clearly by
laying    his finger  on  the knob  of the  first conductor.    Through a long
set of observations, taken at different potentials, the upward jump of
the fringes at the instant of charging was obtained with perfect
regularity ; and — amplitude excepted — the effect was not inferior to
that in CS2.
     (2.) Plane of polarisation of the pencil BF horizontal : Rise of
fringes indicates relative retardation of BF. Many observations
were taken at different potentials, high and low.           There were sluggish
and irregular disturbance movements, great and small, but no trace
of a regular jump of the fringes in one direction or the other at the
instant of the spark.       There could be no doubt as to the true meaning
of these results.      In this positive dielectric, as in CS», the vibration
along the line of force is retarded by electric strain, and the perpen
dicular vibration is unaffected.
     First Negative Dielectric : Oil of Colza. — This liquid also was far
inferior to CS2, especially as an optical medium. The method of

264         On a Fundamental Question in Electro-Optics.       [Mar. 15,
experiment followed with paraffin was retained here as the best ; the
first internal conductor was charged by spark from the prime con
ductor at regular intervals, and was put to earth for a moment in each
interval.
    (1.) Plane of polarisation of the pencil BP vertical: Rise of fringes
indicates relative retardation of BP. The fringes were generally
curved and very imperfect at the beginning of an experiment, but a
few successive charges brought them, after some disturbance, into
permanently good form, and then there was a quick downward jump,
seen always at the instant of the spark.     And, as in the contrary case
of paraffin, this jump was a thing as distinct as possible from the
sluggish and irregular disturbance-movements          by which it was
generally followed.     When   the  spark  was  taken at every 10th turn
of the plate, the potential was about as high as the liquid could bear,
and the extent of the jump was fully one-iifth of the fringe-width.
In the course of a long set of observations this downward jump of
the fringes at the instant of charging was seen with perfect regularity,
and always distinctly. In this case, therefore, the regular optical
effect of electric strain was an acceleration.
   (2.) Plane of polarisation of the pencil BF horizontal : Rise of
fringes indicates relative retardation of BF. When the fringes were
imperfect at starting, the effects of a few successive charges were the
same as in the first case, irregular displacements and changes of incli
nation, the fringes generally rising and falling in their lower and
higher parts till they came into permanently good form. Afterwards
there were smaller disturbances always present in this case as in the
former ; but neither there nor here were they such as to interfere
ultimately with exact observation. The experiment was carried on
for some time till the liquid, was well mixed and the fringes good.
Many observations were then taken, some of them at highest poten
tial, but there was no trace of a jump ever seen at the instant of the
spark. In this liquid, therefore, as in carbon disulphide and paraffin,
the only one of the two principal vibrations which is affected by
electric strain is that along the line of force ; but, as the present

this liquid was very defective optically, the image of the slit L being
mnch deformed and sometimes broken by streaks. The defect was
remedied in a good degree by strong charges given to the liquid on
both sides of the second conductor.       The method of experiment was
the same as with oil of colza.

the midst of which there was no regular effect to be seen ; but as the
experiment went on, and the medium improved, the expected effect
came out distinctly : a quick downward jump of the fringes at or im
mediately after the instant of the spark.             Under good optical con
ditions, and at potentials high and low, the effect was perfectly
regular, and was distinct and pure as that in oil of colza, though
apparently not quite so large.
    (2.) Plane of polarisation of the pencil BF horizontal : Rise of
fringes indicates relative retardation of BF. The disturbance of the
fringes was greatly reduced as the experiment went on, till at last
there was nothing left but a set of slow movements, very irregular
and very small, sometimes invisible.           In the midst of these, as in
their absence, and in a long set of observations, taken at different
potentials, from low to highest, there was no trace ever seen of a
jump of the fringes at the instant of the spark.               It appears, there
fore, that in this negative dielectric, as in oil of colza, the total
optical effect of electric strain is an acceleration of the vibration
which is directed along the line of force.
    The conclusion to he drawn from the preceding experiments has
been stated already by anticipation ; but         I  repeat it finally in other
terms as follows :   —
    If light pass through an electrostatically-strained medium at right
angles to the lines of force, and be represented by two component lights
whose    planes of polarisation are respectively parallel to the lines of force
and perpendicular, then the proper and immediate optical effect of the
electric strain is a change of velocity of the latter component.*
    The use of the words proper and immediate in this statement may
be thought objectionable ; but some such words are required for the
purpose here chiefly intended, which is to exclude those undoubtedly
remote effects of electric action that appeared as disturbances in all
the experiments.

       by Sir G. G. Stokes, F.R.S. Received February 16, 1694.
    It is  a well-known fact that during the solidification of certain
 alloys groups of the constituent metals fall out of solution, giving
 rise to the phenomenon called " liquation."           The molecular arrange
 ment which results from this behaviour of alloys has been investi
 gated by many experimenters, notably hy Devol, Roberts- Austen,
 and Guthrie.      The author has also studied the behaviour of a large
    *
      Tlie change of velocity in the case of any positive dielectric is of course a
 decrease.

                 '
Transactions for 1892, and in other papers to which reference may
be made.*       It is, however, in the case of alloys of silver and copper
that liquation is most marked, and gives rise to results of mnch inte
rest and industrial importance.            It is, for instance, often a matter of
great importance to obtain a plate of standard mlver (925 parts of silver
in 1000) of uniform standard. The great difficulty of effecting this has
been shown by Roberts-Austenf, and, as the results of an elaborate
series of experiments, he was led to the conclusion that slow and uni
form cooling of the mass was most effeotive in obtaining uniformity
of standard. He informs me of a fact of which                   I was not aware until
the present experiments          were   concluded,      viz., that be also tried the
effect of the rapid cooling of a thin casting in a large mould which
was no less than 45'7 cm. long. He found, however, that castings
made in this mould were comparative failures as regards uniformity
of standard, and that, as in the case of other published results given
by castings in thicker moulds, it was not possible, either- by rapid or
by slow cooling, to obtain masses of alloys which did not give points
of local richness.
    During the last few years         I  have returned to the investigation of
the silver-copper alloys, and as the results of a series of some hun
dreds of experiments, only the final ones of which must be referred to
here,   I find that it is preferable to cast the alloy very thin, and to
promote the uniformity of cooling.
   A bar of this alloy was cast into a " skillet" mould to produce a
casting 30 cm. in length, 13 cm. in width, and 6 mm. in thickness,
weighing 5 kilos. Punchings were taken through its thickness at
the points marked, and the assays which were made of these punch
ings showed the composition at the respective points to be as

    These results will,    I think, be considered sufficiently remarkable by
metallurgists who have been accustomed to deal with castings of
standard silver. It must not be supposed, however, that liquation
has been entirely prevented ; it has, however, practically disappeared.
    The excellent results now submitted to the Society have been ob
tained by limiting the possibilities of re-arrangement as much as may
be, and by ensuring that the conditions of cooling shall be as uniform
as possible. The need of obtaining uniform alloys is met with in
other branches of industry than those which involve the use of silver-
copper alloys, so that the conclusions to which the present experiments
point are somewhat far-reaching.

     Where the animals have been kept alive, the symptoms during life
   and the anatomical changes found after death have been investigated,
  and in all cases the results of absinthe stimulation have been recorded
  by the graphic method.
     In order to enable a clearer comparison to be made between the
  various results obtained by the experimental and anatomical methods,
  the paper is divided into —
        I. The anatomical   changes.
      II.  Behaviour of the animal during life.
     III.  Results of absinthe stimulation.
     IV.   Conclusions.
                        Part I. — Anatomical   Changes.
     The investigations of the degenerations have been made in every
  instance by the Marchi method upon animals which have been kept
  alive from a few days to three months.
  Removal of   one  Cerebral Hemisphere (Left), or complete Section of the
                  Left Crus Cerebri flush with the Tentorium.
     The results of these lesions as regards the descending degenerations
  are identical.
     They show that in the higher bulbo-spinal segments, from the
 3rd nerve downwards, there exist long descending internuncial fibres,
 which are grouped anteriorly and laterally as in the spinal cord ; in
 other words, that the anterior, antero-lateral, and lateral columns of
 the cord can be traced from the level of the superior corpora quadri-
 gemina.
     Anterior Columnar Fibres. — These fibres begin to group at the level
 of the uppermost part of the 3rd nerve against the anterior and inner
 aspect of the grey matter of the aqueduct of Sylvius ; they constitute
 the commencement of the posterior-longitudinal bundle. The degener
 ate fibres are absolutely limited to the side of the lesion; they occupy,
 for the most part, the inner portion of the posterior-longitudinal
 bundle, and they can be traced to the end of the cervical spinal cord.
 The higher the lesion the fewer are the number of degenerate fibres in
 the po8t.-longitudinal bundles ; if the lesion extends much below the
 3rd nerve, the degeneration of the post.-longitudinal bundle is very
 complete.    New fibres are continually being added to the post.-longi
 tudinal bundle in its passage through the bulbar segments, the
 degenerate fibres in consequence moving more anteriorly.           In the
 Bpinal cord   the  degenerate   fibres  are scattered  through the middle
 and post.-thirds of the anterior column on its inner aspect and closely
-simulate a direct pyramidal tract.

 1894.]      Degenerations in the Brain and Spinal Cord, §-c.'      271
    Antero-lateral Columnar Fibres. — Meynert's fibres (fountain decus
 sation) pass from the side of the lesion across the raphe immediately
 ventral to the post.-longitudinal bundles, and turn vertically down,
 lying in the raphe in front of the post.-longitudinal bundles. The
 fibres can be traced into the antero-lateral column of the cord as far
 as the lower cervical region.     In their descent they move slightly
 forwards, but they are always more anterior than the fibres of the
 post.-longitudinal bundles.    The degeneration method shows that
 Meynert's fibres arise in a focus close to the point of commencement
 of the descending root of the 5th, on a level with the roots of the
 3rd nerves. The vast majority of the fibres decussate completely ;
 the decussation is a very horizontal one.
    Lateral Columnar Fibres. —In the highest segments these are
 derived from fibres, which decussate in front of the preceding group,
 and originate from a slightly higher level in the tegmentum ; they
probably correspond to Forel's decussating fountain fibres.           In
the mesencephalon they occupy a position in front of and slightly
 external to the antero-lateral columnar fibres ; lower down they are
more laterally situated, and in the pons and medulla form a well
defined group, immediately in front of the ascending root of the 5th
 and the substantia gelatinosa, and dorsal to the nucleus lateralis ;
 they are traversed by the root of the 7th, and are bounded externally
 by trapezoid, and ascending cerebellar fibres.     They are internal to
the lemniscus and quite distinct from it ; they can be traced to the
 upper lumbar spinal cord.     In the spinal cord they occupy a position
immediately in front and to the outer side of the pyramidal tract ;
they are readily distinguished from the latter by their large size.
    Degeneration of Descending Hoot of bth. — The Marchi method shows
that this root is invariably degenerate upon the side of the lesion.
It arises in the lateral aspect of the Sylvian grey matter at about the
 level of the upper oculo-motor nucleus, descends to meet the ascend
ing root, and passes out without interruption.
    Pyramidal System. — The degeneration is confined exclusively to
the pyramid on the side of the lesion, and the degeneration appears
complete.
    There is a slight bifurcation at the decussation, a small group of
fibres passing back to the lateral tract on the same side.      There is
thus a direct lateral pyramidal tract, but there is no anterior direct
pyramidal tract.
    The decussation of the pyramid is not confined to the cervical
region ; degenerate fibres leave the pyramidal system from the in
ternal capsule, the crnsta, and from the pyramid in the medulla. A
large group passes through the thalamus and beneath the corpora
quadrigemina, many of the fibres crossing over in the roof of the
aqueduct.     A considerable number of degenerate fibres pass back to
    vol. LV.                                                    u

 the quadrigeminal region from the outer and dorsal part of the
 crusta.
    In the posterior commissure, pineal commissure, and corpus callosum
 there are numerous degenerate fibres.
    When the motor area or anterior third of the brain is removed, the
 degeneration is confined to the pyramidal system, the contrast with
 the results of hemisection of the mesencephalon being, therefore, very
 striking.
    Comparing hemisection of the mesencephalon with hemisection of
 the cord, the difference, as regards the internuncial fibres, is the
 greater amount of decussation in the mesencephalon than in the cord.
 The internuncial fibres are conspicuous by their large size.
   Comparison with ascending degenerations at the various levels
shows that the descending tracts described above are distinct from
the ascending.
   Lesion of the Cerebellum. — When one lobe of the cerebellum is
removed there is degeneration of the superior cerebellar peduncle.
I  have found no evidence of the descending columnar degeneration
described by Marchi.
                Part II. — Symptoms of Animals during Life.
   Comparing the relationship between the extent of the degenera
tions and the symptoms, it is found that —
   Removal     of the motor area entails degeneration of the pyramid
      alone, and a temporary paresis ; the animal appearing, after a
      short time, quite like the normal.
   Removal of a cerebral hemisphere or hemisection in the quadri
      geminal region gives rise to degeneration of the pyramidal and
      internuncial systems and fibres. The symptoms are more pro
      nounced; sensation is much altered; there is great difficulty of
      feeding.
   Hemisection of the cervical spinal cord produces extensive degene
      ration of the anterior and lateral columns of the cord.  There is
      at first hemiplegia, the vasomotor disturbance is much greater,
      and the sensory and motor paresis lasts longer.
   Removal of a lobe of the cerebellum does not appear to be accom
      panied by descending columnar degeneration ; the symptoms
      may be very slight, or there may be incoordination and sensory
      and motor weakness upon the side of the lesion. The manifesta
       tion of the motor weakness differs from that seen in the cats, in
       which the pyramid is degenerate. There is no wrist drop in the
      cerebellar cat.    The weakness in the case of the pyramidal cats
      is uncomplicated ; on the contrary, that in the cerebellar cat is
      intimately bound up with complex phenomena of incoordination.

1894.]       Degenerations in the    Brain and Spinal Cord,    fyc.     273
      The evidence would tend to show that the weakness in the two
      cases is due to different causes.
                 Part  III. — Remits  of Absinthe Stimulation.
   The absinthe has been injected either       immediately after the opera
tion or after complete recovery.       There are, therefore, two categories
                           "            " and " remote " but, as a rule,
 of experiments, viz.,       immediate                     ;
the difference between the average results in both cases is slight.
The fit was registered by spring myographs attached to the extensor
tendons   of the fore paws.
1.  Rernoral   of one  Cerebral Hemisphere, or Hemisection of the Mesen
        cephalon,   and  Immediate or Remote Absinthe Stimulation.
   Result. — There are bilateral fits.    On the paretic side the initial fit
may be    much smaller than on the left side ; in the subsequent fits,
tonus is more marked than clonus ; the final clonic contractions are
less numerous.
  2. Removal
                of Left Motor Area ; Immediate and Remote Stimulation.
    Result. — The fits upon the right and left sides more closely re
semble one another ; there is considerable clonus upon the " paretic
                                                                            "
side as  well as upon the normal.
                       3.  Removal of both Hemispheres  .
    Result. — Immediate removal of the hemispheres arrests the fits ; a
slight respiratory response can, however, be elicited.           Where one
hemisphere has been first removed, and after recovery the remaining
hemisphere and absinthe has been given, contractions have been
obtained, occurring at regular intervals and equal upon both sides           ;
in one case the contraction was most marked upon the side corre
sponding to the hemisphere first removed.           Removal of both hemi
spheres and stimulation        upon the second day was followed by two
strong fits, made up     of a series of contractions following one another
fairly rapidly, but not so rapidly as in the clonus when a hemisphere
is present.
    Where both motor areas have been removed in succession, regular
tonic and clonic bilateral responses have been obtained ; the rhythm
of the clonus is much Blower than when the cortex is intact.

    Result. — In two cases of complete recovery (complete paralysis of
 the hind quarters remaining), absinthe did not elicit a response from
 the distal segment of the cord ; the experiments, however, require
 repeating.
                             Part IV. — Conclusions.
    The formation of the descending system of the anterior, antero
 lateral, and lateral columns can be seen in the mesencephalon.
     There is a marked decussation of the lateral and antero-lateral
 column fibres in the mesencephalon.              The anterior column fibres
  (post.-longitudinal bundle) appear to be direct fibres            Decnssation
 is, however, not limited to this region ; it occurs in the spinal cord,
 and probably throughout the bulbo-spinal system.
     Decussation of the pyramidal system is not limited to the cervical
 region ; it occurs in the higher segments.               As in the preceding
 system so in this, there is a direct path      —  the direct lateral pyramidal
 tract, and there is evidence of direct fibres in the hipher segments.
    There is bilateral distribution of both systems of fibres, but there is
 no evidence whatever of recrossed fibres.

 1894.]         On the Elasticity    of the Living Brain,      §-e.          275
   No fibres get into the opposite pyramid by way of the corpus
callosum.
   Stimulation with absinthe shows that the bulbo-spinal centres (in
cluding the cerebellum) alone, can produce a series of clonic tits,
differing from the cortical in the much slower rhythm of the con
tractions.    But from the complete section of the cord experiments it
seems improbable that the cord alone can be excited by absinthe.
   Immediate hemisection of the cord prevents the absinthe fit on that
side ; bnt after recovery a modified fit results upon the side of the
lesion, in spite of the fact that the direct lateral and crossed pyramidal
tracts are completely degenerate, as well as the internuncial fibres in
the anterior and lateral columns.
   When one hemisphere is removed or a complete hemisection made
in the quadrigeminal region, there are bilateral fits, in spite of the
fact that, one pyramidal system is completely degenerate.              The fits
are modified upon the side opposite to the lesion, the clonus being less
marked, and the first fit being absent or very small.
   If, in the last two cases, a hemisection is made upon the side of the
degenerate pyramid, it instantly arrests the fits upon that side, the
section interrupting the sound direct pyramidal tract.
   I  therefore conclude that the maximal effect of absinthe is produced
when the motor area is present, and that the impulses generated
there are distributed by the pyramidal system in the way described,
the maximal effect crossing to the opposite side, the question of uni-
laterality or bilaterality being one of degree as shown by the differ
ences between the initial and subsequent fits, and as borne out by the
relative sizes of the crossed and uncrossed tracts.
   The epilepsy due to absinthe indicates that there are probably very
many epileptiform attacks in man which are toxic.

some knowledge        of the elementary factors conditioning the physical
changes in the brain substance due to mechanical pressure.
    Grashey* has already definitely proved that the coefficient of com
pressibility of the dead brain is slightly less than that of water,
which is equivalent to saying that under any ordinary pathological
conditions the brain tissue is incompressible.          At the suggestion of
Professor V. Horsley, who devised an apparatus for the purpose, and
to whom     I  am indebted for advice and suggestions, an attempt was
made to determine the elasticity of the living brain, i.e., of the brain
mnss   with its full complement of circulating blood and lymph, and
further to test the truth of the generally accepted view that the
elasticity of the brain is proportional to the blood pressure.
    The brain was experimented upon in situ, the influence of the
cerebro-spinal fluid being excluded by the mere fact of the skull
being opened and the membranes partially reflected, thus releasing
the fluid from all tension. Thus we arrive at the properties of the
brain mass itself as it rests upon its osseous enclosure.
    There were, in the first place, considered the results of experiments
performed upon freshly-exposed brains, the blood pressure being at
its normal height, in order to arrive at some conclusion as to the
normal elasticity of the brain.          The downward movement of a
plunger was measured after a given interval of time, and the extent
of this is termed the
                              " excursion."    The recovery of the brain
surface, to    the   extent of which the term "recoil" is applied, was
measured until it failed to perceptibly develop further.            The general
character of the excursion is that of a rapid plunge downwards
taking place within the space of one or two seconds, followed by a
much more gradual compression. Its extent varies within a con
siderable range in different animals ; thus a weight of 50 grams
applied for one minute produces an excursion which varies in different
 dogs from 4'5 to 7'3 mm. It also varies notably with the weight em
ployed.     There is no obvious relation between the depth of excursion
and the blood pressure.
    For convenience of expression and of comparison the ratio of the
excursion to the recoil is in the full paper expressed in the form of a
fraction, and this' ratio is termed the " proportionate recoil ; " the
smaller this fraction the feebler the elastic reaction it denotes, and
vice-versa.    A comparison of the ratios derived from experiments per
formed under like conditions upon different animals brings out the
striking approximation which they bear to one another, whatever the
length of the excursion and whatever the existing blood pressure may
be. And such deviations from the average as the ratios present cannot
be found to have any relation to variations in oither excursion or blood

pressure.    A  compression by a 50-gram weight for a period of from
30 seconds to one minute yields an average proportionate recoil of ^.
A further comparison definitely shows that the longer the period of
compression the less is the recoil ; thus with a compression of only
two seconds the reaction is sometimes almost perfect, whereas a
compression lasting six miuutes yields a ratio of l/2'74. Heavier
weights similarly damage the brain in a fashion prejudicial to its
recovery.
   A series of experiments were performed with a view to comparing
the " elasticity " of the brain at the normal blood pressure with the
"            "
  elasticity   of the same brain at an artificially lowered blood pressure.
The first method employed was that of producing a large fall of
blood pressure by bleeding.      The results tended to confirm the im
pression that there exists no constant relation between brain elasticity
and blood pressure. This series is somewhat vitiated by the partial
collapse of the cerebrum which ensues during the process of bleeding,
and a second series was instituted, in which the blood pressure was
lowered through the agency of amyl nitrite; the brain at the moment
of administration becoming flushed with blood, it has no tendency to
collapse. Under the influence of this drug the cerebral vascular con
ditions are such that the " elasticity
                                        " is
                                             actually increased, thus con
clusively demonstrating the non-dependence of the latter upon the
central arterial pressure.
   A further series of experiments were performed in view of the
influence which venous pressure is believed to exert upon the cerebral
circulation.    This object was carried out by exposing the accessible
cranial veins and clamping them in succession, and by measuring the
variation in the intra-cranial pressure induced by this means.         The
results tended to show that the increase of intra-cranial pressure
must be considerable to influence the "elasticity" in even a small
degree.
    Experiments performed upon brains which had undergone pro
longed or severe compression showed that a considerable increase
 of arterial blood pressure is quite unable to restore the volume of the
 brain thus damaged, whereas an increase of venous pressure, obtained
 by asphyxiation, rapidly, and usually completely, brings this about.

                                  (Abstract)
    In consequence of the fact that the     effects prodnced on the circula
tion and respiration by a bullet passing through the cerebral hemi
spheres are but little understood, the authors instituted a series of
pathological experiments on etherised dogs, and of physical experi
ments on various substances.
   The results obtained establish, beyond question, that the primary
c:iuse of death under these circumstances is not, as is usually sup
posed, duo to failure of the heart, but to arrest of the respiratory
movements.     Further, the authors have found, in confirmation of this,
that death can be prevented by tie employment of artificial respira
tion, except under certain circumstances detailed in the paper.
   After describing the changes in the circulation produced, and which
consist of (a) slight initial fall of blood pressure, (6) considerable
later rise of blood pressure, (c) preservation of the rhythm of the
heart, the authors discuss the physical effects of the projectile on the
encephalic contents, and they show, as was originally contended by
Professor    Kocher, that the action of the bullet is essentially a
hydrodynamic one, and that it is the lateral pressures which cause
mechanical lesion of the respiratory centre.
   In this respect the results obtained further support the original
observations of Spencer and Horsley, recently confirmed by Hill, viz.,
that the respiratory centre is the first to be seriously affected by
changes in the intra-cranial tension.
   Finally the authors point out that, supervening on the primary
arrest of respiration, there ensues a gradual rise in the intra-cranial
tension due to the haemorrhage within the skull cavity, and that the
phenomena which then follow are the same as those described in the
above-mentioned paper.

    I have,   in the course of previous researches on blood coagulation,*
had occasion to suggest that the phenomena with which 1 was
dealing might be explained in a very simple manner by assuming                              i
that carbonic acid gas exercised a favourable influence on the oc
currence of blood coagulation.              The present research consists of an
examination of the hypothesis            in  question.
    The method of experimentation employed consisted in determin
ing the alterations of blood coagulability which occurred in animals
when alterations were effected in the respiratory gases with which
they were supplied.
              Details of the Method of Experimentation employed.
    The animals experimented upon were dogs and rabbits. The
animals were in all cases tracheotomised under the influence of
ether (rabbits) or of * mixture of ether and chloroform (dogs). In
the case of the dogs, the animals were kept under the influence of
the chloroform and ether during the whole course of the experi
ment.       In the case of the rabbits, the repeated inhalations of
carbonic acid and other gaseous mixtures served to keep up the
anaesthesia.       The tracheotomy tubes were connected up with a
T-tube ; one limb of the "T"';uoe was fitted with a Speck's intes
tinal valve (made of rabbit-gut), and allowed of free expiration into
the outer air. The other limb of the "J^abe was connected up at
pleasure with reservoirs (4,000 c.c. capacity) of pure gases or gaseous
mixtures standing over water. The water was carefully kept at the
same level inside and outside of the reservoirs during the whole
course of an experiment.               A convenient check upon this was
afforded by the regular opening and closing of the intestinal valve.
   The blood for the coagulability estimations was obtained from the
ear. In the case of the rabbits, the blood was invariably drawn off
from the central artery of the ear.                  Only rabbits with full ear
arteries were employed in the experiments.
    The blood coagulability determinations were made by the method
of capillary coagulation tubes recently! described by me. The method

differs from the method previously described by Vierordt* in the
following particulars : — 1. A series of capillary tubes, of equal calibre,
is employed instead of the single capillary tube employed by Vierordt.
2. Coagulation         time is determined by blowing down the capillary
tubes, one after another, at regularly increasing intervals until a tube
is found to have become blocked by clot. In Vierordt's method the
occurrence and duration of coagulation is judged of by passing a
chemically cleansed white horse-hair down the capillary tube, and
observing the deposition of coagulum upon its surface.
    In all   cases  I employed    a column of blood of 5 cm.      in length, and
received       it into tubesf     "which  had a diameter       of approximately
0 25   mm.
    The following precautions were observed in order to ensure accu
racy of results : — 1. The coagulation tubes were washed ont before
use    successively with distilled water, absolute alcohol, and ether.
2. They were then warmed in an incubator to a temperature of 37° C.
3. A fresh drop of blood was employed for filling each tube.               4. The
column of blood was aspirated some little distance up the tubes to
prevent desiccation occurring at the orifice.          5. In testing for coagu
lation the blood was blown out on to a piece of white filter paper in
order to ensure the detection of the first traces of clot.
    The gases which were experimented with were the following : —¦
Atmospheric air, oxygen, hydrogen, carbonic acid, and a mixture of
(approximately) 20 per cent, of oxygen with 80 per cent, of carbonic
acid.     I  also examined the effect of clamping the trachea.
                      Effect of an Increase of Carbonic Acid.
    In  order to elicit the effect of an increase of carbonic acid upon
coagulability,      I caused the animals to inspire out of a reservoir con
taining     a  mixture    of 1 part (approximately) of oxygen with 4 parts
of carbonic acid. This mixture of gases presents the obvious ad
vantage of supplying carbonic acid in association with the normal
quantum of oxygen.             Determinations of blood coagulability were
made when the animals were breathing this mixture of gases, and
the results were compared with the " coagulation times " which were
elicited immediately before when the animals were breathing atmo
spheric air.        Thirty experiments were made. Out of these twenty-
seven showed a marked increase^ of coagulability while the animal
vras breathing the mixture of carbonic acid and oxygen.                In two ex
periments coagulation time was unaltered, and only in one experi
ment was a slight diminution of coagulability observed.

    In the three experiments last mentioned the coagulability of the
 blood was already at a maximum when the animal was breathing
 atmospheric air.
    It is to be noted that the blood which was drawn off while the
 animal was breathing the carbonic acid and oxygen was arterial in
 colour in all the experiments which have been summarised above.
 The increase of coagulability must therefore be ascribed to the in
crease of carbonic acid in the blood, and not to any defect of oxy
genation.
   It    has thus    been demonstrated         that the increase of carbonic acid
in the blood does exert a favourable influence on coagulation.*                        Car
bonic acid is therefore in all probability           what   I assumedf     it  to  be, i.e.,
a vera causa in the determination of intravascular                     coagulation to
particular vascular areas.
                    Effect of a Diminution of Carbonic Acid.
   This question was studied by examining the condition of coagu
lability in animals when an atmosphere rich in carbonic acid was
replaced by (o) ordinary air, or (6) by oxygen.

 replaced by ordinary air.
                                — -The resultf of such a replacement of carb
onic acid and oxygen by atmospheric               air is a decrease of coagulability
to the    original   norm.
   6. Results of experiments in which an atmosphere of carbonic acid
and oxygen is replaced by an atmosphere of unmixed oxygen. — The sub
stitution of unmixed oxygen for the mixture of carbonic acid and
oxygen is invariably followed by a decrease of coagulability.                           The
diminution may be due to a specific effect of an atmosphere of un
mixed oxygen.           On the other hand it may with much greater prob
ability be referred to the diminution of carbonic acid in the blood,
for the rate of respiration is always extraordinarily accelerated (to
160 respirations        per minute and upwards) by the inspiration of
oxygen.        This view is also suggested by the analogy of the experi
ments in which air is substituted for the carbonic acid mixture.                           It
is further supported by the fact that the diminution of coagulability
is apparently proportionate to the amount of carbonic acid which is
present in the blood.           The diminution is, for instance, well marked
   *  I have  found this statement to hold true also in the   case of human blood.       The
inhalation of an atmosphere which is rich in COj causes an increased coagulability
in my own blood.      I  have obtained a similar increase of coagulability (associated
with an arrest of hemorrhage) in a case of severe bleeding in hemophilia.             I have
also obtained    an Increased  coagulability   by inhalation of COa in the case of three
 members    of another hemophiliac family. — 21/2/94.

when the blood is rich in carbonic acid {e.g., in protocols of rabbits
lo5, 163 and 135), while there is practically no diminution of coagul
ability when the blood has been adequately ventilated by respiration
in ordinary air (vide second oxygen inhalation in protocol of rabbit
155).
   It   evidently results from both these series of experiments that the
diminution of carbonic acid in the blood which was assumed by me
to afford a clue to the diminished coagulability of peptone* and of
blood which has circulated through the lungs and heart alone is in
reality capable of exercising a well marked retarding influence npon
coagulation.
                       Effect of a Diminution of Oxygen.
   It   is extremely difficult to determine with precision what effect the
withdrawal of oxygen exercises upon the coagulability of the blood.
The difficulty consists in the complication of the phenomena which
are due to the withdrawal of oxygen by other phenomena which are
due to an increase of carbonic acid in the blood. To elucidate the
matter, we evidently require methods which allow of at least a partial
dissociation of the effects of the two gases.                 Such methods should
aim at (a) a limitation of the amount of carbonic acid produced
in the system after the oxygen is withdrawn; (6) the elimination
of the carbonic acid which is produced ; (c) a minimising of the
effect of the carbonic acid increase.             These objects can be partially
realised by     the two  following   methods      : —
    1. Inhalation of an atmosphere of indifferent gas (e.g., hydrogen)
while provision is made for free expiration into the external air.
    This method provides to some extent for the elimination of the
carbonic acid which is produced after the withdrawal of the oxygen.
 On the other hand, the method does not provide against the accumula
tion of carbonic acid which must occur during the dyspnceic stand
still of respiration.
   2.    Substitution of an atmosphere of unmixed carbonic acid for an
atmosphere of carbonic acid and oxygen.
   This method presents two advantages : (a) it limits the production
of carbonic acid in the system, inasmuch as the withdrawal of
oxygen, when made under these particular circumstances, no longer
evokes any dyspnceic spasms ; (6) it minimises the effect of any im
creased carbonic acid tension inasmuch as such increase takes place
in a blood which is already almost saturated with carbonic acid.

1. Results of Experiments          in which Oxygen was withdrawn by the Sub
                    stitution of Hydrogen for Atmospheric Air.
    I have   employed this method in 29 experiments. In 15 of these
experiments a diminution of coagulability was observed to result
from the inhalation of hydrogen.                In 14 other experiments an in-
crease of coagulability was noted.                   With respect to the latter
results, the following points are to be noted : — (a) The increase of
coagulability was invariably confined within very moderate limits ;*
(b) in 2f out of the 14 experiments expiration was found to have
been obstructed by an accidental compression of the tracheal tube.
    The results of these experiments are patently ambignous.                 On the
one hand we have a bare majority of experiments or (if we subtract
the experiments in which expiration was accidentally obstructed) a
majority of only 15 to 12 experiments in favour of the result that
the inspiration of hydrogen conditions a diminution, and not an
increase, of blood coagulability.            On the other hand, it is evident that
there is nothing in these experiments when taken by themselves to
justify a conclusion as to whether it is the decrease or the increase of
coagulability which is to be regarded as the effect of the withdrawal
of the oxygen. In such a case the only available method of interpre
tation consists in subducting from the aggregate of the observed
phenomena such phenomena as we know by previous inductions to
be the result of disturbing factors which cannot be eliminated from
the experiments.           The accumulation of carbonic acid in the blood,
which occurs when the inevitable dyspnoeic standstill of respiration
 takes place, or when (as in rabbit 176 and dog 4) expiration is acci
 dentally obstructed, is just such a disturbing factor, and the effects of
this disturbing factor must, in accordance with our previous induc
tions, manifest themselves in an increased blood coagulability.                   We
may, therefore, legitimately assign to this cause all the phenomena of
increased blood coagulability which came under observation in the
hydrogen experiments.             The residue of the observed phenomena, in
 other words the diminution of blond coagulability, then emerges as
 the effect of the absence of oxygen from the inspired air.
     If the above train of argument is valid, we must conclude that the
 diminution of the oxygen of the blood conditions a diminution of
 coagulability.

 2.    Results of Experiments in which Oxygen was withdrawn by a Substi
        tution of Unmixed Carbonic Acid for a Mixture of Carbonic Acid
       and Oxygen.
    This substitution of carbonic acid for the mixture of carbonic acid
 and oxygen tends to effectuate itself spontaneously by the slowing
 down and ultimate standstill of respiratory movements which super
 vene when an animal is continuously supplied with an atmosphere
 surcharged with carbonic acid. A defect of oxygenation was allowed
 to supervene in this manner in five* experiments.    In all these cases
a diminution of coagulability was observed.
    Similar experiments were performed by the actual substitution of
unmixed carbonic acid for an atmosphere of carbonic acid and
oxygen. In the fourf experiments which were performed a diminu
tion of coagulability was invariably observed.
    The diminution of coagulability which is observed by either
variant of this method may be interpreted either (a) as an effect of
an excess of carbonic acid in the blood, or (6) as an effect of the
withdrawal of oxygen.       Against the former interpretation of the
facts the following considerations may be urged : (1) the tension of
carbonic acid in the blood must already have been very high when
the substitution of gases was effected ; (2) with the then obtaining
very slow respiratory movements the respiratory interchange in the
lungs must have been at a minimum.         It therefore, unlikely that
                                                               is,
any appreciable increase of carbonic acid tension can have effectuated
itself in the blood in the interval during which the lungs were filled
with unmixed carbonic acid.
   If this reasoning valid, we must evidently interpret the diminu
                           is
tion of coagulability which came under observation in all these
experiments as a direct result of the withdrawal of the oxygen.
   It need hardly be pointed out that this interpretation would
harmonise with the interpretation which has just been placed upon
the hydrogen experiments.

      It
      may be premised that we have here, as in the case of the
hydrogen experiments, to disentangle the effects of a duplicated
series of phenomena, (a) the giving off of any excess of carbonic acid
which has accumulated in the blood, and (6) the restoration of
oxygen to the blood. The effect of (a) would, in accordance with
our previous]; experiment", be a diminution of coagulability.  On the

other hand, if the interpretation which we have placed npon the
results of our experiments on the effect of a diminution of oxygen is
correct, we should expect an increase of coagulability to accompany
the restoration of oxygen to the blood.
    The following is a summary of the results of the experiments which
were directed to the determination of this point.
    In a total of fourteen experiments, restoration of atmospheric air
was in ten instances* found to result in an increase of coagulability.
In the four remaining instances a decrease of coagulability was
noted.        It is, however, significant that in two of these instances the
diminution of coagulability which was observed lay well within the
limits of error of the method of determination, while in the remaining
two instancesf the diminution of coagulability was only a rebound
from a condition of increased blood coagulability which was brought
about by an accidental obstruction to the expiration of carbonic acid.
    We may, therefore, conclude that the restoration of oxygen to
anoxyhcemic blood conditions an increase of coagulability.
  Comparison of the Results obtained                above   with the Results obtained by
                                        other Observers.
    In    recent times the question of the influence exerted by the blood
gases on coagulation                 has been investigated            among others by
Vierordt.J         Hasebroek,§        and      Bonne,  ||  and   also  by Mathieu and
 Urbain.^f         The two first of these observers employed Vierordt's
 method of coagulability determinations, and both observers per
 formed their experiments chiefly upon themselves.                       In none of their
 experiments does any attempt appear to have been made to dissociate
the effect of changes in the quantity of carbonic acid in the blood from
the effect of simultaneous changes in the quantity of oxygen in the
blood.        On the contrary, the phenomena which came under observa
 tion appear to have been referred to either one or other of these causes
 according to the particular bias of either observer.                      Thus Vierordt
 ascribes the increased coagulability which he detected in the stagnat
 ing blood of his ligatured finger to an increase in the CO, tension. On
 the other hand, Hasebroek, who reinvestigated this point, interprets
 the increased coagulability which is observed after a brief applica
 tion of a ligature to the finger as an effect of a diminution of oxygen
    * Examples of       such increase of coagulability are given on protocols of rabbit 175,

in the blood, while he ascribed the diminished       coagulability which is
observed after a lengthened application of       the ligature to an excess
of the carbonic acid.       In like manner this   observer ascribes (a) the
increased coagulability which he obtained        after holding his breath
for twenty seconds to an increase of CO, in      his blood, (b) the dimin
ished coagulability he obtained after holding his breath for forty-
five seconds to an excess of carbonic acid, (c) the diminished co
agulability of venous, as compared with arterial, blood to the same
cause, and (<f) the diminished coagulability of his blood after rapid
respiration to an excess of oxygen. There is nothing in the experi
ments to justify any of these inferences.
    Exactly the same objections can be urged against Bonne's experi
 ments.     It will suffice to point out that Bonne obtained a diminution
 of coagulability in a bare majority of experiments in pigeons in
 which asphyxia was produced by the inspiration of carbonic acid, and
 that he interprets this diminution of coagulability as an effect of
 the excess of carbonic acid tension, while the anoxyhaemia to which
 the animals succumbed is entirely left out of sight as a possible
 factor in the causation.
    Lastly, the work of Mathieu and TJrbain comes up for notice.
 These observers conjointly investigated the effect of carbonic acid
 upon blood coagulability, and came to the conclusion that carbonic
 acid was a very important, if not indeed the all-important, agent in
 the production of blood coagulation.          This conclusion was based
 upon the following observations : (a) Blood coagulation is accom
 panied by a giving off of something like 50 per cent, of the carbonic
 acid originally present in the blood ; (6) an artificial increase cf the
 body temperature goes hand in hand with a diminution of the carb
 onic acid and with an increase in the oxygen in the blood, and this
 artificial increase of the body temperature results in a diminished co
 agulability ; (c) the blood from the renal vein, which resembles in its
 gaseous composition the blood of the superheated organism, is chai-ac-
 terised by a similar diminished coagulability; (d) an artificial reduc
 tion of the body temperature goes hand in hand with an increase
 of carbonic acid, which is quantitatively comparable to the increase
 which is produced by asphyxiating an animal by C02. This increase
 of carbonic acid in the blood under the influence of cold goes hand in
 hand with an increased blood coagulability ; (e) when blood is pre
 vented from clotting by the addition of a few drops of ammonia (the
 ammonia is assumed to retard coasulation by binding the free carb
 onic acid), and when a new formation of carbonic acid is prevented
 by eliminating the oxygen from the blood by a stream of CO, the
 blood is found to have lost its spontaneous coagulability.       Such blood
 becomes coagulable when a stream of CO» is passed through it ;
  (f) strong solutions of neutral salts have a large absorbing power for

 1894.]    Oxygen upon the Coagulability     of the  Blood in Vivo.    287
free carbonic acid. The power which these solutions have of in
hibiting blood coagulation is inferred to be associated with this
property ; (gr) thrombosis of the pulmonary vessels occurs in does
when they are caused to breathe atmospheric air in which the whole
nitrogen has been replaced by COa; (K) after burns, the venous blood
is found to contain a great excess of carbonic acid. The coagulability
of such blood is abnormally high.
   It will   be observed that the experiments       which have been the
subject-matter of the present communication entirely confirm the
conclusions which had already been arrived at by entirely different
methods by Mathieu and Urbain.            I have not in any systematic
manner controlled the observations upon which the conclusions of
these observers were based.      I  have, however, had many incidental
opportunities of confirming their observations with respect to the
alterations of blood coagulability which are conditioned by raising
or cooling the general body temperature.           On the other hand,    I
have not, in the very few cases        I have examined for it, observed
the occurrence of pulmonary thrombosis as an effect of a simple
rise of carbonic acid tension in the blood, bnt            I have, in one
striking experiment, seen a     rabbit    whose  blood   coagulability had
been increased by the administration of calcium chloride die in
stantaneously from universal intravascular coagulation, when it was
supplied with an atmosphere which was surcharged with carbonic acid.
                      Appendix.    Selected Protocols.
   The appended protocols are to be read from left to right, and then
back in a zig-zag manner, following the dotted lines from right to
left. In accordance with the fact that the method of coagulability
determinations which was employed is an approximal and not an
absolute one, two data are given for each coagulability determination.
These data (longest interval during which the blood was observed to
remain in a tube nnclotted, and shortest interval which the blood was
found to require for complete occlusion of a tube) are entered in sepa
rate columns. Where only a single entry appears on the protocols this
is indicative of a lacuna in the observations. Thus, when an entry
appears in the first column only (as, for instance, in the case of the
second coagulability determination on the last protocol on the list), it
is to be understood that the last of the coagulation tubes which were
appropriated to the particular coagulability determination was found
liquid when tested after the interval noted in the protocol. Simi
larly, when an entry appears in the second column only, as, for
instance, in the second determination on the first protocol on the list,
it is to be understood that all the tubes were found completely
clotted, although the testing of the tubes was not deferred beyond
the fifty seconds noted on the protocol.

 1894.]        disappearance of Leucocytes from the Blood.             295
IX. " On      the Disappearance of the Leucocytes from the Blood,
        after Injection of Peptone."       By Surgeon-Captain David
        Bruce, A.M.S., Army Medical School, Netley. Commu
        nicated by Professor Horsley, F.R.S. Received February
        21, 1894.
     As is well known, the injection of   a solution  of peptone into the
 circulation of certain animals is followed immediately by a very con
 siderable diminution in the number of white blood corpuscles in the
 circulating blood. Some investigators who have written on this sub
ject ascribe this diminution to the destruction and breaking down of
 the leucocytes in the blood plasma.
     As this theory appeared to me to rest on the very slenderest
 evidence, and as    it seemed to me much more natural to believe that a
 temporary withdrawal of the leucocytes into the internal organs took
 place,   I was led to attempt the enumeration of the white blood cor
 puscles in sections of the various organs before and after the injection
 of peptone.
     If the theory of destruction is true, then the leucocytes ought to
 be found in fewer numbers in the organs as well as in the blood,
 ¦whereas, if the theory of temporary withdrawal be the true one, then
 an augmentation in their number should be seen in the sections.
     For the purpose of this enumeration   I used rabbits of equal weight,
  and proved to have a normal number of white blood corpuscles by
  examination of samples of blood taken from the ear.
     Six rabbits were taken. The organs of two of these were examined
 without previous injection of peptone. The third, with a normal
 number of white blood corpuscles, was killed 3£ hours after the injec
 tion of the peptone solution, when f-ths of the white blood corpuscles
  had disappeared from the circulating blood.
     The fourth, also having a normal number of white blood corpuscles,
  was killed 5 seconds after injection, when almost all the leucocytes
  had disappeared, at least from the blood of the heart.
      In the fifth and sixth a leucocytosis was first caused by the injec
  tion of appropriate fluids and the animals killed 5 seconds after the
  injection of peptone.
      As it seemed to me impossible to be certain    of recognising all the
  varieties of the leucocytes in sections of the organs,       I  restricted
  myself to enumerating what      I know as the polynuclear variety, since
  this is the variety which disappears most completely from the blood
   after the injection of peptone and many other substances, and which
   can be very readily recognised in sections after appropriate stain
   ing.
                                                                 x 3

296       Surgeon-Captain D. Bruce.        Disappearance    of   [Mar.  15,
    I may mention here that for practical purposes and without pre
                           I
judice as to their origin, adopt the classification of the leucocytes of
the rabbit's blood into four varieties : —
    A. The Eosinophilous, constituting on an average 2 per cent, of the
 total leucocytes, with an irregular-shaped nucleus and large oval
 shaped granules, which stain readily in eosine.
    B. The Polynuclear, 51 per cent., with intensely staining poly
morphous nucleus, having the appearance of several nuclei united by
narrow thread-like processes, the protoplasm of the cell containing
fine granules which also stain in eosine.
    C. The Myelocytes, 16 per cent.      Difficult in every case to rigidly
separate from the fourth variety, but defined as mononuclear cells,
the nucleus of which stains badly, and is surrounded by compara
tively a large amount of non-granular protoplasm.
    D. The Lymphocytes, 31 per cent.       Mononuclear cells, little larger
than a red blood corpuscle, with intensely staining nucleus and narrow
rim of protoplasm.
    The preliminary enumeration of the leucocytes in the blood of       the
ear or heart was made by diluting the blood 200 times with an 8         per
cent, magnesium sulphate solution, to which sufficient gentian violet
had been added to stain the white blood corpuscles, and not by
estimating their proportion to the red blood corpuscles, which seems
to me a most unsound method. The number of white blood cor
puscles in 300 squares of a Gower's hsamocytometer             were then
counted and this number multiplied by 333, which gives approxi
mately the number in a cubic millimetre.
    Three samples of blood are taken, two of which are counted, and,
if the counts are sufficiently close, an average made. In the event of
there being a marked discrepancy, the third sample is counted and an
average of the two most alike taken, but, with care, it is seldom found
 necessary to use the third sample.
    In regard to the fixing and hardening of the tissues for cutting,
 alcohol, Muller's solution, Foa's, and Flemming's solutions were used,
 but the best results were obtained by fixing for twenty-four hours in
 Flemming's strong solution, washing in running water for twenty-
four hours, then through successive alcohols for forty-eight hours.
    The tissues, after infiltration with paraffin, were cut as neatly as
 possible of the same thickness, and stained in various ways, the most
 successful results being got by staining for twenty-four hours in the
 Ehrlich-Biondi triple stain.
    On taking the sections out of the stain     I  place them for a minute
 in a saturated solution of corrosive sublimate, as this seems in some
 way to prevent them becoming too much decolorised during the sub
 sequent manipulations.
    The white blood corpuscles contained in twenty fields of the micro

 1894.]      Leucocytes from the Blood after Injection   of Peptone.   297
scope      (Zeiss' 2 millimetres apochromatic, oil immersion, and 8
eye-piece) were counted in each section, several of which were
monnted from each organ, and, as will be seen, with very striking
uniformity of results.
     I  shall now proceed to describe the results obtained in each experi
ment.
     No. 1. Control Experiment. — Babbit, weight 2 kilos.        The blood
from an ear-vein was found to contain 6500 leucocytes per cubic
millimetre — 0 per cent, eosinophilons, 34 per cent, polynuclear, 20 per
cent, myelocytes, 46 per cent, lymphocytes     — of which   2210 were thus
polynuclear.       The animal was now killed by a blow on the head and
the organs at once removed. Four sections of the spleen were found
to contain 54, 47, 55, and 54 polynuclear leucocytes respectively
 (twenty fields of the microscope being counted in each specimen), the
lung, 39 and 32, and the liver, 7, 6, and 7.
     It will be seen from the above enumerations that a remarkable
 uniformity was found to exist in the distribution of the polynuclear
 leucocytes in different sections of the same organ. This,      I may here
 mention, obtained throughout, not only in the con'rol experiments,
 but also after the injection of peptone.
     No. 2. Control Experiment. — Rabbit, 2 kilos.     Tho blood from an
 ear-vein was found to contain 3833 polynuclear leucocytes in each
 cubic millimetre.      Two sections of the spleen were counted and con
 tained, in 20 fields, 62 and 74 respectively ; the lung, 35 and 41 ;
 liver, 5 and 6.
      No. 3. Control Experiment. — To show that the blood contained iu the
 right and left ventricles does not differ markedly from the blood
  taken from an ear-vein in the number of leucocytes contained in the
 cubic millimetre the following experiment was made :—
      Rabbit, 2 kilos. The blood from an ear-vein was found to contain
  8500 leucocytes in each cubic millimetre.       After an hour the rabbit
  was killed by a blow on the head, and the heart ligatured and re
  moved as soon after death as possible.
      The blood of the right ventricle was found to contain 7200 leuco
  cytes per cubic millimetre ; that of the left, 7500.
       The following experiment shows the number of polynuclear leuco
  cytes found in sections of the organs of an ordinary normal rabbit
   after the leucocytes have been greatly diminished in tho circulating
  Wood by the injection of peptone.
      No. 4. Rabbit, 2 kilos.    Blood from the right ear contained 4015
   polynuclear leucocytes. Three and a half hours after the injection
   into a vein of the left ear of 3"5 grams peptone, dissolved in 35 c.c.
   water, blood from the right ear only contained 1100 of the same
   variety.
       Sections of the spleen prepared and examined in the same way as

298        Surgeon-Captain      D. Brace.     Disappearance  of [Mar.     15,
in Experiments 1 and 2, contained 159, 150,171, and 168 polynuclear
leucocytes in 20 fields of the fonr specimens examined ; the lung,
230 and 209     ; the liver, 38 and 35 respectively.
    This experiment then shows a large increase in the number of the
polynuclear leucocytes in the organs, as compared with what was
found in the organs of the control animals.
    But, as the injection of peptone causes not only a primary diminu
tion but also a secondary augmentation in the number of leucocytes
in the blood, it might be argued that this augmentation takes place at
first in the organs, and that this might account for the increase found
in Experiment No. 4.
    To meet this objection the following experiment was made : —
    No. 5. Rabbit, 2 kilos. Blood from ear contained 9200 leucocytes,
of which 47 per cent, or 4424, belonged to the polynuclear variety ;
 20 c.c. of a 10 per cent, peptone solution were now rapidly injected
 into the left jugular vein, and the animal killed five seconds after the
injection.
    The blood contained in the heart was at once examined, that in the
 left ventricle being found not to contain a single leucocyte of any
 kind whatever ; that of the right only 166 per cubic millimetre, all
 told. It must be noted, however, that the leucocytes do not disappear
 from all parts of the circulation with this marvellous rapidity, as
 Experiment No. 7 will show.
    The organs in this case were also found to contain a great excess
 of polynuclear leucocytes : the spleen, 174, 133, and 149 ; the lung,
 230 and 221 ; the liver, 12 and 14.
    I  next tried the effect of first causing a leucocytosis, and then
 driving the white blood corpuscles out of the blood by peptone, in the
 belief that some proportionate increase in the number of the poly
 nuclear "leucocytes in the organs might be found.
    No. G. Rabbit, weight 2 kilos.       Blood from ear contained 7800 leu
  cocytes, of which 4290 belonged to the polynuclear variety.
     Nineteen hours after the injection of 10 c.c. of a broth cultivation
  of anthrax, which had been sterilised by filtration through a Chamber-
  land filter, the number of leucocytes in the blood taken from the ear
  had increased to 17,600, of which 11,264 were polynuclear.           20 c.c.
  of a 10 per   cent, peptone   solution were  now injected into the jugular
  vein, and, five seconds afterwards, the animal killed. Blood from
  the left ventricle      contained no leucocytes ; that from the right
  ventricle only 1500 per cubic millimetre.
     The spleen sections contained 223 and 218, the lung 251 and 247,
  the liver 12 and 10.
     Experiment 7. Rabbit, 2 kilos.         The blood taken from an ear-
  vein contained 14,300 white-blood corpuscles.
     20 c.c. of a 10 per cent, peptone solution were injected into an

1894.]      Leucocytes                  from               the   Blood after Injection of Peptone.                                                                                                 299
ear-vein, and, five seconds afterwards, the white-blood corpuscles in
the opposite ear enumerated, when no diminution in their number
was found.    Eighteen hours after the injection an intense leucocy
tosis was found to have become developed, no fewer than 184,500
white blood corpuscles being found in each cubic millimetre of blood
drawn from the ear.
   Again, 20 c.c. of a 10 per cent, peptone solution were injected; this
time by the left jugular vein, and, five seconds afterwards, the animal
killed.   The blood in the left ventricle contained 1000 white blood
corpuscles per cubic millimetre, the right ventricle 3000, and the
inferior vena cava in the lumbar region 5000.
   Sections of the spleen contained 262 and 308, the lung 435, 325,
and 348, and the liver 78 and 82.
   Presenting, for the sake of clearness, the above facts in a tabular
form, an average of the various numbers being set down, the contrast
is   striking.

     From, the above table                        it         is   seen that the                                          lung harbours a greater
proportion of the leucocytes which have disappeared from the blood
than any other organ. This may be accounted for            the fact that                                                                                 by
this organ     the first acted on by the peptone solution after its injec
                 is
tion into the jugular vein.
   Other organs, snch as the kidney, supra-renals, and ovary, were
found to contain so few leucocytes, either before or after the injection
of peptone, that the results as regards them have been neglected.
 I   conclude from the above experiments that the injection of a solu
tion of peptone into the circulation of rabbits does not cause, as has
been asserted,    destruction of leucocytes, but merely a withdrawal of
                      a
them into various organs, notably the lungs and spleen.

   On February 9 the Kew Committee became registered under the
Companies Acts, 1862 and 1867, as the

mittee of the Royal Society."
   The Memorandum and Articles of Association are given in Ap
pendix A.
   It is . with deep regret that the Committee have to report the
decease of the late Superintendent of the Observatory, Mr. G. M.
Whipple, B.Sc, which occurred on the 8th of February, after a
serious illness of more than seven months.           He had been connected
with the Observatory in various capacities for thirty-four years, and
had filled the office of Superintendent since 1876.       Under his efficient
management the work at         the  Observatory      had  been largely aug
mented in amount and variety, and the fnnds at its disposal for
purchase of apparatus and extension of its premises had steadily
increased.     Mr. Whipple was the author of numerous papers on
Meteorological and other subjects connected with the work of the
Observatory, which appeared in the

308                   Report of the Kew Committee.
   During the year there also occurred the death of Mr. H. McLaugh
lin, Librarian and Accountant, whose connexion with the Observatory
had extended over twenty years.
   The Committee having invited applications for the vacant post of
Superintendent, selected from amongst the candidates Mr. Charles
Chree, M.A., Fellow of King's College, Cambridge, Sixth Wrangler
1883, First Division Part     III  of the Mathematical Tripos, and First
Class in Part     II of the Natural Sciences Tripos, 1884. Mr. Chree
entered on his duties on May 15.
   During the earlier part of the year the work of the Observatory
was carried out by Mr. Baker, the Chief Assistant, to the entire
satisfaction of the Committee.        They desire that his services should
be specially recorded, and they are glad to state that the rontine
work of the Observatory has in no way suffered owing to the en
forced absence of the Superintendent for the early months of the past
year.
   The work at the Observatory may be considered under the fol
lowing heads: —
   1st.  Magnetic observations.
   2nd.   Meteorological observations.
   3rd.   Solar observations.
   4th.  Experimental, in connexion with any of the above departments.
   5th.  Verification of instruments.
   6th.  Rating of Watches and Marine Chronometers.
   7th.  Miscellaneous.
                        I.  Magnetic   Observations.
   The magnetographs have been in constant operation throughout
the year, and the scale values of all the instruments were determined
in January.
   The ordinates of the various photographic curves were then found
to be as follows :—
           Declinometer   : 1

   The distance between the dots of light -upon the Vertical Force
cylinder having become too small for satisfactory registration, the
position of the zero dot was altered on January 23.
   The toothed wheel of the Declination cylinder being much worn,

                       Report of the Kew Committee.                    309
 a new one     was    obtained  from Adie,   London,    and fitted  to the
cylinder on   July  5.
    On  August 10 the clock was dismounted and cleaned
    As regards Magnetic    Disturbances, no very large movements have
been registered during the year.      The principal oscillations that were
recorded took place on the following days : —
    February 4—5, March 14—15, April 26, June 18—19, July 16,
August 6 — 7 and 18, November 1 — 2.
    The hourly means and diurnal range of the magnetic elements for
 1893, for the quiet days selected by the Astronomer         Royal, will be
found   in Appendix I.
    The following are the mean results for the entire year    : —
      Mean   Westerly Declination               17° 28' 8
      Mean   Horizontal Force                   0-18238  C.G.S. units.
       Mean  Inclination                        67° 26'-3
       Mean  Vertical Force                     0-43896  C.G.S. units.
    The observations of Horizontal Force, Inclination, and Declination
with the absolute instruments have been made in accordance with the
usual practice.
    Captain Schiick visited the Observatory in July, and made a series
of absolute magnetic observations in order to compare his own in
struments with those of Kew, prior to his continuing his magnetic
survey on the banks of the Elbe.
    The temperature coefficients of the magnets employed by Captain
Schiick were determined at Kew.
    The magnetic instruments have been studied and a knowledge of
their manipnlation obtained by Lieutenants Parry and Tancred, of
the Royal Navy, who visited the Observatory          from December 4 to
December 20.
                     II. Meteorological  Observations.
    The several self-recording instruments for the continuous registra
tion respectively of Atmospheric Pressure, Temperature of Air and
Wet-bulb, Wind (direction and velocity), Bright Sunshine, and Rain,
have been maintained in regular operation throughout the year, and
the standard eye observations for the control of the automatic records
 duly registered.
    The tabulations of the meteorological traces have been regularly
 made, and these, as well as copies of the eye observations, with
 notes of weather, cloud, and sunshine, have been transmitted, as usual,
  to the Meteorological Office.

  3D                  Report of the Keto Committee.
    A summary of the results for the year is given in Appendix II,
  Tables I, II, and III.
    With the sanction of the Meteorological Council, data have been
 supplied to the Council of the Royal Meteorological Society, the
  Institute of Mining Engineers, the editor of ' Symons's Monthly
 Meteorological Magazine,' Dr. Rowland, and others.
    Detailed information of thunderstorms observed in the neighbour
 hood during the year has been forwarded to the Royal Meteorological
  Society.
                          " worm " on the direction fan-spindle had
    Anemograp h. —The
 become very thin through wear, causing considerable
                                                            " back-lash ; "
 a new one has been put in hand by Munro, and will be fitted up at
 an early date.
    The new square-headed pricker, mentioned in the last Report, has
 been rather unsatisfactory in its action, and will be shortly replaced
 by a round one, made of specially hardened steel.
    Bain-gauge. — The Willesden prepared papers have been in daily use
 on tbe self-recording    Beckley gauge, and although the curves ob
 tained are clear and distinct, yet the defect of the lengthening of the
 sheets in wet weather has not been entirely overcome.
    Circular letters were sent to several prominent paper makers
 asking for samples of material, specially prepared, to be used in a
 very damp atmosphere ; bat of those thus obtained, only one sample
 (supplied by Messrs. Waterlow and Sons) showed no appreciable
 lengthening in the dampest atmosphere producible artificially.          It
 has, however, some counterbalancing        defects, which render its
 superiority  to the Willesden  paper for the purpose in view somewhat
donbtful.
    Barograph. — At the request of the Meteorological Office an investi
 gation has been carried out as to the causes of fluctuations that
present themselves in the value of the residual correction to the
barograph readings, which is deduced by comparison of simultaneous
readings of the barograph and a standard barometer.
    An analysis was made of the value of the residual correction be
tween May, 1892, and October, 1893, while numerous measurements
 were taken of the width of the temperature compensation to the
 barogram at different temperatures.      The data obtained accounted
for a very considerable part, at least, of the irregularities observed iu
the residual correction.
    A report embodying an analysis of the results has been sent to tbe
Meteorological Office.
    Electrograph. — This instrument has been in regular action during
the year, but its performance on the whole has been rather unsatis
factory.    Early in the year the needle-suspension being accidentally
broken, another was fitted without delay, and a new determination

                       Report of the Kew Committee.                   •Ml
 made of the scale value.      Subsequent re-determinations were carried
 out in May, July, and November.
    It is intended to take advantage of the first spell of frosty weather
 to dismount and thoroughly overhaul the instrument, and to open
 out the scale, which has for some time past been too contracted.
    Inspections. — In compliance with the request of the Meteorological
 Council, Mr. Baker visited and inspected the Observatories at Stony-
 hurst, Glasgow, Fort William, and Aberdeen, and the Anemograph
 Stations at Yarmouth, North Shields, Alnwick Castlo, Deerness
 (Orkney), Fleetwood, and Holyhead ; while Mr. Constable inspected
 the Observatories at Oxford and Falmouth
                          III. Solar Observations. ....
    Sun-spots. — Sketches of Sun-spots have been made on 155 days, and
the groups numbered, after Schwabe's method.
    Particulars will be found in Appendix II, Table IV.
    The marked exhibition of solar activity noted in last report has
continued, and although no phenomenally large group of Sun-spots
has appeared, yet no one observation has been recorded in which the
Sun's surface was entirely free from spots.
   Time Signals. — These have been regularly received from Greenwich
through the G.P.O., with the exception of a few dayB, on which
occasions supplementary signals were transmitted at later hours.
                         IV. Experimental Work.
   Richard's Anemo-cinemograph. — This instrument, which has been
at the Observatory since May, 1891, was at the end of the year re
turned to Mr. Casella, by request of the makers.
   Cloud Photographs. — Operations connected with cloud photography
have been suspended during the past year.
   Fog and Mist. — The observation of a series of distant objects
referred to in the last report has been continued.       A note is taken
of the most distant of the selected objects which is visible at each
observation hour. An analysis of the results for the period May,
1892, to December, 1893, is' at present being carried out.
   During the thickest fog experienced in the past year, at one of the
hours of observation the most distant object visible was only 12 feet
off.

                       Report of the Kew Committee.                  313
    3 Standard Thermometers have been supplied during the year.
   There were at the end of the year in the Observatory undergoing
verification, 6 Barometers, 571 Thermometers, 18 Sextants, 45 Tele
scopes, and a Snnshine Recorder.
               VI.  Rating of Watches and Chronometers.
    A  large increase has taken place in the number of watches sent for
trial daring the year, 1,521 having been received, as compared with
1,044 during the previous twelve months.
    This increase, however, has been largely in watches entered for the
class B test, and for various reasons a future falling off in the
number of such watches is not unlikely.
    It is a gratifying fact that the number of high-class movements
attaining the distinction especially good has been greater than in any
previous year.
    The watches were entered for trial as below :—
    For class A, 376 ; class B, 885 ; class C, 251 ; and 9 for the subsi
diary trial. Of these 5 passed the subsidiary test, 299 failed from
various causes to gain any certificate ; 238 were awarded class C
certificates, 722 class B, and 257 class A ; of the latter, 34 obtained
the highest form of certificate, class A, especially good.
    In Appendix    III will be found a table giving the results of trial
of the 34 watches which gained the highest number of marks during
the year.     The first place was taken by Messrs. Stauffer, Son, and Co.,
 London, with a keyless, going-barrel, chronometer-watch, No. 147,625,
with the " tourbillon" escapement, which obtained 88-0 marks out of
a maximum of 100.
    The best performance of lever watches during the year was that of
No. 33,884 by Jos. White and Son, Coventry, which gained 84"9
 marks.
    Non-Magnetic Watches. — Twelve watches thus designated have been
 examined during the year, both as to their ordinary time-keeping
 and also as to their non-magnetio properties, and although the trial
 to which they are submitted is severe — the movement being tested in
 an intense magnetic field, both in vertical and horizontal positions,
 and gradually approached to and removed from the poles, whilst
 its behaviour is critically watched — in the majority of cases the
 watches were found to perform very satisfactorily.
    Marine Chronometers. — The Committee having been requested by
 the Naval Attache to the Royal Italian Embassy to undertake trials
 for Marine chronometers on the Greenwich plan, Mr. Constable
 visited the Royal Observatory, Greenwich, by kind permission of the
  Astronomer Royal, and was afforded every facility to make himself

314                  Report of the Kew Committee.
familiar with the system of rating chronometers carried on there for
many years past.
   The Greenwich trial lasts for twenty-nine weeks, the movements
being tried during alternate periods of seven and fonr weeks at the
ordinary temperature of the air, and in a hot room at temperatures of
from about 75° to 100° Fahr. This gives a total of twenty-one weeks
at atmospheric temperatures and eight weeks in the oven.
   The difference, in seconds, between the greatest and least weekly
rates of a chronometer during the trial being denoted by a, and the
greatest difference, in seconds, between the rates of two successive
weeks by b, the smallness of the quantity a + 26 has been adopted at
Greenwich as the measure of the excellence of a chronometer.
   At the request of the Italian Naval Attach^ the test at Kew was
to be directed to ascertain in which of the chronometers sent for trial
the value of a + 2b did not exceed 38.
   It was decided to utilise for the trial the Pendulum Chamber in
the basement and the North room in the new wing.           The former is
constructed of wood, double walled, with a 6-inch air space all round,
and having been originally designed with a view to reduciug tempera
ture variations to a minimum, it was admirably suited for conver
sion into a hot chamber.
   A gas furnace, made of copper to avoid the risk of disturbing the
magnetographs, was specially built by Messrs. Fletcher, Russell, and
Co., of Warrington.     It has given entire satisfaction, being perfectly
under control, so that any desired temperature up to 100° Fahr. can
be reached aud regularly maintained.       By means of two copper flues
the products of combustion are taken into the outer air, and the
atmosphere of the hot chamber is at all times pure and free from
fumes, while the presence of several open vessels of water prevents
undue desiccation.
   The North room referred to above is used for the ordinary tem
perature tests, and in it temperatures as low as 37° Fahr. have been
observed.    In addition to the ordinary maximum and minimum
thermometers a " Richard " thermograph is used, which supplies a
continual record of the temperature.
   Two sets of trials were started during the year : the principal — for
which 30 chronometers were entered — commencing on June 1,
while the subsidiary — for which there were 12 entries — commenced
on November 1.        Of the 30 chronometers sent for the first trial
only 14 attained the limit prescribed by the Italian Government. A
brief summary of their performance will be found in Appendix III,
Table III.
   During the year 10 ohronometers have been received for the
ordinary trials.    Of these 1 obtained the A certificate and 3 B
certificates, while 2 failed to pass and 4 are still under examination.

                      Report of the Kew   Committee.                 315
   A  mean time Astronomical      Regulator has also been rated at tem
 peratures of 40° to 80° Fahr., and a statement of its performance
issued.
                           VII.  Miscellaneous.
   Lens Testing. — During the year 31 lenses have been tested ; of these
13 received class A and 18 class B certificates. ¦ These numbers
though small show a gratifying increase on the two previous years.
    The testing apparatus has been the subject of a good deal of in
terest, several practical opticians of emiuence and others interested
in photography having inspected it and enquired into the details of
the various tests.
   Library. — During the year the library has received as presents the
publications of —
   26 Scientific Societies and Institutions of Great Britain and
        Ireland, and
   108 Foreign and Colonial Scientific Establishments, as well as of
        numerous private individuals.
   During the summer a partition was removed which used to divide
the library into an outer and an inner portion. The conversion into a
single room has greatly improved the appearance of the library, and
has been found advantageous in various other ways.

                  MAGNETioAii Observations,         1893.
Made at the Kew Observatory, Richmond, Lat. 51° 28' 6"
    N. and Long. 0h lm 15''1 W., height 34 feet above mean
    sea-level.
   The results given in the following tables are deduced from the
magnetograph curves which have been standardised by observations
of deflection and vibration.    These were made with the Collimator
Magnet K.C. I. and the Declinometer Magnet marked K.O. 90 in the
9-inch Unifilar Magnetometer by Jones.
   The Inclination was observed with the Inclinometer by Barrow,
No. 33, and needles 1 and 2, which are 3§ inches in length.
  The Declination and Force values given in Tables I to    VIII  are pre
pared in accordance with the suggestions made in the fifth report of
the Committee of the British Association on comparing and reducing
Magnetic Observations.
  The following is a list of the days during the year 1893 which
were selected by the Astronomer Royal, as suitable for the deter
mination of the magnetic diurnal variations, and which have been
employed in the preparation of the magnetic tables : —

                                 April   19, 1894.
     The LORD       KELVIN,      D.C.L., LL.D., President, in the Chair.
   A List    of the Presents received was laid on the table, and thanks
ordered for them.
    Professor Dewar made an oral communication stating that he had
observed that many bodies cooled to between —180° C. and —200° C.
after stimulation by light become remarkably phosphorescent, not
only in increased intensity, bnt in duration, and that liquid oxygen
itself always shows faint but distinct phosphorescence. He stated
that the details of experiments would be shortly communicated to
the Society.
   The following Papers were read         : —
I. "On an Anomaly encountered in Determinations of the
        Density of Nitrogen Gas." By Lord Rayleigh, Sec. R.S.
        Received February 16, 1894.
   1 n a  former communication*         I   have described how nitrogen, pre
pared by Lupton's method, proved to be lighter by about 1/1000 part
than that derived from air in the usual manner. In both cases a red
hot tube containing copper is employed, but with this difference.                   In
the latter method the atmospheric oxygen is removed by oxidation
of the copper itself, while in Lupton's method it combines with the
hydrogen of ammonia, through which the air is caused to pass on its
way to the furnace, the copper remaining unaltered.                    In order to
exaggerate     the  effect, the air  was subsequently replaced by oxygen.
Under these conditions the whole, instead of only about one-seventh
part of the nitrogen is derived from ammonia, and the discrepancy
was found to be exalted to about one-half per cent.
    Upon the assumption that similar gas should be obtained by both
methods, we may explain the discrepancy by supposing either that
 the atmospheric nitrogen was too heavy on account of imperfect re
 moval of oxygen, or that the ammonia nitrogen was too light on
 account of contamination with gases lighter than pure nitrogen.                  In-
   ¦                                               '

   1894.]     Determinations   of the Density of Nitrogen   Gas.       341
  dependency    of the fact that the action of the copper in the first case
  was pushed to great lengths, there are two arguments which appeared
  to exclude the supposition   that oxygen was still present in the pre
  pared gas.    One of these depends upon the large quantity of oxygen
  that would be required in view of the small difference between the
  weights of the two gases.     As much as l/30th part of oxygen would
  be necessary to raise the density by 1/200, or about one sixth of all
  the oxygen originally present.     This seemed to be out of the question.
  But even if so high a degree of imperfection in the action of the
  copper could be admitted, the large alteration caused by the sub
  stitution of oxygen for air in Lnpton's process would remain un
  explained.   Moreover, as has been described in the former paper, the
  introduction of hydrogen into the gas made no difference, such
  hydrogen being removed by the hot oxide of copper subsequently
  rra versed.   It is surely impossible that the supposed residual oxygen
  could have survived such treatment.
     Another argument may be founded upon more recent results,
  presently to be given, from which it appears that almost exactly the
  same density is found when the oxygen of air is removed by hot iron
  reduced with hydrogen, instead of by copper, or in the cold by ferrous
   hydrate.
     But the difficulties in the way of accepting the second alternative
  are hardly less formidable.     For the question at once arises, of what
  gas, lighter than nitrogen, does the contamination consist ?     In order
  that the reader may the better judge, it may be well to specify more
  fully what were the arrangements adopted. The gas, whether air or
  oxygen, after passing through potash was charged with ammonia as
 it traversed a small wash-bottle, and thence proceeded to the furnace.
 The first passage through the furnace was in a tube packed with
 metallic copper, in the form of fine wire. Then followed a wash-bottle
of snlphnric acid by which the greater part of the excess of am
 monia would be arrested, and a second passage through the furnace
 in a tube containing copper oxide. The gas then traversed a long
 length of pumice charged with sulphuric acid, and a small wash-
bottle containing Nessler solution. On the other side of the regulat
ing tap the arrangements were always as formerly described, and
included tubes of finely divided potash and of phosphoric anhydride.
The rate of passage was usually about half a litre per hour.
     Of the possible impurities, lighter than nitrogen, those most de
manding consideration are hydrogen, ammonia, and water vapour.
The last may be dismissed at once, and the absence of ammonia is
almost equally certain. The question of hydrogen appears the most,
important. But this gas, and hydrocarbons, such as CH4, could they
be present, should be burnt by the copper oxide ; and the experiments
already referred to, in which hydrogen was purposely introduced
                                                                2 b 2

342     Lord Rayleigh.       On an Anomaly encountered in        [Apr.  15',
into atmospheric nitrogen, seem to prove conclusively that the
burning would really take place. Some further experiments of the
same kind will presently be given.
    The gas from ammonia and oxygen was sometimes odourless, but
at other times smelt strongly of nitrous fumes, and, after mixture
with moist air, reddened litmus paper. On one occasion the oxidation
of the nitrogen went so far that the gas showed colour in the blow-off
tube of the Toppler, although the thickness of the layer was only
about half an inch. But the presence of nitric oxide is, of course,
no explanation of the abnormal lightness.           The conditions under
which the oxidation takes place proved to be difficult of control, and
it was thought desirable to examine nitrogen derived by redaction
from nitric and nitrous oxides.
    The former source was the first experimented upon. The gas was
evolved from copper and diluted nitric acid in the usual way, and,
after passing through potash, was reduced by iron, copper not being
sufficiently active, at least without a very high temperature.         The
iron was prepared     from  blacksmith's scale.  In  order  to get quit of
carbon, it was first treated with a current of oxygen at a red heat,
and afterwards     reduced by hydrogen, the reduction being repeated
after each employment.       The greater part of the work of reducing the
gas was performed outside the furnace, in a tube heated locally with a
Bunsen flame.      In the passage through the furnace in a tube con
taining    similar  iron the work would be completed, if necessary.
Next followed washing with sulphuric acid (as required in the ammonia
process), a second passage through the furnace over copper oxide, and
further washing with sulphuric acid. In order to obtain an indica
 tion of any unreduced nitric oxide, a wash-bottle containing ferrous
 sulphate was introduced, after which followed the Nessler test and
 drying tubes, as already described. As thus arranged, the apparatus
 could be employed without alteration, whether the nitrogen to be
 collected was derived from air, from ammonia, from nitric oxide,
 from nitrous oxide, or from ammonium nitrite.
    The numbers which follow are the weights of the gas contained by
 the globe at zero, at the pressure defined by the manometer when the
 temperature is 15°.     They are corrected for the errors in the weights,
 but not for the shrinkage of the globe when exhausted, and thus
 correspond to the number 2"31026, as formerly given for nitrogen.

   In the last    case  a large volume of       air was confined for several
hours in a glass reservoir with a mixture of slaked lime and ferrous
sulphate.     The gas was displaced by deoxygenated water, and f nrther
purified by passage through a tube packed with a similar mixture.
The hot tubes were not used.
   If we bring together the means for atmospheric nitrogen obtained
by various methods, the agreement is seen to be good, and may
be regarded as inconsistent with the supposition of residual oxjgen
in quantity sufficient to influence the weights.

   Two of the results relating to hot iron, those of Deceml>er 14 and
December 19, were obtained from nitrogen, into which hydrogen had
been purposely introduced.          An electrolytic generator was inserted
between the two tubes containing hot iron, as formerly described.
The generator worked under its own electromotive force, and the
current was measured by a tangent galvanometer. Thus, on Decem
ber 19, the deflection throughout the time of filling was 3°, repre-
           • The  N.0  was prepared from zinc and very dilute nitric acid.

344        Prof. W. N. Hartley.        On Variations observed     [Apr. 19,
senting about 1/15 ampere.         In two hours and a half the hydrogen
introduced into the gas would be about 70 c.c, sufficient, if retained,
to reduce the weight by about 4 per cent.       The fact that there was no
sensible reduction proves that the hydrogen was effectively removed
by the copper oxide.
    The nitrogen, obtained altogether in four ways from chemical com
pounds, is materially lighter than the above, the difference amounting
to about 11 mg., or about 1/200 part of the whole.         It is also to be
observed that the agreement of individual results is less close in
the case of chemical nitrogen than of atmospheric nitrogen.
    I have made some experiments to try whether the densities were
influenced by exposing the gas to the silent electric discharge.          A
Siemens tube, as used for generating ozone, was inserted in the path
of the gas after desiccation with phosphoric anhydride.         The follow
ing were the results :  —

    The somewhat anomalous result of January 1 is partly explained
 by the failure to obtain a subsequent weighing of the "globe empty,
 and there is no indication that any effect was produced by the electri
 fication.
    One more observation     I will bring forward in conclusion. Nitrogen
 prepared    from   oxygen  and   ammonia, and about one-half per cent,
 lighter than ordinary atmospheric nitrogen, was stored in the globe
 for eight months. The globe was then connected to the apparatus,
 and the pressure was re-adjusted in the usual manner to the standard
 conditions.     On re-weighing no change was observed, so that the
 abnormally light nitrogen did not become dense by keeping.
 II. "   On Variations observed in the Spectra of Carbon Elec
        trodes, and on the Influence of one Substance on the
        Spectrum of another."         By W. N. Hartley, F.R.S., Royal
        College of Science, Dublin. Received January 13, 1894.
     In  a recently  published paper by Eder and Valenta, on the Line
                                                                      "
  Spectrum of Elementary Carbon and the Ultra-violet Spark Spec

  schriften,' vol. 60, 1893), there occurs this passage : —

  1894.]         m the Spectra   of Carbon Electrodes,  $-c.         345
    " It is
             worthy of remark     that Hartley and Adeney, among the
 carbon lines measured by them, included those with wave-lengths
 3881-9, 3870-7, 3589 9, and 3584 8, which, according to the foregoing
 investigation, are described as the edges of cyanogen bands, and must
 be struck out of the list of lines in the spectrum of carbon.   Liveing
 and Dewar, in their previous work on the graphite spark spectrum,
 had not recorded them, but these were first presented as new
 carbon lines by Hartley and Adeney."
   At the time the observations of Mr. Adeney and myself were made
 there was no published description of the ultra-violet spectrum of
 carbon, but before our work received publication, that of Messrs.
 Liveing and Dewar appeared, and to this we referred (' Roy. Soc.
 Proc.,' vol. 34, p. 429). The lines we described we still believe to be
none other than carbon lines, because of the absence of satisfactory
evidence to the contrary.
   Tbe carbon spectrum, as modified by moistening graphite electrodes
and surrounding them with gases other than atmospheric air, was
closely studied by me and the different spectra were mapped (' Phil.
Trans.,' Part I, 1884, p. 49). Not only was the carbon spectrum
studied, but an endeavour was made to obtain the " cyanogen bands
                                                                       "
from saturated solutions of cyanides.       No success attended these
experiments, even when on the one hand a stable cyanide such as the
potassium salt was used, nor when the most easily decomposed salt,
mercuric cyanide, was taken. On this ground there appeared to be
no sufficient reason for attributing the lines 3881-9, 38707, 3589 9,
and 3584-8 to cyanogen rather than to carbon. On the other hand, it
was shown that some of the lines were much strengthened and the
general appearance of the first grou p was altered when concentrated
solutions of zinc and calcium chlorides surrounded the electrodes,
but it was evident that the modification of the spectrum did not
arise from the zinc, calcium, or chlorine, and, therefore, more
probably the carbon lines were modified by the presence of the saline
solutions.
   The stronger the solutions the more pronounced were the modifica
tions in the spectra. Eder and Valenta do not appear to have re
ferred to these facts, and it is quite possible they may have
overlooked pp. 58 and 59 of my paper, where they arc recorded and
discussed.
   I  have recently again examined a large number of photographs of
spectra of saline solutions and several spectra of various flames
taken in the years 1880-81.        The graphite electrodes immersed in
solutions show beautiful groups of lines which coincide with the
edges of certain bands in spectra of the flame of burning cyanogen.
These bands can be recognised in the groups         III   and IV on the
spectra photographed by Kayser and Runge.

346      Prof. W. N. Hartley.      On Variations observed      [Apr. 19,
    The origin of these coincident portions of spectra, namely, from the
 combustion of cyanogen and from carbon electrodes in saline solu
 tions, taken in conjunction with the fact that they are not rendered
 by cyanides, makes it doubtful whether the cyanogen spectrum is
 not due to elementary carbon, as first advocated by Marshall Watts.
 There are other facts and circumstances which somewhat support
this doubt. First, variations have been observed in the spectrum of
carbon which cannot be easily accounted for. Secondly, the effect of
one substance on the spectrum of another which I have recently
observed not only strengthens weak lines but in certain cases brings
a new series of lines into view.        Thirdly, the spectra of mixed
vapours have been shown to be different from the spectra of the sub
stances by themselves (Liveing and Dewar, ' Roy. Soc. Proc.,' vol.
34, p. 428) ; and, fourthly, the influence of the strong lines of an
element on adjacent weaker lines of another substance is to strengthen
the weaker lines in some cases, but almost to obliterate them in
others.
    In order the more readily to be able to refer to modifications in
the carbon spectrum,     I append lists of the lines which appear in
different circumstances when condensed sparks are passed between
graphite electrodes, so that at a glance it may be noted in what
manner the spectra are modified.      For comparison the edges of the
cyanogen bands measured by Kayser and Bunge, and the carbon
lines as recorded by Eder and Valenta, are given.         The difference
between the wave-lengths quoted     for  the same lines is dne chiefly to
the different scales used, namely those of Angstrom and of Rowland.
    On examining these figures it will be observed that Hartley and
Adeney's carbon line, 3881'9, may or may not coincide with the edge
of the cyanogen band, 3883'6, of Kayser and Runge, but probably
it does not. The carbon line, 3870-7 appears to coincide with 3871-7,
the band of cyanogen, but there is no further agreement between the
two spectra until we come to the three lines of carbon 3589*9, 3584"8,
and 3583 5. The two lines 38819 and 3870 7 of carbon are obtained
when dry electrodes are immersed in carbon dioxide, and under this
condition the second line is greatly lengthened and both are much
strengthened, whereas in atmospheric air, though the first is long,
both are only feeble.    With wet electrodes in air they are both long.
With dry electrodes in oxygen 3881*9 is a long line, but 3870 7 is
absent.
    I conclude from these facts that, whatever may be the origin of
these lines, they do not arise from the presence of any compound
of carbon with nitrogen, while at the same time they do appear to
belong to the element carbon.
    Of the three lines given above, that with the wave-length 3589'9
appears when sparks are passed between dry electrodes of graphite

   548       Variations in the Spectra of Carbon Electrodes.    [Apr. 19,
  in an atmosphere of oxygen       ; this can scarcely be considered a
  cyanogen line.      There remain now the two 3584"8 and 3513*5, and,
  as these lines are absent from the spectra taken in oxygen and in
  carbon dioxide, it may well be questioned whether their origin is
  elementary carbon.
      From their occurrence in the spectra taken in air and their being
   lengthened when moistened electrodes are used, it seems that for
  their prodnction nitrogen is necessary and water vapour advan-
. tageous ; but they are not yielded by cyanides, and, therefore, in the
  absence of any good reason for this, they cannot be attributed to
  cyanogen. A further examination of the list of lines will show that
  there are seven attributed to carbon by Eder and Valenta and three
  assigned by them to cyanogen which do not always appear when
  powerful sparks are passed between graphite electrodes through air.
  Then we have four lines of carbon and three attributed to cyanogen
  which do not appear when the spark is passed through carbon
  dioxide.    Liveing and Dewar (' Roy. Soc. Proc.,' vol. 34, p. 428)
  have shown that mixed vapours do not give precisely the same
  spectra as the substances present in the mixture would give by
  themselves.       In certain cases one element renders the lines of
   another more brilliant, while in other instances some of the lines
  disappear.      Chlorides usually have the effect of sweeping out the
   fainter lines.
      The lines at 3590"5 and 3585-9 and 3584 are closely adjacent to
  certain nitrogen lines which are somewhat strengthened in the carbon
  spectrum.     As the carbon spectrum varies remarkably under different
  conditions, it may exercise an influence on the nitrogen spectrum,
  and at the same time be modified by the presence of an atmosphere
  of this gas.       In order to test the probability of the carbon and
   nitrogen spectra being subject to variations when the two elements,
  are together in the spark or flame, it is necessary to consider tbe
  effect of one spectrum on another when the two are produced simul
   taneously from quite different materials.
      In the oxyhydrogen flame the water-vapour lines are prominent,
  but only two groups are visible in the spectrum under normal con
  ditions, and with an exposure of half an hour.        If, however, some
  Bulphur be burnt in the flame, the conditions being otherwise
  unchanged, then the spectrum, in addition to a band of continuous
  rays and flutings characteristic of sulphur vapour, shows the water-
  vapour lines wonderfully strong, with groups extending beyond
  those portions of the spectrum usually photographed, and not only
  are the lines distinct, but dense, as if their radiating power or the
  chemical action of their radiations was greatly increased.         This,
  does not arise from the continuous spectrum merely overlapping and
  apparently strengthening the water-vapour lines, since new groups of

1894.]            Electrical Interference Phenomena.                   349
lines came into view which were too feeble to be visible on the other
photographs.    Sulphur is not the only substance which affects this
spectrum,   for instance, the banded spectrum of magnesia and the
spectrum of lime also appear to intensify it.
   It is probable that something similar takes place with regard to
carbon ; we know that the spectrum is modified by the surrounding
nitrogen of the atmosphere, and the rays of carbon increase the in
tensity of the nitrogen rays adjacent to the carbon lines, the effect
being increased in the case of the spark by a saturated solution of
zinc or calcium chloride.
   The facts here set forth certainly favour the view that the lines in
Hartley and Adeney's spectrum of carbon are the lines of the ele
ment and not merely the edges of cyanogen bands. Finally,          I would
point out that the carbon spectra of Eder and Valenta are not quite
the same as those obtained by me, for if the photographs published
in the ' Journal of the Chemical Society,' vol. 41, p. 91, are carefully
examined with a strong magnifier, it will be seen that the graphite
spectrum, No. 10, on Plate II, yields neither the group            III  nor
group IV of cyanogen as depicted in spectrum No. 4 of the photo
gravure plate illustrating Eder and Valenta's paper; at the same
time it may also be remarked that it does not resemble the spectrum
of moistened electrodes to which I have already drawn attention.

   1.  The preliminary paper* on this subject gave the results of a
single experiment, and approximately accounted for them by a
mathematical theory of the phenomena involved.
   2. The present paper discusses the question of disturbances, and
gives nine experiments.       Two of these are similar to the first experi
ment, but were made under better conditions ; the others were made

original fundamental conclusions.
   3. The disturbances alluded to arise from the fact that the electrical
waves are not suddenly lost after their first incidence upon the ab
normal part of the secondary, but course to and fro until they die out.
A method of avoiding the greatest disturbance due to this cause is

spectively     of thinner      wires     nearer  together,  and   of thicker wires
further apart, than the normal spacing. In each case the capacity was
practically unaltered by the change in the wires ; hence, as anticipated
from the theory, no reflexion- occurred.

general features as to be mutually confirmatory, and were approved
by Professor Hertz|[ as close approximations.

    During his journey in the Karakoram-Himalayas, Mr. W. M. Con
way collected more than 300 specimens of rocks and minerals,
generally rather small, which have been examined by the authors.
They give a general summary of the results obtained, together with
the details of chief interest.
    Among the rocks are numerous specimens of granite and gneiss
 (the latter frequently pressure-modified granites), diorites, and horn
blende schists, crystalline limestones and dolomites, calc-mica,
micaceous, and other schists, ordinary limestones, sandstones witli
some conglomerates, argillites, slates, and phjllites, as well as some
peculiar mottled felstones, probably devitrified acid lavas, from one
locality (Golden Throne Peak). Of these rocks, the most interesting
are a dark green serpentine, very like a variety common in the Alps,
some hornblendites, piedmontite-schists,                6chists with a secondary
brown mica, the crystals in one case being quite a quarter of an inch
in diameter ; a partially altered argillaceous rock, in which small

the case of certain " Horonian

                                        conglomerates, and a black-garnet
micaceous schist, exactly resembling a rock which occurs in the
Lepontine Alps at various localities from the neighbourhood of the
Lukmanier Pass to the Binnen-Thal. Several of the schists resemble
                                              "
those which occur in the " upper schist         group (as defined by one of
the authors) in the Alpine chain.             Certain rather fine-grained
speckled gneisses resemble a variety of that rock common in the
Blair Athol district (Scotland).
    Among the minerals or vein-specimens, the        most  interesting is one
which presents some resemblance to jadeite.          Microscopic examina
tion shows it to consist of an aggregate of          minute minerals, very
difficult to distinguish, and chemical analysis     suggests that the most
probable are lime-garnet, jadeite, saussurite, or an allied mineral,
and a pyroxene. As the specimen was collected from a moraine, its
origin is conjectural, but that it was a vein-specimen seems most
probable.
    The minerals (among others) are actinolite, garnet, idocrase, noble
serpentine, pyrite, and copper pres.
    The geographical distribution of the rocks is described, and it is
shown that in these mountains, as in the Alps, remnants of sediment
ary rocks, probably of more than one geological era, are folded in
among great masses of crystalline rocks, some, doubtless of igneous
origin, but others metamorphosed sediments. It is evident that here,
 also, the rocks, as a rule, have been greatly modified by the effects of
 earth-movements.
 V. " Contributions to the Chemistry of Chlorophyll. No. V."
    By Edward Schunck, F.R.S. Received February 15, 1894.
    My previous papers       were    devoted to a description of various
products derived from chlorophyll and their qualitative reactions.
                                    I
 In the present communication propose to give an account of some
 experiments made with a view to ascertain the composition of some
 of the derivatives of chlorophyll previously described.
    Considerable difficulty was experienced in obtaining quantities of
 the various substances in a state sufficiently pure for analysis. This
 was especially the case with phyllocyanin and phylloxanthin, which,
by the methods of purification employed so far, cannot be obtained
 entirely free from fatty matter. No attempt was therefore made to
 determine their composition.         Of the compounds of phyllocyanin
 there is one, the phyllocyanin cupric acetate, which crystallises well,
 and has the appearance of a definite compound.         Its composition was

352                               Dr. E. Schuuck.                       [Apr.    19,
accordingly determined, two analyses made by different observers
leading to concordant results.              Unfortnnately, as previously ex
plained, the compound is of such a nature as to make the elimination
of copper and the consequent separation of the phyllocyanin im
possible ; otherwise the preparation of pure phyllocyanin from the
compound would have been easy.
   More satisfactory results were obtained in the case of phyllotaonin
and its compounds. These beautiful substances being well crystal
lised and easily soluble in chloroform, but much less so in alcohol,
may be obtained in a state of comparative purity, and             I  have reason
to think that the numbers yielded by analysis represent, with
tolerable accuracy, the composition of these bodies, although, in con
sequence of their high atomic weights, some doubt remains even as
regards the corresponding empirical formulae.

   The preparation       and properties of this compound have been pre

  VI. " Thermo-electric Properties of Salt Solutions." By George
         Frederick Emery, B.A., LL.M., of the Inner Temple, late
         Scholar of Trinity College, Cambridge.           Communicated by
         Professor  J. J.   Thomson, F.R.S.         Received   February     8.
         1894.
    The thermo-electrical       properties of solutions have not hitherto
 received much attention from physicists.         If we form a circuit of two
 substances, one a metallic wire and the other a solution, and arrange
 it so that the junctions between the metal and the liquid are at
 different temperatures, we generally find that an electromotive force
 is developed in the circuit which varies in magnitude nearly in pro
 portion to the difference of temperature between the junctions, and
 which, in comparison with the ordinary thermo-electromotive forces
 in metallic circuits, is very considerable. Up to the present time, as
           I
 far as am aware, the only extensive measurements of such thermo
electric forces are those of M. Bouty (' Journ. de Phys.,' vol. 9). He
concludes that for a given difference of temperature between the
junctions when the metal is constant the E.M.F. is nearly inde
pendent of the nature and strength of the solut ion (t he solution being
of somo salt of the metal used).
    The object of my experiments has been to see how far this is true,
and to find out how (in the event of its not being strictly true) the
E.M.F. varies with variations both in the strength and in the nature
of the solution.      The results show that both have considerable in
fluence on the magnitude of the E.M.F.
    My method of observation is as follows : the solution to be examined
is put in a U-tube (fig. 1, A), in each limb of which is one of the
ends of metal, which we may for convenience call electrodes, BB.

1894.]       Thermo-electric Properties of Salt Solutions.        357
                                Fig. 1.
Close to each electrode is the bulb of a thermometer, C, graduated
to one-fifths of a degree Centigrade.    One limb of the U-tnbe
surrounded by a water-jacket, DD, which is heated by an ordinary
circulating arrangement, so that its temperature can be regulated
as desired.   (See fig. 1.) The E.M.F. between the electrodes is
balanced against a branch of a circuit of about 20,000 ohms through
which a pair of Leclanche cells are kept closed, and the value of an
ohm in E.M.F. is measured against a Clarke cell.
   At the commencement of each experiment, when botft electrodes
were at the same temperature, there was very often a slight E.M.F
between them.     This was carefully read, and then the water-jacket
was gradually heated and the readings of the thermometers were
taken as the E.M.F. passed through, values represented by definite
numbers of ohms generally differing by 5 or 10.       The readings at
the highest temperature were very carefully taken, and then the whole
was allowed to cool, more readings being taken as the temperature
fell. The value of any particular experiment is roughly given by the
closeness of the readings for corresponding differences of tempera
ture, while the temperature was rising and falling. In some series
of observations the temperature was allowed to vary very slowly, so as
                                                           2 c 2

 to give accurate readings all through and enable me to get a curve
 showing the connection between E.M.F. and difference of tempera
 ture. In every case this was very nearly a straight line, and most of
 the experiments were made pretty quickly so as to get accurate read
 ings for the highest and lowest temperatures, while those for inter
  mediate points served to show if any irregularity had taken place
  from secondary causes, and form a check on the accuracy of the whole.
  If the readings are not steady or differ much for corresponding points
  on rising and falling temperatures,      I  do not, as a rule, attach any
  value to that experiment.      A change of -J*,,0 C. in the temperature of
  one of the junctions gave an easily noticeable deflection to the gal
  vanometer spot.
     For convenience    I  have used the symbol S for the electromotive
 force per 1° C, and the unit in terms of which S is given is 10~4 volts
 per 1° C.
     The value of dSjdt is in all cases very small compared with that of
 S, and appears to vary in sign for different solutions.
     Assuming, then, that dS/dt — 0, as is approximately              the case,
 my object was to find the variation of 9 with the strength of the
 solution.
     I made  a long series of experiments    with six salts, acetate, chloride,
 and sulphate of zinc, and sulphate, nitrate, and acetate of copper.
 Nitrate of zinc and chloride of copper gave no results as they appeared
 to attack the electrodes.      In a whole series of experiments on one
 salt I used the same lot of boiled distilled water and the same stock
solution, which was diluted down to the required strength.             I think,
therefore, that any small effect due to impurities in the water may be
safely taken to be a constant. The salts were all as pure as I could
obtain, and the stock solution was kept for a long time over oxide or
carbonate so as to neutralise any free acid as far as was possible.
    I found considerable variations in the value of 3 when the concentra
tion of the solution was varied, and to show these I have plotted corves
 (fig. 2), whose ordinates are equal to 3, and abscissae are the corre
sponding concentrations in gram molecules per litre of volume. For
very small concentrations it seems impossible to observe $ accurately,
and the parts of the curves corresponding to very small concentra
tions   I have extra-polated as well as    I can.   For zero concentration
the curves all appear to start from somewhere about & = 8-6 at an
angle to the axes, and then as concentration increases the curves bend
round more or less sharply till they are nearly parallel to the axis of
concentration.     It will also be observed that for some salts & increases
with increasing concentration, while for others it decreases, so that
for thermo-electrical purposes we may divide salts into positive and
negative according as the value of 9 for the solution is greater or less
than its apparent value for pure water. In all the aqueous solutions

 solution.
    With the zinc Baits I always used amalgamated zinc electrodes
 coated with sealing-wax or india-rubber where they entered the solu
 tion.   I always found these very satisfactory ; there was usually no
 E.M.F. between them when at the same temperature.               Unamal-
 gamated zinc is absolutely useless, as the E.M.F. flies about in a
 perfectly wild way.     The following are the values found for 3 : —

   This salt was not so satisfactory as those above, but the results are
sufficient to show that the sulphate is thermo-electrically positive in
aqueous solution.
   With the copper salts    I came to the conclusion, after trying several
forms of electrode, that the most satisfactory consisted of a short
length of fine wire projecting from the end of a glass tube, which
was drawn out and stopped with shellac. The following results were
obtained : —

   These last very strong solutions do not seem to follow any rule, the
last two were quite oily. The 0-25 concentration is the only one
within the range of the first set of experiments with which it fits in
very fairly.

   This last of the copper salts was not at all satisfactory, but the re
sults with it are very interesting, as the values of 9 are all far above
anything others measured. As the temperature rose the E.M.F. gene
rally varied in an irregular way, rising at times more quickly than
would be right, but as the temperature fell the E.M.F. usually fell
pretty steadily, and the values deduced from the fall are those given ;
they were all repeated, and the value given is what appears best.
The value 12-1 for the last concentration was very steady.
   After these experiments the solution stood in a stoppered bottle,
and some bright blue crystals separated out of the liquid.

    The weakest of these solutions gave the best results, it seemed as if
the stronger the solution was the more irregular the E.M.F. became.
All that can be said is that acetate of copper is very strongly
thermoelectrically positive, and that a very minute quantity in water
has a very great effect on the value of 3:
    These experiments appear to show that a great part of the quantity
# is due to the water, and that the presence of a salt in solution may
increase or diminish the value of & according to the nature of the
salt. The next step was to see how far this effect was an additive one,
and for this various mixtures of the above salts were used. The value
for water appears to be in the neighbourhood of & = 8*6, but it cannot
be measured directly, as with pure water the results are very ir
regular.    The following table gives the value of & as observed for the
mixture, the values for the separate salts of the same strength, and
the value which 9 would have if water were 8'6 and the differences
for the salts were additive.

    These results show that though the difference from the water value
 of £ is not quantitatively additive, yet as far as direction is concerned
 the differences do add, with the exception of the mixture of copper
 sulphate and acetate, which turned quite milky during the heating,
 though there was no trace of irregularity in the change of E.M.F.
 In a case where the components are both negative £ for the mixture
 is below either of the S-'s for the components, while for a mixture of
 a positive salt with a negative one the value of S is between those for
 the components. It will be noticed that in all the mixtures the salts
 liave one common component, so that there cannot be any action
 between the two salts.      These results for mixtures of salts seem to
 be of value as supporting the theory that the final S in a solution

1894.]        Thermo-electric   Properties    of Salt Solutions.            363
is due to the superposing of a salt effect on that due to the water
itself.
   We see from these observations that for any given salt the value
of 9, starting from some value independent of the nature of the salt,
tends to come to some value depending on the salt, and which does
not vary much for solutions of moderate strength. The latter result
was that obtained by M. Bouty ; the former is believed to be new. In
one of his series of experiments M. Bouty used very strong solutions of
zinc choride, and he found that as the strength of these was increased
the value of S rapidly diminished. This taken with the above results
seems to show that, if we could trace the entire curve for this salt,
taking the value of S for all concentrations down to pure zinc choride
at one end and pure water at the other, we should have a curve with
a point of inflexion somewhere about its middle.        It would, of course,
be well-nigh impossible to trace such a curve for any salt, but we can
do something very nearly identical without any great difficulty.              If
we take two solvents, and while keeping the salt a fixed quantity use
different mixtures of the solvents, we can get a complete curve for
3, as it varies with the change of solvent. I made a large number of
experiments on 1 per cent, solutions, or rather 1 gram per 100 c.c.
solutions of cadmium bromide ; these gave very good results with all
the mixtures used.       The electrodes were the exposed ends of sticks
of cadmium, the sides being coated with glass. In each set started      I
with the solutions in pure solvents, and then mixed them so as to get
the required mixture for each experiment.
   With solutions of 1 gram per 100 c.c. in methyl alcohol and ethyl
alcohol with their mixtures the following results were obtained : —

   These results show a marked difference from those for mixtures of
the two alcohols, methyl and ethyl.        In the latter case we have an
inflected curve, which is never far from the mean line which it would
occupy, if 9 for the mixture were proportionally placed between the
$'b for the pure liquids.   In the present case, however, a very small
admixture of either with the other causes a large drop in the valne of
9, and the curve lies almost entirely below its lower extremity.          In
both cases the ends are as symmetrical as the positions of the
extremities will permit.
   Now, the two pairs of solvents would appear to be good representa
tives of two classes of pairs of liquids. The two alcohols mix in a
quiet way with no appearance of chemical action, or, if any, very little
in the way of heat evolution and alteration of bulk, so that we might
very well expect to find any property of the mixture not very dif
ferent from the corresponding properties of the two components, and
lying somewhere between them in value. In the case of a mixture of
alcohol with water we have, on the contrary, large evolution of heat

and  considerable alteration      in bulk, so that we might expect to find
a change   in any physical property disproportionate to that usual in a
case  of simple mixture.
   The variations in the value of 9 for these two pairs are very like
those in the conductivity of different pairs of metals, for here again
we have in some cases the conductivity of the mixture nearly equal
to the mean conductivity of the components, while for other pairs the
conductivity of a mixture is far lower than that of either component.
   Besides the above sets of experiments, observations on a constant
strength of a stock solution of zinc sulphate mixed down to a con
stant bulk per 5 c.c. of stock with various substances, gave the fol
lowing results.

   All these were very satisfactory measurements.        The zinc sulphate
solution was not the same as that need before, and the value of 9 for
the aqueous solution is considerably lower than any of those pre
viously obtained. The great alteration in the value of 9 sometimes
caused by comparatively slight changes in the quality of the solution
makes it rather difficult to get the same results with two solutions
which are apparently alike, and I do not think that this last value
8"15 need cause doubt as to the substantial accuracy of the previous
results, since two at least of the previous set giving higher values for
9 appeared to be free from any objection.
   It will be noticed that all the additions to this zinc sulphate solution
caused a decrease in the value of 9, that for sugar, as might be ex
pected from such an inactive substance, being least and nearly pro
portional to its amount.         The presence of the sodic sulphate hag
considerable effect on the value of the change caused by 10 per cent,
alcohol, reducing the decrease in 9 by about half its amount. The
strength of the sodic sulphate added was too great to make the
results very interesting, but      I have no doubt that the curve would
have come round to the zero at 8*15, like all the others.          ,
   Various strengths of cadmium bromide in alcohol, which was after
wards found not to be pure, were tried.          The salt appeared to be
pretty strongly positive,   the   values observed for 9 being —

   A few experiments of what are believed to be an entirely novel
kind were made on the thermoelectric force generated in a purely
liquid circuit, that is, in a circuit composed of two kinds of liquid, the
junctions being at different temperatures. To measure this E.M.F.
one of the liquids was divided, and between the extremities, which
were kept at exactly the same temperature, two similar electrodes
were inserted.     For this the following apparatus (fig. 5) was used.
   The method of observation was as follows : —
   The beakers A, A' contain No. 1 liquid, as does the tube C. Of two
tubes D, of which the- ends are closed by porous plates, D 1 contains
 No. 1 liquid, and D 2 contains No. 2 liquid. The tube D 1 Was
placed in position, and when the temperature was steady the E.M.F.
 between F, F', which were at the same temperature connected by one
fluid was measured. Then the tube D 1 was removed, tube D 2
inserted, and the E.M.F. taken as soon as the temperature was
steady.

 salts. A few trials with alcohol in the D-tube were made, but were
 not very successful, owing to the rapid effects of diffusion in the A

     Lastly, I endeavoured to prove by experiment that these thermo
 electric forces at the junctions of metals and solutions are part of a
 system of reversible thermodynamic phenomena.         For this to be true
 we require to prove the equation

 where H is the heat developed by the passage of unit of electricity
 across the junction, t is the absolute temperature of the junction, and
 3 is the quantity discussed above.

    As far as am aware, M. Boufcy alone has attempted this previously
 (' Journ. de Phys.,' vol. 9). He used the plated bulbs of two similar
 thermometers as electrodes, noticing the difference between their
 readings when the current was allowed to pass in different directions.
 He graduated them in terms of heat units by sending a current
 through a spiral coil of fine wire enclosing one of the bulbs.        The
 values of H which he so obtained compare fairly well with those of
 t(dEi'jdt) measured directly.    This method seems to depend rather too
 much on the steadiness of convection currents in a liquid to be quite
 reliable, and   I have tried several arrangements to avoid this difficulty
        I
 with, think, satisfactory results.
    Some very good observations were obtained with an apparatus on
 the ordinary calorimeter principle. It was made up of the following
 parts, fig. 6 : —
    A. The Measuring Apparatus. — This consists of a double bobbin of
thin sheet copper on a hollow core, on the lower end of which is
screwed a metal plate (<*), which forms the electrode, and is in close
proximity all over its inner surface with the lower side of the bobbin.
 The lower half of the bobbin (/3) is wound with very fine copper wire,
the resistance of which forms the thermometer.        The upper half of
the bobbin (7) is wound with platinoid wire, having a resistance of
9-58 ohms. This platinoid coil formed the heater, by means of which
a known quantity of heat could be put into the calorimeter, and in
this way its heat capacity could be measured.
    B is a revolving stirrer which passes through the core of A, and
rests on a thin metal plate.
    The calorimeter vessel, C, is a thin glass tube, drawn out at its
lower extremity, through which passes the stem of the lower electrode,
D, which is a circular plate of metal ; over D are porous plates, E,
protected from the stirrer by a thin sheet of metal.
    All the vessel above this sheet of metal is enclosed in a metal box
F, and all above D is in a wooden box, G, which is surrounded on
all sides by fossil meal.

   For measuring the current, the potential between the ends of a
known resistance in its circuit was compared with a Clarke cell.
Thus, if on the potentiometer the latter = S, the former = RC being
T, we have

   For measuring the resistance, or rather the change in the resistance,
of the coil B, a circular wire bridge, of what is believed to be a new
form (fig. 7), which entirely avoids all thermoelectric disturbance,
was used. The bridge wire, A, is on the inside wall of a circular
channel, cut in a thick piece of wood. A second wire, B, made of
the same material as A, is sprung into a groove on the outside wall
of the channel.     The ends of A are on two copper plates close to
gether, and  the ends   of B are on a copper plate just opposite them,
on the other side of the channel, so that all the junctions of dissimilar
metals are within an area of about 1 sq. in.   Contact is made between

minutes, the liquid being well stirred, and the current, being mea
sured. The resistance of ft is again measured.
   The whole is allowed to stand for a few minutes till the tempera
ture is steady, and then a current is passed through the liquid by the
plate a for three minutes, and the resistance of ft is again measured.
After a rest the current is reversed, and allowed to pass again through
the liquid, and the resistance is again measured.
   When the current is passing through the liquid the heating effect
is due to two causes ; one of these is unknown, and is independent of
the direction of the current.     Let C be the enrrent, and let Ac2 be
this  unknown     heat.   The  rest  is due to the Peltier effect, and we
may put it equal to He.

   This is open to the objection that the heating not being the same in
each case,   the loss of heat will not be the same in each.
   An improvement on this method which was afterwards adopted
ensures the loss of heat being steady, and the same for all the obser
vations.     This was to so adjust the current that the change in- the
resistance of ft should be the same, whether the current passed
through the liquid, so as to heat the electrode-*, or whether it passed
so as to cool a, and at the same time passed through the coil 7.
   If C is the current which gives these equal differences, we have
                    AC' + HC = 4K =        AC'-HC + RC,
or                                 H = iRC.
    The  following observations were obtained with these methods, or
combination of them, using a 15 per cent, solution of copper sul
 phate, for which the value of & was equal to 6'8. The current is given
 in terms of potentiometer readings and the change of resistance in
 bridge divisions.

   Finally, the measurement was reduced to a null method by using
two pieces of apparatus like A, of the same size, and as nearly alike
as possible.     These were used side by side in a wooden bowl of
liquid of an oblong shape, with a copper bottom, and divided by an
ebonite plate, so that the current from the electrodes should go ver
tically through the liquid. Each platinoid coil had a resistance =
12 35 ohms., and the thermometer coils were 32 and 36 ohms, respect
ively.    The total thickness of each bobbin with its electrode plate
was   not  much above ^ in., the diameter a little over 1 in.
   The current passes through one of the 7 coils, and from one electr
ode- plate to the other through the bottom of the liquid.                 It is
adjusted so that    the ratio   of the resistances  of the  thermometer    coils
should remain constant for both directions of current.
   We now have, using the same letters as before, the single equa
tion
                        AC'+HC = AC-HC-rRC,
assuming everything symmetrical,
or                                 H  = £RC.
   If  there is any want of symmetry, we shall get two values for C,
one for each direction of the current, and if these are nearly equal,
 we are safe  in taking their mean.
    With this apparatus for the same solution a perfect balance             was
 got in each direction for the same value of C = 0-0339 amp.
                .-. H =   6-165.       C  =  0-2091 volt amp.
                               H/«  =  7 26  xlO"4.
    As this seemed rather high, the contact of the electrodes with the
 bobbins was made better by amalgamating their surfaces.
      A current    280 potentiometer gave a bridge change        — 10 in 5'.

                           H/* = 6-83 xlO-1.
   This the last, and, I believe, the best, result, is almost exactly
equal to & for the solution.
   With the last apparatus and a solution of nitrate of copper, for
which £ was measured and found = 6-14, a perfect balance in both
directions was obtained
with                   C  =   245     potentiometer

   I should have liked to do a few more solutions, but something went
wrong with the insulation of the bobbins, and        I had no time to repair
them. However, these two results appear to be enough to enable us
to say that the equation
                               dEjdt = H/f
is true for the junctions  of the kind under examination,          and that
these thermo-electric  phenomena are reversible.

      Received April 12, 1894.
   The experiments with which this paper deals were carried out
between the years 1883 and 1886 by Professor Kennedy and the
author, with an instrument which the latter had originally designed
for measuring local strains in metal structures, but which proved
itself to be so exceedingly sensitive that it seemed capable of being
applied to the measuring of the cross contraction of test pieces while
these were subjected to a longitudinal pull, thus providing the means
for measuring Poisson's ratio direct. In its original form the instru
ment consisted of two small frames, which were secured to each
other by means of two flat springs, in such a manner, that any relative
motion was a perfectly parallel one. One of these frames carried a
small piece of dark glass, and close to it, but on the other frame, a
right-angled reflecting glass prism was secured. The two glass sur
faces, which faced each other, were then carefully adjusted, so as to
                                                                2 d 2

be   nearly parallel, and, on throwing yellow sodium light into the
prism, interference bands conld be seen in the reflected light, and
these would move either in one direction or the other, according as
to whether the two glass surfaces, and with them their two frames,
 were either moving towards or away from each other. By counting
the number of interference bands, which passed a mark which had
been   scratched on the dark glass, it was possible to estimate the
 amount of the relative motion of the two glass surfaces, each band
representing a motion of half a wave-length of sodium light, or about
0-0000116 in.     A centre point projected from the nnder-side of
each frame, and these conld be pressed against that part of the
structure where it was intended to measure the variations of strains.
   Subsequently these centre points were replaced by two small
brackets and set screws, and in this form the instrument has been
                           Pio. 1. — Instrument A.

   It was soon found that the results which were obtained with this
instrument differed materially from those which were obtained by
less direct methods ; it was therefore taken to South Kensington and
calibrated in a Whitworth measuring machine in company with
Mr. Boys, by carefully comparing the relative motion of the two
screws a and b, fig. 1, with the number of interference bands which
had passed the mark on the dark glass. It was found that each band
represented 0 0000144 in.      Evidently the spring of the brackets and

 of the frames must account      for this large difference, namely, 24 per
 cent., over the true value of 0-0000116in. Although the cause might
be  known, this large correction introduced an element of uncertainty,
which the author hoped to eliminate by constructing a new instru
ment, B, fig. 2.
   In this sketch, T is the section of the test piece, which is pressed
against the point on the frame ~FX by the screw S.           G is the dark
glass, which, as soon as T contracts, is pulled away from the glass
prism P by means of the four helical springs Z, Z, which surround
the columns C, C, and which are firmly secured to the frames F,, F3.
The latter carry the adjustable glass prism P, which is so shaped that
the ray of yellow sodium light Li does not fall together with its
reflected ray 1^.   The inclination of the rays of light in the narrow
space between the prism P and the dark glass G was carefully
measured, and found to be 19°, so that each interference band, as
seen in the reflected yellow light, ought to represent a distance of
0-0000109 in., but careful measurements with the fine screw S showed

it to represent 0'0000120 in., or   10 per cent. more. Both instruments
A and B were nsed, and in the Table each experiment is marked with
a distinguishing letter. In the earliest experiments (marked A]) a
spirit lamp was used for illuminating purposes ; it was enclosed in
an asbestos-lined casing, but this soon got very hot, and must have
affected the readings.    Later on a Bunsen burner was used, and the
test piece and instrument screened from its radiant heat.      These ex
periments are marked Aj, but even now the heat made itself felt, and
the value l//i, last column, might in most of the experiments, as well
as those marked Ba, be reduced 5 per cent.          In the case of those
marked Bs, the test piece was placed in position and the lamp lit from
.30 to 60 minutes before commencing the readings.
    In most of the early experiments (compare Columns 3 and 4) five,
ten, and even twenty bands were counted between each reading of
the steelyard of the testing machine.           This was not only very
fatiguing to the eye, but it was subsequently impossible to determine
whether any interference bands had been wrongly counted. In the
later experiments, two, or at the utmost three, bands were counted
for each steelyard reading. Judging by the results, the central
position of each band can be estimated to within 10 per cent., and in
 many experiments the total number counted exceeded 20. Each test
piece was strained to the maximum intended load before each experi
 ment ; but, in spite of this, the first experiments were always slightly
 unsatisfactory, and have generally been rejected.
    The author's original intention had been to use the instrument A
 both for measuring the longitndinal extension and the cross contrac
 tion, but as this instrument did not give reliable results as regards
extensions, other strain indicators had to be used.
    I. Professor Kennedy's Lever Gear (Ci). The short end of a little
lever ended in a point, which was inserted into the centre punch
mark at one end of a test piece.       The fulcrum was connected to an
arm, which was fixed to the other end of the test piece, and the long
arm of the lever acted as a pointer.         The leverage was 100 to 1.
This instrument measured the elongation only on one side of the test
piece, and would not give reliable results.      In many of the experi
ments (those marked Ca) the instrument was first fixed on one side of
the test piece and then on the other. The same remarks apply to
the following gear, D, and Da.
    II. Mr. Stromeyer's Rolling-pin Gear D,. Two flat plates with
projecting centre points at either end were attached to the test piece.
The rolling pin, which was placed between the two plates, and held
there by helical springs, was a fine piece of hardened steel wire, to
which a large straw pointer was attached. In the first experiments
the leverage was about 300 to 1 ; in the later ones it was nearly
1,000 to 1.

 382       E xperimental    Determination   of Poisson's Ratio.  [Apr.  19,
    Professor Kennedy's Needle Gear (E). Two frames were attached
 to either end of the test piece, and each one carried a long arm in
 such a position that the two were close alongside each other, but not
 tonching.    The index pointer was attached to a small brass frame
 from which two strong needle points, about one- tenth of an inch apart,
 projected ; these rested in fine cross grooves which were cut on both
 arms, and any relative motion was magnified about a hundredfold.
 This instrument gives the average reading for two sides of a test piec«.
     One of the objects of these researches was, to ascertain whether
 Poisson's ratio, as determined by these experiments, agreed with the
 values as fonnd by a comparison of tension and torsion tests, and in
 order to obtain reliable angular measurements of the twist, the author
 constructed an instrument (P), which consisted of two mirrors, which
  were attached to either end of a torsion test piece, in such a position
 that the doubly-reflected image of a scale, which was placed about
  60 ft. away, coincided with the image as seen direct.     A slight twist
 of the test piece produces a displacement of the two scales, and this
 is the measure of the torsion angle.      The instrument is very sensitive
 and reliable for small angles.
    Only a few of the samples were tested for torsion, but Messrs.
 Piatt and Hargraves (Minutes of the Inst, of Civil Engineers, vol. xc,
p. 387) have made experiments on 11 samples with the instruments
 Ci and F, but as there is internal evidence that the results cannot be
 relied upon in all cases they have not been reproduced here.
    Before discussing the results it will be necessary to consider how
far the experiments are reliable. The instruments have already been
 discussed, but the methods also play an important part.
    1st Method.    Tensile test, measurement of elongation e and cross
contraction c. The value of           is cje, and an error of 1 per cent,
 in either determination will affect l//t by an equal amount.
    2nd Method.      Tensile test and measurement of elongation, and
torsion test and measurement of shearing angle, *. In this case l/«
 = a 2e — 1, and when this value is about 0'2, an error either in e or a
produces a sixfold greater one in l//t.         A 5 per cent, error in e,
which is not unlikely, if it is only determined for one side, would
absolutely spoil the conclusions.      In most cases, l//i found in this
way is smaller than by the 1st Method, but, as will be seen (Table,
Nos. 16 and 58), it sometimes is even greater than 0'500.
    The conclusions to be drawn from the experiments with these nine
teen samples are   : —
    1. That Poisson's ratio is not a constant value for all materials.
   2.  That mechanical treatment : cold rolling (No. 52) and annealing
(No. 67) of the metal alter it.
    3. That Poisson's ratio is sometimes a function of the stress (Nos.
12,17. 23, 28, 53, 61, and 68).

   4.  That Poisson's ratio, as found by direct measurement, is not the
same as that found by comparing torsion and tension experiments.
   The work entailed in the digestion of these experiments, and their
reduction to a small table, has been heavier than the author had
anticipated, but as the results show that they are fairly reliable, they
may be of use to those engaged in researches on elasticity.                In con
clusion, the author begs to thank Professor Kennedy, not only for
allowing him the use of his testing machine, but also for directing
each experiment, and personally taking its reading.

 substance was partly in the liquid state at the lower limit of tem

    These observations, combined with those contained in Part           I   (loc.
ext.), afford a well defined line, which rises slowly at the higher
densities, turning away from the axis of density.
     According to an empirical equation to this line, the specific heat
of carbon dioxide at constant volume is given in terms of its variation
with density p, as follows : —
                       Cv   = 01650+0-2125/.+0-3400/.s.
    This is in fair agreement with the linear equation deduced in
Part      I from the limited number of experiments at low densities
therein contained : —

    In these experiments a spherical vessel of copper        was used to hold
the gas, having a voluminal capacity of about 86              CO., a mass of
137 grams, and an estimated resistance to bursting of 300 atmos.
This,    as in the former experiments, was equilibrated against a similar
vessel in a differential steam calorimeter.          These vessels produced
each precipitation, due to its own calorific capacity of 2*1 grams of
        a
steam.       It was found, however, that closely agreeing results (to     1  per
cent, about) were obtained when the precipitation due to the gas fell
to as little as 0'15 gram.

      Received March 9, 1894.
                                   (Abstract.)
   In order to investigate the question of the variation of the specific
heat of carbon dioxide with temperature, a steam calorimeter was
constructed having double walls of thin brass, between which the
vapour of a liquid boiling under atmospheric pressure could be
circulated.   The vessels used in the experiments were hung in the
closed inner chamber.      Into this chamber steam could be admitted
after the temperature had become stationary and the same as that of
the jacketting vapour.      In this way the initial temperature could be
varied.
   Experiments at various densities and over four intervals of tem
perature were carried out.         The densities chosen were 0'0456 ;
0 0800 ; 0 1240 ; 01800, and 0-1973.      The intervals of temperature
over which the gas at each density was investigated were : air
temperature to 100° ; 35° C. (boiling point of ether) to 100° ; 56"
(boiling point of acetone) to 100°, and 78° (boiling point of ethyl
alcohol) to 100°.
   The results are plotted on 5 equi-density lines, and it was found
most intelligible to plot the precipitation         due to the calorific
capacity of the gas between t, and 100° against the initial tempera
ture ti in each case. If the initial temperatures are measured as
absciss®, starting from 0° C. at the origin, and the precipitations are
set off as ordinates, the 5 equi-density       lines so determined slope
downwards to the right (the slope increasing with the density),
passing, necessarily, through the point 100° C. on the axis of temper
ature in each case.    If the specific heat is invariable these are right
lines. This proves to be sensibly the case for the lines p = 0-0456
and p = 0-0800 ; those of lowest density.
   The next line, 0-124, is nearly rectilinear over the higher ranges,
but pursued from right to left it rises markedly at the lower tem
peratures ; thus indicating that the specific heat at constant volume
falls in value with increasing temperature.          The line /> = 0'1800
and the one close above       it,  = 0'1973, show this variation very
                                    p
markedly.    Their variation below the critical temperature       compli

decrement of the specific heat of a gas at constant volume with i-ise
of temperature. The characteristic-equation of carbon dioxide does
not seem to have been given as yet in a satisfactory form for ap
plication to the higher pressures. Probably on this account only an
approximate agreement is found to exist between the numerical
amount of the decrement predicted and that observed experimentally
at the higher densities.               At the lower densities the sensible
absence      of variation   with  temperature over the range of the observa

 ILL "A Contribution to the Study of the Yellow Colouring
        Matter of the Urine." By ARCHIBALD E. GARROD, M.A,
        M.D. Oxon., F.R.C.P. Communicated by Sir Alfred B.
        Garrod, M.D., F.R.S. Received February 5, 1894.
     The uncertainty which still surrounds the origin of a phenomenon
 so   familiar as the yellow coloration of the urine bears eloquent
 testimony to the difficulties which beset the investigation, by ordinary
 chemical methods, of such substances as the urinary pigments, and to
 the importance of the part which the spectroscope has played in the
acquisition of such knowledge of them as we possess.
    Indeed, our acquaintance with the individual pigments is propor
tional to the distinctive character of their absorption spectra, rather
than to the time which has elapsed since they first attracted atten
tion ; and in not a few modem works doubt is thrown upon the very
existence of a distinct yellow pigment, having negative spectroscopic
properties, but to which normal urine owes its characteristic tint,
the chief part in the coloration of the excretion being assigned to
urobilin.
    In this connexion the spectro-photometric researches of Vierordt*
are of much importance, for they appear to show conclusively that
more than one pigment is present in normal urine.               Vierordt found
that with different specimens of the urine of a single healthy indi
vidual, examined at considerable intervals, the extinction coefficients
for different parts of the spectrum exhibited relative as well as posi
tive differences.
    The variations of positive value are of course dependent upon the
depth of colour of the specimen, but the relative variations can only
be explained by the presence, in varying proportions, of two or more
distinct pigments.
    It must not, however, be forgotten that, as Vierordt himself points
out, pigments which yield definite absorption bands may influence
the extinction coefficients, even when present in such small quantities
that their bands are not visible as such ; and it can be shown that at
least three colouring matters, apart from a yellow pigment, may be
present in any given specimen of the urine of a healthy individual,
which may, nevertheless, exhibit no obvious selective absorption.
    Of these pigments, urobilin is certainly one, and when not seen on
direct examination of the untreated normal urine, its band not in
frequently appeai-s on standing, or on the addition of a mineral
acid.
    Yet the quantity present is at best extremely minute, and wholly

  1894.]       of the Yellow Colouring Matter of           the Urinet         395
 inadequate to account for the coloration, and               I  am therefore con
 vinced that the statement that urobilin is the chief colouring matter
 of normal urine is entirely incorrect.          Indeed, as far as normal urine
 is concerned, urobilin can hardly be reckoned as one of its colouring
 matters at all, for even a very faintly tinted solution of this pigment
 yields a well-defined absorption band, far darker than is ever seen in
 normal urine.       In some morbid urines, on the other hand, it affects
 the colour profoundly.
    The second pigment referred to is h»matoporphyrin, which, as                 I
 have elsewhere shown,* can usually be detected by appropriate means
 even in normal urine ; but here, again, the amount present is so in
 finitesimal that it can have no appreciable effect upon the colour.
    The occasional deposition of pink urate sediments, apart from any
 noticeable deviation from perfect health, shows that uroerythrin
 must also be reckoned among the pigments of normal urine ; and if
 further confirmation is needed, it is obtained, as Rivaf and Zoja have
 shown, by the examination of the extracts obtained by shaking
 specimens of urine with amylic alcohol.
    Since, however, the above-mentioned pigments, with the possible
 exception of uroerythrin, can have no material influence upon the
 colour of normal urine, we are driven to the conclusion that there
 must exist in the urine another much more abundant colouring
 matter, of a yellow tint, which even in concentrated solution yields
 no absoiption bands, or that the colour is due to the presence of more
 than one such substance.
    There are not wanting records of investigations directed to the
 isolation of such a pigment, or mixture of pigments, and products
have been obtained by several observers, which they have looked
upon as the substance in question, but the various products have
differed in their properties, and no one of them has met with general
acceptance.
    The literature of the subject will be found admirably epitomized in
papers by ThudichumJ and Schunck,§ published in 1864 and 1867
respectively, and to these epitomes there remains little to be added,
seeing that during the twenty-seven years which have since elapsed,
no fresh observer has, as far as       I am aware, published any investiga
tions upon the subject.
    Referring my readers to these epitomes for records of the earlier
work of Proust, Berzelius, Lehmann, Harley, and others,                   I  only
propose to allude here to the results obtained by Tichborne,              Thudi-
chum, and Schunck.

    C. Tichborne* (1862) threw down most of the colouring matter of
 a large  quantity of concentrated urine upon a basic copper precipi
 tate, and extracted the pigment from the precipitate by means of
 cold dilute sulphuric acid and alcohol.
     In this way he obtained a solution which, on evaporation, left a
 brown residue, very hygroscopic and smelling of stale nrine, solutions
 of which yielded, according to the degree of concentration, the various
 tints of normal urines.
    The pigment was soluble to almost any extent in water, was in
 soluble in ether, sparingly soluble in absolute alcohol, and more
 readily in rectified spirit. It was precipitated from solution by basic
 lead acetate.
    The results of elementary analysis led Tichborne to think that it
 was derived from hippuric acid by the subtraction of water, the per
 centage composition obtained being C, 67 80 ; H, 4-23 ; N, 8 56 ;
 O, 1941.
    It is extremely doubtful whether combustion analyses of such sub
 stances are calculated to materially advance our knowledge, in the
 absence of any of the ordinary guarantees of the purity of the sub
 stance analysed ; and so simple a process as that employed by Tich
 borne could only be expected to yield a product of a moderate degree
 of purity.
    Thudichumf (1864) obtained from normal urine by a variety of
 processes a substance to which he gave the name of urocbrome, and
 his researches which have extended over a long period form the most
 elaborate contribution yet made to the subject.
    In the second edition of his work on the urine,J in which his later
 researches are embodied, he gives four methods for the isolation of
 urochrome in which phosphomolybdic acid and the neutral and basic
 lead acetates are employed as precipitant*, and sulphuric acid, sulph
 uretted hydrogen, &c, for the extraction of the pigment from the pre
 cipitates.    Great pains were taken to obtain the pigment in the
 highest attainable degree of purity.
    Thudichum describes urochrome as forming yellow crusts when its
 solutions are evaporated, as dissolving very readily in water, fairly
 readily in ether, and least easily in alcohol. It was precipitated from
 its solutions by lead acetate, silver nitrate, acetate and nitrate ot
 mercury, &c.
    On heating with mineral acids the aqueous solution became red,
 and resinous flakes were thrown down from which three definite
 substances conld be obtained, which were minntely studied, and sub
jected to ultimate analysis.         These substances were a red pigment,

  band to the more refrangible side of D (omicholic acid), a portion
  soluble in alcohol, showing a band extending from E to beyond F
  (uropittine), and a residue scarcely soluble in water or alcohol, but
  readily dissolved by alkalies (uromelanine).
     Thudichum assigns to uroohrome a faint absorption band at P, and
 was led to regard the pigment as a feeble alkaloid, on account of its
 precipitation by phosphomolybdic acid.
     Schunck* (1867) employed the acetates of lead as precipitants, and
 extracted the colouring matter with cold sulphuric acid or sulphuretted
 hydrogen.     He came to the conclusion that the urine owes its colour
 to two distinct yellow pigments, one soluble and the other insoluble
 in ether.
    The pigment soluble in ether (urian) yielded, on heating with
mineral acids, a brown resinous substance, readily soluble in alcohol
 (uroretine), whereas the pigment insoluble in ether (urianin) yielded
a brown flocculent substance scarcely soluble in alcohol (uro
melanine). He made numerous combustion analyses of these pro
ducts, and his results differed widely from those of Tichborno, espe
cially in the much smaller percentage of carbon found. For urian,
 the pigment soluble in ether, Schunck obtained the percentage com
position C, 5123; H, 5 38; N, 1"26; 0, 42-13. Whereas urianin
gave C,46-44; H,       5 66; N, 316; 0, 4474.
    In  more recent years, Thudichum has on various occasions upheld
the claims of urochrome to be regarded as a definite chemical entity ,f
in reply to the criticisms of MalyJ and others.
    Dr. Lewis Jones, who, some years ago, made some investigations
on this subject, has favoured me with an account of his results, which
were never published.          He arrived at the conviction that the yellow
colour of urine could not be due to urobilin, which, in solution, has a
redder colour than urine. Moreover, the yellow pigment is insoluble
in chloroform, in which urobilin dissolves freely. Urobilin, even in
very dilute solution, has a very distinct absorption band at F, whereas
normal urine shows no band at F unless viewed in deep layers, and
then shows only a diffused obscuration about the region of the F line,
quite unlike the sharp band of urobilin.
    He found that an extract obtained by the lead acetate method,
evaporated in vacuo, with proper precautions, yielded a yellowish
crust, from which chloroform dissolved out any traces of urobilin.
The remainder, when dissolved in water, reproduced the colour of the
original urine when diluted to the same bulk. From normal urine
the amount of urobilin obtained was very minute ; more could be

extracted from the highly-coloured urine of febrile patients, but in
neither case does he consider that the quantity present suffices to
materially affect the colour of the urine when diluted to the original
buMc.
   He adds    :
                " I am disposed to regard the colour of urine as being
due to   the presence of a yellow body which, for the present, may be
called  urochrome, and, without positively denying the presence of
traces  of urobilin in normal urine,     I   consider that the amount which
occurs   in ordinary specimens is far too minute to affect the colour,
whilst even in febrile urine the colour is only modified a little by the
presence of urobilin."
   The present writer was led to approach this difficult problem by
the study of the coloration of uric acid sediments in urine, in which
it became obvious that the yellow pigment played an important part.
Attempts wei* therefore made to extract this pigment for purposes of
further investigation, by a process which should differ from those
hitherto employed in the following important respects : —
   1. That, if possible, the recognised urinary pigments, and especially
        urobilin should be got rid of at the outset.
   2. That the employment of powerful reagents, and especially of
         mineral acids, should be, as far as possible, avoided.
   3. That the colouring matter should not be precipitated by lead
        acetate or other metallic compounds, and afterwards extracted
        from the precipitate.
   After many attempts and repeated failures, a method was devised
which, to a great extent, fulfils the above couditions, the essential
parts of the process being    as follows   : —
   1.  Saturation of the urine with pure ammonium sulphate and filtra
        tion.
   2. Extraction, from the filtrate, with ethylic alcohol, which sepa
        rates out from the saturated liquid, and carries most of the
        colouring matter with it.
   3. Evaporation, and solution of the residue in absolute alcohol.
   4. Precipitation of the pigment from its alcoholic solution by excess
        of ether.
   For purposes of more detailed description, it will        be convenient to
divide the process into the above four stages.
   Stage I. — A pint or two of concentrated normal urine is saturated
with pure ammonium sulphate, solution being aided by gentle warmth,
and is then passed through a filter.
   The filtrate is clear and has a pure golden colour, somewhat paler
 than that of the original urine.
   The precipitate, which varies in tint from brown to pink, contains

 18114.]       of the   Yelloio Colouring Matter      of the Urine.     399
any urobilin that may be present, as has been shown by G. Hoppe
 Seyler,* who makes saturation with ammonium sulphate the start
ing point of his process for the quantitative estimation of that sub
stance.
    Acidulated alcoholic extracts from the precipitate usually show a
faint urobilin band, and sometimes still fainter bands of acid hsemato-
porphyrin. Unusually pink precipitates will be turned green by
alkalies, which shows that they contain uroerythrin.
    If the precipitate be washed with water a yellow solution is ob
tained, which is found to contain some of the yellow pigment precipi
tated by the saturation.
    Lastly, in addition to mucus, there may remain upon the filter
paper a black residue, insoluble in water, alcohol, and dilute acids,
but slightly soluble in soda, potash, or strong ammonia, which is an
impurity derived from the ammonium sulphate.
    A morbid urine, highly coloured with urobilin, yields a yellow
filtrate, like that obtained with normal urine, which shows no urobilin
baud.     I  have reason to think that there is no such complete removal
of hfflraatoporphyrin, but any traces of this pigment which may exist
in the filtrate are removed at a later stage.
    Stage II. — To the saturated clear yellow filtrate absolute alcohol is
next added, which throws down some of the ammonium sulphate, and
after a small quantity has been added, quickly separates and collects
upon the surface as a clear layer, carrying with it the bulk of the
yellow pigment.
    The alcohol is then separated off from the partially decolorised
urine, from which a further supply of pigment can be obtained by a
 fresh addition of alcohol. By repeated extraction the pigment may
 be almost completely         removed, but the result does not repay the
expenditure of alcohol entailed. If rectified spirit be used instead of
 absolute alcohol, a considerably larger quantity is required to produce
satisfactory separation.
    The alcoholic extract thus obtained is next poured into a consider
able bulk of distilled water, and the alcohol is again caused to sepa
 rate out by once more saturating with ammonium sulphate, with the
 aid of gentle warmth.         This washing process, which entails some loss
 of pigment, is of much importance, as by this means urea and other
 crystalline impurities are to a large extent got rid of ; and its omission
 is apt to give rise to trouble at a later stage.
     The golden orange-coloured extract thus obtained is inflammable,
 but will not mix with chloroform, as it still contains water and am
 monium sulphate. It is therefore poured upon some fresh ammonium
 sulphate and gently warmed, when two layers will form, the lower of
  which is almost colourless, and represents much of the water pre-

  viously contained in the extract, tbe bulk of the dissolved ammonium
  sulphate being separated with it.
     Stage III. — The lower layer having been removed, the alcoholic
 extract is now evaporated to dryness over a water bath, a few drops
 of ammonia being added from time to time so as to maintain an
 alkaline reaction.                     ,
     This precaution is rendered necessary by the presence in the extract
 of a considerable quantity of indoxyl sulphate, which is otherwise
 apt to be decomposed during the evaporation, with the formation of
 indigo pigments.
     Such decomposition cannot take place if the liquid be kept alkaline,
 for, as Baumann showed, the indoxyl sulphates may be boiled with
 caustic alkalies without undergoing change ; and, far from producing
 any alteration in the yellow pigment, the ammonia tends to preserve
 it from changes to which it is otherwise liable.
    A brown residue remains after the evaporation is complete, which
 has a treacly consistence, but solidifies on cooling.       This residue,
 which emits a powerful urinous odour, and contains some ammonium
 sulphate, is washed once or twice with acetic ether, which removes
 the bulk of the indoxyl sulphate, and comparatively little of the
 yellow pigment. It is then transferred to a stoppered bottle and
 allowed to soak for some hours in absolute alcohol. On filtering a
 beautiful orange-coloured alcoholic solution is obtained, but some of
 the pigment escapes solution and may be in part removed by a second
 soaking in fresh alcohol.
    Water dissolves the undissolved residue readily and completely,
 and if the aqueous solution so obtained is treated like the original
 urine by saturation with ammonium sulphate and extraction with
 alcohol, a further supply of absolute alcoholic solution may be ob
tained from it, which has the advantage of being free from indoxyl
sulphate;
    It is probable that some of the pigment has undergone a slight
change which renders it very sparingly soluble in alcohol.
    Stage IV. — The alcoholic solution, which, when treated in the cold
with hydrochloric acid and a trace of chloride of lime, still yields an
indigo reaction, is next concentrated, if necessary, until it has a rich
orange colour.      It is then poured into rather more than its own bulk
of   ether, whereupon much of the pigment is precipitated in an
amorphous state, and may be collected upon a filter which has been
first moistened with pure ether to ensure rapid filtration.
    The presence of a very little water prevents the precipitation, a
few drops of a very concentrated aqueous solution separating out and
passing through the filter.
    If the various stages of the process have been carefully followed,
and especially   if   the second separation of the alcoholic extract from

 1894.]           of the Yellow Colouring Matter of            the   Urine.             401
distilled water has been carried out, the filter paper will merely be
coated with an amorphous brown film, and there will be no appreciable
deposit of crystalline impurities.               The filtrate of ether and alcohol
will have yellow colour,
                a                   as it  is able  to hold a considerable quantity
of pigment in solution.
     The filter paper, to which the pigment clings tenaciously, is allowed
to dry and is then soaked for a time in chloroform which remains un-
tinted, and afterwards in absolute alcohol.                     The alcohol becomes
coloured by the pigment, but does not dissolve it nearly so readily as
before.
     The paper is then allowed to soak for an hour or so in distilled
water, by which means a clear orange-coloured or yellow aqueous
solution is obtained, which should yield no indigo reaction, and which
contains the pigment in a condition approaching to purity, although
it   is certainly not entirely pure.           I believe, however, that no pigment
other than the yellow            one    is   present, and the absence of those
which show absorption bands can be definitely established.
     When it is treated with sodium hypobromite, a little nitrogen is
evolved, the freedom from urea being in proportion to the amount of
washing or soaking in alcohol that the brown precipitate has received.
If    only slightly washed, 1 c.c. of a concentrated solution tested by
means of Southall's apparatus, may give off nitrogen equivalent to as
much as 0'003 gram of urea, but if the washing has been more
thorough, the amount evolved is too small to bo measured.
     Seeing how soluble urea is in alcohol and in water, whilst it is
almost insoluble in ether, it is only to be expected that this snb&tance
should constitute the chief impurity in the specimens.
    When the residue obtained by evaporation of the aqneous solution
is burnt on a platinum dish, it yields a veiy bulky mass of carbon, and
ultimately a trace of colourless ash, varying in quantity, which is
readily soluble in water, contains no appreciable amount of carbonate,
and apparently consists of sodium phosphate.*
    * May     9fh, 1894. — It has been suggested that the yellow pigment may contain
some, at least, of the iron which is present in urine, but although           I cannot state
that the product obtained by the above process           is absolutely  free from  iron, the
amount of that element contained in it is, at most, exceedingly        minute.    After  the
combustion of such small quantities as 1 or 2 cgrm. of the dry pigment, the
sulphocyanide test gave ncgativo results, provided that iron-free reagents, and
filter-papers which had been extracted with hydrochloric acid, were employed in
the process j but with as much as 6 cgrm. a just perceptible tint was obtained, in
no way comparable with that yielded by a fiftieth part of that weight of haemo
globin.    I   am, therefore, inclined to look upon this minute trace of iron as an
accidental impurity, probably derived from the urine, rather than as a constituent
of  the yellow pigment.
    When heated with potassium hydrate         the yellow pigment    wa3   found to give off
ammonia      freely.

 402     Dr. A. E. Garrod.      -1 Contribution   to the Study   [Apr. 26,
   The final product represents but a small part of the yellow pigment
present in the original specimen of urine, conspicuous loss beiug
entailed in the washing of the alcoholic extract, the washing with
acetic ether, and especially in the precipitation with ether.
   I have not made any ultimate analysis of the product, since such
an analysis would have little value without further guarantees of the
purity of the product, and such guarantees could hardly be obtained
in the case of a colloid substance such as this pigment is. A long
series of combustion analyses, if they yielded uniform results, would
doubtless go far towards establishing its percentage composition, but
in order to obtain the material l-equired for such a series, very laige
amounts of urine would have to be dealt with, and a correspondingly
large consumption of the materials employed in the extraction of the
pigment would be involved.
                     Properties of the Solid Pigment.
   In the solid state the product obtained by the       above process was
completely amorphous     and   brown   in colour.   It was  so hygroscopic
that it could not be completely dried in air, but in the exsiccator, over
sulphuric acid, it lost its viscosity, and became quite hard.
   It dissolved in water with the greatest facility, readily in rectified
spirit, and much less readily in absolute alcohol.           Acetic ether,
amylic alcohol, and acetone dissolved the pigment sparingly.
   The solubility of the product in alcohol appeared to undergo a pro
gressive diminution, through the successive stages of extraction, and
after each evaporation of an alcoholic solution some of the pigment
was apt to escape re-solution in alcohol.
   In pure ether, chloroform, and benzene it was quite insoluble, but
mixtures of ether or chloroform with alcohol dissolved it to some
extent. In its purest state the pigment was practically odourless
 when cold, but on the water-bath it softened and emitted a slight
urinous odour.
                  Properties  of Solutions of  the Pigment.
   The solutions of the pigment in alcohol or in water reproduced on
dilution the various shades of yellow and orange colour of normal
urines.    On concentration they passed through various shades of
orange to a rich, warm brown.
   Blue litmus paper dipped into the solutions was slightly reddened,
and red litmus took a faint blue tint.
   When the solutions were placed before the spectroscope they
showed no absorption bands, even on the addition of an acid. The
blue end of the spectrum was absorbed, and the absorption faded
away so gradually towards the yellow, that even with concentrated solu

1894.]          of the Yellow Colouring Matter of        the Urine.           403
tions it was not possible to assign to it even an approximate limit.
There was no increase of the absorption in the position of the urobilin
band.
     Treatment with zinc chloride and ammonia did not produce any
fluorescence.
     The alcoholic solutions always showed the same rich yellow or
orange tint, and could be kept for a long time without undergoing
any appreciable change ; but aqueous solutions kept in stoppered
bottles tended to assume a brown tint on standing, even when dilute,
and this change was precipitated by evaporation or warmth.                 In this
respect my product        behaved   just  like  urochrome.
     The tendency of the aqueous solutions to undergo this change could
be restrained by the addition of a little ammonia.
     Alkalies did not appreciably alter the tint of dilute solutions, but
more concentrated ones wero slightly browner when alkaline than in
the neutral condition.
     Small additions of mineral acid produced no immediate change,
but larger quantities quickly changed the colour to a reddish-brown.
     Solutions of the pigment were decolorised by nascent hydrogen
produced by the action of hydrochloric acid upon zinc.              This is only
 to be expected, seeing that it is a known fact that the urine is itself
 decolorised by similar treatment.*             The destroyed colour was not
restored by hydrogen peroxide.
                   Action of Mineral Acids upon the Pigment.
     Solutions of the yellow pigment when warmed with nitric acid re
 mained clear, but took a distinctly brighter yellow tint.                On the
 addition of ammonia to alkalinity the yellow colour changed to a rich
 orange, the changes of tint being exactly similar to those which con
 stitute the xanthoproteic reaction.         This reaction seemed to be due to
 a change in the pigment as a whole, and not to any traces of impurity
  present.
     Heated over the water bath with the addition of sulphuric or
  hydrochloric acid, the changes observed were uniform with all speci
 mens of the indigo-free pigment which were subjected to this
  treatment, and were the same whichever               of the two acids was
  employed.
      The colour of the liquid quickly changed to reddish-brown, and on
  evaporation to dryness a nearly black residue was left.          This residue,
  when treated with water, yields an orange-coloured solution, resem
  bling the original liquid in colour, but darker in tint.          This aqueous
   extract left ou evaporation a brown residue, which was scarcely soluble
   in alcohol, but which communicated a yellow colour to chloroform.

   From the remainder of the original residue alcohol extracted more
pigment, and hot alcohol more still, the liquid assuming a sepia tint,
and showing no absorption bands.          The hot alcoholic eolation de
posited, on cooling, a dark, pulverulent sediment, which, examined
microscopically, was found to be amorphous.          A black residue still
remained which was insoluble in water, alcohol, and dilute acids, was
scarcely soluble in amylic alcohol, but was readily dissolved by strong
ammonia (the nromelanine of Thudichum).             The alkaline solution
gave no absorption bands.
   After extraction with water the original residue communicated a
yellow colour to ether, but no substance resembling theomicholic acid
of Thudichum (which is readily soluble in ether with a fine red colour)
was obtained.
                    Frecipitants of  the Yellow Pigment.
   In its behaviour towards metallic salts the pigment obtained by my
process exhibited the closest resemblance to the urochrome               of
Thudichum.
   The solutions were almost decolorised by the acetates of lead, by
nitrate of silver, and by phosphotungstic and phosphomolybdic acids,
which all threw down precipitates containing the bulk of the
pigment.
   Mercuric acetate decolorised the solutions completely, a yellow pre
cipitate being formed, from which the colouring matter could be
readily extracted with alcohol acidulated with hydrochloric acid, but
apparently not without some change, evidenced by its reddish-brown
colour.
   Mercurous acetate had not the power of throwing down the pig
ment from its solutions.
               Behaviour of the Pigment towards Uric Acid.
    If to a solution of colourless urate, obtained from snake's excre
ment, some of the yellow pigment was added, and if the conditions of
the experiment were so adjusted that crystals of uric acid are slowly
deposited from the solution, these crystals resembled those which
 compose the yellow or brown variety of uric acid sand, and had,
moreover, the ordinary urinary forms, the familiar whetstone shape
preponderating.     I have, indeed, specimens of crystals so obtained
which are quite indistinguishable from those of the natural urinary
sediments.
    This experiment is difficnlt to carry out satisfactorily, chiefly
owing to the instability of the isolated pigment.       If the crystals are
too quickly deposited they have the whetstone form, but are only

 1894.]         of the Yellow    Colouring Matter of the Urine,                 405
faintly tinted. If acid is added they have a brown colour like that
of crystals thrown down on the addition of acid to urine.
    The convei-se experiment to this was performed some years ago by
Ord,* who showed that, on repeatedly redissolving and reprecipitating
urinary uric acid, the crystals lost their colour, and, at the same
time, tended to assume the tabular forms of those of pure uric acid.
    The above result lends strong support to the view that the pigment
is isolated by the alcohol process in the form in which it actually
exists in the fresh urine, and confirms the statement that it plays an
important part in determining the forms which the crystals assume."
   Another fact which is demonstrated by this experiment is that the
yellow pigment is one of those which colours the urinary crystals,
although it does not stand alone in this respect.            I  do not, however,
propose   to   enter  further  into  this subject  here, as I  hope to deal with
it at length in     a separate paper, but      I  may mention that crystals of
uric  acid which are deposited from a solution of urobilin are colour
less and exhibit no modification of form, resembling, in every
respect, those thrown down from pure aqueous solutions of urates.
                           Summary and Conclusions.
   There cannot, I think, be any doubt that the substance isolated
from the normal urine by the process here described is that to which
its colour is almost entirely, if not entirely, due, and, since solutions
of this substance do not fluoresce with zinc chloride and ammonia,
show no absorption bands, and cannot be got to show a urobilin band
by any process to which it was subjected, it follows that urobilin is
not the chief colouring matter of normal urine. Moreover, there is
every reason to believe that the product obtained has not undergone
any notable change in the process of extraction, although its solu
bility in various media appears to be somewhat impaired.
   The question whether the yellow colouring matter so obtained is a
definite chemical entity is one to which it is very difficult to give a
conclusive answer, chiefly on account of its physical properties.
However, the uniform course of events observed on each of the many
occasions on which the alcohol and ether process was carried out,
strongly suggested that the product was a definite compound.
   This view also received support from its behaviour towards its
solvents and its precipitation by ether, as well as by its effect upon
uric acid crystals, which is hardly what might be expected from a
mixture of pigmentary substances.
   The only fact with which I am acquainted which appears to be
opposed to this idea is the impossibility of completely decolorising its
solutions by certain metallic precipitants, which throw down the

great bulk of the pigment ; but, since we are ignorant of the form in
which the pigment exists in such precipitates, i.e., whether it is in
actual chemical combination with the precipitant, this objection
does not appear to be insuperable, especially as other pigments,
which are certainly definite compounds, appear to behave in a similar
way.
   There can, T think, be little doubt that the same substance formed
the basis of the products obtained by Thudichum, Tichborne, Schunck,
and myself, such differences as were observed being due to varying
degrees of purity, and probably to changes produced in the pigment
by the various methods of" extraction employed.
   The most important respects in which my product differed from
the urochrome of Thudichum were its behaviour with ether and when
heated with mineral acids.
   The fact that ether, when shaken with normal urine, does not
acquire any yellow tint suggests, but does not prove, that, in its
original condition, the yellow pigment is insoluble in ether, and at no
stage of my process is the product soluble in that medium.          Uro
chrome, on the other hand, is described by Thudichum as being more
readily soluble in ether than in alcohol. Again, a portion of Schunck's
product (urian) was also soluble in ether.
    I have myself found that the pigment obtained from urine by
saturation with baryta, precipitation with the acetates of lead, and
extraction of the precipitate with cold dilute sulphuric acid, followed
by immediate neutralisation with ammonia, is to some extent soluble
both in ether and in chloroform, and can only attribute this difference
to a change produced by the process of extraction employed.
   When acted upon by hydrochloric or sulphuric acid upon a water
bath, my product behaved more like those of Schunck than like
urochrome.     Tho chief difference from Thudichum's results was that
no portion of the residue was soluble in ether with a red colour.
I  should, however, mention that   I   have repeatedly obtained a sub
stance yielding a rich red ethereal solution, when the specimens
treated had not been freed from indoxyl sulphate, but never when
this impurity had been got rid of.
   To the difficult questions connected with the origin and formation,
in considerable quantities, of a pigment, such as is here described, the
source whence it is derived, and the manner in which it enters the
urine, of which it is a constant constituent, it  is, at present, impos
sible to venture even a hypothetical answer and we may well content
                                             ;
ourselves for some time to come with the attempt to establish upon     a
firm basis the contention that the yellow colour of urine is  not due to
any  of the band-yielding pigments, but to a distinct yellow colouring
matter, of negative spectroscopic properties, which may be judged
from its reactions to be a definite chemical entity.   For the designa

tion of this substance the name " Uroehrome," assigned to it by
Thudichum, appears eminently suitable.
    The only points hitherto brought out which afford any clue to the
chemical relationships of this pigment are the resemblance of the
products of its decomposition to the humous substances described by
Udranszky,* and the fact that it yields, when heated with nitric acid,
a colour reaction which is indistinguishable from the xanthoproteic
reaction, suggesting        a relationship      to the members of the aromatic
series.
    Udranszky classes Thudichum's uromelanine and the other pro
ducts of the decomposition of uroehrome as humous substances, and
suggests as a possibility that the conversion of carbohydrates into
such substances begins even within the body, and so may contribute
to the yellow coloration of urine.
    Certainly uromelanine has, as might be expected, certain obvious
resemblances to the products which Ijdranszky obtained by the
action of acids upon urine, and Thudichum long ago described how
it might be prepared directly from urine by similar means. On the
other hand, even if it be granted that the yellow pigment does yield
humous substances on decomposition, any argument based upon this
may well be regarded as open to the objection of explaining ignotum
per ignotius.

      II.  Elements which consist of a ganglion cell in the cord and a
              fibre which runs out at a lateral nerve root. Some, at least,
              of these elements, possibly all, are connected with muscles,
              and are motor elements.
    III.   Elements which consist of a cell lying outside the central
              ganglionic chain, and a fibre running from it to a ganglion.
              These must be regarded as sensory elements.
    I. Elements of the first group, co-ordinating elements, are of four
 kinds.
    A. Elements made up of a cell in the brain or one of the ganglia,
 and a fibre which runs posteriorly to the end of the cord, giving off
 collateral branches to the neuropile in each ganglion through which
 it passes.         For reasons to be explained, these elements must be
 regarded as placed temporarily in the groups of co-ordinating
 elements. It may be necessary to place them in a new group by
 themselves.
    Two kinds of A elements may be distinguished : —
    (a.) Those which decussate with the corresponding element of the
              opposite side.
    (6.)   Those     which pass down on the same side of the cord as that
               on which the cell lies.
    The elements A (a) inserted in the ganglion of Antenna                 II  and
 Thorax II (fig. I) may be taken as typical of the fibres which decus
sate.     The cell lies in the lateral mass of ganglion cells, and the fibre
gives off lateral branches to the neuropile before crossing to the other
side.      After the decussation has taken place the fibre turns back
wards, and runs down the ganglionic chain, giving off collateral
branches to the neuropile of each ganglion through which it passes.
The fibre A (a) Thorax II, together with a corresponding fibre in
Thorax I, have been traced as far as the last abdominal ganglion, but
no definite ending has been made out. A (a), Antenna II, was only
actually traced to Abdomen 5, but it showed no sign of ending in that
ganglion, and probably continues to Abdomen 6. It will be observed
that the decussation of A (a), Antenna II, takes place through the
transverse bridge, behind the oesophagus.               Similar elements have
stained     in  Thorax     III  and   Thorax    V.*
   The element A(a)Br (fig. 1) may be best considered here. It con
sists of a large cell on the ventral surface of the brain, from which a
moderately thick fibre runs at first forwards and upwards to the
dorsal surface. After turning outwards, the fibre runs backwards to
a point immediately in front of the oesophagus, where it passes across

VII  — XI form      the five posterior ganglia.

to the other side, and then runs down the cord. On entering' the
thoracic ganglia, the fibre becomes very broad, and maintains a
diameter many times that of any other fibre in the ganglionic cord.
A single pair of elements of this kind exists, and it is easy to trace
the fibres from the brain through the whole length of the ganglionic
cord to the 6th abdominal ganglion.             In the latter ganglion the fibre
divides into several branches, but            I have never obtained complete
staining   of   these.   The giant-fibres of the adult, with which these
agree, are stated by Retzius* to divide in the last abdominal ganglion,
and send branches through several of the nerve roots, which leav*1
that ganglion.
   In the brain this fibre gives off         a few branches to the nenropile
(fig. 1), but on its course down the cord, no collateral branches have
ever stained, and      I believe that none exist.      The giant fibres differ in
this respect from the other fibres of the class (A) which is now being
considered.
    Of the elements whose fibres do not decussate, A(fc)Br. (fig.                  I),
may be taken as a type. The element starts with a cell of moderate
size on the ventral surface of the brain, immediately anterior to the
large cell of the giant fibre (A(a)Br).           The fibre passes first forwards
and upwards, giving off numerous branches to the anterior lobes of
the brain on both sides, and then backwards through the brain, and
down the ganglionic cord of the same side to the last abdominal
ganglion.      It gives off collateral branches to the neuropile of the
ganglia through which it passes.
    Similar elements have stained in Thorax          III  and Thorax IV.
    B. Each element consists of a fibre starting from a cell in one of
the thoracic ganglia, and running forwards to the brain.               B Thorax V
and B Thorax VI (fig. 1) are types of elements of this kind.
    The cell of B Thorax V, lies in the lateral mass of ganglion
cells.    Soon after entering the neuropile the fibre gives off two
branches, one running forwards and breaking up in the hinder portion
of the ganglion immediately anterior, whilst the other runs back
wards and breaks up in that immediately posterior.                  The main fibre
turns inwards, crosses its fellow of the opposite side, and then bends
forwards, running close to the median ganglionic cells, until it enters
the brain.      In the brain the fibre continues to run forwards, giving
off many branches, and ends at about the level of the nauplius eye.
The fibre has not been observed to give off collateral branches during
its course through the thorax. Precisely similar elements occur in
Thorax VIII, and somewhat similar ones in Thorax II.
    In B., Thorax VI (fig. 1), the cell lies in the median mass of
ganglion cells, and the fibre, on its course towards the brain, runs

 along the outer border of the neuropile.       It ends in the brain, at a
 point nearly   as far  forwards  as the  termination  of B Thorax V, but
 somewhat lateral to it. In this fibre also no collaterals have been
 observed in ganglia other than that in which the element originates.
 A similar element occurs in Thorax I.
    C. Elements of this kind are inserted in ganglia Thorax VII — X
 in fig. 1. Each consists of a small cell in the anterior portion of the
 lateral mass of ganglion cells. The fibre, after taking a 2 -shaped
 course through the neuropile, to which it gives off numerous arbor
 escent branches, turns backwards, and after running between a fibre
 of Series D and the central mass of ganglion cells, ends in a tuft of
fine branches at the posterior end of the ganglion next behind that
in which the cell is situated.
    D. These elements appear to be intimately associated with those of
 Group C, and both groups generally stain in the same preparations.
    The cells of elements D lie in the posterior portion of the lateral
 ganglionic mass. The fibre of each element passes forwards and
 inwards through the neuropile, giving off numerous arborescent
 branches to the latter.     On entering the next ganglion in front, the
 fibre has reached the outer border of the median ganglionic mass, and
 after giving off a little tuft of branches in front of the tuft in which
one of the C elements ends, it pursues a direct anterior course, ending
in a tuft of branches in the ganglion next but one to that in which
 it started. This terminal tuft lies opposite the terminal tuft of one
 of the C elements, and behind the lateral tuft of the D element of the
 next ganglion.    The three tufts lie at exactly the same level in the
 cord, being all in the focus of the microscope at the same time.
    II. Elements consisting of a cell in the ganglionic cord, giving off a
 fibre, which, after sending arborescent branches to the neuropile,
 passes out from the cord by one of the nerve roots.        Many of these
 elements, not improbably all, are motor, and in some cases the fibre
 has been traced through its whole course from the cell, until it breaks
 up on the muscle. (Fig 1, E. Thorax XI.)
    Typical elements of this class are inserted in fig. 1 (Thorax   VII  —
 XI, E J). Each of these ganglia contains one or more elements of
        —
 the various kinds.    E and F have the cell situated in the lateral mass
 of ganglion cells, and the fibre passes out through the anterior root of
 the ganglion and goes to one of the limbs.       In G and H the cell lies
in the central mass, but the fibre passes through the same anterior root
as E and F to a limb. The element J, on the other hand, passes through
the posterior root and goes to the muscles of the body wall.      It arises
in a very small cell in the median mass, and the fibre runs for some
distance outwards.      It then tarns and takes a circular course through
 the neuropile, forming a complete loop, after which it passes outwards
and enters the posterior nerve root. From the anterior part of the

 inner side of the loop a straight arm passes inwards and meets a
 similar arm from the opposite side. A direct fusion of the two arms
 has, however, never been observed.
    III. Sensory elements, in which the cell lies outside the ganglionic
cord.
    These have been demonstrated by me up to the present only in the
abdomen of lobster embryos.              The cells are similar to those described
 by Lenhossek* and Retziusf in the earthworm, and by RetziusJ, in
polychaetes and molluscs.             They are spindle-shaped and lie in the
ectoderm (or immediately beneath it) of the dorsal surface of the
abdomen. The distal end of the spindle either runs out as a fine
fibre which ends freely, or the end of the fibre broadens out, forming
a T-shaped figure on the end of the spindle.                 The fibre arising from
the proximal end of the cell passes forwards and downwards to the
nerve cord, where, after entering one of the ganglia, it bifurcates,
giving rise to a Y-snaPe(i figure.               One of the branches runs for
wards, the other backwards along the ganglionic cord. They have
been seen to pass through two ganglia, but as to where they end I
am not at present in a position to make a definite statement.
                                       Theoretical.
    I  shall now endeavour to draw attention to some points of in
terest connected with the observations                  described above.           With
regard     to  the    elements  C  and   D,  it  might  be    maintained     that  they
represent a purely embryonic arrangement, which has not yet
reached the active state.           This, however, appears to me improbable
from the fact that the two systems remain in practically the same
state from very early embryos, in which the eye-pigment has just
begun to deposit, to the oldest larvre (about one week) which I have
been able to examine; and also from the fact that they take up
methylene blue in a way which, according to present experience, only
active nerve tissue does. Assuming then that the system is in the
active state, it is important to notice the position of the three tufts of
fibres, which stand opposite to each other, where elements C and U
end.     Although my observations agree entirely with those of Retzius,
Kiilliker, and the majority of recent investigators, in the fact that
direct anastomosis of the portion of the element which stains with
methylene blue has never been observed, it seems impossible to
understand the meaning cf this arrangement on any other supposi-

tion than that here the nervous stimulus passes from one element to
the other. It appears to me to be at least worth while to throw out
the suggestion that the nervous energy resembles a static electrical
charge, in the fact that the discharge takes place most readily through
points. Wherever nerve endings have been demonstrated, the break
ing up into finer and finer branches, which end freely, has been shown
to take place.
   On the view suggested, each nerve element resembles an electrical
condenser capable of charging itself, and being suddenly discharged
by an appropriate stimulus.     It is interesting to note what would
happen upon some such theory    as this, supposing one of the elements
D to be stimulated in any way. Imagine, for instance, the element
D Thorax IX to be caused to discharge, either by an impulse from a
sensory nerve, or from the brain.      The main discharge would, we
must suppose, pass into one of the motor elements such as E, by means
of the fine branches which both send to the neuropile, and the muscle
innervated by that particular fibre would be stimulated.     A portion
of the charge would, however, pass to the lateral and terminal tufts
of D Thorax IX, and we may suppose that in this way D Thorax                VIII
and D Thorax X are made to discharge, as well as C Thorax VI. If
we suppose the C elements to influence some other motor element in
the neuropile, say F, then it will be seen by following out the result
in the figure, that all the E and F elements upon one side of the
thorax would be stimulated by the single stimulus to D Thorax IX.
   With regard to elements of the class A, which start from a cell in
one of the anterior ganglia and send a fibre down the cord, the fact
that they give off collateral branches to the neuropile of each gan
glion would seem to indicate that they in some way control an
element, which also sends branches into that particular ganglion,
and the suggestion would be that by their means a series of elements
are stimulated all along the body by an impulse from the brain.     On
the other hand, by means of elements B, a particular ganglion would
be placed in direct communication with the brain. This communica
tion would be independent or correlated with a stimulus to (or from)
all the ganglia through which the fibre passes, according to whether
the absence of collaterals is the true condition of the element, or is
due merely to imperfect staining.
     A similar   consideration   will apply   to the   giant fibres (A (a) Br).
Ithas been already stated that no collaterals have ever been observed
on these fibres. According to Retzius branches go directly from their
ends to the nerves of the last abdominal        ganglion, and    it,   therefore,
seems probable that they serve the purpose of
                                            putting           some organ into
direct communication with the brain. The most obvious suggestion
would be that      by their means that the muscles of the tail-fin, the
                  it   is
steering apparatus of the animal, are controlled by the brain.             There

is,  of course, the possibility that the other fibres, which have been
followed all along the cord to the last abdominal ganglion, also send
branches through the nerve roots of this ganglion and serve a similar
purpose.     The presence of collateral branches upon them seems to
me to be opposed to this view. The problems, however, suggested by
the foregoing remarks can only be finally solved by means of physio
logical research.
    My observations were made in the laboratory of the Marine Bio
logical Association at Plymouth, with the assistance of a grant made
by the Government Grant Committee.          I hope shortly to publish a
more detailed account with fuller illustrations.
V. " The Refractive Character of the Eyes of Horses."                 By
       Veterinary-Captain      F.  Smith,   F.R.C.V.S.,   F.I.C., Arm'y
       Veterinary Department.          Communicated by Professor
       McKendrick, F.R.S. Received March 7, 1894.
    The eyes of the horse are of great physiological interest, for there
are certain features in connection with them not found in other
animals.
    While equine vision is principally monocular, it is quite undoubted
that the horse can see objects situated to the right and left of his
body at one and the same time ; it is also equally certain that by
directing both eyes forward, and producing a powerful internal
squint, vision may be rendered binocular for objects situated directly
to the front.
    The corresponding points in the retina of the human eye, do not
hold good in the case of animals which have their eyes situated
laterally in the head and at some distance apart.
    The pupil of the horse is a horizontal slit, which in full sunlight
becomes so contracted that, with the presence of the corpora nigra, it
is difficult to understand how sufficient light finds its way to the
retina.     A monocular retinal image in full sunlight must be a broken
or imperfect one, for, filling up the centre of the horizontal pupil, are
some large, black, soot-like bodies, the corpora nigra just referred to.
These are attached principally to the superior pupillary margin of
the iris, and completely block out the centre of the pupil when the
latter is closely contracted. The horse is, I believe, the only animal
possessing corpora nigra, and the function of these bodies is quite
obscure.
    It  is essential that the horizontal pupil should always be kept
horizontally placed, no matter what position the head may occupy ;
 every upward and downward movement of the head necessitates a
 rotation of the eyeballs to ensure the pupils remaining horizontal,

1894.]      The Refractive Character of the Eyes of Horses.               415
and this rotation is produced by the oblique muscles of the eye. As
the horse can move its head vertically through an angle of about 90°,
(the pupil all this time remaining horizontal) it can be seen how
important is the function of these oblique muscles.
   Though in direct sunlight the pupil closely contracts, yet in or-
dinary artificial light it dilates. This phenomenon can be turned to
practical advantage in an ophthalmoscopic examination.             Further,   I
have found that if daylight be thrown into the eye by means of a
mirror the iris does not, as a rule, contract ; this may bo proved by
placing a horse in a stable and excluding daylight from all but one
source, and utilising that source to illuminate the eye by means of a
mirror; a complete examination of the fundus can now be made,
owing to the dilatation or, at any rate, non-contraction of the pupil.
    For the last two years        I  have used no artificial light in my
ophthalmoscopic      work,   and  in  the enquiry I  am about to detail the
whole was carried out in broad daylight.            I have met with cases
where the pupil has contracted on throwing a beam of daylight into
the eye ; such do not amount to more than 6 per cent, or 8 per cent,
of the eyes examined.
    Horses no doubt possess the power of accommodation, but I have
never been able to satisfy myself that the instillation of atropine
paralyses this power as it does in man ; in fact, I think I can go so
far as to say that in many cases no action is produced by this drug
on the ciliary muscle, though the pupil be widely dilated.               In a
small proportion of cases      I  believe I have been able to observe some
 defect in accommodation under atropine.
    My attention to this point was especially directed by a remark
made by Messrs. Lang and Barrett* to the effect that a cat, the pupils
 of which they had thoroughly dilated with atropine, had no difficulty in
 pursuing and catching a mouse.          Though it is difficult to apply such
 a satisfactory test to the horse, yet I have adopted measures which
 should, undoubtedly, have demonstrated any paralysis of accommoda
 tion had such existed.
    The physiological pecularities of the horse's eye, which I have
 ventured briefly to draw attention to, induced me to examine the
 nature of the refraction, especially as a knowledge of it was calculated
 to be of practical importance and utility.
    Disorders   of vision are very common amongst horses           ; the most
 careful examination of such eyes often fails to reveal any pathological
 condition, but I think it will be possible to show that the nature of
 their refraction is calculated to throw light on an obscure condition.
    We must accept it as practically correct that disorders of vision in

  horses    commonly exhibit themselves by "shying," a vice which may
  be attended by considerable danger.               I  shall hope to show that there
  is now a reasonable prospect of determining the cause of "shying"
  in the absence of pathological changes in the eye ; farther, that in
  that important branch of the veterinary art— the examination of
  horses for soundness — it should be possible to detect the kind of eje
  against which an intending purchaser should obtain a special
  warranty ; and, lastly, as it is possible not only to determine the
  nature of the refraction, but also the amouut of error which exists,
  we shall be able — when the needful public prejudice is overcome —
  to prescribe glasseR for horses with every reasonable prospect of im
  proving their vision.
                              -
     This is not the first time the refraction of the horse's eye has been
  examined.        Professor Berlin, of Stuttgart, published two papers on
  the subject,* of these        I have only been able to consult the second
  one.    About the same time J. Hirschberg published his observations
  on the refraction of horses' eyes.f
     In this country Messrs. Lang and Barrett, to whose paper                      I  have
  already    alluded,    published   an   account   of   the  refraction   of the  eyes of
 animals, including the horse. It is from their paper that                     I obtained
 two of the above references.
     These observers obtained results which                 I  have not been able to
                  I
 verify, and think the reason of this admits of easy explanation : —
 In the case of Berlin the refraction was obtained by a direct
 examination of the fundus of the eye with the ophthalmoscope, a
 procedure the result of which appears to depend very largely on the
 refraction of the examiner, and his capacity for relaxing his accom
 modation.
     In Lung and Barrett's excellent work the refraction was measured
                    "
 by means of retinoscopy." They devoted their attention to the                        eyes
of mammalia generally, but the number of horses tested by them
was too small to admit of any general deductions being drawn.
     According to Berlin, the majority of horses are slightly hyper
metropic ; he only met with eight cases of myopia in as many years.
 The amount of hypermetropia, according to this observer, is small, as
a rule, lying between 1 D and 2 D.                   The largest amount found by
him was 2 25 D.

1894.]      The Refractive Character of the Eyes of Horses.                     417
    Of myopia, Berlin found in one case as much as 3 D, and in another,
275 D;
   Hirschberg, adopting the same method of enquiry as Berlin, viz.,
direct examination of the fundus with the ophthalmoscope, found a
considerable amount of astigmatism in the eyes of horses.
    Lang and Barrett, in the six eyes they examined, found one was
emmetropic, three hypermetropic and astigmatic, and two had slight
mixed astigmatism.          The astigmatism only once equalled 1 D, and
the horizontal was always the least curved meridian.
    In  the enquiry     I  am recording, the number of horses examined
was 54    ; these 54 horses, from one cause or another, furnished me
with 100    eyes.
   Of the   54 animals, 31 were mares and 23 were geldings ; their ages
varied from 4 years to 16 years ; the largest number of horses of one
age (5 years) was 13, 7 horses were 6 years old ; 7 horses 7 years ,
6 horses 8 years ; the remaining numbers for each age varied from
1  to 4.
    Before recording the results of this enquiry, I think it necessary to
describe the method by which retinoscopy is carried out on the
horse.
    It has been shown by Messrs. Morton and Barrett* that the results
of retinoscopy are liable to considerable error unless practised at the
right portion of the fundus.
    The observations made by these and other observerst are of the
greatest value, for they have drawn attention to the difference in the
reflex obtained in the human subject at the yellow spot and at the
optic disc, and have settled that retinoscopy is only reliable when
practised at the visual axis of the eye.
    In the horse I found very early in the enquiry, that confusing and
conflicting results might be obtained with the same eye when reti
noscopy was practised at different parte of the fundus, for the reflex
given at the optical axis was not the same as that obtained when the
fundus was looked at obliquely.             We have no knowledge whether
the optical axis and visual axis of the horse are identical — for the
purpose of this enquiry it has been assumed that they are.
    The horse has no yellow spot, so that a valuable guide is lost in
determining the position on the fundus at which to judge the reflex ;
on the other hand, the error of taking the reflex at the disc is not
likely to occur, owing to the difficulty of seeing the disc with the
head in the ordinary position.

418                   Veterinary-Captain F. Smith.                 [Apr.  26,
   The area of the most acute vision in the horse is probably             the
" tapetum," and that portion of the tapetum which lies in the optical
axis of the eye is the part where all the observations contained in
this paper have been made.
   The horse to be examined is brought into an ordinary stable, and
any windows likely to bo reflected in the cornea are covered up. The
observer stands facing the source of daylight, the eye to be examined
being in shadow ; standing opposite to the centre of the pupil (and
looking at it in such a direction that a line passing through the eye
would come out well below the base of the opposite ear), the light is
reflected on to the retina at a minimum distance of 4 feet. A brilliant
yellow reflex is obtained from the tapetum, by means of which we
can readily fix our position relative to the pupil.
   No means of restraint are employed, aud though for a minute or
two the horse works the eye under examination to and fro, thereby
alternately altering the reflex, yet it soon comes to a standstill as he
gets used to the reflection from the mirror.
   The observer, by practice, automatically regulates his position, so
as always to be opposite the centre of the longitudinal pupil, and to
ensure that during any change lie may make in his position he does
not come nearer to the eye than the prescribed distance, a 4-foot
gauge is lying on the floor at his feet, in the direction of the horse's
head.
   The reflex is taken in the horizontal and vertical meridians of the
eye ; it is very seldom that any difficulty is experienced in deter
mining the direction in which the shadow is travelling ; the real
difficulty is in determining between two opposito shadows given con
secutively in the same eye and in the same meridian.             1 think this
latter phenomenon is caused by        the horse using  its  ciliary muscle;
with patience the truo reflex of the resting eye will b8 obtained.
   Having determined the direction of the shadows in both meridians,
a trial lens is now placed in a frame and held in front of the eye
under examination.       The glass is brought quite close to the cornea,
the centre of the lens corresponding to the centre of the cornea; the
observer, standing at a minimum distance of 4 feet, throws the light
into the eye and determines the reflex through the lous.
   As we approach the lens which corrects the ametropia, some diffi
culty may be experienced in determining the direction taken by the
shadow;     sometimes it neither passes "with" nor "against" the
mirror, but dies away from the circumference, producing an appear
ance resembling a dissolving view.       In human practice this charac
teristic reflex, I believe, is considered to bo due to astigmatism.
   No part of the above examination is made under atropine ; as
previously explained, the pupil as a rule dilates sufficiently for a
complete examination of the fundus to be made, and, so far as

  1894.]     The Refractive Character        of the  Eyes of Horses.       419
 paralysis of accommodation is concerned, little, if any, is produced
 even by repeated    instillations of this drug.
    My results have been calculated according to the rule given by
 Morton : For hypermetropia deduct + 1 D from the weakest convex
 lens which causes the shadow to move with the mirror ; for myopia
 deduct + 1 D from the strongest concave lens with which the shadow
continues to move with the mirror.
    The following table (p. 420) exhibits the results of the enquiry.
    The table shows that of the 100 eyes examined —
                  51  were myopic and astigmatic.
                   2   ,,    hypermetropic and astigmatic.

    In the  eyes affected   with myopia and astigmatism, the horizontal
meridian was nearly always the meridian of least curvature.              Berlin
and Lang and Barrett had also observed the same fact. In my table
of the 51 eyes there were only nine exceptions to this rule.
    The amount of error which existed in each refraction was as

   The amount of error shown in these different refractions is small,
so much so  that many eyes might be regarded as emmetropic. In only
about 33 per cent, of the myopic eyes did the amount of error
exceed 1 D.

but we cannot agree with Hirschberg that the amount found is
" intense." Of 59 astigmatic eyes only in nine did the error exceed
ID.

 VI. " Correction of    an  Error of Observation in Part XIX of the
       Author's Memoirs on the Organisation of the Fossil Plants
       of the Coal Measures." By W. C. Williamson, LL.D..
      F.R.S. Received March 28, 1894.
   During the past two or three years we have acquired a much more
accurate knowledge than we previously possessed of the structure of
the leaves of the Lepidodendroid plants of the Coal Measures ; and
my last memoir, published in vol. 184 (1893) of the Philosophical
Transactions, contains some new and not unimportant details on this
subject.     These facts were obtained from some finely preserved
specimens of Lepidodendron Harcourti and of a Lepidophloios
recently added to my cabinet.
   But the value of these observations was seriously vitiated by an
apparently small but very fundamental error into which       I  had fallen,
an error which cannot be left uncorrected without misleading some
of the palaeontologists who honour me by consulting my writings on
these subjects.
    The students of fossil botany have long distinguished the leaves of
the Lepidodendron from those of the Genus Lepidophloios by the
shape of the leaf-scar left on the pulvinus or leaf-cushion on the fall
of the deciduous leaf.     These scars are always more or less quadri
lateral in form, two of their angles following in opposite directions
the long axis of the parent stem or branch, the other two pointing
transversely across that axis. In Lepidodendroid leaves there is
little difference in the lengths of these pairs of decussating angles,
but in Lepidophloios the two transverse ones aro much more pro
longed than the vertical ones are, making the transverse diameter of
the leaf-scar greatly exceed that in the opposite direction.
    Whilst attached to the stem or branch of a Lepidodendron these
 leaves always point upwards towards its apex ; and when       I  wrote the
 memoir referred to above,     I  had no reason for supposing that this
 was not also the case with the foliage of Lepidophloios, and my two

1894.]              Error in   the   Author   .1   Memoirs on Fossil Plants.             423
figures 33 and 34 were drawn in accordance with this belief ; but
during a visit recently paid to England by my old friend Professor
Graf Solms-Laubach, he informed me that such is not the case. As soon
as the leaves of Lomatophloios are developed, instead of ascending,
they bend downwards, overlapping and hiding the leaf-cushion from
view.         I
             found from Count Solms that Lomatophloios is much more
common in Germany than in England ; consequently our friends
across the water are more familiar with its aspect than we
Englishmen are. Nevertheless, when thus enlightened by my friend,
I  found fragments in my collection which made clear to mo that T
had fallen into an error.
    It follows from this fact that several of my figures in Part XIX
illustrating the structure of these leaves are simply turned upside
down, and require to be reversed.        This is the case with fig. 13 on
Plate 2, aud with figs. 33, 34, 36, and 37 on Plate 4. Thus drawn,
these figures misrepresent the relative positions of three important
internal structures, viz., the Leaf-trace, the bifurcating Parichnos,
and what has received the name of the Ligule.        Our attention was, I
believe, first called to this latter organ by the late Professor Sturr, of
Vienna, but it has subsequently been further commented on by
Professor Bertrand, of Lille, in conjunction with M. Hovelacque, of
Paris.      It is now clear that the Leaf-trace is the more central
 organ, having the so-called Ligule above and the double Parichnos
 below it. Apart from their inversion, my figures of these organs are
absolutely accurate. Pig. 13, in Plate 2, though belonging to a true
 Lepidodendron, represents the Parichnos g, as resting upon the Leaf-
trace c. In thus arranging these two organs in a Lepidodendron,                             I
was misled by the specimen represented in Plate 4, fig. 36. All
these errors, arising from a common misunderstanding, are now cor
rected.    Of course it follows that all such terms as upper and
lower, used in the text describing the above-named five figures, must
be severally reversed.
                                     I
   On p. 9 of my memoir criticised the application by MM. Bertrand
and Hovelacque of the name Ligule to the organ to which they had
assigned          it,
             because they thus identified the organ as being the homo-
logue of the appendage so named in the living Selaginellse. In the
latter case the Ligule springs from the upper surface of the leaf,
Whereas the mistaken impression under which        laboured, led me to
                                                             I
believe that in the fossil forms     sprang from the under side.
                                              it                    Of
course, any argument based upon the latter supposed fact now falls
to the ground.    At the same time, like Solms-Laubach, should be        I
cantions in accepting this supposed homology as proven.       Never
theless, some curious points of resemblance between the primaeval
and the recent types make this identity far from impossible.*

         by the Action of some Organic and Inorganic Compounds."
         By T. Lauder Brunton, M.D., F.R.S., and S. Delepine,
         M.B. Received March 14, 1894.
     We have, on a former occasion, given an account of the scope of tlie
  investigation, and of the methods used, of some preliminary observations*
 which we have found it necessary to make.
     Briefly speaking, our object was to ascertain the action of drugs on
 the cells of the liver and to connect, if possible, the changes in the
 cells with the physiological action of the drugs and their chemical
 structure.
     Certain drugs were selected by one of us (Brunton) as being
 most suitable for this investigation.             These drugs were the follow

    We have recorded the various appearances which we have observed                 as
the result of the purely physiological stimulation of the liver produced            by
the ingestion and digestion of a meal, and have noticed that                the most
important changes indicating various states of activity were : —
    1.   The size of the cells.
    2.   The distinctness of the mitoma and of the cellular cleavage.
spectingthe structures that distinguish Lepidodendron from Lepidophloios.       Some
trust to the several forms of the sections of the leaves, leaf-scars and         leaf"
cushions ; others to the upward or downward directions taken by the elongated
portions of the leaves. In fact the question demands a more critical and conclu
sive investigation than it has yet received. — Note, April 19, 189t.

    3. The size and arrangement of the meshes of the mitoma of the
cells.
    4. The size of the biliary canaliculi.
    5. The amount and distribution of the glycogen in the cells and in
the lobules of the organ.
    6. The amount and distribution of granules giving the reaction
characteristic of inorganic ferric salts.*
    We also recorded changes affecting other parts, but we need not
consider them for the present.
    We will now give an account of the appearances produced in the liver
soon after the administration of the compounds mentioned above, either
subcutaneously, by the rectum, or by the mouth (the latter in only two
cases)  : —
    1. To rabbits that had taken a moderate amount of food (50 grams
of carrots from 7 to 9 hrs. before death — in two cases only the time
was less than 7 hrs.) ;
    2. To rabbits that had not been fed for at least 24 hrs. before
death.
    To estimate the changes produced, the organs of animals to which
drugs had been administered were compared in each case with those
of animals in the same stage of digestion, but to which no drug had
been administered.             Thus, when we say that a drug causes an en
largement of the meshes of the mitoma, or renders them more distinct
or indistinct, or causes an accumulation of iron, we always mean that
the state in which the cells would have been at the same stage of digestion
has been modified in the direction indicated.
    As the measurements of cells and parts of cells necessitate the care
ful drawing of a large number of cells with the camera lucida, the
report, in its final shape, cannot yet be given, but, as all the appear
ances observed have been taken note of during the progress of the
investigation, we are in position to give an idea of the results which
 have so far been obtained, but which we are not yet able to express in
numbers, and compare as accurately as we hope to do when all our
measurements are completed.

                            Provisional  Conclusions.
    The effect which the administration of various drugs has on tho
 distinctness of the cellular mitoma and on the distribution or arrange
 ment of that mitoma and of the paramitoma, resembles, in the case
 of a certain number of drugs, that of pilocarpine, and in others that
of atropine.      The first drugs may be said to stimulate glandular
 activity, the latter to restrain it ; only a few of those experimented
 with seemed to have neither a stimulating nor a depressing action.
    On this basis we may subdivide the compounds studied into three
 groups.
    1.  Stimulating or excito-secretory group, with pilocarpine for a type.
    2.  Neutral group.
    3.  Depressing or depresso-secretory group, with atropine for type.
    1.  Excito-secretory group.
    Of the following compounds, those heading the following list pro
 duced the most marked changes in the mitoma of the cells : —
    Toluene, benzol, sodium iodide, pilocarpine, chrysophanic acid,
 ammonium chloride, toluylene diamine, nitric acid,
    (Aniline seemed in one case to have a stimulating effect, but this
was    doubtful.)
    2.  Neutral group.
    No drug was altogether neutral, but two drugs seemed to have
little depressing, and still less exciting, action, though they evidently
produced degenerative changes in the cells ; in the doses used, they
acted probably too powerfully as poisons.'                These compounds
were aniline and phenol.
    3. Depresso-secretory   group.
    The following compounds belong to this group : —
    Phenol, atropiue, ammonia.
   In   each of the two great groups      it is possible to recognise marked
differences based on the influence        which the drugs had (1) on the
storage    of glycogen ; (2)   on   the accumulation   of compounds giving
the reaction of inorganic ferric salts in the liver.

    A. — The following drugs       caused marked increase   of glycogen in the
liver : —
    Sodium     iodide, toluylene, diamine, chrysophanic acid (toluene ?)

    B. — The following gave rise to no marked increase of glycogen, and
sometimes even to a diminution : —

                           ** Ferrogenic Function.
    A. — The following drugs caused        a very marked  diminution     in  the
amount of free iron in the liver : —
    Sodium iodide, toluene, tolnylene diamine.
    B. — Tbe following caused' a diminution in the quantity of iron, but
not to the same extent as the first, and the iron was often so dis
tributed as to remind one of the appearances observed in an active
liver : —
    Chloride of ammonium, nitric acid, pilocarpine, benzol (in the fed
liver).
    C. — In one case only a doubtful increase of iron was found    : —
   Benzol (in the fasting liver).
    2. In the group of   depresso-secretory compounds.
    A. — Ammonia caused a diminution of the glycogen and an increase
of iron.
    By its influences on the accumulation of glycogen and of iron,
phenol acts distinctly in the same way as the depresso-secretory com
pounds ; thus it caused diminution in the glycogen and an increase
in the iron.
   Aniline caused little change in the glycogen, but a great accumula
tion of iron in one case.     The action of aniline evidently requires to
be studied more specially.
   B. — Atropine caused a slight    diminution in the glycogen       and little
change in the iron.
                       General Concluding Remarks.
    We are satisfied that much is to be learnod of the affinities of drugs and
of their physiological action by the methods which we have been using
in this study. The anticipation of unknown difficulties in a field
practically new has caused us to spend much time in observations
 which have not all proved of much use. We know now how to obtain
 those results which are most useful. We are repeating some of the
 experiments in order to test the value of our first results, and we are
 slowly repeating the measurements which have already taken such a
 considerable amount of time. It would be unwise in the present
 state of the inquiry to attempt to give more dogmatic conclusions than
 those we offer provisionally.

VIII.   " Note on the Production of Sounds by the Air-bladder of
      certain Siluroid Fishes." By Professors T. W. BRIDGE and
      A. C. Haddon. Communicated by Professor A. NEWTON,
      F.R.S. Received April 17, 1894.
   Dr. William Sorensen, of Copenhagen, has drawn our attention to
the fact that, in our memoir on " The Air-bladder and Weberian
                                                               '

                   last year (vol. 184, pp. 65 — 333), we failed to do justice

                      " Om
paper, entitled              Lydorganer hos Fiske : en physiologisk og
comparativ-anatomisk          Undersogelse," and published at Copenhagen
in 1884.    In    this  paper Dr. Sorensen treats of the various methods
of sound production in Fishes in general, and in the case of the
Siluroid Fishes, describes the production of sounds by means of
certain stridulating mechanisms (friction of the dorsal and pectoral
                  " elastic         "
spines), the                 spring apparatus, and the paired extrinsic
muscles of the air-bladder in the Pimelodince.           We do not here wish
to criticise his morphological conclusions, but to point out that, con
trary to the assumption on pp. 270 and 301 of our paper, Dr. Sorensen
did make some experiments on living Fish. After describing the
nature of the " elastic spring
                                     " and the
                                                 disposition of its muscles in
the South American Siluroid, Doras maculatus, on p. 88 of his paper,
 he says, concerning this Fish : —
    " Observations on the Production                  — When one opens the

abdomen of a recently caught fish and quickly extracts the intestines
with everything that is attached to them so that the swim-bladder is
exposed, one can very easily perceive that the swim-bladder is in a
convulsive vibratory motion at the same time that the sound is pro
duced. It is a very deep murmuring note, which is so strong that it
can be distinctly heard at a distance of 100 ft. when the animal is
out of the water.        Unlike the sounds produced by the movements of
 the pectoral fin, the tones produced by the swim-bladder are not
 grating, and therefore not disagreeable to the ear.                       I
                                                                 As far as am
able to judge, the swim-bladder commands only one note, but this
 can be stronger or weaker according to the will of the fish.            If one
moves the fingers backwards and forwards over the swim-bladder,
one will soon perceive that the vibrating motion, beginning at the
same time as the sound, is strongest in the front, especially at the
 " muscle-springs,"      and also that the muscles passing to these contract
 at the same time that the sound is produced.           If the muscles are cut
 through, the sound is no longer produced. If one makes a little hole
 in the swim-bladder, the sound will not be very much weaker ; but if

a larger opening    is made in    it,the sound -will considerably diminish
in strength. If one takes out the swim-bladder, the note will become
 very weak, but may still be heard          ;    then produced only by the
                                                 it   is
vibrations of the springs.    By ordinary observations         have not been
                                                                          I
able to prove that those bars or cross-walls (transverse septa) which
project into the lumen of the chief compartment of the swim-bladder,
or its external diverticula, assist in the production of sound but             ;     if
one compares this with what   I    state later on in Pseudaroides,    believe I
it would prove very doubtful, on account of their incomplete partition
walls, that the diverticula of the swim-bladder even to a great degree
serve to strengthen the sound by the air passing to and fro over
them.     By looking more particularly one will observe that the
anterior cutaneous plate at the side of the body also vibrates when
the sound     isproduced. I    suppose that the action of the ligament,
which connects     it with the circular plate of the muscular spring,
besides transferring the sound vibrations of the swim-bladder to the
water, consists in preventing    a too violent recoil of the spring when
the muscle    isrelaxed."
   After describing the air bladder, and the arrangement of its
paired extrinsic muscles in Platystoma orbignyanum, and Pseud
aroides clarias, Dr. Sorensen continues (p. 93) — " When the swim-
                                                                :
bladder  is laid open in the living animal,            very easy to perceive
                                                           it   is
that the contractions of the previously mentioned muscles [ex
trinsic muscles] occur at the same time as the production of a
strong, deep, murmuring sound, whilst the wall of the swim-bladder
is put into strong vibratory motion.       The majority of the specimens
I have examined of Pseudaroides had at the most               total length of
                                                                          a
25 — 35 cm.     The walls of the swim-bladder were, therefore, not so
thick, but
         I     was able to distinguish the internal transverse septa as
darker transverse lines   ;I    could therefore see very distinctly that
when the sounds were produced, the septa were in              state of rapid
                                                                          a
vibration forwards and backwards.         This     sufficient to prove that
                                                       is
they play a very important part in tending to increase the sounds by
the fact that the air vibrates over their free edges, from one chamber
to the other. If one makes        a   small hole in the swim-bladder of
Platystoma, the strength of the sounds will not be very much dimi
nished. If an even smaller incision        made the sound becomes fainter
                                            is
and fainter, and at length dies away, even though the muscles are
functional."
   ''
      So far as have been able to see, only one muscular contraction
              I
takes place, as in Doras, for every time sound          produced. This
                                                                     is

denly. About the nature of   the sound, the same can be said as    have        I
stated about Doras. The'sound        Platystoma produces can be heard
                                        a

   From these observations it is also clear that the sounds produced
by these fishes are not caused by the expulsion of air through the
ductus pneumaticus, as erroneously assumed by us on pp. 298 and
p. 301 of our memoir, but are caused by the vibration of the air
within the air-bladder, which is set in motion either by the " elastic
         "
spring apparatus, or by the extrinsic muscles.
   The investigations of Dr. Sorensen seem to show that, under
                                                "
certain conditions, the " elastic spring           mechanism, and the paired
extrinsic muscles of the Pimelodince, are structures subordinate to
sound production, and are not, as we suggested, related to any method
of adjustment to varying hydrostatic pressures. Had we appreciated
this fact earlier, we should have modified certain of the tentative
conclusions suggested on pp. 298 — 301 of our memoir. On the pre
sent occasion we wish to draw the attention of those interested in
the subject to Dr. Sorensen's researches, and at the same time to
express our regret at the injustice we have unintentionally done
him.                                      •

The Cboonian Lecture. — " La fine Structure des Centres
      Nerveux." By Santiago Ramun t Cajal, Professor oi
      Histology, University of Madrid.            Received  March 1,—
      Read March 8, 1894.*
   A l'invitation gracieuse    que m'ont faite les honorables membres
de cette   société  savante de venir dans cette séance rendre compte de
mes travaux      sur la structure des centres nerveux, mon premier
dessein, je ne le cacherai pas, a été de renoncer à un honneur que je
jugeais par trop disproportionné avec mes mérites ; mais je songeai
ensuite que votre bienveillance à m'écouter ne saurait être moindre
que la générosité de votre invitation, et je me suis résigné au rôle, pea
flatteur du reste, d'interrompre un moment l'harmonieux concert de
vos beaux travaux.      J'ai d'autant plus besoin de toute votre indul
gence que je vais vous entretenir d'un sujet qui vous est parfaitement
connu. Tout ce que je vais vous dire, des maîtres aussi éminents que
His, Kôlliker, Waldeyer, von Lenhossék, van Gehuchten, l'ont déjà
publié et résumé d'une manière presque irréprochable.             Je vais
essayer cependant    de  vous donner, moi  aussi,  un aperçu de la struc
ture du système nerveux central, et pour cela je m'inspirerai sur
tout, comme on m'en a prié, de mes propres recherches.
   Les centres nerveux des mammifères, spécialement ceux de l'homme,
représentent le véritable chef-d'œuvre de la nature, la machine la plus
subtilement compliquée que la vie puisse nous offrir.       En dépit de
cette complication, capable de décourager les esprits les plus hardis,
il n'a pourtant jamais manqué de patients anatomistes qui, utilisant
la technique de leur époque, ont tenté de débrouiller la trame déli
cate de l'axe encéphalo-spinal.    Ils étaient guidés, cela ne fait point
de doute, par l'espoir que la découverte de la clef structurale des
centres nerveux jetterait une vive lumière sur les importantes acti
vités de ces organes. Les premières données positives, quoique in
complètes, relatives à la fine anatomie des substances grise et blanche,
nous les devons à Ehrenberg, qui en 1833 découvrit les fibres ner
veuses, à Bémak, à Hannover, à Helmholtz, à Wagner, qui, à la même
époque, ou quelques années plus tard, trouvèrent les corpuscules
multipolaires    et crurent que ces expansions ramifiées des cellules
étaient en continuation avec les fibres nerveuses. En 1865 Deiters,
un des plus sagaces observateurs que l'anatomie ait jamais eus, nous fit
faire un grand pas dans la connaissance de la morphologie de la cellule
nerveuse ; il démontra que dans tonte cellule nerveuse il y avait
toujours des expansions de deux sortes, c'est-à-dire que, outre les
expansions ramifiées ou protoplasmiques, il s'en trouve une autre
non ramifiée, ou cylindre-axe, se continuant directement avec un tube

                  La   fine Structure des Centres Nerveux.              445
 nerveux.     Cette découverte importante était déjà préparée par les
 travaux de Wagner, qui en 1847 avait appelé l'attention des savants
 sur l'existence de deux sortes de prolongements dans les cellules de
 l'encéphale de la torpille, et par Rémak, qui en 1854 retrouva dans
 la moelle épinière du bœuf une disposition semblable.
    Les travaux de Gerlach étendirent encore les notions apportées
 par Deiters.     Ils servirent de fondement, ainsi que vous le savez,
 à une conception théorique de la structure de la substance grise
 qni a régné dans la science presque jusqu'à nos jours. Gerlach
 imaginait que les expansions nerveuses des cellules de la corne anté
 rieure de la moelle se continuent avec les racines motrices, tandis
 que les racines sensitives tirent leur origine d'un réseau nerveux inter
 stitiel formé par les anastomoses des expansions protoplasmiques.
    Je n'insisterai pas davantage sur cette conception, pas plus que sur
 les déductions physiologiques que l'on en a fait découler. Qu'il me suffise
 de vons dire que la théorie du réseau protoplasmique interstitiel
 est une hypothèse anatomique qui ne s'appuie sur aucun fait positif
 d'observation.     Il faut savoir en effet que les méthodes utilisées par
 Gerlach et ses successeurs pour établir la théorie du réseau inter
 stitiel — coupes fines en série, coloriées au carmin, à l'hématoxyline, à
 la nigrosine ou au chlorure d'or — sont absolument inaptes à faire
 résoudre un problème de cette difficulté, et ne permettent de
 découvrir dans la substance grise qu'un plexus pâle, très compliqué,
 dans lequel il serait téméraire de supposer un mode quelconque de
 terminaison des fibres.
    Quant aux méthodes plus modernes de Weigert-Pal, de Freud, et
aux méthodes basées sur les dégénerations secondaires, créées par
 Charcot, Gudden, Turk, Bouchard, elles ne peuvent que nous montrer
 le trajet des fibres à myéline et la situation des stations cellulaires
auxquelles elles sont reliées ; elles ne sont en aucune façon à même
do nous instruire sur le mode d'union des cellules et des fibres ou des
cellules entre elles.
    Sur ces entrefaites, un savant italien d'un grand mérite, bien
connu pour sa découverte des organes terminaux                    musculo-
tendineux et par la lumière qu'il a projetée dans la biologie du
'Plasmodium malariœ, Camillo Golgi, annonça dès 1875 une méthode
de    coloration qui permit de teindre et d'observer parfaitement les
plus fines expansions nerveuses, méthode qui faisait espérer une solu
tion prochaine et définitive du difficile problème des connexions
intercellulaires. Cette méthode, dans son essence, consiste à soumettre
à l'action du nitrate d'argent des morceaux de centres nerveux préa
lablement durcis dans le bichromate de potasse ou dans un mélange
de liquide de Mùller et d'acide osmique.          Sous l'influence du bain
d'argent ii se forme un précipité rouge, opaque, de chromate d'argent
qui se dépose exclusivement dans l'épaisseur de quelques cellules et

fibres.    Celles-ci ressortent alors d'une façon très nette et presque
schématique sur un fond jaunâtre transparent.               Grâce à cette
importante      innovation  dans  la technique microscopique M. Golgi
put mettre en évidence les faits suivants : —
    Primo, les expansions protoplasmiques des cellules nerveuses se
 terminent librement dans l'épaisseur de la substance grise.
    Secundo, les prolongements fonctionnels des corpuscules nerveux
 émettent pendant leur trajet à travers la substance grise des ramilles
collatérales très fines et ramifiées à plusieurs reprises.
    Troisièmement, en ce qui concerne la façon dont se comportent les
prolongements fonctionnels, on peut distinguer deux espèces de
 cellules : un type moteur caractérisé par la présence d'un cylindre
 axe qui ne perd pas son individualité et se continue avec une fibre de
 la substance blanche ; un type semitif, caractérisé par l'existence d'un
cylindre-axe qui, se divisant un très grand nombre de fois et presque
dès son origine dans la substance grise, voit son individualité dis
paraître sans qu'il soit sorti de la substance grise même.
    En quatrième lieu, il existe dans le sein de cette substance un
réseau de fibres formé par les ramifications et les anastomoses des trois
espèces de fibres nerveuses suivantes : les ramilles terminales des tubes
nerveux centripètes ou sensitifs, les branches de l'arborisation ter
minale des cylindres-axes des corpuscules du type sensitif et les
collatérales des expansions nerveuses des corpuscules du type moteur.
    Enfin M. Golgi crut pouvoir énoncer à l'aide de ses observations
que les prolongements protoplasmiques jouent un rôle de nutrition,
puisqu'ils se mettent de préférence en rapport avec les vaisseaux et
les cellules de la neuroglie.
   Les recherches que nous avons entreprises durant ces cinq dernières
années sur la structure de presque tous les centres nerveux, cervelet,
moelle épinière, cerveau, bulbe olfactif, ganglions sympathiques,
centres optiques, rétine, etc., si elles nous ont permis de confirmer en
grande partie les faits annoncés par Golgi, nous ont porté en même
temps à substituer aux trois hypothèses anatomo-physiologiques du
savant italien, l'existence d'un réseau nerveux interstitiel, distinction
des cellules en sensitives et motrices et rôle nutritif des prolongements
protoplasmiques, par les propositions suivantes que nous considérons
comme complètement démontrés.
   Les cylindres-axes, de même que les expansions protoplasmiques, se
terminent dans l'épaisseur de la substance grise par des ramilles par
faitement libres.
    Les prolongements protoplasmiques, ainsi que le corps des cellnles
nerveuses, peuvent servir à la conduction des courants nerveux.
    Les deux types physiologiques des cellules nerveuses admis par Golgi
n'ont précisément pas de réalité physiologique ou fonctionnelle. Leur
réalité morphologique est au contraire hors de doute. En effet, dans

               La fine   Structure   des   Centres Nerveux.           447
 la substance grise, à côté des éléments que nous avons nommés cellules
à cylindre-axe court et dont le prolongement cylindraxile se résout
en une arborisation terminale autour des corpuscules voisins, on en
rencontre d'autres que nous appelons cellules à cylindre-axe long,
 dont l'expansion fonctionnelle se continue avec une tibre de la sub
 stance blanche.    Or ces derniers, les corpuscules à cylindre-axe long,
 abondent dans des organes essentiellement, indubitablement sensitifs,
 comme la rétine, le bulbe olfactif; d'où la conclusion qu'ils ne
jouissent pas d'une manière nécessaire et exclusive d'un rôle moteur.
    La même circonstance et le même raisonnement s'appliquent aux
 corpuscules à cylindre-axe court; on ne peut réellement pas les con
 sidérer comme des cellules sensitives puisqu'ils se trouvent indis
tinctement dans tous les centres nerveux, tels que cerveau, cervelet,
 corps strié, rétine, bulbe olfactif, etc.
    Les connexions établies entre les fibres et les cellules nerveuses ont
 lieu au moyen de contacts, c'est-à-dire à l'aide d'une véritable articu
lation entre les arborisations variqueuses des cylindres-axes d'un
 côté, le corps et les prolongements protoplasmiques de l'autre. Aussi
 est-on amené à se représenter l'axe encéphalo-spinal comme un édifice
 composé d'unités nerveuses superposées, de neurones, suivant l'expres
sion de Waldeyer.
   Au point de vue morphologique nos recherches nous ont appris
d'autres faits de quelque importance.
   Les expansions fonctionnelles des cellules nerveuses peuvent se
diviser en  "J*
             à   leur arrivée dans la substance blanche, en produisant
ainsi   deux ou un plus grand nombre de tubes nerveux        myéline.
                                                              à
   Les tubes nerveux de la substance blanche du cerveau, comme ceux
de la substance blanche de la moelle épinière, du bulbe olfactif, de la
corne d'Ammon, les fibres du cordon du grand sympathique, etc.,
émettent   à  angle droit des ramilles collatérales destinées     se rami
                                                                  à
fier et se terminer
       à               librement dans  l'épaisseur  de la substance   grise
immédiate.      Ces collatérales, que Golgi avait déjà mentionnées
sommairement dans la moelle épinière, constituent une grande
partie des commissures des organes nerveux centraux, commissure
antérieure et postérieure de la moelle, corps calleux, commissure de
la corne d'Ammon, etc., et presque la totalité du plexus serré des
fibrilles qui entourent les corpuscules nerveux.
   Reste enfin  à  examiner la question       capitale de la terminaison
                                             si
des cylindres-axes dans la substance grise.      Déjà, depuis 1886, MM.
His et  Forel, soutiennent, à l'encontre des auteurs anciens, de Gerlach,
et de Golgi lui-même, que les cylindres-axes se terminent dans cette
substance non en formant des réseaux, mais uniquement par des
extrémités libres.
   Voici, brièvement rapportées, les raisons que M. His, dans un travail
                                               "
récent, allégea contre la théorie des réseaux.   L'embryologie démontre

448                   Prof. Santiago Ramôn y Cajal.
que les fibres nerveuses représentent la continuation des expansions
 des neuroblastes, chaque fibre doit, donc, pendant une longue
période de son développement, avancer librement.            On ne voit pas
pourquoi cette disposition     se modifierait ultérieurement.    Nous con
naissons, en outre et depuis longtemps, une série de terminaisons
nerveuses tout à fait libres ; aussi celles des muscles, de la cornée, de
la peau, des corpuscules de Pacini, etc., qui se font tantôt par nne
extrémité arrondie et épaisse, tantôt par une arborisation nerveuse
complètement libre.       Il nous semble donc peu raisonnable d'admettre
une distinction fondamentale entre les terminaisons périphériques et
les terminaisons centrales."
    Pour Forel, sa négation des réseaux se base sur ce qu'il n'est
jamais parvenu à reconnaître des anastomoses de fibrilles nerveuses
dans les coupes de substance grise imprégnées par la méthode de
Golgi.
    Ce sont là des arguments      de haute portée en faveur de l'indépen
 dance   absolue   des corpuscules nerveux ; et pourtant la plupart des
neurologistes resta fidèle à la vieille doctrine.         C'est que, pour
trancher définitivement cette question il fallait en effet ne pas se
 contenter d'arguments négatifs ou de raisonnements par analogie; il
fallait faire la preuve certaine, absolue, irréfutable des dernières rami
fications des cylindres-axes et de leurs collatérales dans la substance
grise et résoudre, du même coup, le problème des connexions intercel
lulaires.    C'est là l'œuvre que nous croyons avoir accomplie en
employant sur les parties nerveuses en voie d'évolution, ou très proches
de leur développement complet, la méthode de Golgi quelque pen
modifiée. Dans une série de travaux ayant pour objet la moelle, le
cervelet, le cerveau, la rétine, le grand sympathique, etc., nous somme*
 arrivé à démontrer, sans laisser prise au moindre doute, les arborisa
 tions nerveuses terminales qui siègent autour des cellules de ces organes;
 et les recherches ultérieures       de Kôlliker, van Gehuchten, His,
 Waldeyer, Edinger, von Lenhossék, A. Sala, P. Ramon, G. Retains,
 etc., n'ont fait que confirmer l'existence de cette disposition terminale,
 tout en ajoutant d'importantes découvertes.       C'est à Retzius surtont
 que nous sommes redevables des preuves les plus convaincantes, car
 il a réussi à démontrer la terminaison libre des arborisations nerveuses,
 non seulement dans l'axe cérébro-spinal des vertébrés, mais encore
 dans les ganglions des invertébrés, crustacés, vers, etc., où il s'est
 servi de la méthode d'Ehrlich au bleu de méthylène, dont les révéla
 tions coïncident complètement avec celles de la méthode de Golgi.
    Les principes généraux de la morphologie et. des connexions des
 neurones étant ainsi exposés, nous allons maintenant passer succincte
  ment en revue les diverses modalités de rapports ou d'articulation
  que présentent les éléments de quelques centres nerveux.
     Voyons tout d'abord les racines sensitives et la moelle épinière.

                  La fine   Structure des Centres Nerveux.               449
   Les recherches de Ranvier, de Retzius, de von Lenhossék nous ont
appris que les cellules des ganglions rachidiens possèdent une seule
expansion divisée en deux branches : Vune externe, généralement plus
épaisse, qui se dirige vers la périphérie pour se terminer dans la peau ou
dans un corpuscule sensitif ; Vautre interne, qui pénètre dans la racine
sensitive ou postérieure pour se rendre à la moelle épinière.           Cette
dernière branche, d'après nos observations chez les oiseaux et chez
les mammifères, ne pénètre pas directement dans la substance grise,
mais se bifurque dans l'épaisseur du cordon postérieur, de façon à
donner une branche ascendante et une branche descendante (fig. 1).
Cette bifurcation à la forme d'un        Y  e* les fibres qui en résultent se
portent  le long  du  cordon   postérieur pendant un trajet indéterminable,
mais qu'on peut évaluer à plusieurs centimètres ; leur terminaison a
lieu dans le sein de la substance grise, au moyen d'arborisations vari
queuses et péricollulaires.
   Mais outre ces arborisations terminales, dont l'imprégnation est
souvent difficile, les fibres radiculaires sensitives possèdent un nombre
infini de ramilles collatérales, partant à angle droit, soit de la tige,
soit des branches ascendantes et descendantes, grâce auxquelles elles
se mettent en rapport de contignité avec les cellules de la substance
grise.   Dans ces collatérales on peut en distinguer de longues, ou
destinées à la corne antérieure, et de courtes, ou destinées à la corne
postérieure.
   Les collatérales    courtes traversent, réunies en faisceaux méridiens,
la substance de Rolando, et se résolvent en arborisations variqueuses
fort compliquées qui entourent les cellules 'de la colonne        de Clarke,
ainsi que celles dont le siège est dans la tête de la corne postérieure.
   Les collatérales longues constituent un faisceaux antéro-postérieur
fort épais qui, traversant la corne postérieure,        se dissémine dans le
sein de la corne antérieure (fig. 2).       Ces collatérales fournissent un
grand nombre de ramifications, dont la plupart se terminent eu se
mettant en contact avec le corps ou les expansions protoplasmiques
des cellules motrices. Étant donné que les longues collatérales repré
sentent le seul moyen de communication entre les racines sensitives
et les cellules de la corne antérieure, il faut les considérer comme la
voie ordinaire des reflexes.       C'est pourquoi on appelle actuellement
ces collatérales fibres reflexo-motrices,     à l'exemple de Kôlliker, ou
fibres sensitico-motrices, nom que je leur ai attribué.     D'après quelques
recherches que nous avons entreprises très récemment chez l'embryon
dn poulet, les collatérales longues partent non de tout le trajet verti
cal des branches ascendante et descendante, mais, de préférence, de
la portion voisine de la bifurcation. Sur le reste de leur parcours les
branches de bifurcation donnent surtout naissance aux collatérales
courtes.
   Toutes les fibres de la racine postérieure ne se bifurquent pas dans

c'est-à-dire dont le prolongement cylindraxile contribue à former la
commissure antérieure en se rendant au cordon antéro-latéral de
l'autre côté      ; secundo, les cellules    des cordons,  ou dont le cylindre-axe     se

continue, soit par simple inflexion à angle droit,' soit au moyen d'une
bifurcation en    "J"avec une fibre de la substance blanche du. même
côté (cordon antérieur, latéral et postérieur)       ;    tertio, les cellules
radiculaires ou motrices, dont l'expansion fonctionnelle constitue les'
racines antérieures; quarto, les cellules pluricordonales, ou   à    cylindre-
axe complexe, dont l'expansion nerveuse, d'abord simple, fournit denx,
trois ou un plus grand nombre de tubes pour les cordons d'un côté ou
les cordons des deux côtés.
   Le temps nous manquerait, certainement, pour étudier la marche
probable de l'excitation sensitive       travers les cylindres-axes de tous
                                         à
ces éléments aussi nous bornerons-nous
              ;                              à    la suivre dans deux voies
dont l'interprétation nous semble la plus facile         ;   ce sont la voie
reflexo-motrice et la voie cérébelleuse.
   Amenée par les radiculaires postérieures, l'impression sensitive se
divise au niveau des bifurcations de ces dernières en deux courants,
ascendant et descendant. Si l'excitation est de faible intensité, elle
peut dériver par les collatérales longues ou reflexo-motrices, qui nais
sent, comme nous venons de l'exposer, de la première portion du trajet
des branches ascendante et descendante, ainsi que de la tige d'origine,
et être transmise ensuite aux cellules motrices d'un segment limité
de la corne antérieure      mais
                             ;      l'excitation est plus forte, outre les
                                    si
voies reflexo-motrices, elle suivra la totalité des branches ascendante
et descendante, et tout      système des collatérales courtes sera par la
                             le
suite influencé.     Le mouvement parviendra de cette manière           la
                                                                        à
colonne de Clarke, région où se terminent plusieurs collatérales
courtes, et, par l'intermédiaire des cylindres-axes des cellules siégeant
dans cette colonne,     ilgagnera la voie cérébelleuse ascendante de la
moelle.                                  *
   Ajoutons encore que les collatérales courtes, ainsi que les arborisa
tions terminales des branches ascendante et descendante des radicul
aires sensitives, se mettent en rapport avec les cellules commissurales
de la corne postérieure, dont les cylindres-axes vont soit au cordon
antéro-latéral du côté opposé, soit au faisceau fondamental du cordon
latéral du même côté, constituant là des voies courtes, en grande partie
ascendantes,    destinées   vraisemblablement    à   porter l'ébranlement
sensitif aux cellules motrices de segments           plus éloignés de la
moelle.
  La propagation         de l'impression sensitive jusqu'au cerveau exige
encore l'admission de certains neurones intermédiaires que l'on appelle
cellules sensitives centrales.   Ces cellules siégeraient dans toutes les
régions  de  la  moelle et du  bulbe  où se terminent des fibres radicul
aires sensitives leurs cylindres-axes auraient un cours ascendant, et
                  ;
s'achèveraient, après avoir croisé la ligne médiane, dans l'écorce
cérébrale de l'autre côté.      L'entrecroisement se ferait surtout    àla
partie inférieure de la moelle allongée, au niveau du ruban de Beil.

 Mais, d'après van Gehuchten, il aurait lieu aussi tout le long de          la
 moelle épinière, an niveau de la commissure antérieure.
    Du reste, l'existence des cellules sensitives centrales est encore fort
 énigmatique.     Dans la moelle épinière, outre la voie cérébelleuse, on
 ne peut distinguer, à l'aide des méthodes anatomiques, une voie
 ascendante spéciale destinée à recueillir les excitations sensitives
 apportées par les fibres radiculaires postérieures.     Il  y a cependant
 deux faits qui militent en faveur de l'existence d'une voie sensitive
 centrale; d'abord l'absence d'entrecroisement des fibres radiculaires
 sensitives et ensuite la circonstance que la plupart de ces dernières
 représentent des voies courtes, se terminant dans les divers segments
 de la moelle épinière.
    Etudions ensemble les connexions des fibres nerveuses olfactives (fig. 3).
    Nos recherches concordant avec celles d'Arstein, Grassi et Castro-
 nuovo, van Gehuchten, Brunn, nous montrent les cellules nerveuses
 bipolaires de la muqueuse olfactive émettant par leur extrémité pro
 fonde une fibrille variqueuse, ou prolongement cylindraxile, qui se
 continue avec un filament des nerfs olfactifs.      Durant leur passage à
 travers le tissu conjonctif sous-épithélial ces filaments ne donnent pas
 de ramifications et conservent leur individualité ; à leur arrivée au
 bulbe olfactif ils pénètrent dans l'épaisseur des glomérules, où ils se
terminent au moyen d'une arborisation courte, variqueuse et parfaite
ment libre.
    Les couches constitutives du bulbe olfactif sont : la zone des fibres
 nerveuses olfactives, la zone des glomérules, la zone des cellules à
 panache protoplasmique et la zone des grains et des fibres nerveuses
 profondes.
    La couche des cellules à panache est une des plus intéressantes,
 parce qu'elle renferme les éléments destinés à recueillir l'excitation
olfactive.    Ces éléments, qui varient dans leur forme et leur siège
mais non dans leurs traits essentiels, se distinguent en ce qu'ils
 possèdent un cylindre-axe long qui se rend à la racine externe du
bulbe olfactif, en ce qu'ils offrent des expansions protoplasmiques
latérales s'étalant dans une couche d'aspect moléculaire, et, finalement,
en ce qu'ils présentent un ou deux prolongements protoplasmiques
périphériques épais, qui se terminent dans l'épaisseur des glomérules
au moyen d'un élégant panache de ramilles courtes et fort variqueuses.
Les glomérules eux-mêmes ne sont que le résultat de la juxtaposition
et de l'entrelacement de deux espèces de fibres terminales : les ramilles
variqueuses des fibres olfactives et les branches relativement robustes
du panache protoplasmique que nous venons de mentionner. Entre
ces deux espèces de ramifications il n'existe nulle anastomose, mais
bien un contact très intime.      Jamais on ne voit pénétrer dans les
glomérules venant du bulbe olfactif d'autres fibres que les tiges à
panache ; on peut aussi affirmer que jamais aucune ramification des

fibres olfactives n'émerge du glomérule.          Une pareille disposition
nous donne donc à considérer deux faits dont l'importance n'échappera
à personne.      D'abord les expansions protoplasmiques ont un rôle
conducteur, car elles constituent des anneaux de la chaîne des neurones
olfactifs ; ensuite, la transmission s'opère par des contacts entre les
ramifications nerveuses et les arborisations protoplasmiques.
    Pour abréger, indiquons rapidement le chemin suivi par l'excita
tion olfactive. Elle traverse successivement les cellules bipolaires
de la muqueuse, les cylindres-axes de celle-ci constituant les fibres
du nerf olfactif ; les cellules à panache du bulbe, les cylindres-axes
de ces dernières se réunissant pour former la racine externe du bulbe ;
elle aboutit finalement aux corpuscules pyramidaux de l'écorce céré
brale frontale et sphénoïdale où les cylindres-axes des cellules initiales
envoient leurs arborisations libres.
    A propos de la terminaison des fibres de la racine externe nous
devons fixer l'attention sur un fait de qnelque intérêt.           Ces fibres,
d'après   les résultats   de  mes  recherches  et  de  celles de  M. Calleja,
fournissent exclusivement leurs arborisations terminales, ainsi qu'un
grand nombre de ramifications collatérales, à la première couche céré
brale ou zone moléculaire, de sorte que l'excitation olfactive est reçue
seulement par le panache périphérique de la tige des pyramides.
Nous reviendrons bientôt sur ce fait, qu'on peut observer aussi dans
le lobe optique des oiseaux, au niveau des terminaisons des fibres
optiques ; cela semble indiquer que la zone moléculaire est l'endroit
où s'établit la transformation du courant sensitif conscient qui y arrive
en impulsion motrice volontaire qui en part.
    Les connexions des fibres visuelles et des cellules de la rétine (fig. 4)
vont à leur tour nous apprendre une série de faits d'une haute signifi
cation.
    On peut, malgré sa complication, considérer la rétine comme un
ganglion nerveux formé par trois rangées de neurones ou de corpus
cules nerveux ; la première rangée renferme les cônes et les bâtonnets
avec leurs prolongements descendants formant la couche des grains
externes ; la seconde est constituée par les cellules bipolaires, et la
troisième est dne à la réunion des corpuscules ganglionnaires.            Ces
trois séries d'éléments s'articulent au niveau des couches dites
moléculaires ou réticulaires et internes.
    La couche moléculaire externe de la rétine renferme une articulation
multiple dont les éléments sont : en dehors, les sphérules terminales
de la fibre des bâtonnets et les pieds coniques munis d'excroissances
filamenteuses latérales, des fibres des cônes ; en dedans, les panaches
externes ou prolongements périphériques des cellules bipolaires, dont
il existe deux espèces : les bipolaires à panache aplati, ou destineés
aux cônes, et les bipolaires à panache ascendant, ou destinées aux
bâtonnets   ; les ramilles protoplasmiques et les arborisations nerveuses

                  La fine Structure des Centres Nerveux.                 457
 de certaines cellules horizontales constituant les cellules étoilées ou
sous-réticulaires de quelques auteurs.
   La couche moléculaire interne renferme une articulation encore plus
 compliquée, que l'on pourrait décomposer en trois ou un plus grand
 nombre d'étages.       Les facteurs principaux sont représentés, en
 dehors, par les panaches terminaux variqueux du prolongement
 descendant des bipolaires        et les ramifications     terminales des
 spongioblastes ;    en dedans,  par   les  arborisations  protoplastniques
aplaties des cellules de la couche ganglionnaire.
    Abstraction faite de certains elements dont le rôle est encore très
 obscur, comme les spongioblastes et les cellules horizontales, voici les
 neurones qui participent à la transmission visuelle : les cônes et les
bâtonnets, les cellules bipolaires, les cellules ganglionnaires et les fibres
 du nerf optique, les cellules; fusiformes et pyramidales des corps
genouillés et des tubercules quadrijnmeaux.
    Chez les oiseaux, où nous avons réussi à colorer très complètement
les éléments du lobe optique, on reconnaît que les fibres optiques
entourent d'abord cet organe, et qu'elles se terminent au moyen
d'arborisations fort variqueuses, très riches et complètement libres.
Ces ramifications, qui siègent dans les couches les plus périphériques
du lobe optique, se mettent en contact avec les expansions proto
plastniques externes de certaines cellules fusiformes dont les cylindres-
axes pénètrent plus profondément.          Chaque arborisation optique se
met en relations avec un groupe de cellules ; de cette façon l'excita
tion apportée par une fibre se dissémine dans l'épaisseur de la
substance     grise, le nombre des cellules et des cylindres-axes qui
interviennent dans la conduction croissant à mesure que s'avance
l'excitation visuelle.
    Le nerf optique possède encore des fibres centrifuges qui se ter
minent par des arborisations libres très variqueuses autour des corps
des spongioblastes de la rétine, auxquels elles apportent une excitation
nerveuse d'origine centrale et dont la signification est actuellement
indéterminée.
    L'examen très succinct et par cela même aride que nous venons de
faire de la marche des excitations sensitivo-sensoriellos dans la rétine,
le bulbe olfactif et la moelle, prouve non seulement que lus expansions
protoplasmiques remplissent un rôle conducteur, mais encore que le
mouvement nerveux est dans ces expansions cellulipète, tandis qu'il
est cellnlifuge dans les cylindres-axes.     En d'autres termes, la cellule
nerveuse présente un appareil de réception des courants figuré par les
 expansions dendritiques et le corps cellulaire, un appareil de trans
mission représenté par le prolongement cylindraxile, et un appareil
 de répartition ou de distribution représenté par l'arborisation nerveuse
 terminale.     Dans tous les organes où le sens des courants est
 suffisamment connu, comme la moelle, la voie pyramidale du cerveau,

  458                  Prof. Santiago Ramdn y Uajal.
  le ganglion spiral da limaçon, les cellules sensitives cutanées des vers,
  d'après Lenhossék, cette orientation dynamique est aisée à vérifier.
      Il est encore une autre induction qu'il nous semble légitime de tirer
  des faits que nous venons d'énumérer, c'est la diffusion croissante des
  courants à fur et à mesure qu'ils atteignent des organes plus centraux.
  Par exemple : l'excitation olfactive amenée aux glomérules par les
  fibres olfactives est conduite au cerveau par l'intermédiaire de quelques
  cellules à panache — vous vous rappelez que l'on rencontre dans les
  glomérules un faisceau de fibres olfactives et un groupe de tiges de
  cellules à panache — et ce fait se répète dans la zone molécnlaire du
  cerveau, où chaque fibre de la racine externe du nerf olfactif se met
 en contact, à l'aide de ramifications collatérales et terminales, avec
  une quantité considérable de panaches périphériques de pyramides.
 On peut en dire autant des excitations visuelles et des excitations
 sensitives de la moelle.
     Voyons maintenant quels sont les neurones et les connexions de ces
 neurones dans une lamelle de cervelet (fig. 5). Une section transversale,
 par exemple, nous montrera trois couches concentriques de neurones.
     La première, ou zone moléculaire, est formée principalement par les
 petites cellules étoilées superficielles.   La seconde, ou intermédiaire,
 est constituée par les corps des cellules de Purkinje.        La troisième
 résulte de l'agglomération des grains.
     Tous ces éléments offrent deux espèces de rapports : des rapporte
 intrinsèques, c'est-à-dire établis entre les cellules des trois couches ;
 des connexions extrinsèques, c'est-à-dire ayant lieu entre les neurones
 du cervelet et des neurones appartenant à d'autres organes nerveux.
     Examinons successivement les connexions intrinsèques et ex
 trinsèques.      D'abord les connexions des cellules de Purkinje avec les
 petits    éléments   étoilés de la couche moléculaire.       Les rapports
 établis entre ces deux ordres de cellules constituent l'exemple le plus
 classique d'arborisations nerveuses péricellulaires, et le fait le plus
 éloquent de transmission par contact, par contiguïté, de l'action
nerveuse.
     Les petits éléments étoilés de la couche moléculaire sont aplatis
 dans le même sens que les cellules de Purkinje ; ils possèdent une
ramification      protoplasmique    divergente, qui ne dépasse jamais
l'épaisseur de la couche où ils sont renfermés, et un cylindre-ase
horizontal dont le trajet est perpendiculaire à l'axe longitudinal des
lamelles cérébelleuses. Ce prolongement cylindraxile émet plusieurs
collatérales descendantes, et, après un parcours variable, décrit une
courbe pour venir s'achever au niveau des corps de3 cellules de

 nexion n'est pas individuelle ; elle est collective; c'est-à-dire que choque
 plexus péricellnlaire renferme des ramifications provenant de plusi
 eurs cellules étoilées.
    Voyons   à présent    les  rapports    entre  les   grains et les cellules de
Purkinje. Les grains du cervelet sont de petits éléments nerveux
 dont l'agglomération constitue presque exclusivement la couche
granuleuse. Ils possèdent trois ou quatre appendices protoplasmiques
très courts, ornés à leur extrémité d'une arborisation digitiforme, et
un cylindre-axe d'une finesse extraordinaire.            Celui-ci monte jusqu'à
la zone moléculaire et s'y bifurque à différentes hauteurs, produisant
ainsi une fibrille longitudinale qui parcourt parallèlement toute la
lamelle cérébelleuse. Ces intéressantes fibrilles, que nous avons
appelées parallèles, parce qu'elles sont disposées parallèlement à la
direction des lamelles du cervelet, se mettent en contact très intime,
durant leur trajet, avec les contours épineux des branches protoplas
miques des cellules de Purkinje.            Comme chaque fibrille parallèle
parcourt la longuenr totale do la circonvolution cérébelleuse, et s'y
termine par des extrémités libres et arrondies, il s'en suit qu'un seul
grain peut agir sur une multitude de corpuscules de Purkinje.                     Il
est aussi très probable que chacun de ces derniers est soumis à l'in
fluence d'un nombre considérable de grains.
   Les rapports extrinsèques, ou entre        les cellules   du  cervelet et celles
d'autres  centres nerveux, ont été et sont encoro           des plus   difficiles à
établir.   Ainsi   que Golgi    le  démontra      le premier,     les cellules   de
Purkinje donnent naissance à des prolongements nerveux du type
long dont la terminaison est ignorée, et, inversement, dans la sub
stance grise du cervelet se terminent des cylindres-axes venant
d'autres organes dont la situation est encore très problématique.                Ce
sont les fibres moussues et les fibres grimpantes.
   Les fibres moussues sont de gros tubes médullaires qui se ramifient
et se terminent dans la couche des grains, où ils se mettent en contact
avec les expansions protoplasmiques de ces petits éléments au moyen
de certaines excroissances ou efflorescences collatérales. Les dernières
ramilles finissent par une varicosité ou une petite ramification en
forme de rosace.
   Les fibres grimpantes traversent la couche des grains, longent le
corps des cellules de Purkinje et enveloppent la tige ascendante et
les branches protoplasmiques          principales      de ces éléments d'une
magnifique arborisation     terminale    allongée,    tout  à fait comparable à
celle des fibres motrices sur les faisceaux musculaires.
   11 résulte de ce que nous venons d'exposer que les grains et les
cellules de Purkinje peuvent recevoir des actions nerveuses d'antres
centres au moyen soit des fibres moussues, soit des fibres grimpantes ;
              '
tandis que les petites cellules étoilées de la couche moléculaire,
ainsi que les gros éléments étoiles de la zone des grains appartenant

    an second type des cellules    de Golgi, semblent n'avoir aucune rela
   tion avec les fibres extrinsèques.    C'est ce qui nous a déterminé à
   qualifier ces deux dernières espèces de cellules de corpuscules d'associa
   tion, car elles paraissent avoir pour rôle exclusif d'associer les
   éléments de Purkinje, on les grains, en un ensemble dynamique dont
   la signification est actuellement indéchiffrable.
      Le dernier sujet que nous avons intentionnellement laissé pour la
  fin de cette conférence, à cause de son importance primordiale et des
  déductions psycho-physiologiques        qu'on en peut tirer, a trait aux
  connexions de Vécorce cérébrale (fig. 6).    Pour que vous vous repré
  sentiez d'une façon plus claire cette écorce cérébrale, nous la décom
  poserons schématiquement en trois couches fondamentales qui vont de
  la périphérie au centre : une couche moléculaire, une couche des
  grandes et des petites cellules pyramidales, enfin une couche des
  corpuscules polymorphes.
      La couche moléculaire, qui ne fait jamais défaut dans le cerveau des
 vertébrés, est formé par un plexus fort compliqué dont les facteurs
 principaux sont les panaches périphériques des cellules pyramidales, qne
 pour abréger nous appellerons pyramides, les arborisations nerveuses
 terminales de certaines cellules de la couche des pyramides dont le
 cylindre-axe est ascendant, les ramifications de certains corpuscules
 autochtones. Ces derniers éléments, qui siègent dans l'épaisseur même
 de la zone moléculaire, affectent une forme fuselée ou triangulaire et
 la plupart de leurs expansions devenant horizontales se résolvent
 en une quantité considérable de ramilles d'apparence nerveuse.           On
 pourrait comparer ces éléments aux spongioblastes de la rétine et
 aux grains du bulbe olfactif parce qu'ils manquent aussi de différencia
 tion en expansions protoplasmiques et nerveuses.
     La amclie des pyramides, la pins épaisse de l'écorce, renferme de
nombreuses rangées de cellules longues de forme pyramidale, dont
le volume s'accroît à mesure qu'on s'éloigne de la périphérie.           Les
principales propriétés de ces éléments sont de posséder une tige pro-
toplasmique        radiale terminée dans la couche moléculaire par un
panache de fibres plus ou moins horizontales et hérissées d'appendices
épineux, d'émettre diverses expansions protoplasmiques latérales et
descendantes, ramifiées à plusieurs reprises ; et finalement de donner
naissance à un cylindre-axe descendant, continué dans la substance
blanche, soit par un tube de projection, soit par une fibre d'associa
tion, soit encore par une fibre calleuse ou commissurale trans
versale.
     La dernière couche, ou des cellules polymorphes, renferme des corpus
cules de forme variée, généralement allongée, parfois triangulaire
ou fusiforme, mais dont un des prolongements se dirige très souvent
vers la surface cérébrale.         Du reste, cette expansion externe ou
radiale ne se résout pas en panache comme la tige des cellules pyra-

  midales et n'atteint pas la couche moléculaire.       Quant au cylindre-
 axe,  il pénètre dans la substance blanche, où il se comporte comme
 celui des cellules pyramidales.
    À leur passage dans la substance grise tous les cylindres-axes des
 pyramides et des corpuscules polymorphes émettent un grand nombre
 de collatérales ramifiées, qui se terminent librement autour             des
 cellules nerveuses, ainsi que nous l'avons reconnu chez les petits
 mammifères nouveaux-nés.           L'ensemble des ramifications des col
 latérales engendre dans la substance grise et autour des cellules un
 plexus d'une complication extrême. Ce plexus reçoit encore des rami
 fications des ramilles collatérales venant des tubes de la substance
blanche et des arborisations terminales des fibres calleuses et d'asso
ciation.
    Vous devinez à cette complexité inextricable      de l'écorco cérébrale
quelle obscurité enveloppe encore notre connaissance de ses con
nexions inter-cellulaires.      La diffusion considérable des arborisations
nerveuses terminales, le manque de séparation précise des rapports
nerveux correspondant à chaque couche cellulaire, telles sont les
causes de toutes les difficultés.     Nous serons donc très sobres sur ce
point, et nous nous bornerons seulement à indiquer les connexions
qui semblent les mieux déterminées ou les plus probables.
    Les connexions des cellules pyramidales de l'écorce peuvent être
distinguées en superficielles, ou de la couche moléculaire, et en profondes,
ou des couches sons-jacentes.
    Au niveau de la zone moléculaire chaqne panache protoplasmique
des pyramides entre en contact avec un nombre presque infini de
fibrilles nerveuses terminales. Ces fibrilles appartiennent aux caté
gories suivantes : aux arborisations terminales des fibres d'association,
c'est-à-dire des fibres dont les cellules d'origine siègent dans l'écorce
soit dn même hémisphère, soit de l'hémisphère opposé ; aux arborisa
tions nerveuses provenant des cellules spéciales placées dans les
couches sous-jacentes, éléments dits à cylindre-axe ascendant, qu'ont
décrits Martinotti, Retzius et celui qui a l'honneur de vous parler ;
aux arborisations terminales de certains corpuscules spéciaux siégeant
dans la première couche cérébrale elle-même ; aux ramifications termi
nales de fibrilles collatérales provenant de la substance blanche, ou
des couches profondes de la snbstance grise, et encore à bien d'autres
arborisations terminales, dont l'énumération nous entraînerait trop
loin.
    On voit donc qn'au niveau de cette couche moléculaire            chaque
pyramide peut     être  influencée non-seulement par   les cellules habitant
la même région de l'écorce ; cellules à cylindre-axe ascendant,
collatérales    ascendantes, etc.,      mais aussi par celles qui rési
dent dans d'autres lobes, soit du même côté, soit du côté
opposé.     Il est aussi probable, comme nous l'avons exposé il y a

 464                  Prof. Santiago Ramon y Cajal.
 quelques instants, lorsque nous avons étudié les rapports des fibres
nerveuses olfactives, que la première couche cérébrale reçoit les
dernières ramifications des fibres sensitives et sensorielles.        De la
 sorte, le panache périphérique des pyramides serait le point où com
mencerait l'excitation motrice volontaire ; de là elle se communiquerait
 au corps cellulaire pyramidal et aux fibres de projection constitu
tives de la voie pyramidale.
   On peut admettre, en outre, que lorsqu'on excite électriquement
l'écorce cérébrale d'an animal, des contractions musculaires se pro
duisent, parce que le stimulus agit soit sur le panache des pyramides,
soit sur les fibres nerveuses de la couche moléculaire, dont le rôle, à
mon avis, serait d'apporter les courants aux panaches.
   Quant aux connexions profondes, c'est-à-dire à celles qui ont lieu
dans l'épaisseur même de la couche des pyramides et des cellules
polymorphes, elles semblent avoir pour objet de rendre solidaires les
éléments d'une rangée avec ceux des rangées sous-jacentes.               Les
facteurs de cette articulation nerveuse sont d'un côté le corps, la tige
radiale et les branches basilaires des pyramides d'une série inférieure,
et de l'autre, les collatérales nerveuses innombrables émanées des
cylindres-axes des pyramides d'une série supérieure.        Chacune de ces
collatérales, grâce à ses nombreuses ramifications et à son étendue
considérable, peut toucher et influencer des centaines de pyramides
sous-jacentes.
   Nous ne voulons pas prolonger davantage cette fastidieuse exposi
tion des connexions inter-cellulaires de l'écorce cérébrale et nous
allons terminer cette causerie par quelques considérations générales
qui découlent de l'ensemble de nos recherches sur les centres nerveux.
   D'une manière synthétique on peut dire que tout centre nerveux
résulte de l'association des quatre parties suivantes : les cellules
nerveuses à cylindre-axe court, c'est-à-dire ramifiées dans l'épaisseur
même de la substance grise ; les fibres nerveuses terminales arrivées
d'autres centres ou de régions distantes du même centre ; les cellules
nerveuses à cylindre-axe long, c'est-à-dire prolongé jusqu'à la' sub
stance blanche ; les collatérales qui naissent soit du trajet à travers
la substance grise des prolongements cylindraxiles des cellules à
expansion nerveuse longue, soit du cours des tubes de la substance
blanche.     Dans certains organes, tels que la rétine, le bulbe olfactif
et la première couche cérébrale, il faut ajouter un cinquième facteur
de structure ; ce sont les éléments caractérisés par l'absence de diffé
renciations en expansions nerveuses et protoplasmiqueB.           Cela vous
rappelle   les grains  du  cervelet, les spongioblastes de la rétine  et les
cellules spéciales de l'écorce cérébrale.
   Toute fibre nerveuse est la continuation de l'expansion fonctionnelle
d'une cellule nerveuse. Cette loi se réalise aussi dans les ganglions
du grand sympathique dont les éléments, d'après nos observations

                  La fine  Structure des Centres Nerveux.              465
 confirmées par Retains, van Gehnchten, L. Sala 'et von Lenhossék,
 offrent deux sortes de prolongements:         des appendices ramifiés ou
 protoplasmiqnes qui se terminent librement dans le ganglion même,
 et un prolongement cylindraxile qui se continue avec une fibre
 de Rémak.
     Les cellules nerveuses constituent       des  unités, les neurones de
 Waldeyer, dont les rapports réciproques consistent en véritables
 articulations.   Les facteurs de chaque contact sont, d'une part, le corps
 et les expansions protoplasmiques des cellules, et, d'autre part, les
 arborisations terminales des fibres nerveuses.
     Dans les organes où l'origine de l'excitation est bien établie on
 reconnaît que les cellule» sont polarisées, c'est-à-dire que le courant
 nerveux pénètre toujours par l'appareil protoplasmique ou le corps
 cellulaire, et qu'il sort par le cylindre-axe qui le transmet à un nouvel
 appareil protoplasmique.
     La différenciation compliquée de l'appareil protoplasmique — ex
  pansions basilaires, tige protoplasmique radiale, panache terminal,
 etc. — que nous présentent les pyramides du cerveau, et en partie aussi
 les corpuscules de Purkinje du cervelet, paraît avoir pour but de per
  mettre que chacune des cellules de cette espèce puisse établir des
  contacts distincts avec diverses catégories de fibres nerveuses.
     Les éléments qui, comme les spongioblastes de la rétine ou les cor
  puscules des ganglions spinaux, manquent d'appareil protoplasmique
  se mettent en relation avec une seule espèce de fibres nerveuses.
  Dans ces éléments l'appareil de réception est représenté par le corps
  protoplasmique seul.
     On peut affirmer que plus sont nombreuses, ramifiées et diffé
  renciées les expansions protoplasmiques         d'un élément, plus est
  grande la quantité de cellules dont il subit l'influence. De même, plus
  le prolongement      nervoux d'une cellule acquiert d'étendue et de
  ramilles collatérales et terminales, plus est considérable le nombre des
  corpuscules auxquels il pourra adresser ses courants. A ce double point
  de vue — différenciation et abondance des expansions protoplasmiques,
  quantité énorme des ramilles nerveuses collatérales et terminales —
  aucun élément nerveux ne semble approcher, même de loin, de la
  pyramide cérébrale des mammifères.
     Le résultat de nos recherches comparatives sur les propriétés de la
  pyramide cérébrale c'est que plus on descend dans l'échelle des
  vertébrés moins l'appareil protoplasmique apparaît différencié et moins
  sont nombreuses, longues et ramifiées les collatérales des cylindres-
  axes.   Ainsi, chez les oiseaux la pyramide manque de tige radiale et
"
  de véritable panache externe ; chez les reptiles la tige et le panache
  périphérique existent, mais les expansions basilaires et latérales sont
   encore absentes ou réduites seulement à un ou deux prolongements
  descendants; chez les poissons la cellule pyramidale fait défaut.

466                   Prof. Santiago Ramon y Cajal.
Une pareille gradation peut s'observer aussi dans les diverses classes
de vertébrés relativement au nombre et aux ramifications des collaté
rales nerveuses.
    D'ailleurs il n'est pas nécessaire de quitter la classe des mammifères
pour observer des différences, parfois très considérables, relativement
à la richesse des expansions protoplasmiques              et des collatérales
nerveuses des pyramides.          Ainsi, tandis que chez la souris les pro
longements basilaires       sont  courts et peu ramifiés, chez l'homme ik
deviennent très nombreux, longs et très ramifiés;                 en outre, les
collatérales nerveuses de la souris, ainsi que celles du rat, du lapin etc.,
se dichotomisent seulement une ou deux fois, tandis que chez l'homme
ces mêmes collatérales, beaucoup plus nombreuses, se divisent quatre
ou cinq fois en constituant des ramilles si longues qu'on ne pent les
obtenir entières sur une seule coupe.
    D'autre part, nos recherches sur le développement des cellules
nerveuses embryonnaires ou nenroblastes de His nous ont montré
qu'à fur et à mesure que l'écorce cérébrale s'accroît les expansions
protoplasmiques et les collatérales des cylindres-axes des pyramides
deviennent plus longues et plus divisées. D'abord, le prolongement
cylindraxile de ces dernières manque de ramifications et se termine
au moyen d'un renflement épineux que nous avons appelé cone
d'accroissement ; pnis, du trajet du cylindre-axe poussent des ramilles
collatérales courtes semblables à des épines, qui, en s'accroissant et en
se divisant successivement, établissent des contacts avec un nombre
chaque fois plus considérable de cellules nerveuses.            Chez les fœtus
à terme,   ainsi  que  cbez  les  enfants   de quelques   mois, les expansions
protoplasmiques basilaires et les collatérales nerveuses sont encore
très courtes et simples, et il est très probable que ce processus d'étire-
ment des prolongements cellulaires se continue jusqu'à l'âge adulte.
    Les faits d'observation que nous venons d'exposer sommairement,
et qui sont d'une portée si considérable en soi, nous ont suggéré une
hypothèse susceptible de faire comprendre mieux que toutes les
autres, soit l'intelligence acquise à la suite d'nne éducation mentale
bien dirigée, soit l'intelligence          héréditaire, soit les adaptations
cérébrales professionnelles,     soit encore la création de certaines aptitudes
artistique*.
    La gymnastique cérébrale n'est pas susceptible d'améliorer l'organi
sation du cerveau en augmentant le nombre de cellules, car, on le sait,
 les éléments nerveux ont perdu depuis l'époque embryonnaire la
 propriété de proliférer ; mais on peut adméttre comme une chose
 très vraisemblable que l'exercice mental suscite dans les régions
 cérébrales plus sollicitées un plus grand développment de l'appareil
 protoplasmique et du système des collatérales nerveuses. De la sorte,
 des associations déjà créées entre certains groupes de cellules se ren
 forceraient notablement au moyen de la multiplication des ramilles

 veuses  ;  mais, en outre, des connexions interoellulaires tout à fait
 nouvelles pourraient s'établir' ,grâce> ^ la liéoférmation de collatérales
 et d'expansions protoplasmiques.
    Une objection se présente immédiatement à vos esprits : Comment,
 direz-vous, le volume du cerveau peut-il se maintenir invariable s'il
 y a multiplication et même néoformation de ramuscules terminaux
 d'appendices protoplasmiques et de collatérales nerveuses ?
    Pour répondre à cette objection rien ne nous empêche d'admettre
 ou une diminution corrélative des corps cellulaires ou un tassement
 proportionnel des régions du cerveau dont les fonctions ne se rappor
 tent pas directement à l'exercice de l'intelligence.
    On expliquerait encore le talent de famille par la transmission
 héréditaire aux descendants immédiats ou éloignés (par atavisme) de
cette organisation supérieure des connexions des cellules pyramidales.
    Bien d'autres déductions sont permises ; ainsi, chez les hommes
 dont le talent, comme l'exemple nous en est fourni par Gambetta,
coïncide avec un cerveau de petites dimensions, les cellules nerveuses
 seraient ou moins nombreuses, ou peut-être simplement plus petites,
mais en revanche elles présenteraient un système fort compliqué
d'associations protoplasmico-nerveuses.           Au contraire, les cerveaux
excessivement       volumineux,   si souvent   associés à une intelligence in
 férieure et même à l'imbécillité, renfermeraient un plus grand nombre
de cellules, mais alors les connexions de celles-ci seraient très impar
faites.    C'est peut-être ce qui a lieu pour les gros cerveaux de la
 baleine et de l'éléphant.
    Cette hypothèse anatomo-physiologique             n'est pas originale en
 principe,   car il ne manque pas     de physiologistes et de psychologues
qui aient cherché la caractéristique somatique de l'intelligence dans
 la richesse des associations cellulaires, mais elle a ceci de nouveau,
qu'elle se base sur des faits positifs de structure et non sur de pures
 suppositions concernant l'agencement et les rapports des corpuscules
nerveux.
    Vis à vis de la théorie des réseaux celle des arborisations       libres des
expansions cellulaires susceptibles de s'accroître apparaît non seule
ment comme plus probable, mais aussi comme                      plus encoura
geante.     Un    réseau  continu    pré-établi — sorte   de  grillage de fils
télégraphiques       où ne peuvent se créer ni de nouvelles stations
ni de nouvelles lignes — est quelque chose de rigide, d'immuable,
d'immodifiable, qui heurte le sentiment que nous avons tous que
l'organe de la pensée est, dans certaines limites, malléable et sus
ceptible de perfection, surtout durant l'époque de son développe
ment, au moyen d'une gymnastique mentale bien dirigée.               Si nous ne
craignions pas d'abnser des comparaisons, nous défendrions notre con
ception en disant que l'écorce cérébrale est pareille à un jardin peuplé

d'arbres innombrables, les cellules pyramidales, qui, grâce à une culture
intelligente, peuvent multiplier leurs branches, enfoncer plus loin
leurs racines, et produire des fleurs et des fruits chaque fois plus variés
et exquis.
   Du reste nous sommes très loin de croire que l'hypothèse que nous
venons d'esquisser puisse à elle seule expliquer les grandes différences
quantitatives et qualitatives que présente le travail cérébral chez les
divers animaux et dans la même espèce animale. La morphologie
de la cellule pyramidale n'est qu'une des conditions anatomiques de
la pensée.    Or cette morphologie spéciale ne suffira jamais à nous
expliquer les énormes différences qui existent au point de vue fonc
tionnel entre la cellule pyramidale d'un lapin et celle d'un homme,
ainsi qu'entre la cellule pyramidale de l'écorce cérébrale et le cor
puscule étoilé de la moelle ou du grand sympathique.         Aussi à notre
avis est-il très probable qu'en outre de la complexité de leurs
rapports les cellules pyramidales possèdent encore une structure
intraprotoplasmique toute spéciale, et même perfectionnée dans les
intelligences d'élite, structure qui n'existerait pas dans les corpuscules

" On Rocks and Minerals collected by Mr. W. M. Conway in
    the Karakoram Himalayas." By Professor T. G. Bonney,
    D.Sc, F.R.S., and Miss C. A. Raisin, B.Sc. Received
    February 15,— Read April 19, 1894.
  During his journey in the Karakoram Himalayas,                     Mr. W. M.
Conway collected more than 300 specimens of rocks and minerals,
which, however, were generally rather small. These were sent to
us for examination at University College, London.    Thin slices have
been prepared of the specimens which promised to be the more
interesting. Of the rest, the mineral composition was verified in cases
of doubt by examining pulverised fragments under the microscope.
   Since the detailed results of our examination, which practically
form an annotated catalogue of the specimens, will be printed as an
appendix to Mr. Conway's forthcoming volume,* we restrict ourselves
in this paper to a summary of our work, and to a notice of a few
specimens which appear to be of more than local interest.
                             (1.) General Description.
   Commencing with the crystalline rocks, and with the most basic of
these, we find one specimen of a dark green serpentine, containing

published (' Climbing and Exploration in the Karakoram-Himalayas    '),which gires

  small glittering crystals of bastite, brought from debris at foot of a
  slope at the village of Mapnun on the Burzil Pass. The rock has
  been evidently affected by pressure, and is practically identical with
  a type of serpentine rather common in the Alps.
      Many varieties of diorite have been collected.          Of these, some are
  almost hornblendites (see below), others are normal diorites varying
  from coarse to fine grained, others, again, are really hornblende-
  schists.    In some of the last it is likely that the foliation (as we
  believe to be generally the case with the hornblende-schists of the
  Lizard and of Sark)* is the result of fluxional movements anterior to
  consolidation, while in others this structure is more probably due to
  pressure, and to consequent mineral changes subsequent to the first
  solidification of the rock.
      Granites are rather numerous.         Some are of a normal type, mode
  rately coarse grained, the mica (variable in quantity) beiDg generally
  biotite.    Certain of these are slightly gneissoid in structure.             More
  definitely foliated, almost certainly as a result of pressure, are some
  rather micaceous (biotite) granites.            Yet more distinctly gneissic
  rocks occur, with a mineral banding as well as a foliation, in which
  pressure modification is generally to be noted. One group of these has
  a rather markedly different character; they are fine grained gneisses,
  modified by pressure (to which, however, the texture does not appear
  to be due), not rich in quartz, consisting mainly of felspar (orthoclase
  or microcline and plagioclase) and biotite, with a more or less defi
  nitely banded structure.        They present a considerable resemblance to
  certain rocks found in the district about Blair Athol (Scotland),
  which Dr. H. Hicks, in consequence of their rather peculiar aspect,
  has named the " pepper and salt gneisses.
                                           "               We find also a coarse
  granite, rather porphyritic in structure, and rendered gneissoid by
  pressure, which contains large red impure garnets, up to about                 f in.
  in diameter. Similar garnets, but of smaller size, also occur in
   several varieties of granite and gneiss ; one of these might almost be
   called a kinzigite, others are granulites (leptynites).
       The compact acid igneous rocks are not numerous ; but a rather
   remarkable series from the neighbourhood of the Golden Throne
   calls for a little notice.      Some come from the moraine proceeding
  from the west foot of the mountain.            These are compact, but show a
   schistose structure with slightly micaceous or talcose aspect, indica
   tive of crushing.       They are parti -coloured ; a grey, varying from
   slightly to markedly greenish, being streaked, spotted, and blotched
   with a dull Indian red, small white specks showing in some of the
   patches. The texture of the lighter part under the microscope is

speckled, or somewhat fibrous, with indications of minute aggregate
polarisation, this being most conspicuous when it makes an angle
of 45° with the vibration planes of the crossed nicols. The fibrous
mineral very closely resembles the so-called sericite of some porphy-
roids. Here and there are grains of quartz, decomposed and some
times broken felspar crystals, and some dark reddish, flaky patches.
The dark microscopic spots contain corroded grains of quartz, decom
posed or partly corroded felspar crystals, and the same dark red
flaky minerals in a crypto- to micro-crystalline                 matrix.      In one
rounded lump, at first sight very like a pebble, some grains of
crystalline calcite are enclosed. The smaller patches, though varying
in detail, present a general resemblance, and there can be little doubt
that they are fragments of a devitrified acid igneous rock.                    In the
absence of definite      characters,   it is difficult  to speak positively as to
the nature of the matrix, but most probably it was once a volcanic
glass, which has since undergone micro-mineralogical change, mainly
in consequence of pressure.*
   Though the red patches occasionally look very like pebbles, it is
more probable that they are due to a flow brecciation.                    If we are
right   in our   inferences,  these rocks    of  the  Golden Throne indicate an
outpouring of acid lavas prior to the mountain making.                          Other
specimens from the same district are generally similar to the above-
described, but present varietal differences, and a small specimen of an
Indian red colour from debris on the Baltoro glacier is very probably
a tuff, though the amount of crushing makes it difficult to be sure.
   The crystalline schists include epidote-, Piedmontite-, and various
mica-schists.       The first of these very probably occurs as a band in a
hornblende-schist, and a rock very similar to it may be found at
more than one locality on the Lizard peninsula, in Cornwall. The
second schist will be described more fully below. The third group
contains several varieties, one of which will receive a separate notice.
Of the rest, it may suffice to say that with one exception they are
ordinary types ; this, however, though a well known one, has suffi
cient interest to warrant a slightly fuller description.                  The rock,
which comes from the Hunza Valley, between Gulmet and Tashot,t
is a dark lead-coloured schist containing garnets. The latter, on
microscopic examination, are found to be a pale reddish colour, some
times fairly regular in outer form, cracked, granular in structure,
and often containing a fair amount of dusky enclosures. These have
a somewhat dendritic grouping ; the angles which the tufts make
one with another are such as to suggest relations with the process

of crystal     building.      Also tubes or fibrous cracks are present,
arranged generally at right angles to the faces of the garnet.
Rather irregular crystalline grains of yellowish staurolite with
many enclosures occur; also irregular grains of magnetite, and
nnmerous little patchy flakes of brown mica.               These are all set in a
crystalline matrix, consisting of white mica and (apparently) granular
quartz, with usually a considerable quantity of opacite (probably
graphite), a few small tourmalines (strongly dichroic, changing from
a light to a brownish or dull greenish tint), and some small rutiles.
A similar schist comes from near Askole, and one without garnets,
but in other respects like these, from the south flank of Crystal Peak.
The chief interest of these garnet-bearing mica schists is their very
close resemblance to schists in the Lepontine Alps,* as described by
one of us, where the rock is a local variety of a dark micaceous
schist, and it occurs, to his knowledge, at intervals for a distance of
over 30 miles in a straight line along the chain.
    With the mica schists we may mention, under the general name of
sericite schists, several very much crushed rocks from Kamar nala,
Mir, and the Dar Valley, Bagrot, and then pass on to a group of
more or less calcareous schists, such as are developed in the Alps,
and are there associated with quartz schists, green schists, and the
aforesaid black garnet schists.         In that chain they not unfrequently
pass into crystalline limestones or dolomites, and rocks of this cha
racter also occur in Mr. Conway's collection.                One or two contain
malacolite, and some show distinct signs of having been affected by
pressure. f
    Passing on to the ordinary sedimentary rocks, we find a number of
limestones, more or less impure, some containing fragments of other
rocks, with schistose calcareous grits, besides argillites and slates,
 one or two of the latter resembling the slates of Llanberis (North
 Wales). A few of the specimens contain much crystalline material,
so that it is difficult to decide whether they are very crushed dark
 schists, or slightly altered slates largely composed of detrital crystal
 line material. Rocks may be found in the Alps which present similar
 difficulties.
    Sandstones, grits, and conglomerates occur ; some of the gritty
 rocks show a cleavage, and certain near the Golden Throne probably
 contain volcanic materials.          A conglomerate from Mapnun, in the
 Burzil Valley, contains a fragment of a quartz diorite, which obviously
 had been already modified by pressure when it was made into a pebble,
 indicating that in this mountain region, as in the Alps, earth move-

 ments must have occurred long anterior to those which have pro
 duced the existing chain. Lastly, two partially altered sedimentary
 rocks are of some interest.       The first, from a fallen fragment half
 way between Samaiyar village and Strawberry Camp, on the left
 bank of the valley, is a blackish, compact, slightly-cleaved rock, not
 distinctly crystalline, in which are scattered several crystalline
 grains, the largest slightly more than one-eighth of an inch in
 diameter. This has one fairly well-marked cleavage, with a sab-
 vitreous, slightly oily lustre, and a second more imperfect, meeting it
at an obtuse angle. The hardness seems to be slightly less than 5.
 Under the microscope the ground-mass is seen to consist of minute
 films of a sericitic mica mixed with a minute colourless mineral and
granules of opacite and ferrite.        In this are scattered larger irregular
 grains and plates of a black       mineral,    with raggedly outlined flakes
of biotite, containing much of the ground-mass, some prisms (prob
ably rutile), and two or three specimens of a larger mineral (probably
the same species as that already mentioned).              The best detined has
two cleavages, one more strongly developed than the other, meeting
at an angle of about 76°, and extinction takes place at an angle of
30°, or a little less, with the former.          The crystals exhibit a rather
irregularly outlined prismatic form, the sides being roughly parallel
with these cleavages, and are crowded with minute materials, appa
rently identical with the ground-mass.                This presents a slight
resemblance to that of the ottrelite rock of the Forges de la Commune,
Ardennes, and of one or two schistose rocks from the Alps, which do
not belong to the most ancient group.           Both the biotite and the above-
named mineral appear to have been formed in situ at a time when
molecular movements were not easy.              We are unable to identify the
latter with any mineral        known      to ns, but it somewhat recalls to
            "                         " from certain Jurassic rocks
mind the knoten and prismen                                                   in the
Lepontine Alps,* and even the couseranite from Vicdessos (Pyrenees).
It does not seem to be tetragonal. We venture to suggest that it is
a hydrous alumina-lime-silicate         allied to the scapolite group. The
matrix around the crystals is slightly coarser than elsewhere. Possi
bly the peculiarities in this rock may be the result of contact meta-
morphism.       The other rock from near Trough Camp, on the right
side of the neve, obviously contains rather angular fragments of
white marble imbedded in a hard matrix, grey, speckled with dark
green, in colour. The larger marble fragments are stained externally
with limonite ; many of the smaller are altogether brown.                   Micro
scopic   examination   shows   these  to   consist alike   of  crystalline  caleite,
fairly coarse in the whiter parts, fine-grained in the iron-stained.
Both structures are sometimes present in the same fragment, and
their relations suggest that the fine-grained one comes from a

crashing of the coarser.      The matrix has a sub-crystalline aspect,
and is variable in character.    In one part sub-angular grains appear
to be, as it were, set in a matrix composed of small scales of mica
(mostly white, but some green), and of a chalcedonic material.         This
condition closely resembles that described in some Huronian con
glomerates, and probably results from the alteration of a felspathic
grit.    In other parts a large grain of quartz is occasionally seen,
commonly fairly well rounded, and the ground-mass consists of a
mixture, resembling that already described, of minute mica with
felspathic-looking granules, enclosing larger crystals of green and
brown mica and crystals of a second mineral.       These are fairly deve
loped, rather elongated prisms (varying from about 1 : 4 to 1 : 8)
up to 0-04 in. in length, rather full of microlithic enclosures, very
pale yellowish-green with transmitted light, with dichroism almost
imperceptible, and moderately bright-coloured       with crossed nicols.
The mineral shows a rather irregular transverse cleavage with occa
sional hints of one parallel to the sides of the prism, and extin
guishes straight or nearly so with the latter. Though it has a general
 resemblance to epidote, the cleavage parallel with the above-named
sides is not so marked as usual.         It is, however, more like this
mineral than andalusite, with specimens of which we have compared
it.   The mica, which occurs in flakes, is dichroic, changing generally
from a light straw colour to a brownish-green.         It has formed after
 the epidote, and as it frequently borders the fragments of marble it
may possibly be a lime-mica.        It produces the impression that it is
 slowly eating up the ground-mass.         Of other minerals present in
parts of the slice, rutile, sometimes in geniculate twins, is rather
abundant, and is included in both the epidote and the mica. From
its mode of occurrence a derivative origin seems probable. A few
 granules of iron oxide, apparently limonite, occur, also a rounded
 grain of zircon, and one small crystal of brownish tourmaline,
 secondary in origin.
              (2.) Remarks on Certain Specimens of Interest.
    We proceed next to describe more particularly those rocks already
 mentioned which are more specially interesting.       First of these are
 some rocks consisting almost wholly of hornblende.
    Hornblendites. — One of them from a fallen block on the west side of
 the Astor Valley above Dashkin is a dark green, rather friable rock,
 which consists chiefly of hornblende, mostly in porphyritic crystals
 about  J inch long. More than one variety of this mineral appears on
 microscopic examination : one is blue-green (for rays along the c axis),
 and a yellower green (for direction at right angles) ; the other, in larger
 crystals, is strongly dichroic (a straw colour, b dark bronze-green, c

474            Prof. T. G. Bonney and Miss C. A. Raisin.
similar but slightly darker).        In the latter, enclosures, probably hema
tite, are rather frequent, which apparently lie in the pinacoidal planes.*
We find also some plagioclase felspar, a little pseudobrookite, rutile,
and pyrite. ', The rock has suffered from pressure, which has caused
locally the formation of a chlorite, and possibly of some secondary
felspar.
    Another specimen from the same locality seems to be a schistose
form of a similar rock.        It consists mainly of a blackish, glittering,
fibrous hornblende, and thus is very dark green in colour.                 Its sur
faces are somewhat slickensided and are covered with films of green
copper ore. A few elongated grains of clear felspar or quartz appear
on microscopic examination, but the slice consists almost entirely of
hornblende in rather elongated prisms, with a very definite orienta
tion.    This is markedly dichroic, changing through bluish-green
(c axis) to grass-green (b axis), or almost colourless (a axis) ; it con
tains occasionally small crystals of rutile, rather impure, arranged
along the cleavage planes. A system of parallel planes extends con
tinuously across the crystals of the slice whatever their orientation,
roughly making angles of 70° and 110° with the foliation.                  Even in
a grain of (?) quartz lines of enclosures seem to continue the direc
tion of these planes. The rock is now a hornblende schist, but it was
probably produced by pressure from one closely allied to a pyroxenite.
    Piedtnontite Schist. — We come next to specimens of Piedmontite
schist, all from near the Gargo glacier.             One from the left bank or
moraine shows in a rich purple compact matrix a number of dull white
Bpots, rather fragmental in aspect. These exhibit a slight orientation,
and traces of divisional surfaces are perceptible, cutting this at an
angle of rather more than 35°. Quartz, white mica, and piedmontite,
the first being the most, the second the least, abundant, and some
felspar, are the principal minerals shown in the slice. The quartz
contains enclosures, generally minute but variable in size, occasionally
with bubbles. The piedmontite occurs in more or less clustered grains
or irregular short prisms. With ordinary transmitted light the mineral
exhibits a great variety of tints, from rather dull pale orange or straw
colour to a rich purplish-pink or strong orange-red, inclining some
times to a burnt sienna, sometimes to a more purple hue.                On testing
for dichroism, we find in sections parallel to the orthodiagonal the
colour changes from pale pink (parallel to b axis) to rich pink (c axis,
as stated by Levy), and in sections more or less transverse from pale
yellow to burnt sienna, and in some sections from deep amber (a
axis)t to a rich pink or slightly orange-purple.
   * These might be similar to the enclosures in schillerised pyroxenes described bT
Professor Judd, which, however, consist of mixtures of limonite and other oxides.

   The grains are apt to be irregular in external form, and seldom
exhibit a perfect crystal outline; besides this they have generally a
rather dusty look, as if they contained numerous small enclosure?.
We find also one or two grains of a mineral rather irregular in
outline, which has two cleavages crossing at a large angle, and
exhibits not very high polarisation tints.          It is probably monoclinic
or triclinic, and a secondary product. In parts of the slide crystal
line granules of iron oxide (? haematite) are fairly abundant, and
exhibit a somewhat streaky arrangement.                Under the microscope
the white spots of the rock consist almost wholly of crystalline
quartz, and have a somewhat brecciated aspect.             This suggests that
the specimen may be from a vein, bnt the rest of the rock in structure
more resembles a schist. There seem to be some slight indications of
mechanical disturbance, but if this has occurred it has been followed
by very considerable recrystallisation.
   The next specimen (fig. 1) comes from a small boulder on the south
bank of the stream flowing from the east through the " maidan " of
Gargo.     This appears to be a rather compact and hard schist, which

evidently contains a fair amount of white mica in very small scale?,
and is rather rich in piedmontite.            At the first glance the slice
exhibits a large number of crystals of piedmontite, similar to those
already described, together with small garnets and two micas, one

 colourless, the other brown, in little films, all scattered in a fairly
 glass-clear gronnd-mass ; one or two grains of iron oxide and possibly
 of rutile occur. The crystals generally have a foliated arrangement, and
 are somewhat irregularly grouped, comparatively free lacunae occur
 ring here and there. The garnets are clear, and contain a few enclo
 sures (? cavities) ; they usually occur in well-formed dodecahedra, and
 are about 0'002 inch in diameter.     This is seldom and very slightly
 exceeded, but much smaller specimens are not rare.        The white mica
 is less abundant where the garnets are common, and has a tendency
 to occur in larger crystals and group itself round the lacunae.     With
 crossed nicols the greater part of the ground-mass exhibits a rather
 minute mosaic structure, and is probably, at least to a considerable
 extent, secondary felspar. The larger interspaces prove to be in some
 cases aggregated granules of quartz, in others an almost water-clear
 felspar, cleavage planes and occasional twinning being perceptible
 The outline of the felspar is very irregular, and it is associated some
 times with grannies like those above mentioned, as though it had
 been  partly replaced by them.     There can be no doubt that the pied-
 montite, the garnet, and possibly some of the, white mica are of
 secondary origin. It is even doubtful whether all the larger grains
 of felspar and quartz are intact, for some contain more microliths
 than might have been anticipated.      Calcite occurs locally in patches ;
 in one place also a slightly granular mineral, giving bright tints with
 crossed nicols.    The rock is now a piedmontite schist, bnt it is diffi
 cult to suggest what its original condition may have been, not improb
 ably a fairly coarse-grained gneissoid or granitoid rock.
    Another specimen from the left half of the Gargo glacier bears
 some resemblance to the preceding, but is less micaceous and paler
 in colour ; also it contains a vein of quartz with some minute calcite.
 Even on microscopic examination the distinctions for the most part
 are only varietal, but broken felspars of considerable size are rather
 more conspicuous in the specimen, and the rock generally affords
 very marked indications of fracture and reconstitution.          There is
 another specimen from the left side or moraine of the Gargo glacier
 (below the icefall), which has a general resemblance to the last but
 one, but has a slightly more slabby character.
    These rocks have been compared with a specimen of the pied
 montite schist of Japan, presented to one of us by the kindness of
 Professor Koto.      This contains the characteristic mineral about as
 abundantly arid as well developed as the Gargo specimens, but has
 more iron-glance (?), and more white mica, which sometimes seems
 to be slightly tinted by the manganese.      The rock also is more defi
 nitely foliated.
    Schist with Conspicuous Secondary Mica. — From Dasskaram Needle
.comes a pale grey, closely laminated silvery schist, markedly cal

     On Rocks and Minerals from the Karakoram Himalayas.                   477
careous (effervescing with HC1), including minute dark grains.               It
contains numerous crystals of dark mica, as much as a quarter of an
inch across, their outline being clearly defined and sometimes hex
agonal.     These commonly traverse the foliation planes at a high
angle, and are unusually thick. Thus the edges, which project from a
weathered silvery surface, have the form of oblong prisms, and some
what resemble, as the colour varies from a very dark green to almost
black, crystals of hornblende.         Under the microscope the ground
mass exhibits a foliated and slightly banded structure, and apparently
consists in part of small grains ; some seemingly calcite, while others
— rather irregularly formed, partly free from enclosures, of a water-
clear mineral, giving somewhat low polarisation tints and with a
kind of zoned structure — are probably secondary felspars, which may
retain traces of an original nucleus.       The ground-mass contains also
mica with, perhaps, a little chlorite.         The larger crystals of mica
exhibit a curious and interesting structure.            They are generally a
light brown in colour, but they assume a greener tint near to the
outside.    The former part is fairly dichroic, varying from a light,
slightly greenish-brown to a fairly rich warm brown ; but the
greener parts are paler and not dichroic.            The crystals are usually
somewhat irregular in outline, but the cleavage is fairly good.             In
parts of the slide the mica appears in numerons small patches, mixed
up with the ground-mass.         These in some places seem to coalesce by
      Fig. 2. — A Grain of Secondary Mica in Schist from Dasskaram Needle.

478            Prof. T. G. Bonney and Miss C. A. Raisin.
a gradual replacement        of portions of the ground-mass, so as to form
ultimately a kind of setting for the grains which remain. In other
parts, however, though a considerable portiou of the ground-mass
persists, the characteristic          cleavage of the mica can be readily
detected,* its pleochroism being wanting, while a straight extinction
is quite discernible.       In these cases we have, as it were, the ghost of
the mica, but commonly, as the mineral becomes more and more
characteristic and pleochroic, the constituents of the ground-mass
correspondingly disappear, until at last only few of them remain
(fig. 2). In these, however, the original orientation is still preserved.
Towards the edge of some of the grains the white mica, chlorite, &c,
of the ground-mass seem, as it were, to pierce the brown mica. It is
quite clear that this mineral has been formed after the production of
the cleavage-foliation in the rock.f             The manner of its occurrence
suggests very strongly that its composition differs but slightly
(except for the absence of C02) from that of an average sample of
the ground-mass.
    We are indebted to Mr. P. Williams for the following analysis of this
mica, made in Professor Ramsay's laboratory at University College.
As only a very small amount of the mineral could be spared for the
purpose, he was placed under considerable difficulties, and found it
necessary to compute the alkalies as potash.                   It must be also re
membered that the crystals are rarely quite free from particles of
ground -mass     : —

    The analysis corresponds generally with that of a hydrous mica,
 but has more potash (or alkalies) than is usual.                   It differs from
biotite, which the mineral most resembles, in the higher percentage
 of alumina (in which it comes nearer to muscovite), and in the large
amount of lime.        So far as the mineral can be classified it appears to
 be a hydrous biotite, with          a considerable part of the magnesia re-
   * The  cleavage locally is so strongly marked that at first sight one almost antici
 pates a twinning.   The cleavage seems to be present, if one might say it, almost in
 advance of the mica.

                         (3.) Mineral or Vein Specimens.
   A  considerable number of the specimens brought by Mr. Conway
are vein-stones, or representative of minerals rather than of rocks.
Quartz, of course, is common ; calcite, dolomite, and chalybite not
unfrequent.         Besides these are found the following : — Anhydrite,
actinolite, idocrase, noble serpentine, copiapite (probably from decom
position of pyrite), and almandine.              There are numerous examples of
common garnet, many of epidote and of tourmaline ; also of pyrite,
with chalcopyrite and other copper ores, usually in small amount.
We have looked carefully for gold in the pyritiferous quartzose veins
and other specimens, but have not detected any traces. One speci
men alone seems to call for special notice — a pseudojade — and
this perhaps is, more strictly speaking, a rock rather than a mineral,
but we place it here since it was a fragment on a moraine (left half
of the Baltoro Glacier), and nothing is known as to its origin. Its
form is angular, being partly limited by joints ; it is of a variably
greenish colour, irregularly mottled by a paie yellowish tint. The
hardness is about 6'5, the sp. gr. 3-26, and the general appearance
suggests a jade, but it differs in microscopic character from the few
specimens of that rock which we have examined.f                     A slice exhibits,
in ordinary transmitted light, a ground mass of a very pale yellowish
colour, containing irregular, dusty looking patches and lines, variable
in their distribution.          The parts freer from these enclosures are
almost inert on polarised light, but contain at places a fibrous flaky
 mineral, extinguishing straight, and very faintly polarising with dull,
olive-brown colours. This we find to correspond generally with the
 greener parts of the specimen. The more dusty intervals (those
 corresponding with the paler parts), exhibit, with crossed nicols, dis
 tinctly marked aggregates of very minute granules, and also a fibrous
 prismatic mineral, rather more brightly polarising, extinguishing at
 a fairly high angle, and having a somewhat matted arrangement : not
 improbably a pyroxene.             There are some rather clustered granules
 and grains of a translucent brown mineral, seemingly isotropic,
 possibly a variety of garnet.
    We have to thank Mr. P. Williams, of University College, for the
 following analysis, made in Professor Ramsay's laboratory.

    Microscopic examination, no less than chemical analysis, shows
that this specimen cannot be referred to nephrite, and consists almost
certainly of more than one mineral.        But it is very difficult to ascer
tain "what these may be. The microscope does not give much help,
for it indicates an aggregate of ill-defined constituents, which some
times recall the structures seeu in examining the material named
saussurite.    The chemical analysis is remarkable for its richness in
lime and alkalies (especially potash) and comparatively low per
centages of silica and alumina.         The general character of the rock
suggests the possibility   of jadeite being an important, if not the main
constituent.    But, according to Krenner,* the normal analysis of this
mineral is SiOa = 50-23,AlaO3 = 25-37,NajO = 15-40, and, though the
actual analyses of specimens (doubtless being mixtures) have gener
ally rather more silica, and less alumina and soda, with a little lime
and protoxide of iron, still they do not correspond with the present
one.    Apart from the difficulty of the presence of so much potash,
we should find, if we supposed the alkalies to be contained in jadeite,
hardly any silica or alumina left to go with the lime and other prot
oxide constituents. Saussurite would account for some of the alkalies
and of the lime, but it has nearly the same silica percentage as jadeite,
and a rather higher one of alumina. Zoisite (proper) epidote, the scapo-
lite group, and elosolite present, in each case, important differences.
Certain of the constituents agree fairly well with one of the lime
garnets.f    The rock in which this occurs is said to be homogeneous,
tough,   with   a rather waxy lustre, and a yellowish-white colour —
hardness = 7, and sp. gr. = 3 33 — 3-64. It gave, on analysis, Si02

mineral     resembling      a pyroxene seems to be present.           On the whole,
after consulting many analyses of rocks and minerals, we venture to
suggest that this rock may be composed of a lime garnet,* a potash
jadeite, a mineral of the scapolite group, and a little pyroxene (or,
possibly, even wollastonite or pectolite).              It is more probably a vein
product, for the low percentage of alumina seems to exclnde the pos
sibility of a felspathic euphotide.
                   (4.)  Geographical Distribution of       the Hocks.
   Mr. Conway's collection commences with some specimens from the
Jhelam Valley below Barramula.                These are a limestone and slates,
not unlike some which occur in the Secondary series of the Alps.
The next specimens are from Gurai, in the side valley north of the
Tragbal Pass. These (fallen blocks) are granite and diorite. Ad
vancing thence up the valley of the Kishanganga and the Burzil
Valley, tphyllites,t a -(-conglomerate and then a fgranite. were
collected, and fallen blocks, near Mapnun, furnished a slate and a
serpentine.       Descending from the Burzil pass towards the Astor
Valley, thornblende diorite and tchlorite schist were found ; in
fallen blocks diorites and a micaceous gneiss ; and one water-rolled
specimen of argillite.           Near Astor, two varieties of gneiss were
obtained from boulders. Below Astor, a fdiorite on the west of the
river, and apparently also on the east, and fallen blocks of horn-
blendite on the west, a fgarnetiferous gneiss (near Parri), common as
big boulders down the valley ; and then tgraunlite and ffine-grained
gneiss (these two abundant by the roadside).                  The strikes and dips
recorded by Mr. Conway in some cases may be planes of jointing
rather than of bedding, and in crystalline masses they are most
probably to be reckoned as results of pressure.                 Down to this part
of the Astor Valley, the strikes vary from 15° W. of N, to 10° E. of N.,
the dips varying from 30° eastward to vertical.                From the lower part
of the valley, and from below Hatu Pir come fmicaceous gneisses,
and fdiorite at Ramghat.            In the valley the strikes vary from N.N.E.
to nearly N.E., the dips being on the south-eastern side from
30° to 45°, whiie below Hatu Pir the strike varies between 10° N. or
S. of E., the dips being 33° on the southern side.
    The first specimens brought by Mr. Conway from the valley of the
Indus come from the neighbourhood of Bunji. They are tgranite,
hornblendite, decomposed diabase, and micaceous gneiss. The next
specimens are representatives of the Bagrot Valley ; its stream enters
   * The   constituents of the greater part of the rock are so feebly double-refracting
thatfa fair quantity of an isotropic mineral, if disseminated in granules, might easily
elude discovery.

 Gilgit (a tributary of the Indcs), earring the drainage of       a line of
 lofty peaks and their southern spurs, which curve round from Raki-
 pushi on the west to Emerald Peak on the east. From below Sinakar,
 in the lower part of the Bagrot Valley, comes a fhornblende schist
 (the general strike being nearly E.N.E., dip 55° northerly) and a
f diorite. Hence to a fork in the valley near the foot of the Bagrot
glacier, the specimens represent apparently fcrushed gneiss, and
 diorites of more than one kind. One of these is said to extend far
along the valley ; othei's are common in the debris.     Some strikes are
recorded to easterly or east-north-easterly points, but the dips vary.
 The Bagrot glacier issues from a loop of peaks, and Mr. Conway re
 marks that the mountains on the western side of the glacier as far
 as Rakipushi consist of hornblende rocks, like those of the Bagrot
Valley. From the ridge he collected a fcrushed gneiss, and from the
 Kamar nala beyond a crushed fquartzose mica schist.                 On the
eastern side of the glncier were collected a calcareous fsillimanite
schist and a fhornblende schist, the latter being pretty certainly a
 crushed doleritic rock, and not unlike some of the " griiner schiefer
                                                                            "
of the Alps. From the glacier come a diorite, common in the left
 moraine, and a crushed mica schist.        Passing up the eastern fork,
 Mr. Conway collected a fhornblende schist (or pressure- modi6ed
diorite), a fmica diorite, and some fsericite schists, before reaching
the foot of the Burchi glacier which, descending from the north, joins
the yet larger Gargo glacier.      The specimens from near the former
represent   a  crushed  fcalc-mica schist (in situ on the spur between
the two glaciers) and (from the left moraine) a diorite, an impure
limestone, and a phyllite, so that there must be here an infold of
comparatively unaltered rock.         From the other glacier a crushed
f actinolitic schist occurs on the left bank of the valley beyond Gargo;
yet further up on this side comes a f gneiss (crushed).        The glacier
was now crossed again to the slopes beneath Emerald Peak, on the
ascent of which fsericite schist and f chlorite schist were obtained.
The right moraine of the Gargo glacier furnishes sericite schists, the
left moraine or left side, piedmonite schistR, chlorite schist, diorite,
hornblende schist or schistose diorite, calc-mica schist, and phyllite;
from the more disturbed material is another diorite. Piedmontite
schist also comes from a boulder farther down the valley on the left
side.    The exact locality where this interesting rock occurs in «V« is
not determined, but it is clearly somewhere in the buttresses of the
Gargo Peaks.      These are part of a huge spur which extends from
the Emerald Peak to Dubanni. The strikes along the Gargo Valley
from the fork are generally between 5° S. of E. to 7° S. of E.S.E., the
dips on the south side of the valley and on a peak east of Gargo, are
northward (from 40" to 80°) or vertical ; on the north side of the
valley they are southward 60°.      On the   hill above   the icefall, how-

       On Rocks and Minerals   from   the   Karakoram Himalayas.       483
  ever (left side), and on Emerald Peak, the strike is N. of E.N.E., the
  dip southerly 30° to 75°.
     The next set are from the valley leading to the Gilgit river from
  Chalt. The geology of this region was investigated by Surgeon
  Captain Giles. Here Mr. Conway took but few specimens (fdiorite
  and fhornblendite), and remarks that the rocks are similar to those
  of the Bagrot Valley. Approaching and passing Chalt, tcrystalline
• limestone in situ and a fchloritic rock occur; the strike of these
  varies from 8° E. of S.E. to 13° S. of E., the dips being northerly
 from 50° to 85°. It is noted that much nearer Gilgit the strike of the
  rocks was E., with a varying dip, and that on going northward it
  bends round to be a little more nearly in the direction of the valley.
     The next set of specimens represent the rocks between Gulmet and
Shaiyar ; they are fschistose calcareous grit, ffine-grained gneiss
(both sides of the river), a tgranulite, a tcrystalline limestone, a
fmicaceous gneiss (at Shaiyar), and as loose specimens, garnets,
common near the crystalline limestone, a felstone (Gulmet), and
black garnet-schist (abundant).     It is highly probable that we have
in this region, as in parts of the Lepontine Alps, a series of gneissic
rocks overlain by a group of crystalline schists, probably meta
morphosed sediments, over which comes a newer series of compara
tively unaltered strata. The strikes at this part are stated to be
" parallel with the valley near Gulmet, the dip being 30° in a southerly
direction"; above this they vary apparently from E.N.E. to E.S.E.,
the dips being generally on the southern side, from 20° to vertical.
   In the Samaiyar Valley, below the glacier, are a ffine-grained
gneiss, fgranite (left side, west of camp), and, from fallen fragments
on the same side, a schistose (?) dipyr rock, crystalline limestone, a
mica schist (with some secondary mica), and a schistose grit (brought
clown abundantly by avalanches).         The character of these rocks
suggests the possibility that the granite is intrusive in the sedi-
mentaries.     The strikes in this part of the valley vary from 5° N. of
N.E. to 7° S. of S.E., the dips being very high, generally from 85° to
vertical.    Along the Samaiyar glacier, on the left bank, is a fsome-
what micaceous gneiss. On the right, near Trough Camp, is a fmica-
ceons conglomerate, which recalls some rocks of Huronian age in
                                                     " Trough Saddle," is
Canada. On the same side, near the east end of
a ffine-grained gneiss (common down the left moraine of the glacier).
The strikes below Trough Camp are between E.S.E. and 10° S. of
 S.E., dip southerly 55° to 80°, but at the east end of "Trough
          " the strike is nearly N.N.E., the                  After return
 Saddle                                       dip vertical.
ing  to the  Nagyr   Valley and  ascending to  Hopar,  there  come, beyond
 it, a tfine-grained gneiss, a fmica-diorite. and as loose specimens
along the left side of the Nagyr Valley, and of the Bualtar glacier
(apparently from the Crown of Dirran), diorites      ;    from the medial

 moraine of the glacier a granite, and from the right one a " number
 of rocks similar to those of the Bagrot Valley."        Thus it would
 seem as if dioritic or doleritie rock or some modified form of either,
 extends over a large area along and east of the Nomal Valley north
 of the Gilgit River. The strike below Nagyr is 10° E. of S.E., dip
 northerly 75°, but south of Hopar the strikes vary from 5° S. of
 S.E., dip southerly 30° (recorded at more than one place), to 7° S. of
 E.S.E., dip southerly 50°. Along the Shallihnru glacier, at and
 above Mir Camp, come a ffine-grained gneiss, a forashed mica schist,
 a fcalcareous m;Ca schist, a flimestone breccia (left  bank), and from
 the Dasskaram Needle a ffine-grained gneiss, and a    fmica schist with
 secondary  mica   (two varieties).  A fine-grained gneiss is recorded as
 common in the Mir Moraine, and said by Mr. Conway to correspond
 with that on the " Trough Saddle."        The strikes along the valley
 and on Dasskaram Needle vary from 5° S. of S.S.E. to 15° E. of S.E.,
the dips being south-westerly from 75° to 85°. Prom the Samaiyar
Bar glacier come a crushed mica schist (left side), and a crushed calc
schist (right moraine).       The Bash ridge on the right bank of the
Barpu glacier was climbed in more than one place.            The eastern
part consists of a tg&rnetiferous gneiss, fcrystalline limestone, and a
|mica diorite forming all the upper part of the ridge ; the more
western part of tg&rnetiferous gneiss and (?) tkinzigite,| micaceous
gneiss, fbanded gneiss, and a tdiorite (" forming a thin vein at the
top of the ridge"). The ridge must thus consist very largely of
gneissic rocks, which, however, are pressure-modified igneous rocks.
The strike is recorded as from 10° to 25° S. of S.E., the dips varying,
those above Barpu Camp being southerly 30° to 60°.
   In ascending by the long Hispar glacier to the pass of the same
name the following rocks were collected : on Shukurri, near the foot
 of the glacier, a tfine-grained gneiss, also abundant in the moraine,
and a fmicaceous gneiss (left bank) ; and on the right (nearly three-
fifths of the way up) a fgranite, which, according to Mr. Conway, is
common down the right moraine, and considerably higher up (camp
by Hispar Snowfield) a fmicaceous gneiss. The strikes vary from
2° E. of E.S.E. to 10° S. of E.S.E. ; the dips recorded from the lower
part of the glacier, on the left bank, are vertical and 75° southerly,
from the upper part, right bank, vertical and 60° northerly. The
loose specimens are (in fallen blocks) from the right bank batow
Shnkurri a micaceous gneiss, from the left, on Haigutum slopes, a
banded gneiss (common) ; also a sandstone characteristic of the
moraine of the Kero Lumba glacier, and from the right moraine a
fine-grained gneiss (common).       Evidently the rocks on either side
of this huge Hispar glacier are crystalline, but an infolded mass of
comparatively unaltered sedimentaries must exist somewhere among
the peaks to the south.

      On Bocks and Minerals    from  the Karakoram Himalayas.          485
   In the descent from this pass over the Biafo glacier, a f gneissoid
granite was found on the right side at Snow Lake Camp (the first
halting place), the structure striking 10° N. of E., dipping 60°
northerly, then at "Ogre's Camp" (on the same side), and again at
Nambla Camp, near the lower end of the glacier, a fmicaceous gneiss
— in the former place striking 5° E. of S.E., dipping 80° on the
southern side.     From the left bank, at the foot of Latok glacier
(eastern angle), comes a fgranite, which, according to Mr. Conway,
forms the bulk of the debris.     Moraine specimens are : granite (the
             "
rock which appears to form the needles "), fine-grained gneiss, and
two specimens of crystallised actinolite (these, however, may be only
vein products) (right side), and a slate (obtained a few yards from
Ogre's Camp). Thus the crystalline rocks along both the Hispar and
the Biafo glaciers appear to be generally granite or gneiss.            The
strikes recorded, both in these districts and further west along the
Hunza, the Samaiyar, and the Nagyr valleys, seem to have a general
tendency towards a point between S.E. and E., roughly corresponding
with the direction of this part of the main chain.
   From the valley of the Biaho, rather west of the entrance of that
                                                    f
from the Biafo glacier, comes (near Askole) a mica diorite, and as
loose fragments, garnetiferous (?) quartzite, two varieties of garnet
schist, one (water-worn) the black kind already mentioned, the other
containing chlorite and green mica, and a fine-grained sandstone. The
ascent to Skoro La pass (roughly south of Askole) gave a fmicaceous
gneiss.    The specimens indicate that the rocks enclosing the Biafo
glacier correspond generally with those on the west side of the Hispar
Pass, and that the belt of sedimentaries, already noted as occurring
somewhere among the mountains on the left bank of the Hispar
glacier, possibly is prolonged into those on the right bank of the Biafo
glacier.
   A rather large valley descends into the Biaho Valley, carrying the
drainage of the Punmah glacier, and separated from the one occupied
by the Biafo glacier by a spur-like range of lofty mountains.           The
western side of the extremity of this contains     f crystalline dolomite
 and a ffine-grained gneiss, the eastern side a fcrystalline limestone,
 a fhornblende schist, a ffine-grained gneiss, and a       f  garnetiferous
mica schist.    The strike of the dolomite on the one side, and of the
limestone on the other, is 11° S. of S.E., the dip being 40° towards
the south-west. Ascending the Biaho Valley above the junction with
that bringing the water from the Punmah glacier, Mr. Conway
obtained, just at the angle between them, a ffine-grained gneiss,
striking 5° E. of S.E., and dipping 70° on the south-westerly
side.    Near the foot of the Baltoro glacier, above the camp, comes a
 fgranite and a sandstone from the blocks in the bed of the river.
 By this glacier on the north side were fgranite, a ffine-grained gneiss
                                                               2 l 2

    (into which apparently the granite is intrusive), a tcrystalline lime
    stone, the second striking 7° S. of S.S.E., dipping 10° on the western
    side, the third striking 10° N. of E., dipping 85° southerly, bat with
    many contortions. On the south side are fgranifces, of which, accord
   ing to Mr. Conway, the mountains rising on this side of the lower part
    of the glacier consist. The moraine on the right bank furnished an
   ordinary limestone, a black argillite, and a crystalline limestone ; the
'
   medial one a fine-grained gneiss, a sandstone, a slaty (? felsitic) toff,
    a limestone, a pseudo-jade (marked as rare), and three other speci
   mens (of which the bulk of the moraine is said to consist), viz., a
   crushed gneiss, a sandstone, and a slate,
       About this point a marked change takes place in the scenery.
   From tho higher part of the Biafo glacier the mountains are charac
   terised by needle-like forms ; fnrther to the east, though lofty, they
   are more rounded in outline.     In this part Crystal Peak rises on the
   right bank of the Baltoro glacier.       From its southern slope come
   (order uncertain) ffine-grained gneiss, a fcalcitic quartz schist, a
   tdark mica schist, fdolornite, and flimestone (both crystalline), a
   ffine-grained gneiss, and another gneiss (crumpled). A specimen from
   the summit of Crystal Peak unfortunately consists mainly of crystal
   lised quartz, but to this a little brecciated rock adheres, some frag
   ments in which effervesce slightly and may be limestone.      The mass
   of practically unaltered sedimentary rocks, of which the moraine has
   already given ample evidence, may therefore include the Crystal
   Peak. On the ascent to White Fan Pass, south-east of the same
   peak, were collected a tmica syenite, and a crystalline but fine
  grained fwhite dolomite.      A greyish tcrystalline limestone occurs,
  it is said, apparently belonging to a mass of green rock, in which are
  thin seams of fnoble serpentine. Halfway up to this pass the strike
  is recorded as S.E., the dip being 75° to the south-west.      A diorite
  comes from the Angle Peak, i.e., that which rises from the above-
  named mass west of the Godwin- Austen glacier.
      The moraines from Gusherbrum give a sandstone and earthy lime
  stones.    The right bank of the Throne glacier fphyllite, targillite,
  flimestone (these three being associated), fslate, and a tlimestone
  breccia (this, however, might be a fault product).        From the left
  bank of the same glacier (whether in situ is uncertain) a fine
  grained gneiss, a granite, and a dolomite (the last is said also to
  occur on the Golden Throne). The strike in the mountains by the
  glacier is said to be 7° S. of E.S.E. (dip about vertical) and this
  continues all along the valley.       The moraine starting from the
  western foot of Golden Throne affords sandstone, grits, and cal
  careous grits (both schistose), limestones, and dolomite, and the
  peculiar felstone described above.    Mr. Conway states that the last-
  named rock occurs on the mountain, and appears to form bands in the

        On Rocte and Minerals        from     the  Karakoram Himalayas.              487
 schistose grits.      On the Pioneer Peak the first point reached on
 the arete yielded schistose grits, one of which (a pnrple specimen
with small pebbles) occurred again at the second peak, striking 5° E.
of S., and dipping 35° to the east.            It is evident that a considerable
mass of sedimentary rock must be infolded in the range from
 Gnaherbrum to Golden Throne.
    The valley of the Indus from Parkntta to Tolti (roughly S.W.
of the district last described) lies among alternating diorites and
granites.      Higher up, from Himis to the turn for Lama-ynru,
or on either side of Leh, it is among fargillite and folate (just like
the redder slate of Llanberis) ; these are said by Mr. Conway to be
" sandwiched " with granite.
    Again and again throughout this district of the Himalayas, rocks
bear evidence of severe pressure, the result of earth movements.
Putting aside those which are either certainly or probably of igneous
origin, we find three rather well-marked groups.                   One, fine-grained,
speckled gneisses, very          similar  to   those   which     occur   on the south
side of the Central Highlands of Scotland (e.g., about Blair Athol) ;
secondly, crystalline schists, limestones, and dolomites, doubtless
metamorphosed sedimentaries, several of which are practically iden
tical with specimens described by one of us from the Lepontine and
Pennine Alps* ; and, thirdly, a group of sedimentary rocks (not
more than mechanically altered), which sometimes are very like the
Mesozoic rocks of the Alps, though occasionally some have a rather
more ancient aspect.             With these the peculiar felstones of the
Golden Throne appear to be associated, and in one or two places the
presence of somewhat altered fragmental rocks is suggested.                       In all
probability the history of the Karakoram-Himalaya region is very
similar to that of the Alps. First is a great floor of crystalline rock,
partly igneous, partly metamorphic (in the more strict sense of the
word).       On that was laid down (possibly with interruptions and
marked intervening disturbances and denudations) a series of sedi
mentary rocks.        This ended, all were affected bv a process of folding
on a gigantic scale and upreared into a mountain mass, which has
been carved, by the usual agents of denudation, into peaks and
valleys far surpassing in wildness and grandeur even those of the
Alps.f

      OBITUARY NOTICES OF FELLOWS DECEASED.
    Richard    Owen was born at Lancaster on July 20, 1804. His
 father, whose name was also Richard, was engaged in business
 connected with the West Indies.       His mother's name was Catherine
 Pan-in.     He was educated at the Grammar School at Lancaster
 (where one of his schoolfellows was W. Whewell, afterwards Master
of Trinity), apprenticed to a surgeon of the name of Harrison in that
town, and studied surgery at the County Hospital.             No evidence
can now be found for the statement which has appeared in many bio
graphical notices that when a boy he went to sea as a midshipman,
nor is there any that at a later period he had an intention to enter
the medical service of the Navy, or applied for and obtained an
appointment, as has also been stated.
    In 1824 he matriculated at the University of Edinburgh, and had
the good fortune to attend the anatomical course of Dr. Barclay,
then approaching the close of a successful career as an extra-
academical lecturer, whose teaching was of a very superior order
to that of the third Monro, who, by virtue of hereditary influences,
happened at that time to be the University Professor of Anatomy.
In his work ' On the Nature of Limbs,' Owen refers to " the exten
sive knowledge of comparative anatomy possessed by my revered
preceptor in anatomy, Dr. Barclay," and always spoke of him with
affectionate regard.
    He did not remain in Edinburgh to take his degree, but removed
to St. Bartholomew's Hospital in London, and passed the examina
tion for the membership of the Royal College of Surgeons on
August 18, 1826.
    His first published scientific works were in the direction of surgical
pathology, being on encysted calculus of the urinary bladder and on
the effects of ligature of the internal iliac artery for the cure of
aneurism.
   At St. Bartholomew's Hospital he soon attracted the attention of
the celebrated Abernethy, through whose influence he obtained the
appointment of Assistant Conservator to the Hunterian Museum of
the Royal College of Surgeons.       This was in 1827, and it caused him
to abandon the prospect of private practice, to which he had begun to
devote himself while living in Serle Street, Lincoln's Inn Fields, for the
more congenial pursuit of comparative anatomy. The Conservator of

the Museum at that time was William Clift, John Hunter's last and
most devoted pupil and assistant, under whose faithful guardian
ship the collection had been most carefully preserved during the
long interval between the death of its founder and its transference to
the custody of the College of Surgeons. From him, Owen early imbibed
an enthusiastic reverence for his great master, which was continually
augmented with the closer study of his collection and works, which
now became the principal duty of his life. In 1830 and 1831 he
visited Paris, where he attended the lectures of Cuvier and Geoffroy
St. Hilaire, and worked in the dissecting rooms and public galleries
of the Jardin des Plantes.     In 1835 he married Cliffs only daughter,
 Caroline, and in 1842 was associated with him as joint Conservator
of the Museum.       On Cliffs retirement soon after, he became sole
 Conservator, with Mr. J. T. Quekett as Assistant.
    He was appointed Hunterian Professor of Comparative Anatomy
and Physiology in 1835, an office which he held until his retirement
from the College in 1856, and from which he took the title of " Pro
fessor Owen," by which he was far more widely known than by the
knightly addition of his later years.
    Until the year 1852, when the Queen gave him the charming
cottage called Sheen Lodge in Richmond Park, where he resided to
the end of his life, he occupied small apartments within the building
of the College of Surgeons ; these, however inconvenient they might
be in some respects, furnished him with unusual facilities for pursuing
his work by night as well as day in the museum, dissecting rooms,
and library, of that institution.
    Owen's life of scientific activity may be divided into two periods,
 during each of which the nature of his work was determined to a
 considerable extent by the circumstances by which he was environed.
 Each of these periods embraces a term of very nearly thirty years.
 The first, from 1827 to 1856, was spent at the Royal College of Sur
 geons; the second, from 1856 to 1884, in the British Museum. It was
 in the first that he mainly made his great reputation as an ana
 tomist, having utilised to the fullest possible extent the opportunities
 which were placed in his way by the care of the Hunterian Museum.
 For many years he worked in that institution under the happiest of
 auspices. From the routine and drudgery which always take up so
 large a portion of the time of a conscientious museum curator, he
 was relieved by the painstaking, methodical, William Cliff; the far
 more gifted son-in-law being thus able to throw himself to his heart's
 content into the higher work of the office. This at first mainly consisted
 in the preparation of that monumental ' Descriptive and Illustrated
 Catalogue of the Physiological Series of Comparative Anatomy,'
 founded upon Hunter's preparations, largely added to by Owen
 himself, which was published in five quarto volumes between the

                                    111
 years 1833 and 1840.     This work, which has been tnken as a model
for many other subsequently published catalogues, contains a minute
 description of nearly four thousand preparations.     The labour in
 volved in preparing it was greatly increased by the circumstance
 that the origin of a large number of them had not been preserved,
 and even the species of the animals from which they were derived
 had to be discovered by tedious researches among old documents,
 or by comparison with fresh dissections.        It was mainly to aid
 him in this work that he engaged upon the long series of dissections
of animals which died from time to time in the Gardens of tho
 Zoological Society, the descriptions of which, as published in the
 Proceedings and Transactions of the Society, form a precious fund
 of information upon the comparative anatomy of the higher Verte
brates.    The series commences with an account of the anatomy of
 an Orang TJtan, which was communicated to the fmfc scientific
 meeting of the Society, held on the evening of Tuesday, November 9,
 1830, and was continued with descriptions of dissections of the
 Beaver, Suricate, Acouchy, Thibet Bear, Gannet, Crocodile, Arma
 dillo, Seal, Kangaroo, Tapir, Toucan, Flamingo, Hyrax, Hornbill,
 Cheetah, Capybara, Pelican, Kinkajou, Wombat, Giraffe, Dugong.
 Apteryx, Wart-hog, Walrus, Great Ant-eater, and many others.
     Among the many obscure subjects in anatomy and physiology
 on which he threw much light by his researches at this period were
several connected with the generation, development, and structure of
the Marsupialia and Monotrema, groups which always had great
interest for him. It is a curious coincidence that his first paper
communicated to the Royal Society (in 1832) " On the Mammary
                                            "
 Glands of the Ornithorhynchus paradoxus was one of a series which
only terminated in almost the last which he offered to the same
 Society (in 1887), being a description of a newly excluded young of
the same animal, published in the ' Proceedings,' vol. 42, p. 391.
     On the completion of the ' Catalogue of tho Physiological Series '
Ii is curatorial duties led him to undertake the catalogues of
the osteological collections of recent and extinct forms.    This task
necessitated minute studies of the modifications of the skeleton in all
vertebrated animals, and researches into their dentition, the latter
being finally embodied in his great work on ' Odontography '
(1840-45), in which he brought a vast amount of light out of what
was previously chaotic in our knowledge of the subject, and cleared
the way for all future work upon it. Although recent advances of
knowledge have shown that there are difficulties in accepting the
whole of Owen's system of homologies and notation of the teeth of
Mammals, it was an immense improvement upon anything of the
kind which existed before, and a considerable part of it seems likely
to remain a permanent addition to our means of describing these

                                    IV
organs. The close study of the hones and teeth of existing animals
 was of extreme importance to him in his long continued and labor
 ious researches into fossil forms ; and, following in the footsteps of
 Cuvier, he fully appreciated and deeply profited by the dependence of
 the study of the living in elucidating the dead, and vice, versa.  Per
 haps the best example of this is to be seen in his elaborate memoir
 on the Mylodon, published in 1842, entitled ' Description of the
 Skeleton of an Extinct Gigantic Sloth (Mylodon robuslus, Owen),
 with Observations on the Osteology, Natural Affinities, and Probable
 Habits of the Megatheroid Quadrupeds in General,' a masterpiece
 both of anatomical description and of reasoning and inference.       A
 comparatively popular outcome of some of his work in this direction
 wns the volume on ' British Fossil Mammals and Birds,' published in
 1844-46, as a companion to the works of Yarrell, Bell, and others on
 the recent fauna of our island.       He also wrote, assisted by Dr.
                               "
 S. P. Woodward, the article Palaeontology
                                               " for the ' Encyclopaedia
Britannica,' which, when afterwards published in a separate form,
reached a second edition in 1861.
    To this first period of his life belong the courses of Hnnterian
 Lectures, given annually at the College of Surgeons, each year on a
fresh subject, and each year the means of bringing before the world
new and original discoveries which attracted, even fascinated, large
audiences, and did much to foster an interest in the science among
cultivated people of various classes and professions. They also added
greatly to the scientific renown of the College in which they were
given.   To this period also belong the development and popularisa
tion of those transcendental views of anatomy — the conception of
creation according to types, and the construction cf the Vertebrate
archetype — views which had great attractions and even uses in their
day, and which were accepted by many, at all events as working
hypotheses around which facts could be marshalled, and out of
which grew a methodical system of anatomical terminology, much of
which has survived to the present time. The recognition of homology
and its distinction from analogy, which was so strongly insisted on
by Owen, marked a distinct advance in philosophical anatomy.
These generalisations, first announced in lectures at the College of
                                                        '
Surgeons, were afterwards embodied in two works :         The Archetype
and Homologies of the Vertebrate Skeleton' (1848) and 'The
                   '
Nature of Limhs (1849).
   The contributions which Owen made to our knowledge of the
structure of Invertebrate animals nearly all belong to the earlier
period of his career, one of the most important being his admirable
and exhaustive memoir on the Pearly Nautilus founded on the dissec
tion of a specimen of this, at that time exceedingly rare, animal, sent
to him in spirit by his friend Dr. George Bennett, of Sydney.      This

                                           V
  was illustrated by    carefully executed drawings by his own hand, and
 published in the year 1832, when he was only 27 years of age.
 The Cephalopoda continued         to engage      his attention, and the merits
 of a memoir on fossil Belemnites from the Oxford Clay, published in
                                        '
 the ' Philosophical Transactions          in 1844, was the cause assigned for
 the award      to  him   of the Royal Medal in 1846.             He contributed
 the article " Cephalopoda,"          to the ' Cyclopaedia      of Anatomy and
 Physiology' (1836), catalogued the extinct Cephalopoda in the
 Museum of the Royal College of Surgeons (1856), and wrote original
 papers on Glavagella (1834), Trichina spiralis (1835), Idnguatula
 (1835), Butoma (1835), Spondylus (1838), Ewplectella (1841), Tere-
                                                              '
 bratula (in the introduction to Davidson's classical Monograph of the
 British Fossil Brachiopods,' 1853), and many other subjects, includ
ing the well-known essay on " Parthenogenesis, or the Successive
 Production of Procreating Individuals from a Single Ovum (1849).
                                                                         "
    In 1843 his ' Lectures on the Comparative Anatomy and Physiology
of the Invertebrate Animals,' in the form of notes taken by his pupil
Mr. W. White Cooper, appeared as a separate work.                      Of this, a
second expanded and revised edition was published in 1855.                  By this
                                    '                                     '
 time, as the Royal Society's          Catalogue of Scientific Papers shows,
he had been        the   author of as many as 250 separate               scientific
memoirs.
    In   1856,  when Owen had reached the zenith of his fame, and
was recognised throughout Europe as the first anatomist of the day,
a change came over his career.            Difficulties with the governing body
 of the College of Surgeons, arising from his impatience at being
 reqnired to perform what he considered the lower administrative
duties of his office, caused him readily to take advantage of an offer
from the Trustees of the British Museum to undertake a newly
created post, that of Superintendent of the Natural History Depart
ments of the Museum.          It was thought that hitherto these depart
ments, being under the direct control of a chief who had been
invariably chosen from the literary side of the establishment, and
                                   "
whose title in fact was that of Principal Librarian," had not obtained
their due share of attention in the general and financial administra
tion, and that if they were grouped together an                  placed under a
strong administrator, who should be able to exercise influence in
advocating their claims to consideration, and who should be respon
sible for their internal         working, their relative position in the
establishment would be improved.             Owen was accordingly placed in
this position, with a salary of £800 a year,* and bade farewell to the
College of Surgeons, its museum, and its lectures. At the British
   *  It may be mentioned that he was already in receipt of a Civil List pension of
£200 a year, accorded to him in consideration of his scientific work, mainly in the
completion of the catalogue of the Hunterian Collections.

                                     VI
Museum, however, lie encountered the difficulties which are nearly
always experienced by an outsider suddenly imported into the midst
of an existing establishment without any very well-defined position.
The Principal Librarian, Panizzi, was a man of strong will and
despotic character, and little disposed to share any of his authority
with another. The heads of the departments, especially Dr. J. E.
Gray, Keeper of Zoology, pref erred to maintain the independence to
which they were accustomed within their own sphere of action, and
lo have no intermediary between them and the Trustees, except the
Principal Librarian, who though perhaps with little sympathy, had
ulso, from lack of special knowledge, but little power of interference
in detail. Hence Owen found himself in a situation the duties of
which were little more than nominal, probably for him the best that
could have been, as it gave his indomitable industry full play in the
directions for which his talents were best fitted, and with the magni
ficent material in the collections of the Museum at his command, he set
to work with great vigour upon a renewed series of researches, the
results of which for many years taxed the resources of most of the
scientific societies of London to publish.   It followed from the nature
of the materials that came most readily to his hand, and the smaller
facilities for dissection now available than those afforded by the
College of Surgeons, that .his original work was henceforth mainly
confined to osteology, and chiefly to that of extinct animals.        The
rich treasures of the palceontological department were explored,
named and described, as were also the valuable additions which
poured in from various parts of the world, attracted in many cases
by Owen's great reputation.          The long series of papers on the
gigantic extinct Birds of New Zealand, begun in the year 1839, at the
 College of Surgeons, with the receipt of the fragment of a femur,
 upon which the first evidence of their existence was based, was now
continued at intervals as fresh materials arrived.        The Marsupials
 of Australia, the Edentates of South     America,   the Triassic Reptiles
 from South Africa, the Archceopteryx from Solenhofen, the Mesozoic
 Mammals from the Purbeck, the Aborigines of the Andaman Islands,
 the Cave remains, human and otherwise, of the South of France,
 the Cetacea of the Suffolk Crag, the Gorilla and other Anthropoid
 Apes, the Dodo, Great Auk, and Chiromyt, and many other remark
 able forms of animal life were all subjects of elaborate memoirs from
 his untiring pen.     These were adorned in every case with a profu
 sion of admirable illustrations, drawn as often as possible of the full
 size of nature. His contributions to the publications of the Paljeonto-
 graphical Society, mainly upon the extinct Reptiles of the British
  Isles, fill more than a thousand pages, and are illustrated by nearly
 three hundred plates.
     He now also found leisure to perform the picus duty of vindicat

                                   vii
ing the scientific reputation of his great predecessor, John Hunter,
by arranging and revising for publication a large collection of
precious manuscripts containing records of dissections of animals
and observations and reflections upon numerous subjects connected
with anatomy, physiology, and natural history in general. These
were published in 1861, in two closely printed octavo volumes,
entitled ' Essays and Observations in Natural History, Anatomy,
Physiology, Psychology, and Geology, by John Hunter, being his
Posthumous Papers on those subjects.'         The original manuscripts
had been destroyed by Sir Everard Home, in 1823, but fortunately
not before William Clift had taken copies of the greater part of
them, and it was from these copies that the work was compiled.        Its
publication    shows   that Hunter,  while   occupied with  a large  and
anxious practice — in itself labour enough for an ordinary man —
while cultivating with a passionate energy the sciences of physiology
and pathology, while collecting and arranging a museum such as
has never been formed before or since by a single individual, had also
carefully recorded a series of dissections of different species of
animals which, as his editor justly says,        "if published seriatim,
would not only have vied with the labours of Daubenton, as recorded
in the ' Histoire Naturelle,' of Buffon, or with the 1 Comparative
 Dissections ' of Vicq d'Azyr, which are inserted in the early volumes
of the ' Encyclopedic Methodique' and the 'M^moires de 1'Aca-
ddmie Royale de France,' but would have exceeded them both
together."
    In 1866 were published the first and second    volumes, and in 1868
the third volume, of Owen's own great         book on the Anatomy and
Physiology of the Vertebrates.
    This is the most encyclopaedic work on the subject accomplished
                                        '
by any one individual since Cuvier's      Lecons d'Anatomie Comparee,'
and contains     an immense   mass  of information   mainly based upon
 original observations and dissections. It is in fact a collection of
 nearly all his previous memoirs arranged in systematic order,
 generally in the very words in which they were originally written,
 and unfortunately sometimes without the revision which advances
 made in the subject by the labours of others would have rendered
desirable.    Very little of the classification adopted in this work,
 either the primary division of the Vertebrates into Haamatocrya and
 Hffimatotherma, or the divisions into classes and sub-classes, has been
 accepted by other zoologists.    The division of the Mammalia into
 four sub-classes of equivalent value, upheld by Owen, not only in this
 work, but in various other publications issued about the same time
 (Rede Lecture, Ac), founded upon cerebral characteristics, was
 especially open to criticism.   Though the separation of the Mono-
 tremes and Marsupials from all the others as a distinct group

                                    viii
 (Lyencephala) is capable of vindication, the three other sub-classes,
 Lissencephala, Gyrencephala, and Archeucephala, grade so imper
 ceptibly into each other that their distinction as sab-classes cannot
 be maintained.      The proposed definition of the distinguishing
 characters of the brain of Man CArchencephala) from that of other
 Mammals gave rise to a somewhat acute controversy, the echoes of
 which reached beyond the realms of purely scientific literature.
 On the other hand, the radical distinction between the two groups of
Ungulates, the odd-toed and the even-toed, first indicated by Covier,
when treating of the fossil forms, was thoroughly worked out by
Owen through every portion of their organisation, and remains as a
solid contribution to a rational system of classification.
    The chapter called " General Conclusions " at the end of the third
volume is devoted to a summary of his views on the principal con
troverted biological questions of the day, especially in relation to the
teaching of Darwin, just then coming into great prominence. Al
though f rom the peculiarly involved style of Owen's writing, especially
upon these subjects, it is sometimes difficult to define his real
opinions, it appears that before the publication of the Origin of
                                                              '
Species,' he had
                    " been led to recognise species as exemplifying
the continuous operation of natural law, or secondary cause, and that
not only successively but progressively."     Darwin's special doctrine
    "
of natural selection," however, he never appreciated, and his strong
opposition to it caused him, though quite erroneously, to be looked
upon by those outside the world of science as a supporter of the
old-fashioned and then more "orthodox" view of special creation.
His most distinct utterance upon this subject is contained in the
following paragraph : — " So, being unable to accept the volitional
hypothesis, or that of impulse from within, or the selective force
exerted by outward circumstances,        I deem an innate tendency to
deviate from parental type, operating through periods of adequate
duration, to be the most probable nature, or way of operation, of the
secondary law, whereby species have been derived one from the
other."— (Op. cit., vol. 3, p. 807.)
    His career as a lecturer did not entirely cease with his connexion
with the College of Surgeons, as, by permission of the authorities of
the Museum of Practical Geology in Jermyn Street, he gave several
 courses on the fossil remains of animals, open to the public, in the
 theatre of that institution, and he held in the years 1859, 1860, and
1861, in conjunction     with his office at the British Museum, the
 Fullerian Professorship of Physiology in the Royal Institution. On
the revival of the annual lecture on Sir Robert Rede's foundation
in the University of Cambridge, in 1859, he was appointed to give
the first, and took for his subject the Classification of the Mammalia.
He also occasionally lectured at the Royal Institution on Friday

                                    ix
evenings, his last appearance there being on April 26, 1861, when
he delivered the discourse " On the Scope and Appliances of a
National Museum of Natural History," to be presently referred
to. In April, 1862, he gave four lectures on Birds at the London
Institution.
   While at the College of Surgeons he had been a member of a
 Government Commission for enquiring into the health of the
Metropolis; and subsequently (in 1849) of one on Smithfield and
the other meat markets, in which he strongly advocated the entire
suppression of intramural slaughter-houses, and the concomitant
evil of the passage of droves of sheep and cattle through the streets
of London. For the Great Exhibition of 1851 he was on the Prelimi
nary Committee of Organisation, and he acted as Chairman of the
Jury on raw materials, alimentary substances, &c, and published an
elaborate report on their awards.       He also delivered to the Society
of Arts a lecture on     " Raw Animal Products, and their Uses in
Manufacture." Similar services were performed by him for the
Exposition Universelle of Paris in 1858.
   It has been already said that Owen took scarcely any part in the
details of the administration of the British Museum, but one subject
relating to that establishment did largely engage his attention from
his first connexion with it.      That the accommodation afforded by
the rooms devoted to natural history in the Museum at Bloomsbury
was painfully inadequate for the purpose was evident to him as well
as to everyone else.   Space must be obtained somewhere, even for
the proper conservation and display of the existing collections, to say
nothing of the vast additions that must be expected if the subject
were to be represented in anything like the way in which it deserved
to be in his eyes, and Owen in this respect had very large views.
The scientific public, the officers of the Museum, and the Trustees
were much divided as to whether it would be better to endeavour to
obtain this space in the neighbourhood of the existing Museum, or to
remove a portion of the collection to a totally distinct locality. After
some apparent hesitation, Owen threw himself strongly on the side of
those who took the latter view, being the one which seemed to him to
have the best chance of leading to a successful result, and he strongly
urged upon the Government, and upon the public generally, in
annual Museum returns, lectures, and pamphlets, the desirability of
the scheme. In his address as President of the Biological Section of
the British Association at the York meeting in 1881, he has given a
history of the part he took in promoting the building of the new
museum at South Kensington, including his success in enlisting the
sympathy of Mr. Gladstone, by whose powerful aid the difficulties
and opposition with which the plan was met in Parliament were
mainly overcome.      His earlier views upon the subject are fully

                                     X
explained   in a small work entitled * On the Extent and Aims of a
National Musenm of Natural History,' published in 1862, being an
expansion of the lecture he gave at the Royal Institution in the
previous year. Much controversy arose about this time as to the best
principle of museum organization, Owen adhering to the old view of
a public exhibition on a very extensive scale, while the greater
number of naturalists of the time preferred the system of dividing
the collections into a comparatively limited public exhibition, the
bulk of the specimens being kept in a manner accessible only to the
researches   of advanced students.       The Royal Commission on the
Advancement of Science, of which the Duke of Devonshire was
Chairman, investigated the subject fully, and reported (in 1874) in
favour of the latter view ; but in the new building at Sonth Ken
sington there was, unfortunately, little provision made for carrying
it out in a satisfactory manner.
   As long ago as 1859, in one of his reports on the subject to the
Trustees, Owen recommended that the new museum building, "besides
giving the requisite accommodation to the several classes of natural
history objects, as they had been by authority exhibited and
arranged for public instruction and gratification, should also include
a hall or exhibition space for a distinct department, adapted to
convey an elementary knowledge of the subjects of all the divisions
of natural history to the large proportion of public visitors not
specially conversant with any of those subjects."       The same idea, in
a later publication, is thus described : —  " One of the most popular and
instructive features in a public collection of natural history would be
an apartment devoted to the specimens selected to show type charac
ters of the principal groups of organised and crystallised forms.
This would constitute an epitome of natural history, and should
convey to the eye, in the easiest way, an elementary knowledge of
the sciences." In every modification which the plans of the new
building underwent, a hall for the purpose indicated in the above
passages formed a prominent featnre, being in the later stages of the
development of the building, called, for want of a better name, the
" Index Museum."       Though Owen gave the suggestion and designed
the general plan of   the hall, the arrangement of its contents was left
to his successor to carry out.            ,
   In another part of his original scheme he was less successful.
The lecture theatre which he had throughout urged with great
pertinacity as a necessary accompaniment to a natural history
museum was, as he says in the address referred to above,           erased
from my plan, and the elementary courses of lectures remain for
future fulfilment."
   On several other important questions of museum arrangement,
Owen allowed his views, even when essentially philosophical as well

                                       xi
as practical, to be overruled. As long ago as December, 1841, he sub
mitted to the Museum Committee of the Royal College of Surgeons
the question of incorporating in one catalogue and system of arrange
ment the fossil bones of extinct animals with the specimens of recent
osteology, and shortly afterwards laid before the Committee a report
pointing out the advantages of such a plan. Strangely enough,
though receiving the formal approval of the Council, no steps were
taken to carry it out as long as he was at the College. He returned
to the question in reference to the arrangement of the new National
Museum, and although no longer advocating so complete an incor
poration of the two series, apparently in consideration of the interests
of the division into " departments " which he found in existence
there, he says " The Department of Zoology in such a museum should
be so located as to afford the easiest transit from the specimens of
existing to those of extinct animals.       The geologist specially devoted
to the study of the evidence of extinct vegetation ought, in like
manner, to have means of comparing his fossils with the collections
of recent plants."* Provision for such an arrangement is clearly
indicated in all the early plans for the building in which the space for
the different subjects is allocated, but not a trace of it remained in
the final disposition of the contents of the Museum, as Owen left it in
1883.
    Another essential feature of Owen's original plan, without which,
             " No collection of          can be regarded as               is a
he   says,                      zoology                      complete,"
gallery of physical ethnology, the size of which he estimated (in
1862) at 150 ft. in length by 50 ft. in width. It was to contain casts
of the entire body, coloured after life, of characteristic parts, as the
head and face, skeletons of every variety arranged side by side for
facility of comparison, the braiu preserved in spirit, showing its
characteristic sizo and distinctive structures, &c.         " The series of
                        " would lack its most important feature were the
zoology," he says,
illustrations of the physical characters of the human race to be
omitted."
    An adequate exhibition of the Cetacea, both by means of stuffed
specimens and skeletons, also always formed a prominent element in
his demand for space. " Birds, shells, minerals," he wrote, " are to
be seen in any museum ; but the largest, strangest, rarest specimens of
 the highest class of animals can only be studied in the galleries of a
 national one." And again : " If a national museum does not afford
 the naturalist the means of comparing the Cetacea, we never shall
know anything about these most singular and anomalous animals."
    When, however, the contents of the museum were finally arranged,
nominally under his direction, physical anthropology was only repre-

sen ted by a few skeletons and     skulls placed in a corner of the great
gallery  devoted to the  osteology of the Mammalia, and the fine series
of Cetacean skeletons could only be accommodated in a most unsuit
able place for exhibition in a part, of the basement not originally
destined for any such purpose. The truth is that the division of the
museum establishment into four distinct departments, each with its
own head, left the " superintendent
                                           "
                                              practically powerless, and
Owen's genius did not lie in the direction of such a reorganisation as
might have been effected during the critical period of the removal of
the collections from Bloomsbury and their installation in the new
building. Advancing age, also, probably indisposed him to encounter
the difficulties which inevitably arise from interference with rime-
honoured traditions.     At length, at the close of the year 1883, being
in his eightieth year, he asked to be relieved from the responsibilities
of an office the duties of which he had practically ceased to perform.
   The nine remaining years of his life were spent in peaceful retire
ment at Sheen Lodge, an ideal residence for one who had such a keen
enjoyment of the charms of nature in every form, for, though so large a
portion of his active life had been passed among dry bones, anatomical
specimens, microscopes, and books, he retained a genuine love for out
door natural history, aud the sight of the deer and other animals in
the park, the birds and insects in the garden, the trees, flowers, and
varyiug aspects of the sky, filled him with enthusiastic admiration.
He also had his library around him, and it is needleRH to say that the
habit of strenuous work never deserted him till failing memory and
bodily infirmity made it no longer possible to continue that flow of
contributions to scientific literature which had never ceased during a
period of sixty-two years, his first and last papers being dated respec
tively 1826 and 1888. His wife and only son had died some time
bafore, but the son (who had held an appointment in the Foreign
Office) left a widow and seven children, who, coming to reside with
him at Sheen, completely relieved his latter days of the solitude in
which they would otherwise have been passed. During the summer
of 1892 his strength gradually failed, and he died on the 18th of
December, literally of old age. In accordance with his own expressed
desire, he was buried in the churchyard of Ham, near Richmond, in
the same grave with his wife, a large and representative assemblage
of men of science being present at the funeral ceremony.
   It may be thought that the prodigious amount of work that Owen
did in his special subjects would have left him no time for any other
occupations or relaxations, but this was by no means the case.        He
was a great reader of poetry and romance, and could repeat by heart,
even in his old age, page after page of Milton and other favourite
authors, for he was gifted with a wonderful memory.         For music he
had a positive passion ; in the most busy period of his life he might

                                     xiii
constantly be seen at public concerts, listening with rapt attention,
and in his earlier days was himself no mean vocalist, and acquired
considerable proficiency in playing the violoncello.       He was also a
neat and careful draughtsman ; the large number of anatomical
sketches he left behind him testify to his industry in this direction.
His handwriting was unusually clear and finished, considering the vast
quantity of manuscript that flowed from his pen, for he rarely resorted
to dictation or any labour-saving process. Only those who have had to
clear out rooms, official or private, which have been long occupied by
him can have any idea of the quantity of memoranda and extracts
which he made with his own hand, and most of the books he was in
the habit of using were filled with notes and comments.
   Owen's was a very remarkable personality, both physically and
mentally. He was tall and ungainly in figure, with massive head, lofty
forehead, curiously round, prominent and expressive eyes, high cheek
bones, large mouth and projecting chin, long, lank, dark hair, and
during the greater part of his life, smooth-shaven face, and very florid
complexion.      Though in his general intercourse with others usually
possessed of much of the ceremonial courtesy of the old school, and
when in congenial society a delightful companion, owing to his un
failing flow of anecdote, considerable sense of humour, and strongly,
developed faculty of imagination, he was not only an extremely adroit
controversialist, but no man could say harder things of an adversary
or rival.     Unfortunately he was often engaged in controversy, a
circumstance which led to a comparative isolation in his position
among men who followed kindred pursuits, which was doubtless pain
ful to himself as well as to others. It was this, combined with a cer
tain inaptitude for ordinary business affairs, which was the cause of
his never having been called to occupy several of the distinguished
official positions in science to which his immense labours and brilliant
talents would otherwise have fairly entitled him.        Over the British
Association he presided at the meeting at Leeds in 1858, and he had
 his full share of those honours and dignities to which a scientific
 man can aspire which involve no corresponding duties or responsi
 bilities.  He was made a C.B. in 1873, and a K.C.B. on his retire
 ment from the Museum in 1884.            He received the Prussian Order
 "                  "
   Pour le Merite in 1851, the Cross of the French Legion of Honour
 in 1855, and was also decorated by the King of Italy with the Order
of St. Maurice and St. Lazarus, and by the Emperor of Brazil with
the Order of the Rose.        He was chosen one of the eight foreign
 Associates of the Institute of France in 1859.       The Universities of
 Oxford, Cambridge, and Dublin conferred upon him their honorary
 degrees, and he was an honorary or corresponding member of nearly
 every important scientific society in the world.         The Geological
  Society presented   him  with  the  Wollaston   Medal in  1838, and the

                                    xiv
 Royal College of Surgeons with its Honorary Gold Medal in 1883.
 He was the first to receive the gold medal established by the Linnean
 Society at the centenary meeting of that body in 1888.        The Royal
 Society, of which he became a Fellow in December, 1834, and on the
 Council of which he served for five separate periods, awarded him one
 of the Royal Medals in 1846, and the Copley Medal in 1851.
                                                             W. H. P.
    Sir William Aitken   was born at Dundee on     April   23,  1825, and
received his early education in the High School of that town.          He
 commenced the study of medicine under his father, a medical man
 in Dundee, and by attendance in the wards of the Dundee Royal
 Infirmary. In November, 1842, he matriculated in the University of
 Edinburgh, where, after attending lectures in the faculty of arts,
 and having complied with the requirements of the medical curriculum,
 he took the degree of Doctor of Medicine in 1848, his thesis on a
pathological subject on that occasion gaining for him a gold medal.
He also became a Licentiate of the Royal College of Snrgeons of
Edinburgh in the same year. Thence he appears to have proceeded
to the University of Glasgow as Demonstrator of Anatomy under
 Dr. Allen Thomson.      This office he continued to fill in conjunction
with that of Pathologist to the Royal Infirmary of Glasgow up to
 1855.    Here he laid the foundation of that knowledge of disease
 which procured for him the appointment as Pathologist to the
 Hospitals of the Bosphorus, which were then filled by sufferers
from the army in the Crimea.          In association with the late Dr.
 Lyon he published a report on the diseases of the Crimea, which
appeared in a Blue-book in 1856, and it is, and always will be, a
valuable work of reference in regard to the maladies which were
so fatal to the troops in that campaign.
    On the foundation of the Army Medical School, which commenced
its existence in 1860 at Chatham (afterwards transferred to Netley),
and was an outcome of the experience of the Crimean War, Dr.
Aitken was made Professor of Pathology, an appointment for which
his early training and matured experience in the military hospitals
in the East peculiarly fitted him, and which his subsequent career at
Netley has abundantly justified.     This duty he continued to perform
until April, 1892, when failing health compelled him to rest from
work. His final resignation of the chair had been fixed for the close
of the session in July, 1892; but renal disease, from which he had
for some time suffered, to the profound regret of his colleagues and
nnmerous friends, terminated his valuable life on June 25, 1892.
   Of the value of Aitken 's work at the Army Medical School, as well
an to medicine generally, it would be difficult to speak too highly. As
a teacher he was pre-eminently successful in his method of imparting

                                       XV
 knowledge ; his reasoning was scientific and practical, his. demonstra
 tions lucid and convincing, and he mast be gratefully remembered by
 hundreds of medical officers who owe much of their knowledge of
 disease, its canses and results, to his teaching.
    A friend and colleague of Dr. Aitken writes : — "In the post-mortem
 room he was facile princeps.        I never saw any one to compare with
 him at work of this kind. It was a lesson none could forget to see-
 him conduct a post-mortem and hear his exposition of what he saw.
 He had great powers of work, and was a student in his own way alt
his life.     His book held the field for many years as a student's text
book."     And, again, " He was scrupulously honest as a writer; strove
always to give every man his due."
    Aitken's services to medicine were not restricted to his work as a
teacher and examiner. He made many contributions of importance
to the literature of medicine, and to that branch of it which he had
made peculiarly his own — pathology.         Up to the last he continued
his labours, and at the time of his last illness was engaged in the
publication of a descriptive catalogue of the Museum of Pathology
now located at Netley.        It is to be hoped that some competent
successor will undertake to carry on and complete the work thus
 unfortunately interrupted.
    It is sufficient to name the chief of his writings to indicate the
debt due to this great pathologist, and to show how earnestly he
laboured to contribute his share of knowledge to the common stock.

    Aitken was a man of somewhat reserved and reticent speech, bnt
what he said was pregnant with science and common-sense.          He was
of a most kindly, genial nature, loyal to his profession, devoted to
his friends, and just to all.    His personal character endeared him to
 every one.     His frank, straightforward     mode of expressing      his
 opinions, tempered as they were by sound judgment and discretion,
made him respected and esteemed, and contributed, in no small
measure, to the formation of the reputation of one of that small bnt
remarkable group of men to whom the great Army Medical School
owes its rise, development, and success.        Regretted universally by
f i-iends and colleagues, it is in the great School of Military Medicine,
 which owes him so much, that his loss will be most keenly felt.
    His merits have not escaped some recognition. He was made a
Fellow of the Royal Society in 1873. In 1887 he received the honour
of knighthood.        The Universities of Edinburgh and Glasgow, in
 18S8, conferred on him the degree of LL.D., whilst on the walls of
the ante-room at Netley is an excellent portrait presented by his
numerous friends, admirers, and pupils.
    May his memory long continue to influence coming generations of
 medical officers in the School he loved so well !
                                                                  J. F.
     Thomas Hawksley, civil engineer, was born at Nottingham in
 1807.    He was educated as an architect and Gnrveyor, but, having
an inclination for mechanicil pursuits, he studied diligently the
 sciences necessary to enable him to practise as a civil engineer, and
 with such success that in 1830 he undertook the construction of new
 waterworks for his native town.         The knowledge and skill he ex
 hibited in these works led to more practice in other districts, and in
 1852 he removed his offices to London, where, before long, he took
 the highest rank in that branch of engineering having to do with
 water and gas supply, and with drainage and hydraulic works
generally.
     Mr. Hawksley was accustomed         to say that he had constructed
 above 150 waterworks, many of the largest character ; and that thore
 were no important towns in Great Britain, and indeed very few great
 cities in the civilised world, in regard to which he had not been pro
 fessionally consulted in some way or other.        He is especially cele
 brated for having been the first to suggest and to carry into practice
 ihe system of "constant service" in water supply, which combined
 the most free and ample provision of water with the almost perfect

                                    xvii
   repression of waste, and with greatly improved sanitary conditions.
   The introduction of the system involved n^ay difficulties and much
   opposition ; but he always spoke of his success in it with great satis
   faction and pride.
       It must not be supposed that municipal engineering in the days of
  Mr. Hawksley's early practice meant simply building and mechanical
  operations. It involved often grave and novel considerations, and it
  was his merit to bring to bear upon them accurate scientific know
  ledge and eareful study.    The lucid and skilful manner in which he
  was in the habit of applying scientific principles to his professional
 •practice was well known to engineers generally : " Mr. Hawksley's
  formula?," " Mr. Hawksley's data," " Mr. Hawksley's general results,"
 and so on, were continually adopted as familiar guides by his profes
 sional brethren, and were quoted as authorities against which there
 could be no appeal.
      On one occasion he had to advise on the drainage of one of the
 largest towns in the kingdom, and a question arose involving some
 artificial hydraulic conditions of much greater magnitude than usual.
 Doubts were expressed as to the feasibility of his scheme, but
 Mr. Hawksley had a strong impression that the ordinary rules, based
 on comparatively small experiments, did not apply.       He accordingly
 examined the question thoroughly, bringing to his aid certain recent
 hydraulic researches by eminent French mathematicians ; and, with
 the help of the writer of this notice, he succeeded in showing the
 practicability of the plan by an amount of scientific evidence which,
 while it was perfectly new, was absolutely incontrovertible.
      Mr. Hawksley was President of the Institution of Civil Engineers
 for the years 1872 and 1873, and of the Institution of Mechanical
 Engineers in 1876 and 1877.
      In 1876 he was elected President of the National Association of
 Social Science, holding their meeting at Liverpool, when he gave an
 address especially remarkable for its happy application of statistics to
 sanitation.    He was a clever and lucid writer, and his keen appre
ciation of scientific reasoning gave great weight to his opinions.
     He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society on the 6th of June,
1878, as being "especially distinguished for the application of Science
to Hydraulic Engineering."
     Mr. Hawksley was blessed with a constitution which prolonged his
life and energy much beyond the ordinary lot of man.        In the begin
ning of September, 1893, sixty -three years after his appointment as
engineer to the Nottingham Waterworks, ho undertook one of his
customary tours of inspection of his works in progress in distant
parts of England ; but a fortnight afterwards he was attacked by a
sadden and formidable disease, which his aged frame was not able to
resist, and he died at his residence at Kensington on the 23rd.
                                                                 W. P

     John Ttsdali. was born at Leighlin Bridge, near Carlow, in Ire
land, on the 2l8t of August. 1820, and the flarly years of his life, up
to the age of 19, were spent in this village, where he received in
struction in the school of one John Conwill, who seems to have been
a man of somewhat original and independent character.          Not much is
known of the snbjects taught to Tyndall in this school, but he cer
tainly acquired there a very thorough knowledge of elementary
mathematics and geometry.           Classics did not form part of the cur
riculum ; for, at the age of 27 he was still unacquainted with the
Latin language.
     On leaving school at the age of 19, he obtained an appointment as
assistant in the division of the Ordnance Survey at Carlow.           About
two years     later, Tyndall   came  to England and attached himself to a
Manchester firm of railway engineers, by whom he was employed in
levelling, surveying, and making out plans and estimates in accord
ance with the rules of the Board of Trade.           In this occupation he
seems to have spent about five or six years of his life, and the experi
ence thus gained during the so-called railway mania, doubtless, con
tributed in no small degree to his subsequent love of pursuits which
necessitated accuracy of measnrement and logical reasoning.
     In the year 1847, he became acquainted with the late George
Edmondson, who, at that time, was endeavouring to introduce into a
large private boys' school at Preston instruction in the elements of
experimental science.        In the spring of that year Mr. Edmondson
undertook, at the instigation of the Socialists who were under the
leadership of Robert Owen, to transform their abortive establish
 ment, " Harmony Hall," into a school and agricultural college, which
 received the name of " Queen wood College."        Here, for the first time
 in an English school, experimental science was practically taught
 in the laboratory and in the field, and Tyndall, although at con
 siderable pecuniary loss to himself, was easily persuaded to become a
 teacher of mathematics and surveying in this new establishment,
 being chiefly influenced, as he himself declared, by the opportunity
 afforded him of working in a chemical laboratory.
      Tyndall remained at Queen wood College, where he had an enthu
  siastic class of pupils who were greatly attached to him, until the
  autumn of 1848, when he accompanied the writer to Marburg, there
 to continue his study of chemistry in the laboratory of Professor
  Bunsen.      He did not, however, confine his attention to chemistry,
  but attended also the classes of the professors of mathematics and
  physics.     Indeed, by far the larger portion of his time, during his
  first year at Marburg, was spent in mathematical work.
      In the year 1850 he graduated in the Philosophical Faculty, taking
  mathematics for his principal subject in vivd voce examination, and,
  for the two subsidiary subjects, chemistry and physics.             Before

                                    xix
 admission to examination at Marburg, it is essential to present to the
 Faculty a memoir on some original investigation made by the candi
 date.   TyndalPs dissertation was entitled, " Die Schraubenflaeche mit
 Geneigter Erzeugungs-Linie nnd die Bedingungen des Gleichgewichts
 fur solche Schrauben," which shows that, at that time, Tyndnll's
 knowledge of mathematics was superior to his acquirements in chem
istry and physics.
   Physical Researches. — About this time there came to Marburg, ns
 extraordinary professor, an enthusiastic young physicist, afterwards
well known as Professor Knoblauch, who exercised a profound
influence upon Tyndall, and who was probably the main cause of the
latter devoting himself, for the f utnre, chiefly to physical science. It
was in conjunction with Knoblauch that Tyndall made his first
physical investigation, the results of which were published in the
year 1850 with the title " On the Deportment of Crystallised Bodies
between the Poles of a Magnet."
   During the next thirty-three years Tyndall published 135 papers,
or at the average rate of rather more than 4 per annum. From
Marburg he migrated to Berlin, where he worked for about a year in
Magnus's laboratory, continuing his researches on diamagnetism and
magne-crystallic action, finally returning to England about the end
of the year 1851 or the beginning of 1852.        He took up his quarters
again at Queenwood College, not as a teacher, but as a guest, await
ing the advent of some suitable appointment. At this time there
was no physical laboratory in England, and consequently no chair of
experimental physics. There was, it is true, a professor of physics at
Owens College, Manchester, but the chair was occupied by a Cam
bridge wrangler, who, though an able mathematician, probably never
made an experiment in his life. Tyndall had to wait until 1853,
having in the meantime been an unsuccessful candidate for a pro
fessorship at Toronto.
   On February 11th, 1853, he delivered, at the Royal Institution, his
first public lecture " On the Influence of Material Aggregation upon
the Manifestation of Force."       This lecture, although of such an
abstruse character, took his audience — mostly popular as it was — by
storm.    It concluded with the following graceful tribute to Faraday :
— " This evening's discourse is, in some measure, connected with this
locality ; and, thinking thus,    am led to inquire wherein the true
value of a scientific discovery consists P Not in its immediate results
alone, but in the prospect which rt opens to intellectual activity, in
the hopes that it excites, in the vigour which it awakens. The dis
covery which led to the results brought before you to-night was of
this character. That magnet (pointing to the large electro-magnet
at the Royal Institution) was the physical birthplace of these results ;
and if they possess any vdiue they are to be regarded as the returning
                                                                d  2

                                      XX
crumbs of that bread which, in 1846, was cast so liberally upon the
waters.     I rejoice, ladies and gentlemen, in the opportunity here
afforded me of offering my tribute to the greatest worker of the age,
and of laying some of the blossoms of that prolific tree which he
planted at the feet of the great discoverer of diamagnetism."
    This phenomenal success with such a critical audience at once
established Tyndall's reputation as a clear and powerful expositor of
experimental science ; and, in the following July, he was unanimously
elected Professor of Natural Philosophy in the Royal Institution. It
was in the physical laboratory of this Institution that the whole of
Tyndall's subsequent work was performed, in so far as it was not
work involving the personal observation of natural phenomena in
the Swiss Alps and elsewhere ; for, although he occupied the chair
of physics in the Government School of Mines for several years, no
laboratory was provided for him or his pupils in that Institution.
    The following is Tyndall's own account of his first lecture given iu
his "Faraday as a Discoverer
                                   " : — " In December, 1851, after had I
quitted Germany, Dr. Bence Jones went to the Prussian capital to
see the celebrated experiments of Du Bois Beymond ; and influenced,
I   suppose, by what he heard, he afterwards invited me to give a
Friday evening discourse at the Royal Institution.           I consented, not
 without fear and trembling, for the Royal Institution was to me a
kind of dragon's den, where tact and strength would be necessary to
save me from destruction.         On February 11th, 1853, the discourse
was given, and it ended happily.        I                               I
                                          allude to these things, that may
mention that, though my aim and object in that lecture was to sub
vert the notions both of Faraday and Pliicker, and to establish, in
 opposition to their views, what    I  regarded as the truth, it was very
 far from producing in Faraday either enmity or anger. At the con
 clusion of the lecture he quitted his accustomed seat, crossed the
 theatre to the corner into which I had shrunk, shook me by the hand,
 and brought me back to the table."
    To return to Tyndall's first physical paper, published as a joint
 investigation by Knoblauch and himself : — by employing a method
 proposed by Dove, they examined the optical properties of crystals
 and found that these optical qualities went hand in hand with their
 magnetic observations.       For a long time, these experiments led to
 the discovery of no fact of importance ; but at length, the observers
 met with various crystals whose deportment could not he brought
 under the laws of magne-crystallic action as announced by Pliicker.
 They also discovered cases which led them to imagine that this
 magne-crystallic action was by no means independent, as alleged,
 of the magnetism or diamagnetism of the mass of the crystal.              In
  short, tlie more they worked at the subject the more clearly was it
  revealed to them, that the deportment of crystals in the magnetic

                                     xxi
field was due, not to a force previously unknown, but to a modifica
tion of the known forceR of magnetism and diamagnetism by crystal
line aggregation.        They found, for instance, that whilst Iceland
spar, which had been adduced by Pliicker and experimented on by
Faraday, was, according to the law of Pliicker, axially repelled by a
magnet, it was only necessary to substitute, in whole or in part,
ferrous carbonate for calcic carbonate, thus changing the magnetic
but not the optical character of the crystal, to cause the axis to be
attracted.     They proved that the deportment of magnetic crystals is
exactly antithetical to that of diamagnetic crystals isomorphous with
the magnetic crystals, and showed this to be a general law. In all
cases, the line which in a diamagnetic crystal set eqnatorially, always
set itself in an isomorphous crystal axially.     It was, moreover, shown
that by mechanical compression other bodies were also made to imi
 tate Iceland spar. The results of these experiments were published
in the ' Philosophical Magazine ' and in ' Poggendorff's Annalen,' and
 Tyndall subsequently, and apart from Knoblauch, continued these
 investigations in the laboratory of Magnus.          The results and the
 conclusions drawn from them which form the first section of Tyndall's
 experimental researches, have never been called in question.
    The great work of Tyndall's life, however, was not performed in
 the domain of magnetism, but in that of heat.         Already, in the year
 1852,   he was    experimenting on the transmission of heat through
 organic   structures,  and in October of that year he sent his first paper
 to the Royal Society, entitled " On Molecular Influences.            Part I.
 Transmission of Heat through Organic Structures." As an illustra
 tion of the leisurely way in which such papers were treated in those
 days, this was not read until the 6th of January in the following
                                     '              '
 year, and did not appear in the Transactions until the year 1854, a
 year after it was read. The paper deals with the transmission of
 heat through wood, and the author expresses the laws of molecular
 action which he deduces from his experiments as follows: — 1. At all
 the points not situate in the centre of the tree, wood possesses three
 unequal axes of calorific conduction, which are at right angles to
 each other.     The first and principal axiR is parallel to the fibre of the
  wood. The second and intermediate axis is perpendicular to the fibre
  and to the ligneous layers ; while the third and least axis is perpen
  dicular to the fibre and parallel to the layers. 2. Wood possesses
  three axes of cohesion which coincide with the axes of calorific con
  duction — the greatest with the greatest, and the least with the least.
  3. Wood possesses three axes of fluid permeability         which coincide
  with those of calorific conduction — the greatest with the greatest, and
  the least with the least.
     These researches on the transmission of heat through organic
  structures were not afterwards continued, as Tyndall's attention was

                                    xxii
 soon after diverted   from conduction to radiation ; and his investiga
 tions on the action of gases and vaponrs upon radiant heat, continued
 for twelve years, constitute, by reason both of the experimental skill
 exhibited in their prosecution and the importance of the results
 obtained, the crowning achievement of his life. The first indication
 of the commencement of this work was given in a Friday evening
 lecture, delivered in the Royal Institution on the 10th June, 1859,
 '•
    On the Transmission of Heat of different Qualities through Gases
of different Kinds."     At this lecture the apparatus used throughout
his remaining investigations, with some modifications, was introduced
to his audience.     It consisted of a tube having its ends stopped air
 tight by polished plates of rock-salt.   This tube could be attached to
an air-pump and exhausted, so that any required gas or vapour could
be admitted into it. A thermo-electric pile being placed at one end
of the tube and a source of heat at the other, the needle of an ex
tremely sensitive galvanometer connected with the pile was deflected.
After it had come to rest, the air was pumped from the tube and the
needle was carefully observed, to see whether the removal of the air
had any influence on the transmission of the heat.     No such influence
showed itself, the needle remaining perfectly steady.          A similar
result was obtained when hydrogen gas was used instead of air.
    It now occurred to the experimenter to increase the sensitiveness
  of his apparatus by the use of a differential galvanometer. Under
the influence of two sources of heat, one of which was caused to pass
 through the experimental tube, the astatic needle of the galvano
meter was brought to zero by two powerful currents, which exactly
neutralised each other. A few strokes of the air-pump were now sufli-
cient to make the current from the thermo-pile at the end of the tube
to predominate over its antagonist by 40° or 50°. On re-admitting the
air the needle again fell to zero, thus proving beyond doubt that the
air within the tube intercepted a portion of the radiant heat, the
 source of heat being one at a temperature at about 300° C. Instead
of a differential galvanometer and two thermopiles, Tyndall after
wards used only one pile with the two sources of heat operating upon
 its opposite faces.    The same method was applied to other gases,
 with most remarkable results, gases being found to differ amongst
themselves with regard to their action on radiant heat as much as
liquids and solids do. Some gases he found bearing the same relation
to others that alum does to rock-salt.     He found transparent and dry
coal-gas   to be  exceedingly powerful   in cutting oft the radiant heat
from a source at about 300° C, but when the lime light was placed at
one end of the tube and the rays concentrated by a convex lens were
sent through the tube, having previously been caused to pass through
a thin layer of water, the coal-gas had no power to absorb the
luminous heat thus transmitted through it. He drew from these

                                     xxiii
experiments     the conclusion    that planets, even at a great distance
from the sun, might have atmospheres of such a character as to
maintain upon their surfaces sufficient solar heat for the maintenance
of life, such as we know it on the surface of our earth.
   Tyndall's first paper communicated to the Royal Society on this
subject was received on May 26, 1859.           This was, however, only a
preliminary note, and his first formal paper on the investigation
formed the subject of the Bakerian Lecture delivered on the 7th
February, 1861. In this lecture he enumerated the enormous diffi
culties he had to contend with in devising methods by which trust
worthy results could he obtained. He relates how, for seven weeks,
he worked from eight to ten hours daily, and had to abandon all the
results as liable to certain errors.       It was only after much labour
and many failures that he constructed an apparatus which yielded
consonant and trustworthy numbers.              Shortly summarised, the
results of this classical investigation may be thus stated: — 1. Ele
mentary gases scarcely absorb any perceptible amount of radiant
heat. 2. All compound gases absorb proportions varying directly
with the complexity of their molecules. Thus the vapour of ether was
found to absorb, for equal volumes at maximum density, 100 times
the quantity of radiant heat intercepted by the vapour of carbonic
disulphide.     The molecule of carbonic disulphide vapour contains
only 3 atoms, whilst that of ether contains no less than 15. Never
theless, the quality of the atoms constituting the molecule has also a
profound influence upon the absorptive power. Thus, carbonic acid
contains in its molecule the same number of atoms as carbonic di
sulphide, but at a tension of 1"2 in. its absorption is represented by
the number 37, whilst the vapour of bisulphide of carbon at a tension
of only 1 in. is represented by the number 62. Again, ethylic borate,
which contains in its molecule no less than 25 atoms, has an absorp
tive coefficient, at only O'l in. tension, represented by the number 620.
   Of all the molecules experimented upon, boric ethylate was the most
complex and exercised the most powerful absorptive effect upon
radiant heat from a source at 100° C. Whilst elementary and diffi
cultly liquifiable gases exercise, as already stated, a scarcely sensible
absorptive effect, easily liquifiable elementary gases and vapours, like
those of chlorine and bromine, exert a very sensible action.       Thus,
whilst oxygen, nitrogen, and hydrogen are represented by the absorp
tion coefficient of unity, chlorine is represented by the number 60, and
bromine vapour, at the same tension, by 160. Compound molecules,
though no more complex than elementary ones, exert a much more
powerful absorptive action ; thus bromino and hydrobromic acid both
contain only 2 atoms in their molecules, nevertheless fhe absorptive
coefficient of hydrobromic acid is more than six times as great as that
of bromine.

                                    xxiv
 .  In this paper, Tyndall also studied the radiation of heat by gases,
and found that oxygen, hydrogen, and nitrogen are practically in
capable of radiating heat from a source of comparatively             low
temperature, whilst the radiating power of four compound gases is
expressed by the following numbers : —
                     Carbonic oxide                 12
                     Carbonic anhydride             18
                     Nitrous oxide                  29
                     defiant gas                    53
    Their radiative powers follow precisely the same order as their
powers of absorption.      He then proceeds to discuss the theoretical
bearings of his experimental results.        He draws attention to the
enormous difference     in behaviour towards radiant heat exhibited by
mechanical mixtures of gases as compared with the same gases chemi
cally combined. Thus hydrogen and nitrogen when mixed together
in the proportion of 1 vol. of nitrogen to 3 vols, of hydrogen, produce
a scarcely perceptible absorptive effect ; whilst, when chemically
united in the form of ammonia, they produce an enormous effect.
Again, oxygen and hydrogen which, when mixed in their electrolytic
proportion, show scarcely sensible action, when chemically combined
in the form of aqueous vapour, exert a powerful action.     So also with
oxygen    and nitrogen,  which, when  mixed,  as in our atmosphere, both
absorb and radiate feebly, when united as nitrous oxide, have their
powers vastly augmented. Atmospheric air, freed from moisture and
carbonic anhydride, and at a tension of 5 inches, did not effect an
absorption equivalent to more than one-fifth of a degree of the differ
ential galvanometer ; whilst nitrous oxide of the same tension effected
an absorption     equivalent to 51°. Hence the absorption by nitrous
oxide at this tension is about 250 times that of air. In like manner
 the absorption by carbonic oxide of this tension is nearly 100 times
 that of oxygen alone; the absorption of carbonic anhydride being
 about 150 times that of oxygen ; whilst the absorption by olefiant gas
 of this tension is 1000 times that of its constituent hydrogen.     But
 even the enormous action last mentioned was surpassed by     the vapour
 of many volatile liquids possessing greater atomic complexity.
    Tyndall visualised to himself the cause of this enormous difference.
 He considered that the compound molecules pi-esent broad sides to the
 ether, while the simple or elementary molecules do not ; but, in con
 sequence of these differences, the ether must swell into billows when
 the former are moved, while it merely trembles into ripples when the
 latter are agitated. In the interception of motion also, the former,
 other things being equal, must be far more influential than the latter.
    Now, besides presenting broader sides to the ether, the association
  of atoms to form groups must, as a general rule, render their motion

                                    XXV
through the ether more sluggish, and tend to hring the periods of
oscillation into isochronism with the slow undulations of obscure heat,
thus enabling the molecules to absorb more effectually such rays as
have been made use of in his experiments.       He concluded, however,
that an agreement in period alone is not sufficient to cause absorp
tion and radiation ; but, in addition to this, the molecules must be
so  constituted as to furnish points d'appui to the ether. He remarks
that the heat of contact is accepted with extreme freedom by rock
salt, but a plate of this substance once heated requires a great length
of time to cool. This effect is explained by the experiments of Balfour
Stewart, which prove that the radiative power of heated rock-salt is
extremely feeble. Periodicity, Tyndall remarks, can have no influence
here, for the ether is capable of accepting and transmitting impulses
of all periods, and the fact that rock-salt requires more time to cool
than alum simply proves that the molecules of the former glide
through the ether with comparatively smaller resistance, and thus
continue moving for a longer time ; while those of the latter, being
extremely complex in comparison with rock-salt, present broad sides
to the ether and speedily communicate to it the motion which mani
fests itself as heat.     This power of gliding through still ether,
possessed by the rock-salt molecules must, of course, enable the
moving ether to glide round them, and no coincidence of period
could, he thought, make such a body a powerful absorber.
   Tyndall extended these experiments to the effect of odours on tho
absorption of radiant heat.      He experimented upon the perfumes
arising from patchouli, sandal wood, geranium, oil of cloves, otto of
roses, bergamot, lavender, lemon, nearoli, portugal, thyme, rosemary,
oil of laurel, cassia, camomile flowers, spikenard, aniseed, and,
lastly, musk. Calling the absorptive power of the mixed nitrogen
and oxygen of atmospheric air unity, the smallest absoiption,
namely, that of patchouli, was found to be 30 ; whilst the odour of
cassia was 109, and that of aniseed 372.     The most surprising result,
however, was obtained with musk.        It is well known that this sub
stance goes on emitting its odour for months or even years without
any perceptible loss of weight ; yet, when it was placed in a small
glass tube, and dry air was passed over it in the experimental tube,
the inconceivably small amount of this odour gave an absorption
expressed in one experiment by 74 and in a second by 72.        Several
kinds of tea treated in the same manner produced absorptions which
varied between 20 and 28.
   Ozone was also submitted to the same test, and was found to have
an enormously greater absorptive         power than ordinary oxygen.
Electrolytic oxygen,   which  could  only contain a small percentage of
ozone, was found to have 126 times the absorptive power of ordinary
oxygen. This result is extremely surprising in view of the univer
                                                              d3

sally received constitution of the molecules of oxygen and ozone, the
molecule of ordinary oxygen containing 2 atoms, whilst the molecule
of ozone contains only three.
   Whilst Tyndall was pursuing these researches in London, Magnus
was engaged in conducting a similar investigation in Berlin.            The
general agreement between the results of these two able experi
menters was, as might be expected, very close.           In one important
respect, however, there was a striking divergence.       Tins was in regard
to the action of aqueous vapour upon radiant heat, Magnus having
found that aqueous vapour had little or no action, whilst Tyndall
found it to be a very powerful absorbent of the heat rays of low re-
frangibility.   A long controversy ensued, each experimenter appeared
to have full confidence in his own results, and the opinions of others
were consequently far from unanimous until a paper by Tyndall,
                    '
published in the Proceedings of the Royal Society
                                                             1
                                                               in 1881, and
entitled  " Action of an Intermittent Beam of Radiant Heat upon
Gaseous   Matter,"    finally decided the point, and proved in a startling
manner that Tyndall was right. In this paper he describes his repe
tition of the ingenious experiments of Mr. Graham Bell, wherein
musical sounds were obtained through the action of an intermittent
beam of light on solid bodies.      Entertaining the opinion that these
singular sounds were caused by changes of temperature producing cor
responding changes of shape and volume in the bodies impinged upon
by the beam, Tyndall argued that if this be the case, and if gases and
vapours really absorb radiant heat, they ought to produce sounds more
intense than those obtainable from solids ; and it seemed to him plain,
moreover, that by this new method many of his previous results
might be brought to an independent test. Highly diathermanous
bodies, he reasoned, would produce faint sounds, while highlv
athermanous bodies would produce loud sounds; the strength of
the sound being, in a sense, the measure of the absorption.             The
 source of the intermittent beam was a Siemens lamp connected with
a dynamo machine in the front of which was placed a rotating disk.
The result shall be related in Tyndall's own words.
   " Sulphuric ether, formic ether, and acetic
                                                   ether, being placed in
bulbous flasks, their vapours wore soon diffused in the air above the
liquid. On placing these flasks, whose bottoms only were covered by
the liquid, behind the rotating disk so that the intermittent beam
passed through the vapour, loud musical tones were in each case ob
tained.   These are known to be the most highly absorbent vapours
which my experiments revealed.            Chloroform and bisulphide       of
carbon, on the other hand, are known to be least abporbent, the latter
standing near the head of diathermanous vapours. The sounds ex
tracted from these two substances were usually weak and sometimes
barely audible, being more feeble with the bisulphide than with the

                                   xxvii
chloroform.     With regard to the vapours of aniline, iodide of ethyl,
iodide of methyl, and benzol, other things being equal, their power to
produce musical tones appeared to be accurately expressed by their
ability to absorb radiant heat." The dry elementary gases, hydro
gen, nitrogen, and oxygen, produced a musical note so feeble as to be
heard only with attention ; but "when these dry gases were displaced
by carbonic anhydride, the sound was far louder than that obtained
from any of the elementary gases. Ammonia gas produced a loud
musical note.    Now came the crucial test to be applied to aqueous
vapour.
   Obviously,  if dry air  and moist air produced practically the same
slight effect in the intermittent beam, the conclusion of Magnus
would be right, whilst if the moist air produced a much louder sound,
the correctness of Tyndall's result would be clearly demonstrated.    He
says :
        " In this relation the vapour of water was     that which  inter
ested me most, and as      I could not hope that at ordinary tempera
ture it existed in sufficient amount to produce audible tones,  I heated
a small    quantity of water in a flask almost to its boiling point.
Placed in the intermittent beam,     I  heard — I avow with delight — -a
powerful musical sound produced by the aqueous vapour.         I  placed
the flask in cold water until its temperature was reduced from about
90° to 10° C, fully expecting that the sound would vanish at this
temperature ; but, notwithstanding the tenuity of the vapour, the
sound extracted from it was not only distinct but loud.            Three
empty flasks, filled with ordinary air, were placed in a freezing mix
ture for a quarter of an hour.     On being rapidly transferred to the
intermittent beam, sounds much louder than those obtainable from
dry air were produced."        Thus was this controversy finally set at
rest.
   Interpolated between the magnetic and thermal investigations, or
carried on simultaneously with them, were his researches on the
physical properties of ice. These investigations were carried out
partly in the laboratory of the Royal Institution, but chiefly during
vacation rambles in Switzerland.       They involved a vast amount of
laborious observation and acute reasoning, but in the light of recent
experiments, it would be rash to predict that the theory of fracture
and regelation, founded by Tyndall upon Faraday's original experi
ments, will maintain its place as the true and only explanation of the
motion of glaciers.
   In connection with his glacier work stand Tyndall's frequent
ascents of Mont Blanc and other Swiss mountains.        In one of these,
namely the ascent of Mont Blanc in Augnst, 1859, the writer
accompanied him.      The expedition was undertaken by Tyndall with
the especial object of establishing several self-registering thermo-
metric stations between Chamonnix and the summit of the mountain.

                                rxviii
Unfortunately the whole of these stations were swept away by ava
lanches during the following winter, except the one on the summit,
which was seen to he intact next summer by the only mountaineer
who made the ascent during that extremely unfavourable season.
Probably this gentleman was too much occupied in admiring the
grandeur of the surrounding scene to think of the importance of an
observation of the minimum winter temperature at this great eleva
tion. At all events he neglected to read off the self-registering
 instruments, and thus the expedition, so far as thermometric observa
tions are concerned, was abortive.    Nevertheless, it was not in other
respects altogether unrewarded, as certain remarkable physiological
and physical effects were observed during our stay of twenty-two
 hours on the summit of the mountain.
    Almost immediately after arriving there, Tyndall became ill ; be
 complained of headache, a burning sensation in the brain, and general
lassitude, and expressed his belief that he was about to be seriously
 unwell.   Scarcely half an hour had elapsed before all the guides and
porters, nine in number, who had remained at the summit, complained
loudly of headache, and expressed a strong desire to lie down and
rest. Accordingly the erection of our tent was at once proceeded
with. About 12 ft. below the summit of the ridge, and on its south
side, a circular level plateau, about 10 ft. in diameter, was excavated
in the snow, so as to form a level floor for the tent, the setting np of
which did not occupy more than half an hour. As soon as it was
ready, we were all glad to creep into      it,  the sun having become
shrouded with fleecy clouds, which at once transformed the hitherto
pleasing temperature into the piercing cold of a severe winter. The
north wind had also increased in force, filling the air with clouds
of snow blown from the terminal ridge of the mountain, and rendering
exposure outside the tent by no means pleasant.
   The cold blast of the north wind was not the only reason why the
interior of our tent was so welcome, the general lassitude that had
seized upon us all rendering lying down, even upon a bed of hard
snow, a matter of urgent necessity. The indisposition of the whole
party continued to increase especially was this the case with Tyndall,
                           ;
who complained of fever, excessive thirst, and intense pain in the head.
His pulse kept up to 100, but this was less alarming than the other
symptoms, since the writer's own kept steadily at 120, although he
was comparatively well during the first four hours of his sojourn upon
the summit.    Then a general lassitude stole over him also accom
panied by headache.
   Tea was the only liquid which was acceptable to       us during the
whole time of our stay on the summit.     We had wine    and brandy in
abundance, but no one desired them even champagne
                                     ;                   had a nauseous
taste, and was far less acceptable than tea. For solid   food there was

                                   xxix
no desire ; the writer ate only 2 oz. of bread on the summit of the
mountain, and that quite in opposition to the will of the stomach.
This distaste for food was common to the whole party. During the
night, a thermometer inside the tent in which eleven people were
closely packed, never sank below — 1° C, although the temperature
outside was as low as —17° C. The indisposition of the whole party
continued, but there was little or no vomiting ; and the prominent
symptoms of mountain sickness seemed to be headache, with excessive
lassitude and unwillingness to use the slightest physical, or even
mental, exertion.     The pulse was rapid but without any fever, except
in the case of Tyndall, who continued alarmingly ill during the night.
Snow wrapped up in a cloth and applied to his forehead and temples
gave him some relief, but his thirst was insatiable ; and as ice would
scarcely melt in the warmest part of the tent, it was rarely that any
thing but snow could be obtained for him. Most of the party slept
four or five hours, but both of us remarked that the peculiarity of our
position developed a species of selfishness amongst the men, like that
sometimes observed in cases of shipwreck, and which manifested
itself in symptoms of insubordination and general discontent. Before
leaving the horizontal position in the morning, or making any exer
tion, the writer's pulse was found to be still steady at 120, though
unaccompanied by any feeling of feverishness.        There was nothing
unusual in respiration, and no difficulty of breathing.   In short, lying
there on the floor of the tent, there was nothing in our sensations by
which we could have known that the tent was not pitched at the
level of the sea on a frosty morning ; there was no sensation which
rendered the great rarefaction of the air perceptible.
   Tyndall, who was now rapidly recovering, superintended the erec
tion and furnishing of the thermometer post, and afterwards experi
mented on the thermal effect of the sun's rays ; whilst the writer
occupied himself with the collection of samples of air for analysis,
and with experiments in the tent on the rate of combustion of
stearin candles, which he had undertaken, at Tyndall's request, in
order to test the correctness of the following statement made by Le
Conte in Silliman's Journal of Science and Art.
                                                    " Thus, a
                                                              variety of
well established   facts concur in fortifying the conclusions  to which
we are led by d priori reasoning, namely, that the process of combus
tion is retarded by the diminution of the density of the air, whilst it
is accelerated by its condensation."       A comparison of the results
obtained by burning these six candles for one hour at Chamounix, and
for the same time on the summit of the mountain, completely refuted
this statement; the amount of stearin consumed under the two
widely different barometric pressures, was practically the same.
   Another, and entirely unexpected, phenomenon, however, revealed
itself to the writer in the course of these experiments. The candles

                                     XXX
bnming in the subdued light of the teut obviously gave a compara
tively small amount of light ; the lower and bine portion of the flame,
•which under ordinary circumstances scarcely rises to within a quarter
of an inch of the apex of the wick, now extended to the height of an
eighth of an inch above the cotton, thus greatly reducing the volume
of the luminous portion of the flame. These experiments were re
peated, on returning to England, in artificially rarefied atmospheres,
and led to the discovery of the law that the diminution in illuminat
ing power is directly proportional to the diminution of atmospheric
pressure.
    With   the exception   of one or two of the porters, all the party felt
a marked diminution in the symptoms of mountain sickness after
8 a.m.     The rate of pulsation regularly decreased during the descent,
notwithstanding       the violent muscular exertion.      After remaining
steadily at 120 during the 22 hours spent on the summit, that of the
writer dropped to 100 in the corridor, 80 on the Grand Plateau, and
to 56 at Chamounix, his normal pulse-rate being 60.
    Biological Researches. — About the year 1875, Tyndall became in
 terested in the question of spontaneous generation, which at that time
 was exciting a considerable amount of attention, especially in the
 medical profession. Pasteur had pronounced spontaneous generation
 a chimera, and expressed his undoubting conviction that, this being
 so, it is possible to banish zymotic diseases from the earth.        To the
 medical profession therefore, and through them to humanity at large,
 this question was one of the last importance.           But the state of
 medical opinion about it at that time was extremely conflicting and
 unsatisfactory.     With a view to the possible diminution or removal
 of  this  uncertainty, Tyndall determined to apply the exact methods
 of experimental physics to this difficult biological problem.       He had
 a number of chambers or cases constructed, each with a glass front,
 its top, bottom, back, and sides being of wood. These chambers were
 so contrived that infusions of various kinds could be exposed to germ-
 less air after being boiled.    He thus had these infusions exposed to
 an atmosphere      of  oxygen, nitrogen, carbonic anhydride, ammonia,
 aqueous vapour, and all the other gaseous matters which mingle more
 or less with the air of a great city.     He had them moreover " un-
            "
 tortured     by calcination, and unchanged even by filtration or mani
 pulation of any kind, for the air was rendered germless by subsidence.
 The question which he set himself to answer was this : — " Can air thus
 retaining all its gaseous mixtures but self-cleaned from mechanically
                                              " To this
  suspended matter, produce putrefaction ?                question both the
  animal and vegetable worlds gave him a decided negative.           Among
  vegetables, experiments    were made  with  hay, turnips, tea, coffee, and
  hops, and were repeated in various ways with both acid and alkaline
  infusions.   Among animal substances he experimented with beef,

                                     xxxi
mutton, hare, rabbit, kidney, liver, fowl, pheasant, gronse, haddock,
sole, salmon, cod, turbot, mullet, herring, whiting, eel, and oysters.
The result was that infusions of these substances, exposed to temper
atures varying from 27° C. to 32° C. in these germless atmospheres,
in no single instance underwent putrefaction or developed the
slightest amount of bacterial life. On the other hand, infusions of the
same substances, exposed to the common air of the Royal Institution
laboratory, all fell into putrefaction in the course of from 2 to 4 days ;
no matter where the infusions were placed, they infallibly became
offensive in the end.    The number of tubes containing infusions was
multiplied until it reached 600, but not one of them escaped infection.
   To detect the floating germs in the air, Tyndall employed a power
ful beam of light from which the eye of the observer was carefully
screened.    " When the track of a parallel beam in dusty air,"
                                                                     says
Tyndall,   "  is looked at horizontally through a Nicol's prism, in a
direction perpendicular to the beam, the longer diagonal of the
prism being vertical, a considerable portion of the light from the
finest portions of the suspended matter is extinguished.     The coarser
motes, on the other hand, flash out with greater force, because of the
increased darkness of the space around them. It is among the finest
ultra- microscopic particles that the matter potential as regards the
development of bacterial life is to be sought."        He was thus em
ploying for the detection of suspended matter in air an instrument
far more delicate than the microscope, and he reasons upon the
results of his experiments as follows : — " But though they are beyond
the reach of the microscope, the existence of these particles, foreign
to the atmosphere, but floating in it, is as certain as if they could be
felt between the fingers, or seen by the naked eye. Supposing them
to augment in magnitude until they come, not only within the range
of the microscope, but within range of the unaided senses ; let it be
assumed that our knowledge of them under these circumstances
remains as defective as it is now — that we do not know whether they
are germs, particles of dead organic dust, or particles of mineral
matter.    Suppose a vessel (say a flower-pot)      to be at hand, filled
with nutritions earth, with which we mix our unknown particles, and
that, in forty-eight hours subsequently, buds and blades of well-
defined cresses and grasses appear above the soil. Suppose the
experiment, when repeated over and over again, to yield the same
unvarying result.       What would be our conclusion ? Should we
regard those living plants as the products of dead dust or mineral
particles, or should we regard them as the offspring of living seeds ?
The reply is unavoidable.      We should undoubtedly consider the ex
periment in the flower-pot as clearing up our pre-existing ignorance.
We should regard the fact of their producing cresses and grasses as
proof positive that the particles sown in the earth of the pot were the

                                     xxxii
  seeds of the   plants 'which have    grown from them. It would be
  simply monstrous to conclude that they had been spontaneously
  generated. This reasoning applies, word for word, to the develop
 ment of bacteria from that floating matter which the electric beam
 reveals in the air, and in the absence of which no bacterial life has
  been generated.     There seems no flaw in this reasoning ; and it is so
  simple as to render it unlikely that the notion of bacterial life
 developed from dead dust can ever gain currency among the members
 of a great scientific profession."
     During the course of these experiments, Tyndall made the very
 important discovery of the necessity for the intermittent-application
 of heat for the attainment of absolute sterility.     He found that the
 spores of certain bacteria could resist a boiling temperature for five
 hours, althongh the fully-developed bacteria are killed by the applica
 tion of the same temperature for a few minutes.          Hence the now
 universal practice amongst bacteriologists of heating their infusions
 to the requisite temperature, for a few minutes on three consecative
 days.    The first heating destroys all the fully-developed organisms ;
 before the second takes place, the remainder will, in all probability,
 have developed and be likewise destroyed ; but certainly, by the
 heating on the third day, not a single germ will escape destruction.
    It is not possible, within the space of an obituary notice, to do more
 than give a mere outline of the enormous amount of work accom
 plished during the thirty-three years of Tyndall's active life. Nothing
 has been said here of his most interesting work on acoustics, and
 many memoirs on isolated subjects have been entirely ignored.
    As his colleague for six years in the Royal Institution, the writer
 had ample opportunity of judging of Tyndall's remarkable experi
 mental skill and untiring perseverance in the search after truth. So
long as any result was doubtful, no amount of labour was considered
too great to eliminate all uncertainty.       His cleverness in devising
new forms of experiment for the interrogation of nature, was most
striking ; and ho never allowed himself to trust hypothesis where
appeal to experiment was possible.
    In the year 1886, Dr. Tyndall's health entirely broke down, mainly
through overwork, and the managers of the Royal Institution granted
him a year's holiday ; but, although this relief was of some benefit to
his health, at the end of the year he felt compelled to resign his
appointment.      In accepting his resignation the managers, in their
meeting    in  April, 1887, recorded the following resolution: — "The
managers desire to record the expression of their deep regret that the
state of Dr. Tyndall's health should have rendered necessary the
resignation of his position of Professor of Natural Philosophy at the
Royal Institution, and that it should have compelled the managers to
accept that resignation. They also desire that there should be recorded

                                      xxxiii
 the expression of their thorough appreciation of the unremitting and
 most valuable services which, during the long period of 34 years,
 Dr. Tyndall has rendered to the Royal Institution in carrying out the
 duties of his office — services which not only have upheld and have
 advanced the position of the Royal Institution, but have benefited
 science and the world at large."
    Professor Tyndall, on his withdrawal from the Institution, declined
 to receive any pension or pecuniary testimonial in recognition of his
 services ; and, in severing his long connection with it, desired only
 to carry with him the friendly recollection and goodwill of the
 members. At the same meeting of managers, it was resolved unani
 mously that Dr. Tyndall be nominated for election at the next general
 monthly meeting, on Monday, May 9th, as Honorary Professor of
Natural Philosophy ; and he was so elected on that day.                  The
 managers also instituted, at the same time, an annual course of lec
 tures to be called the Tyndall Lectures.
    Dr. Tyndall held the post of Examiner in the Royal Military
 Colleges and in the University of London.           In 1866, he succeeded
 Faraday   as scientific adviser   to the  Trinity House, and occupied this
 position for 17 years. In 1872 he was invited to lecture in the United
 States, and realised a considerable sum of money from the large
 audiences attracted hj his eloquence and experimental skill. The
 whole of this sum, amounting to between £6,000 and £7,000, he
 generously devoted to the encouragement of scientific training in the
 United States, dividing it equally between Columbia College in New
York, Harvard College Boston, and the University of Pennsylvania
 at Philadelphia.
    In 1876, he married Louisa, eldest daughter of the late Lord Claud
 Hamilton, and received, on the occasion of his marriage, a purse of
 300 guineas from the members of the Royal Institution, and a
medallion bust of himself, in marble, from his fellow members of the
X        Club.
    Dr. Tyndall was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1852. In
 1853 a Royal Medal was awarded to him for his researches on magne-
crystallic action. He also received the Rumford Medal, in 1864, for
his researches on the absorption and radiation of heat by gases and
vapours.     He was D.C.L. (Oxon.), LL.D. (Cantab., Dubl., et Edin.),
and an honorary member of a large number of learned societies at
 home and abroad.
    The last years of his life, after his retirement from the Royal Institu
tion, were clouded by repeated attacks of illness.        In the autumn of
1893, his usual sojourn on the Bel Alp appeared to effect a substantial
improvement in his health ; but, almost immediately on his return,
he had a serious relapse, from which he was gradually recovering,
when, on the 4th of December, he died from the effects of an over-
    vol. lv.                                                        e

sulphate   of magnesia.  In  the  presence of a very large number of his
friends and admirers, his remains were interred in Haslemere Church
yard on the 9th of December, the coffin bearing the following
inscription: — "John Tyndall, died December 4th, 1893, aged 73
years."                                                          E. V.
    Sir  Samokl "White Baker was born at Thorngrove, near Wor
cester, on the 8th June, 1821.         He was the eldest son of Samuel
Baker, of Lypiatt Park, Gloucester.
   At the age of twenty-four he went to Ceylon, where he was en
gaged in agricultural pursuits in company with one of his brothers.
    He has given an interesting account of life and sport in Ceylon in
two works, which he afterwards published.
    After quitting Ceylon, where it is understood his farming opera
tions had not been a success, he was engaged for some time in Eastern
 Europe on the Ruschuk and Varna Railway.
    In 1860, Speke and Grant set out from Zanzibar, commissioned by
the Royal Geographical Society of London to follow up the discovery
 of the Victoria Lake and trace the Nile should it be found to be
 connected with that Lake.          Baker determined to go at his own
 expense by way     of  Cairo,   in   order to meet his friends; and, if
 possible, render them the help of which they would stand in need.
 Setting out in 1861, he ascended the Nile, and was fortunate in
meeting Speke and Grant at Gondokoro, thus enabling them to com
plete their journey, while he, aided by indications given him by these
travellers, pressed south and discovered the Albert Nyanza, through
 which the Nile was found to flow.
    On Baker's return to Europe he received, in recognition of his
 services, the honour of knighthood.        He was also awarded for his
 geographical  discoveries,  the  Gold   Medal of the Royal Geographical
 Society and that of Paris, and was elected an Honorary M.A. of
 Cambridge, where he afterwards was Redo Lecturer in 1874.
    In the year 1870 he returned to Egypt in the service of the
 Khedive, he ascended the Nile to Gondokoro in command of a well-
 equipped Egyptian force, and was for two years engaged in establish
 ing the claims of Egypt to dominions on the Upper Nile. For this
 he was made a Pasha and Major- General in the Turkish service.
     The remainder of his life was spent in foreign travel and at his
 home at Sandford Orleigh, near Newton Abbot, where he died
 December 30th, 1893.       He became a F.R.S. in 1869.
