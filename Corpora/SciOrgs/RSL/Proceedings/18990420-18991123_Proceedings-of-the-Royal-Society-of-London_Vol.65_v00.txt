                      ending December 31, 1898.
    The operations of The Kew Observatory, in the Old Deer Park,
Richmond, Surrey, are controlled by the Kew Observatory Committee,
which is constituted as follows : —
                          Mr. F. Galton, Chairman.
    Captain W. de W. Abney, C.B.,

               lieport  of  the Kew Observatory Committee.
                         I. Magnetic Observations.
   The Magnctogrnphs Lave been in constant operation throughout
the year, and the usnal determinations of the Scale Values were made
in January.
   The ordinates of the various photographic curves representing
Declination, Horizontal Force, and Vertical Force were then found
to be as follows : —
                       Declinometer  : 1 cm. = 0° 8,-7.
   Bifilar, January 11th, 1898, for 1    cm. cH = 0-00051 C.G.S. unit.
   Balance, January 12th, 1898, for 1    cm. SV = 000050 C.G.S. unit.
   Owing to the gradual secular change of declination, the distance
between the dots       of light upon the cylinder of the magnetograph
had become too small for satisfactory registration, and it was found
necessary to alter the position of the zero line.         From a similar
cause it was also found necessary to re-adjust the balance of the
vertical force magnetometer.
   During the past year two magnetic storms, or periods of con
siderable disturbance of the needleR, have been registered, the first on
March 14-15, the second on September 9-10.
   The extreme amplitude of the March disturbance was : horizontal
force, 00050 C.G.S. unit; vertical force, 0-0057 C.G.S. unit, and
declination, 1D 26'. In eight minutes, from 10.40 to 10.48 P.M. on the
 15th, the horizontal and vertical components exhibited falls of 0002
and 0-003 C.G.S. unit respectively.           The most rapid change of
declination occurred some thirty minutes later. Speaking generally,
 the most salient features were the large falls in both the horizontal
and vertical components and the movement of the declination needle
 nearly 1° cast of its normal position.
    The second storm occurred on September 9 —-10. The principal
 disturbance commenced somewhat gradually about noon on the 9th,
 but one of its most striking features was an exceptionally rapid fall
 occurring simultaneously at 3.5 p.m. in the horizontal and vertical
 forces and in the westerly declination.       The fall was so rapid as to
 be shown somewhat indistinctly on the photographic traces, but it
 amounted to at least 15' in the declination and 0-0023 C.G.S. unit
 in the horizontal force.        The recovery from this fall was also
 rapid.
    The declination needle, on the same day, between 5.15 p.m. and
 8.8 p.m. receded 54' to the east. then turned and in the course of the
 next thirty-two minutes moved 59' to the west. The horizontal force
 attaiucd its extreme maximum and minimum at 2.42 p.m. and

                 Report  of  the Kew Obxervatory Committee.             3
8.30    I'.M. respectively, the range amounting to [0'00S0 C.G.S. unit
(or    about   1/37 of the whole component).    Between 7.30 and 8.30
P.M., this element fell O0036 C.G.S. unit.           The vertical forc<.
reached its maximum about 6 P.M., and its minimum about 8.30 P.M.,
but as the trace unfortunately got off the sheet near the minimum,
it can only be said that the range of vertical force exceeded G'0036
C.G.S. unit.
    Uoth storms were presumably associated with the aurora simul
taneously seen in the British Isles.        The March storm was the
largest recorded since August, 1894.
    The hourly means and diurnal inequalities of the magnetic elements
for 1898, for the quiet days selected by the Astronomer Royal, will
be found in Appendix I.
    A correction has been applied for the diurnal variation of tempera
ture, use being made of the records from a Richard thermograph as
well as of the eye observations of a thermometer placed under the
Vertical Force shade.
    The mean values at the noons preceding and succeeding the selected
quiet days are also given, but these of course are not employed in
calculating the daily means or inequalities.
    The following are the mean results for the entire year : —
           Mean  Westerly Declination            17° 1''4.
           Mean  Horizontal Force                0'18364   C.G.S. unit.
           Mean  Inclination                     67° 17''6.
           Mean  Vertical Force                  0-43885   C.G.S. unit.
    Observations of Absolute Declination, Horizontal Intensity, and
 Inclination have been made weekly, as a rule.
    A table of recent values of the magnetic elements at the Observa
 tories whose publications are received at Kew will be found in
 Appendix IA to the present report.
     In September Professor Lnigi Palazzo of the Ufficio Centrale
 di Meteorologia, Home, paid a visit to the Observatory for the
  purpose of comparing the Kew magnetic instruments and his own.
     Dr. van Kijckevorsel also spent some time in the summer in
  making a further comparison between his magnetic instruments and
  those at Kew.
     Mr. Hough, Fellow of St. John's College, Cambridge, who has
  recently been appointed chief assistant at the Royal Observatory,
  Cape of Good Hope, visited the Observatory from August 18 to Sep
  tember 1, in order to gain a knowledge of the method of observing
   with the Unifilar Magnetometer and Inclinometer.

 and the declination curves for certain selected days during the years
 1892, 1893, and 1897 have been made aud forwarded to him.
    Information on matters relating to various magnetic data has been
 supplied to Dr. von Bezold, Professor Milne, and Mr. Gray.
    The Observatory has been visited by Dr. A. Schmidt, of Gotha,
 Professor Eschenhagen, of Potsdam, and Professor Liznar, of Vienna,
 members of the International Conference on Terrestrial Magnetism,
 which was held at Bristol in September.
   In spring the nnifilar magnetometer and dip circle, previously lent
to the Jackson-Harmsworth Polar Expedition, were put in order and
 lent to Mr. P. Baracchi, Acting Government Astronomer, Melbourne
Observatory, for observational use in Australia and New Zealand, or
in Antarctic exploration, as he might decide.        Later in the year an
old dip circle was put   in order at the cost ot Sir George Newnes, and
lent for the use of the Antarctic Expedition, under Mr. Borchgreviuk.
It was also agreed that if Mr. P. Baracchi should be willing to
transfer to Mr. Borchgrevink        the unifilar magnetometer and dip
circle referred to above, the Committee would raise no objection,
provided Sir G. Newnes should become responsible for the safe
return of the instruments.
   A course of magnetic instruction was given to the two magnetic
observers of Mr. Borchgrevink's expedition, Mr. Colbeck and Mr.
Bernacchi, the latter of whom had already practised the use of
magnetic instruments at Melbourne Observatory.
                    II. METE0R0L0GICAL    OBSERVATI0NS.
   The several self-recording instruments for the continuous registra
tion of Atmospheric Pressure, Temperature of Air and Wet-bulb,
Wind (direction and velocity), Bright Sunshine, and Rain, have been
maintained in regular operation throughout the year, and the
standard eye observations for the control of the automatic records
duly registered.
   The tabulations of the meteorological traces have been regularly
made, and these, as well as copies of the eye observations, with
notes of weather, cloud, and sunshine, have been transmitted, as usual,
to the Meteorological Office.
   With the sanction of the Meteorological Council, data have been
supplied to the Council of the Royal Meteorological Society, the
Institute of Mining Engineers, and the editor of ' Symons' Monthly
Meteorological Magazine.'
   Elect rograph. — This instrument worked in a satisfactory manner
till May, when the action markedly deteriorated.            Tests of the
battery showed that its E.M.F. had fallen off considerably ; this was
so far remedied by cleaning and recharging the top row of cells.       At

                Report   of the Kew Observatory Committee.                 5
the same time a new silk suspension was fitted to the needle of the
electrometer, and the instrument generally overhauled, and a new
scale determination was carried oat.
   The records remained satisfactory nntil November, when the
battery potential again began to fall oft' rapidly.       Between November
'24 and 27 the whole sixty cells were cleaned and recharged with a
satisfactory result, and on the latter date one-third of the cells were
removed to contract the scale, in order to record high winter values,
as explained in last year's Report.
    On several occasions it had been noted that the electrometer needle
had a tendency to " set " when the acid in the interior jar had been in
use for some time. This " setting
                                       " largely interfered with the freedom
of the needle.     It has, however, been considerably reduced, by substi
tuting a single platinum wire connection for the double gridiron
form hitherto employed.
    In May another portable electrometer, No. 80, was purchased from
White, of Glasgow ; it is furnished with some additions to the usual
pattern, which experience at the Observatory suggested as likely to
prove beneficial in reducing induction effects. This electrometer
has been used since, with the older instrument, White, No. 53,
in obtaining the scale value of the self-recording instruments, de
terminations being made 011 February 7, April 1, May 26, June 16,
 September 6, and November 28.
    Inspections. — In compliance with the request of the Meteorological
 Council, the following Observatories and Anemograph Stations have
 been visited and inspected : — Stonyhurst, Yarmouth, North Shiehln,
Alnwick Castle, Fort William, Glasgow, Aberdeen, and Deerness
 (Orkney), by Mr. Baker; and Radcliffe Observatory (Oxford), Holy-
head, Fleetwood, Armagh, Dublin, Valencia, Falmouth, and St.
 Mary's (Scilly Isles), by Mr. Constable.
                      III.  SEISM0L0GICAL    OPSKRVATI0NS.
    The seismograph referred to in last year's Report was delivered
 by Mr. li. Munro in March.         Ib is of Professor J. Milne's " unfeli;
          "
 tremor      pattern, the motion recorded being that of a horizontal
 pendulum or boom with along period of vibration (fifteen to eighteen
 seconds from rest to rest).      It is intended to measure the tilting of
 the ground along an east-west line, the boom itself lying due north
 and south.
    At the suggestion of Professor Milne, who visited the Observa
 tory, the site selected for at least a temporary trial is in the base
 ment, inside the double-walled wooden room, originally designed for
  pendulum observations, and sometimes used as a warm chamber for
 chronometers. At first difficulties were encountered from wandering

of the boom, -which is still too liable to get off its pivot ; but the
record has been, on the whole, satisfactory for the latter half of the
year.    The following table gives particulars respecting the time of
occurrence and amplitude in seconds of arc of the largest movements
actually recorded : —

   The times dednced for the commencement of the above-mentioned
earthquakes were 6 h. 47-6 m., 8 h. 4'5 m., and 1 h. 37 m. re
spectively.
    Without special very careful experiments it would be difficult to
say what is the probable error in fixing the precise times.        Inde
pendent measurements of the photographic trace may agree to O'l or
0'2 of a minute, but there is room for a certain amount of doubt as to
the proper values to attribute to the time marks on the sheet.
    In the case of the times of commencement of a disturbance the
 uncertainty is greater, because the movement may be initially infini
 tesimal, and because a tiny movement arising from a different source
 (suoh movements being not uncommon) might intervene.
                          IV.   Experimental     Work.
    Fog and Mist. — The observations of a series of distant objects,
 referred to in previous Reports, have been continued. A note is taken
 of the most distant of the selected objects which is visible at each
 observation hour.
    Atmospheric Electricity. — The comparisons of the potential, at the
 point where the jet from the water-dropper breaks up, and at a fixed
 station on the Observatory lawn, referred to in last year's Report,
 have been continued, and the observations have been taken twice
 every month.
    During October some simultaneous observations were made witli

               Report of tJie Kew Observatory Committee.                7
the two portable electrometers, the one situated on the pillar in the
garden, the other at the same height on a tripod stand, at some
distance in the park. It is hoped that time will be found to repeat
the experiments on sufficiently numerous occasions to allow some
conclusions to be drawn.
   Aneroid Barometers. — The experiments referred to in the last three
" Reports " were continued in the early part of the year. The results
have been discussed by the Superintendent in a paper recently pub
lished in the Society's ' Transactions.'
   Platinum Thermometry. — The experimental work carried out at
the International Bureau of Weights and Measures at Sevres by
Dr. J. A. Harker in co-operation with Dr. Chappms has only just
terminated. It has comprised a careful comparison of certain
platinum thermometers belonging to the Observatory with a gas
thermometer belonging to the Bureau, over the range —30° C. to
 + 600° C.
   Dr. Harker brought back the platinum thermometers, resistance box,
&c., to the Observatory late in December, and is about to be engaged
in preparing the results for publication.      In view of this and other
special thermometric work in contemplation, the Committee have
temporarily secured the services of Dr. Harker in the capacity of
special assistant to the Superintendent.
   Experiments have been continued at the Observatory itself on the
fixity of zero, and the general behaviour of platinum thermometers.
which have shown, amongst other things, the expediency of carefully
                                 "
checking the behaviour of the leads."
   Experimental work on the comparison of platinum and mercury
thermometers has also been continued, and it is hoped that it will
shortly be possible, utilising the results of Dr. Harker's work at
Sevres, to issue certificates to high range mercury thermometers
embodying the results of direct comparison.
   Mercury Thermometry. — The experiments on therinometcrs of
different kinds of glass made by Messrs. Powell and Sous, to which
reference was made last year, have been continued.         Further ther
mometers are being made by Messrs. Powell, of a pattern suggested
by the Superintendent, with which it is hoped to experiment at
higher temperatures.

                VI.  RATIXO   0F WATCHES  AND CHR0NOMETERS.
     The high standard of excellence to which attention has been drawn
 in previous Reports has been maintained.        Although the number of
 watches sent for trial this year is less than last year, yet the genera 1
average is as good, and 66 movements have obtained the highest
possible form of certificate (the class A, especially good), which
 involves the attainment of 80 per cent, of the total marks.
    The 483 watches received were entered for trial as below : —
    For class A, 383; class B, 73; and 27 for the subsidiary trial.
Of these 17 passed the subsidiary test, 116 failed from various causes
to gain any certificate, 55 were awarded class B, and 295 class A.
    In Appendix     III will be found a table giving the results of trial
of the first 50 watches which gained the highest number of marks
during the year.        The highest place was taken by Mr. S. Yeomans,
Coventry,      with a keyless going-barrel, Karrusel lever-watch,
No. 76,152, which obtained 89'2 marks out of a maximum of 100.
    Representations having been made to the Committee that some
changes were desirable in the system of marks and dates 011 certifi
cates, a circular was issued (as mentioned in last year's Report) to
ascertain the general opinion of manufacturers and others interested
in the matter, but the replies received showed no unanimity of
opinion in favour of any one specified change, whilst a considerable
number were quite satisfied with the existing conditions.          Finally
some small alterations were made, mainly in matters of detail.
    The objection to the certificates that sustained most support —
though even on this question opinions were fairly divided — was that
the date suggested to the customer, in the case of any but the most
recently tested watch, a line of criticism that would not naturally have
presented itself. In consequence it was nnjed that the possession of a,

10             Report of   the Keic Obsercaloi-y Committee.
Kew certificate was a very doubtful advantage to any watch remain
ing unsold for several years in a retailer's hands. The Committee
could not see their way to alter the invariable practice of dating
Kew certificates, but they agreed, in order to minimise the source
of complaint, that a watch tested at the Observatory not less than
three years previously, should be admitted to a fresh trial at half the
usual fee.
   Marine Chronometers. — -During the year, 70 chronometers have been
•entered for the Kew A and H trials ; of these 33 gained certificates,
2] failed, and there are 16 in hand.
    The new cold-air chamber, to which a preliminary reference was
made in last year's Report, has been completed, and has proved
very convenient.
    It consists of three separate divisions, each isolated from the
others, and separated by a 3-inch space packed with flake charcoal,
this same packing being continued on all sides of the divisions, the
size over all being 6% ft. by 6$ ft. by 3 ft.
    The centre chamber, 3 ft. by 3 ft. by 2 ft., is fitted with sliding
 racks for the chronometers, and the division on either side is for the
ice.    This is supplied in blocks, which rest on boards, and drain
 away into a trap and gulley.      The chronometer chamber is furnished
 with trays to hold potassic chloride for drying purposes, and with
 maximum and minimum thermometers.
    The doors are packed with flake charcoal, and are so arranged that
 the ice stores can be tilled or emptied without any disturbance of the
chronometer chamber.
                             VII. MISCELLANE0US.
    Paper. — Prepared photographic paper has been supplied to the
 Observatories at Hong Kong, Mauritius, Oxford (Radcliffe), and
 Stonyhurst, and through the Meteorological Office to Aberdeen,
 Fort William, and Valencia.
    Anemograph and SinisJilne Sheets have also been sent to Hong Kong
 and Mauritius.
     Gas Thermometer. — Sir Andrew Noble, K.C.B., having generously
 offered to present a gas thermometer to the Observatory, and to
 defray the cost of sending an assistant to Berlin to study the method
 of using a similar instrument at the Reich sanstalt, at Charlotten-
 burg, the Committee gladly accepted the gift. The construction of
 the instrument has not yet been completed.
    Pendulum Observations. — In July Mr. F. Laurin and another officer
 of the Royal Austrian Navy swung half second pendulums in the
 sextant room on the spot where observations were made some years
 ago by von Sterneck.

               Report  of tlie Kew  Observatory Committee.            11
    Electric Tramways. — During the year a variety of schemes have been
promoted for applying electric traction on the trolley system to tram
lines in the neighbourhood of the Observatory, and one of these schemes,
promoted by the London United Tramway Company, for a new line
between Kew Bridge and Hounslow, passing within 1,300 yards of
the Observatory, has received the sanction of Parliament. The Com
mittee, roused by the fate that has befallen the magnetic observa
tories at Toronto and Washington, requested Professor Riicker and
Professor Perry to take the matter in hand. A series of experi
ments made at various places in London and Leeds, under the
general supervision of Professor Riicker, showed that electric rail
ways and tramways, satisfying presumably all the existing require
ments of the Board of Trade, produced very sensible disturbances in
si declinometer at distances of two or three miles.        This fact was
brought before the notice of the Royal Society, who in turn entered
into communication with the Board of Trade, with the result that
the following clauses were inserted in the London United Tramway
 Company's Bill : —
    1. The whole circuit used for the carrying of the current to and
from the carriages in use on the railway shall consist of conductors,
which are insulated along the whole of their length to the satisfaction
 in all respects of the Commissioners of Her Majesty's Works and
 Public Buildings (in this section called the " Commissioners "), and
 the said insulated conductors which convey the current to or from
any of snch carriages shall not at any place be separated from
 each other by a distance exceeding one-hundredth part of the
distance of either of the conductors at that place from Kew Obser
 vatory.
    2. If, in the opinion    of the Commissioners, there are at any time
 reasonable grounds for assuming that, by reason of the insulation or
 conductivity having ceased to be satisfactory, a sensible magnetic
 field has been produced at the Observatory, the Commissioners shall
 have the right of testing the insulation and conductivity upon giving
 notice to the Company, who shall afford all necessary facilities to the
 engineer or officers of the Commissioners, or other person appointed
 by them for the purpose, and the Company shall forthwith take all
such steps, as shall in the opinion of the Commissioners be required
 for preventing the production of such field.
    3. The Company shall furnish to the Commissioners all necessary
 particulars of the method of insulation proposed to be adopted,
and of the distances between the conductors which carry the current
 to and from the carriages.
    It is understood that the above clauses will be insisted on by the
  Board of Trade in the case of any other tram line which can be
 shown to be a probable source of danger to the Observatory.

12             Report  of tlie Ketv Observatory   Committee.
    The Committee are much indebted to Professor Riicker and Pro
fessor Perry for the trouble they have taken in the matter, and they
are also glad to express their acknowledgment of the valuable
assistance rendered by the editors of scientific journals and various
eminent men of science in educating public opinion.       The Committee
even hope that ere long tramway companies themselves will recog
nise the benefits accruing from improved insulation.
    Whilst everything has been done, as far as can be foreseen, to pro
tect the magnetographs, it is impossible to contemplate the future
without some misgivings.
    National Physical Laboratory. — The Government Committee,
referred to in last year's Report, visited the Observatory on
January 18th. In the course of the summer, that Committee sub
mitted to the Lords Commissioners of Her Majesty's Treasury »
report, embodying the following four recommendations : —
    1. That a public institution should be founded for standardizing and
verifying instruments, for testing materials, and for the determination
of physical constants.
    2. That the institution should be established by extending the Kew
 Observatory in the Old Deer Park, Richmond, and that the scheme
should include the improvement of the existing buildings, and the
erection of new buildings at some distance from the present Obser
 vatory.
    3. That the Royal Society should be invited to control the proposed
 institution, and to nominate a Governing Body, on which commercial
 interests should be represented, the choice of the members of snch
 Body not being confined to Fellows of the Society.
    4. That the Permanent Secretary of the Board of Trade should
 be an ex ojjicio member of the Governing Body ; and that such Body
 should be consulted by the Standards Office and the Electrical
 Standardizing     Department of the Board of Trade upon difficult
 questions   that may arise from time to time or as to proposed modi
 fications or developments.
    In October, the Royal Society informed the Kew Observatory
 Committee that the Government had adopted the report generally,
 and were willing to provide funds for carrying it into effect ; conse
 quently the Royal Society asked for the concurrence of the Kew
 Observatory Committee in their action.
    In reply, the Committee expressed their willingness to facili
 tate the execution of the scheme, and to continue to administer
 the Observatory . pending the nomination of the new Governing
 Bodv. The arrangements were not completed before the close of
 1898.

                  Magnetioal Observations, 1898.
Made at       the Kew Observatory, Old Deer Park, Rich
   mond, Lat. 51° 28' 6" N. and Long.            0h lm 158'1  W.
   The results given in the following tables are deduced from the
magnetograph curves which have been standardised by observations
of deflection and vibration. These were made with the Collimator
Magnet K.C. I. and the Declinometer Magnet marked K.O. 90 in the
9-inch Unifilar Magnetometer by Jones.
   The Inclination was observed with the Inclinometer by Barrow,
 No. 33, and needles 1 and 2, which are 3i inches in length.
   The Declination and Force values given in Tables I to Vin are
prepared in accordance with the suggestions made in the fifth report
of the Committee of the British Association on comparing and
reducing Magnetic Observations.
   The following is a list of the days during the year 1898 which
-were selected by the Astronomer Boyal, as suitable for the deter
mination of the magnetic diurnal inequalities, and which have been
employed in the preparation of the magnetic tables : —

       Motion  in Animals and Plants and Electrical Phenomena.            37
CROOXIAN      LECTURE. —" On the Relation of Motion in Animals and
       Plants to the Electrical Phenomena which are associated with
       it." By J. BURDON-SANDERSON, M.A., M.D., F.R.S. Eeceived
       March 2,— Read March 16, 1899.
   In   a Croonian Lecture which   I  delivered to the Royal Society       in
1867  — more than thirty years ago — I exhibited a number of diagrams
of graphic records, in evidence of the mechanical relations which           I
then sought to establish between the movements of the heart and those
of respiration in the higher animals.
   I  have to-day to bring before you results      which have also been
obtained by a graphic method, which however differs from the other in
that the records are written by light, and not by pen on paper ; that
the time taken in recording is measured in thousandths of seconds, not
tenths ; and finally, that the events recorded are not the movements of
the chest or heart, but the electrical changes which, as will be shown,
are found to associate themselves with all manifestations of functional
activity in living organisms, whenever these take place under condi
tions which admit of their being investigated.
   Our purpose is to consider the relation of two coincident and con
current processes, with reference to which we make at the outset the
assumption that one is functional, the other concomitant, using the
word " function
                  "
                     in the biological sense to imply the doing by an
organ of the work for which it is adapted.      In the observations which
I have made from time to time during the last twenty years relating
to the electrical phenomena of plants and animals, it has always been
my endeavour to regard them exclusively in relation to the functional
activity of the structures in which they manifest themselves.          In in
vestigating the function of a living organ or organism, you have to do
with a machine that you cannot take to pieces, and it is often the best
way to observe how, after its action has been arrested, it goes on again.
To do this under experimental conditions is one of the most frequently
used methods of the physiologist.       The possibility of employing it
depends on the circumstance that all animal organisms, and certain
parts of plants, possess the faculty of being awakened from a state of
rest to normal activity.
   Even under the most favourable conditions, the observation of this
transition is attended with difficulties which arise from the com
plexity of the chemical and mechanical changes, and the shortness of
the time spent in their accomplishment.      It is this crowding together
of chemical, thermal, and electrical phenomena into a very brief period
which determines the method for their elucidation, a method consisting
to a large extent of a determination of time-relations, i.e., of the order of

38        Prof.   J.   Burdon-Sandereon.            Relation    of Motion in Animals
succession of phenomena ; for it is evident that when you have to do
with a number of events which appear to be simultaneous, the most
effectual way to determine their causal relations is to ascertain the
order of their occurrence.   For, inasmuch as one event which follows
another cannot be its cause, the proof of their sequence which accurate
time-measurement affords may be of infinite value in indicating where
 the starting point in a complex series of changes is to be sought for.
    The inquiry as to the relation between functional activity and the
electrical phenomena accompanying                    it,
                                           can only be entered upon by
finding instances in which both processes can be observed together.
Amongst these, those are to be preferred in which the question presents
itself in its simplest form, the experimental conditions can be most
easily controlled, and the observations can be made with the greatest
exactitude.
     It   might at first sight       seem desirable to begin by describing the
electrical manifestations         of functional activity in the simplest organisms
and organs.            There are, however, important reasons for following the
reverse order.           To do so
                             in conformity with the general rule that
                                      is                                                a
problem can be most easily solved when      presents itself in its simplest
                                                           it
form. In the lowest organisms the relation of function to structure,
so far from being simple,       necessarily very complex, for functions
                                           is
of the most varied kind have to be discharged by one and the same
mechanism, and often in default of any mechanism at all that we can
discover whereas in the higher plants and animals we find for the
            ;
most part that every kind of work has its instrument, every action its
agent.   It in the highest organisms therefore that elementary physio

logical questions must be studied, and      in them that they have been
                                                    it     is
most studied.
    Of the elementary vital functions, motion was the one fixed upon as
the subject of this lecture by its founder.        Its fitness for our purpose
is  pre-eminent.   Motion,   in  the  physiological  sense,     simple, control
                                                                      is
lable, measurable.    It        is,
                              moreover, a function of paramount import
ance as the means by which the animal organism maintains its relation
 to the external world.    In the higher animals, muscle         the instrument
                                                                      is
 of motion,  and therefore  claims   our consideration.     It has, in addition,
the advantage of being          structure of which the chemical, thermal,
                                    a
and mechanical properties are better known than those of any other.
This advantage applies particularly to the muscles of the frog, which
on that account, as well as on the grounds which have been the occa
sion of their being most studied, are to be preferred for our present
investigation.   What we have first to do therefore this afternoon            to   is

action and muscular action itself but before entering upon

     When a muscle is roused to activity by the presence of an exciting
 cause, its mechanical properties suddenly change.                   It shortens and, if
 the shortening is resisted, becomes tight.               If the resistance is such as
 cannot be overcome, it tightens without shortening. With reference
to this mechanical change, we know that it is dependent on chemical
change, and that that change is oxidation.                   Admitting these proposi
 tions, we must necessarily believe that the oxidation is sudden, i.e.,
explosive, because its mechanical effect (the tension or tautness I have
mentioned) attains its maximum at a very short period after the
moment at which the process begins.
     At ordinary temperature we find that in a whole muscle the tension
which is induced by an excitation attains its maximum in about 3/100
second.       But if we fix our attention on a single muscular element,
i.e., on one of the infinite number of molecular mechanisms by the
cooperation of which the mechanical change consequent on excitation
is brought about, it can be shown that in each taken separately a much
shorter duration than 3/100 second must be assigned to the process of
 transition.      According to Bernstein, less than 1/100 second must be
assigned to the chemical process which takes place in a muscular
element in response to a single stimulus.*
     This chemical process of extreme suddenness is followed without
measurable loss of time by the conversion of the chemical energy of
the oxidisable material into mechanical energy, which immediately
manifests itself either in shortening or in the effort to shorten.                    The
way     in   which   this    transference      takes place   must  for   the  present be
left an open question, for, as Professor Engelmann explained in the
Croonian Lecture for 1895, the transformation of chemical into
mechanical energy consequent on excitation of muscle, though by no
means an insoluble, is still an unsolved physical problem.                     We know
how much chemical energy is liberated, we know how much work is
done, and how much heat ia wasted, but we cannot explain how it
happens ; it being difficult to suppose that the temperature required for
such transformation can exist in living muscle.
    The absence of a sufficient physical theory of the origin of muscular
force does not, however, deprive the mechanical manifestations                     of the
process of their value as simple, measurable, and controllable indica
tions of functional activity.              Whether we take the case in which a

                        .Archiv,' vol. 67, p. 211, 1897, where Bernstein describes his
method    of measuring the period of latency.        As in the method described by me in
                                  '

      '
                                    in 1895, a magnified image of the moving surface 0f a
muscle excited directly is received on a slit, behind which a sensitive plate passes.
From the curve to obtained, Bernstein determines the moment at which the rate of
expansion increases most rapidly, and regards this as the moment at which the
moving force is at its maximum.          This conclusion, of course, applies to the part of
 the mnscle immediately excited.

40     Prof.  J. Bunion-Sanderson.             Relation of Motion    in Animals
muscle    strives    against      a resistance which it cannot overcome, or
shortens   without     resistance,    or does both simultaneously, the change of
tension in the one case, of form in the other, or of both, are measurable
processes of which the time-relations             can be ascertained with great
accuracy.      We    are on   safe   ground  therefore   in using either change of
tension or change of form as a means of estimating the vital activity of
muscle, and in fact both are required.
   For every investigation in which muscular function is in question,
three points come prominently forward : (1) The moment at which
mechanical energy comes into play ; (2) the maximum energy dis
played ; and (3) the time at which that display culminates.                      AS
regards    the    first  point,     the   time  occupied   before   the  mechanical
response begins was, for many years, believed to be 1/100 second.
This estimate was accepted as though on the authority of Helmholtz,
but was really based on a misunderstanding of his experimental data.
But we now know that the change of form resulting from the action of
a single instantaneous          stimulus begins in the muscle element not later
than 4/1000 second after the moment of excitation, and I may be per
mitted to show you how this result can be arrived at with absolute
certainty by the photographic method.                (Photograph shown.)
   As regards the second and third points, we find it better to measure
contractile activity by change of tension rather than by change of form,
firstly, because the method of measuring tension is less liable to error,
and, secondly, because the process of development of tension is more
rapid than the development of change of form.                    For, although with
the exquisite methods we now possess of getting rid of inertia in our
recording apparatus, it is possible to measure the shortening with great
exactitude, yet it is easier to guard against errors of observation when
the other (isometric) method is used.
    Having seen how functional activity can be measured, we may
advert to the question that principally concerns us this afternoon
— the question, namely, whether the electrical phenomena may also
be regarded as expressions of functional activity.                Assuming for the
moment      the  question      to  be   answered   in  the affirmative,   with what
part cf our tension curve should we expect the electrical concomitant
to coincide t Assuredly with the first and second hundredths of a
second after excitation, i.e., with the period of greatest activity of the
unknown process by which chemical is replaced by mechanical energy,
and, for a reason which I will at once explain, with the very begin
ning of that process. For, as I have already indicated, the transition
does not occur at the same moment everywhere, and inasmuch as the
method which we use for the investigation of electrical change takes
cognisance only of what happens within an area of a couple of milli
metres, we should expect it to occur not at a moment corresponding
to the maximum development of tension in the whole muscle, but at

         and Plants   to the Electrical Phenomena associated with it.       41
  the moment      at which the transition process is going on with the
 greatest   rapidity   in the elements immediately concerned within that
 limited area. Assuming for the moment that this rapidity is expres
 sible as a measurable electromotive     force, we should   expect the appear
ance and disappearance of that electromotive          force to be represented,
 not by a curve resembling the tension curve,          but by a curve of the
 form indicated in the diagram.       (Curve   P' in Diagram   4.)
    Before losing sight of the mechanical changes which have for the last
 few minutes been occupying our attention, there are two other points
 which must be shortly adverted to on account of their bearing on what
 follows. The one is the terminableness and the cyclical character of the
 mechanical process.      The muscle returns to its status quo at a certain
 time after it has been disturbed, a time strictly dependent on tempera
 ture and other well ascertained physiological conditions.         We do not
 know as yet how it relaxes, whether it is merely a physical reaction, or
 whether it is by the intervention of a new chemical process. This is a
 qu(estio Vfxata which for the present must remain open.
    The second point is that although the mechanical process is limited
 in time it is not limited in space.    If it were possible to imagine a con-
 tinuum of contractile protoplasm, an excitation once started would go on
 for ever, i.e., it would be propagated from element to element — in every
 direction if it were of the nature of cardiac muscle, in two directions
 only if it were of the nature of skeletal muscle. For this process to
 take place we suppose that each element excites its neighbour. In each
 transmission the time lost is almost infinitesimal, yet by summation it
acquires a definite value, so that the relation between distance travelled
 and time occupied can, when the temperature and other conditions are
known, be foretold. In so far as each element transmits its state of
 change to its neighbour without loss it resembles the propagation of
light and sound, but the velocity of propagation is of so different an
order that the comparison must not be carried too far.
                             Method of Observation.
    We are now in a position to enter on the inquiry which more
 immediately concerns us.       Having the order of the mechanical changes
 which constitute muscular action before us, it will be our purpose to
compare with this order that of its concomitant electrical phenomena.
Before I proceed with this comparison it is desirable to say that
it should be understood that no reference will be made to electrical
theory. We merely derive our modes of observation and of measure
ment from the exact sciences, and aim at the utmost attainable
precision ; but the phenomena have their chief interest as outward
and visible signs of intimate vital processes, of which they afford us the
only knowledge that is within our reach.

42      Prof.   J.   Burdon-Sanderson.       Relation     of Motion in Animals
  We choose          as   our subject of observation      a muscle of nearly sym
metrical form — a band of parallel fibres.   We explore its electrical
state, by a conducting arch containing a galvanoscope, the ends of the
arch being in contact with its surface. If the muscle is no longer
living, the galvanoscope gives no evidence of current.            If it is living,
there is again no current, provided that the two surfaces are in the
same physiological state.    If one is less living than the other the fact is
indicated by a difference of potential between them, a current flowing
through the galvanoscope from the more living to the less living.    Vitality is,
therefore, here indicated by difference of potential. By vitality we
mean nothing more than the capacity for discharging function.                 This
capacity diminishes by discharge, i.e., by activity.  Accordingly we
find that when, for any reason, the muscular substance at one part
becomes more active than the muscular substance at another, the former
becomes negative to the latter.
     Every observation of the electrical phenomena of muscle (or of any
other  excitable structure) relates either to the state of capacity for
action (called in physiology " rest     or to the state of action or dis
                                           "),

  Hermann, have condemned it               as an  instrument of which the defects
 are essential and irremediable.              As I have answered these criticisms
 elsewhere,     I    need only say here that for the investigation of the order
 and duration of a rapid succession of electrical changes, such as those
 with which we are now concerned, the instrument surpasses all others ;
 and that by means of it my colleague, Professor Gotch, has with Mr.
 Burch's aid, successfully photographed phenomena in nerve, of which
 the very existence could not be demonstrated a few years ago.*
    The purposes to which we apply it are (1) for the measurement of
intervals of time between electrical changes which succeed each other
with great rapidity, and (2) the obtaining an estimate of their relative
intensities. The properties which make it so invaluable to us are
(1) that it responds to the action of a current promptly, beginning
when the current is closed, and indicating every change in its strength
or direction without measurable loss of time ; (2) that cat. par., the rate
of ascent is proportional to the electromotive force of the current which
produces it ; and (3) that the instrument can be graduated, and its
graduation verified by comparison with instruments of greater precision,
and thus used for the measurement of differences of potential of longer
duration.
    The diagrams          1, 2, and 4 illustrate^ the    bearing of these three pro
perties on the cases we have to investigate.                As we shall see, a muscle
can be brought into action either by an instantaneous stimulus, by a
series of stimuli, or by continuous stimulation.                  Each of these has its
mechanical and          its  electrical response. I will anticipate so far as to say
that the three forms of electrical response correspond to the three
forms of mechanical.             They correspond to the changes indicated by the
black lines in the three diagrams.             I will further premise that all known
                              —
excitatory responses all electrical cluinges which are concomitants of action
— may    be compared         with one of these types.
    Case   1. — Besponse to a continuous stimulation.                    A  difference  of
potential comes into existence at the contacts at the time t, and persists
long enough to produce its full effect on the column.                   (Diagram 1 .)

photographically and of interpreting the cnrves was described by Prof. Einthoven
in Pfluger's ' Archiv ' in 1894, and applied by him to the investigation of the
electromotive phenomena of the human heart.            It need scarcely be added that the
two methods are the same in principle.            An important paper has also recently

    Now I have found that in the study of my experimental results it
is of great advantage to proceed a priori. Let us assume that there
 are three types of stimulation, and that each has its form of response.
We can best begin by inquiring to which of these three forms the
observed     variation belongs, and then determine           in what respects it
conforms with, or differs from, the type.
    In the diagrams, I have shown the types of photographic curves
which correspond to the three forms of response to stimulation I have
indicated. The faint lines represent photographic curves ; the strong,
variations of potential-difference.        In each diagram the strong and the
faint lines have been drawn in their true mathematical relation to each
other, i.e., so that the vertical distance apart of strong from faint is every
where proportional to the gradient or slope of the photographic curve, the
proportion being such that if the E.M.F. of the atirent acting on the electro

mercury column would be expressed by the faint line.   We shall see us
we proceed that one or other of the three forms of photographic curve,
which correspond to the three forms of electrical change, just desig
nated as typical, presents itself in every excitatory response we have
to investigate, provided that, as I mentioned just now, the changes
under one contact only are recorded.
  To ensure this, the exploring contacts must be so arranged, and the
muscle itself so prepared, as to enable us to separate the part of the
surface we desire to investigate from the rest, so far as concerns its
effect on the instrument we are using as indicator. It is obvious that
when we apply our leading-off electrodes to two parts of the surface,
both of which are at the same time undergoing change, there must
always be a difficulty in determining how far the effect is due to
changes at the one or at the other contact. It is therefore essential
for the correct observation of an electrical change at one of them, that
the other should be protected from disturbing influences.

                               taken by the wave in its progress from p to d.
nctually happens at the moment the wave passes under p. It means
that a current suddenly appears there, of which the direction is from
p to d. When the wave reaches d, a second effect of the same kind (D1)
occurs, of which the direction is opposed to the first. What the gal-
vanoscopic effect of this must be is easily understood from Diagram 4,
in which the two curves       P   and D are placed in a relative position to
each other which expresses their time-relation.             The two effects sum
together.     In the diagram    the curve    S expresses  the  result of that sum
mation, i.e., the actual variations of difference of potential between the
contacts which occurred while the wave was passing from p to d.                    It
will be seen at once why we call this effect the diphasic variation.
   I explained before, that in accordance with the fundamental pro
perties of our instrument the curve          P  would have as its photographic
expression the curve P.          Similarly the combination-curve         S", would

       awl Plants     to the   Electrical Phenomena associated ivith it.         47
have for its photographic counterpart the curve S. May                 I emphasize
the point that if you have the curve           P  of a parallel-fibred muscle, you
can calculate from     it S    and consequently S, but that from S alone you
cannot deduce       the others.       In other words, if you know the form
    P
of , you know everything             as  to the form of the electrical response —
the lieizwelle.
    Let us now take the actual result. As before stated, the two contacts
are at p and d, and the muscle is excited at r. The wave affects the
muscle first &tp then at d, and the consequent movement of the column
is photographed (Photo. 1).
                                      Photograph 1.*
    You recognise that it is the counterpart of the deduced curve S. In
other words it is the expression of the effects of two similar processes
 having their seats at the two contacts.             Our aim must now be, as       I
 have explained, to annul or suspend the effect of one of them, leaving
 the other intact. The method is simple.              After having obtained the
 record I have shown you, I tie a fine thread round the muscle between
p and d. I tighten the ligature so as to constrict the muscle and again
 record the variation. There is no change of effect, for the wave is still
 able to pass the constriction. I tighten again : it still passes.           I then
 draw the ends of the ligature hard, and again photograph.                    I find
 the photographic curve is no longer S but P, i.e., it has assumed the
 characteristic form of the nvmophmic electrometer curve (Photo. 2).
    What has the ligature effected ? It has exercised no influence on
 either contact, but it has arrested the progress of the excitatory wave,
 so that its effect at p only is manifested, and not that at d. The rela
 tion between the two curves (P and S) is obvious enough when they
 are seen in succession.        It will be still more obvious if I place them on
 the screen together, in such           a way that they are in synchronic rela
 tion to each other (Photo. 3).

   The experiment may be further varied by altering the seat of                        excita

state from the living structural elements on one side to those on the
other; but if we compare the condition of the unexcited preparation
immediately before and after the application of the ligature, we find
evidence that breach of continuity of function is not the only effect
produced by it.       If the one contact is placed on the ligatured part it
is found that, irrespectively of any excitation, there exists a large
difference of potential between the contacts, which may amount to
four or six hundredths of a volt.
                                 The Muscle Current.
   Now it is easy to prove that this difference is not due to breach of
continuity, for if you shove the electrode away from the ligature in
either direction it disappears.        The phenomenon which is thus brought
to light is that to which the great founder of animal electricity, du
Bois-Reymond, applied the term "muscle-current," and when the
 method I have described is employed, it presents itself in its utmost
simplicity — for by the act of tightening the ligature previously applied
under an electrode, you at once bring into existence a state of things in
 which the constricted part is negative to the living parts on either side.
   What happens in this case 1 What is the difference between the
state of the surface of contact immediately before and immediately
after the tightening of the ligature ? Nothing more can be said than
that a certain process which was going on there and which provisionally
we call " life," being ignorant of its nature, has been annulled.                What
 we actually observe may be represented diagrammatically thus : —

                                     as shown            Before tightening the
    ligature between them they are equipotential, because they both rest
    on muscle in the same physiological state.         I represent the electrical
    concomitant of that state by an arrow, by which I mean nothing more
    than that if it were possible to connect p with some other part of the
    muscle, without passing through another electromotive surface, there
    would be a current in that circuit from p to the galvanometer. But
    inasmuch as the actual circuit passes through d where the same condi
    tions exist as &tp, but opposed in direction, there is no current.      If by
     tightening the ligature    I annul   the effect of d, the effect of p comes
    into evidence.     This statement is simple, and seems to arise naturally
     from the observed facts ; but cannot be received without question, for
     it suggests that what we call the " demarcation current" has its seat,
     not at the surface of demarcation, but at the living surface, so that we
     should have to consider the state of " Sfromlosigkeii not as a state of

evidence that, although the whole muscle is in circuit, the presence of
the wave cannot reveal itself until it is under the electrode. As regards

   We may now resume our consideration of the form of the propagatcil
monophasic variation, or excitatory wave. It would bo easy to prove by
the exhibition of numerous photographs of the monophasic variation
relating to different muscles, that all have the same characteristic
features, indicating that in each muscular element the electrical change
culminates from two to six thousandths of a second after excitation,
according to the physiological state of the muscle and the time it has
been kept, subsiding at first abruptly, afterwards more gr.uliuilly, so
that its whole duration (i.e., to the summit of the electrometer curve)
amounts to from two to six hundredths of a second.                 V         I
   The discoverer of the Reiswelk, Professor Bernstein, assigned to it a
very different duration.      " In every element of muscular structure,
the variation lasts between 1/250 and 1/300 second, and coincides with1
the period of latent stimulation." At first sight this statement seems irre-
concileable with fact, but it is much less so than it appears to be.    We
have only to assume that Bernstein's    method   of estimating  a small and
transitory difference of potential between two surfaces, was not suffi
ciently delicate to enable him to appreciate those which exist during
the period of decline, and that what he regarded as the duration of the
whole variation, was in reality the duration of its summit only. How
ever this may be, it is clear that we may divide the period of variation
into two parts, which we may call respectively the initial rise and the
decline, of which the latter lasts eight to ten times as long as the for
mer ; and that we may regard the first as a period of upset, the second
as & period of restoration.    Taking thf period of upset as equivalent to

              " negative Schuxtnkiing," we can accept all he says        as to its
coincidence in time with the moment of greatest intensity of the pro
cess by which chemical is transformed into mechanical energy — the
moment     in the shortening of an unloaded muscle at which its rate of
change increases most rapidly.      As regards the period of decline, it might
suggest itself that the return of each element to its previous state is in
every instance the expression of an anabolic process, not merely a
reiult of the cessation of the opposite process. The facts we are con
sidering, however, lead us for the present to regard the whole varia
tion as the concomitant of one and the same chemical process, and we
are' confirmed in this view by the observation that, as we shall see im
mediately, the modifications which the monophasic variation undergoes
under external or accidental conditions affect both stages equally.
   Of these conditions one of the most important is temperature, par
ticularly when muscles which have been kept for some time in physio
logical" salt solution are used.*      We have hitherto had in view the Sar-
tonus   which   has  been  kept   for some   twenty-four hours, and is at the
temperature of about 10° C.           By placing it in a cooler! chamber at
a temperature      some  6°  C.  lower,  and allowing it to remain there until
it lias acquired the temperature of its environment, its mode of re-

trkction is resisted, its period of effort is of longer duration. Conse
 quently it is able to do more external work in a single, effort than
before, although it is not able to support a heavier weight or maintain
a greater tension in a continuous effort.             Now all these modifications
 depend, so far as I have been able to ascertain, on diminution of the
rate   of   propagation of the excitatory wave.               As has been already
stated, we are able to measure this rate with great facility and accu
 racy.- By alternately cooling and warming our chamber we can deter
mine in any number of instances the change of rate which a difference
of 2°,. 4°, or 6° C. produces, and compare the data so obtained with the
effeets of the same changes on the duration of the monophasic variation
and on that of the mechanical effort which it accompanies.

   Up to this point the phenomena we have had under consideration
have been associated with the response of a muscle to a single instan
taneous excitation, i.e., the monophasic variation and the momentary
contraction which it ushers in. We must now pass on to the considera
tion of the electrical concomitants of those forms of contraction• which
more obviously resemble the natural action' of muscles.     .   ¦ "• ;
   Physiologists have for half a century taught that natural muscular
.action, whether reflex or voluntary, is made up of single contractions
of definite duration, such as those we have been considering, i.e., of a
rhythmical series of such contractions of definite frequency.    This doc
      —
trine that voluntary motion is a well organised system of twitches — js
now commonly expressed by calling it a tetanus, a word which wiis
some fifty years ago diverted from its medical signification to be
adopted as a technical term in physiology, but not precisely\in its .pre
sent sense. What is now meant by it is that every contraction, hoAv-
                                                                     ¦
over continuous it may appear to be, is in reality discontinuous.      "Tnis
conclusion was arrived at by a method which, though sometimes• of
great value to the physiologist, does not always lead to the discovery
of truth — the method which consists in first imitating a natural pro
cess, and then mentally transferring the characteristics of the imitation
process to the natural process which it represents.        In the present
instance the study of artificial tetanus has taught us a largo proportion
of what we know as to the properties of muscle, but not much 'about
voluntary contraction.     In assuming the identity of thcv latter with
experimental tetanus, physiologists have perhaps minimised certain
fundamental difficulties and assigned undue value to certain analogies.'
   Of the difficulties, the most obvious one is that discontinuity could
not,   if it
         existed, be of any advantage.    For if we regard the muscular
system as the  mere instrument of the central nervous system, and every
muscular fibre as the instrument of the motor cell which governs         itj it
is difficult to see how subjecting that muscular fibre to a rhythm of its
own could have any other effect than to interfere with its efficiency.
Of the analogies the chief are, first, that just as when you listen to         a
muscle in artificial tetanus you hear       musical sound of which the
                                             a
frequency of vibration corresponds to that of the stimuli, so a- muscle
when contracting voluntarily gives out the rywrsi-musical    sound, which
Wollaston compared to the rumble of wheels over pavement.              The
other analogy relates to the reflex spasm of strychnine, which          not
                                                                        is
only rhythmical in itself, but      accompanied by
                                   is                 aseries of electrical
changes which are as rhythmical as       they were evoked by series df

inquiry   : the spasm of strychnine will be considered after we have

     The point to which     I  have first to draw your attention is the form of
  photographic curve which is obtained when the Sartorius, injured under
  one electrode by a ligature, is excited by a series of stimuli of which
  the  frequency      is about 60 per second.          The photograph  shows that
                                      Photograph   6.*
 the column       rises at first abruptly, but afterwards in such a way
 that the rate at which it rises is at any moment proportional to it*
 distance from the point to which it will eventually arrive, i.e., to the
 distance between ,the corresponding point of the curve and its asymp
 tote.    The electrical state, therefore, which comes into existence when
 a musqle is tetanised (;>., subjected to a frequent series of excitations)
 corresponds to diagram 1.          In other words, the electrometer is acted
 on by the same difference of potential between its terminals through
 out; with the exception that the effect of the first, or first couple, of
 excitations    is often greater than    that of the succeeding ones.    Although
 this hardly needs proof, it can be easily verified by direct experiment.
 With this view our circuit is so arranged that we can, without altering
 the resistance, project on to a second photographic plate the effect of
 allowing a constant difference of potential to act on the mercury column
 just| as the plate is passing behind the slit.           On comparing this curve
 with the tetanus curve they are found to be nearly identical.
    .Lot us now take the case in which a muscle is tetanised in the same
 way as in the last instance for a succession of periods of one-fifth second,
alternating with equal periods of rest (Photo. 7). The complete cor
respondence        of the photographic         curve with that represented in

diagram 2 indicates that the conditions correspond with those which
are there theoretically represented.          During each period of excitation
(tetanus)   the  movement      upwards    of the  meniscus is determined by the
difference of potential.        During the intervals it follows in its fall the
similar curve of depolarisation.

    From this we may now proceed to other forms of experiments
 tetanus  in which the excitations are less frequent. Provided that the
 frequency is not much less than 40 per second, the general contour of
 the curve resembles the other one, with the exception that the effect of
each excitation is seen separately (Photo. 8).              If the frequency is
diminished to 20 per second the undulations are more ample, while the
                                    Photograph   S.t
curve rises to a lower level, the reason obviously being that the electro
meter is acted on by a smaller numtar of excitations in a given time.

 although the reflex spasm resembles a short artificial tetanus as regards
the way in which the muscle contracts, the contractions are shown by
their electrical concomitants         to be of a different nature.       The strych
nine spasm, as it is rightly called, is seen not to be a tetanus, i.e., not
to consist of a series of single twitches, but to be a succession of con
tinuous contractions,        the rhythm of which depends on the spinal cord,
not on the muscle.
                                      Photograph   10.*
    The grounds on which this conclusion is founded appear to me to be
unequivocal.         The observation is a simple one.                The automatic
mechanism, which carries the photographic plate,                liberates as before,
at the beginning of the period of exposure, an induction current which
pricks the skin of the preparation. After an interval which may be
about a tenth of a second (during which a :/i«ws-psychological process is
going on in the spinal cord) the muscle responds.                 A curve is drawn
simultaneously by         the  writing  lever   to  which the end   of the muscle is
attached, which indicates that it is in spasm ;t but it is the photo
graphic curve which tells us the nature of that spasm. Each ascent of
the meniscus is seen to be the response, not to a single instantaneous,
but to a short continuous, stimulation, of which the duration can be
easily deduced by measuring the time interval between the beginning
and the culmination of an excursion.               By subjecting the muscle arti
ficially to series of excitations of similar duration with corresponding
intervals of inactivity, one can produce an imitation of the strychnine
spasm which, both in its mechanical and electrical characters, resembles
the natural one (see Photo. 7).

  ">8    Prof. J.  Burdon-Sanderson.         Relation    of Motion in Animals
      Before leaving the subject of the strychnine reflex, I must refer very
 briefly to such previous observations as bear on our present inquiry.
 The phenomenon ia of interest as being one which could not have been
 discovered had we not possessed the capillary electrometer.                  Its dis
 covery was, indeed, the outcome of the first attempt made by Professor
 C. Lovt'n to use that instrument for the investigation of the electrical
 properties of muscle just twenty years ago.             He was good enough to
 make for me the electrometer which was used in some of my own
 earliest    experiments.      Shortly   afterwards,     Mr.   Page     devised   the
 method     of obtaining     photographic     records of our own results and,
 amongst     others,  of  those  of  Love'n   relating to the strychnine spasm.
 Love'n's observation has served ever since as a support for the doctrine
 of discontinuity.      No one would be more willing than he would, if he
 were with us this afternoon, to recognise its true meaning.
     The conclusion to which all the facts we have had before us up to
 this moment lead, is that normal muscular action is the manifestation
 of what happens in the motor nervous system.                If this motor impulse
 is so short that we are obliged        to  call it instantaneous, the response is.
 correspondingly brief ; if it lasts longer, we call it continuous, recognis
 ing that the difference between the two is merely one of duration.
 In either case it is of the essence of the response that it is terminable.
 There is no difficulty in understanding on teleological grounds why a
 muscle must relax ; but of the mechanism by which it is brought about
 we know little, excepting that it is localised in the muscular structure.
 Each element — each tagma — returns to its status quo in the same way
in a curarised muscle as in a normal one ; but whether this power of
recovery is a process by itself, as some physiologists hold, is a question
which is at this moment much debated, but by no means settled.                   It is
only in so far as it relates to the electrical concomitants that it here
concerns us.       Without prejudice to the question whether, as Fick and
Gad maintain, the relaxation of a muscle is dependent on a special
chemical process or not, it falls within our present scope to inquire
vhether by comparing with a normal muscle, one which not only does
not relax but has been deprived of the faculty of relaxing, we can
arrive at any electrical indication of such a process. Fortunately we
have within reach a means by which this experiment can be made.
                The Continuous Response of a Veratrinised Muscle.
     The alkaloid veratrine* is an agent by which a muscle excited by an
instantaneous stimulus is deprived of its power of recovering itself.
The quantity of the alkaloid required to produce the effect is extremely
small.      The addition of one part in a million of veratrine to th&
    •  The veratrine       was kindly prepared
                     used                         by my friend    Professor  Dunstun,

 physiological salt solution in which a muscle has been kept for several
 hours, is sufficient to give it this property or, as it may be expressed,
                       "
 to " veratrinise        it thoroughly. The alteration of the properties of a
 muscle   by veratrine in such a way that it must continue an effort once
 begun, has been long known.               It is an example of perfectly continuous
 contraction.       Normal muscular contraction being regarded, as I have
 said, as discontinuous,       the relation between it and the continuous con
traction of veratrinised muscle has not been sufficiently considered.
 When therefore we set to work to measure the maximum contractile
                 " veratrine
effect of a                     spasm," I was both surprised and gratified to
discover that the tension of a veratrinised muscle, when excited by a
single instantaneous         stimulus. was as great as that of a similar but
unveratrinised muscle when subjected to a succession of stimuli, i.e.,
when artificially tetanised.            It can also lift as great a load and hold it
up for several (10 — 20) seconds at as            great   a height.   (Tracings shown.)
    We then proceeded           to investigate the electrical concomitant of the
 veratrine "tetanus,"         if I may so call it (Photo. 11) and found it to
 he identical with that of an artificial tetanus produced by a succession
of stimuli of sufficient frequency.                Its true character can be best
judged     of by comparing           it with Photo.       12, which    was obtained    by

in the way before explained (p. 54).

on the mode of action of a particular chemical substance, but from the
evidence it affords that discontinuity is not essential to energetic
display of contractile force. In this respect it would be wholly
irrelevant to object that the data derived from experiments on a
poisoned muscle cannot be applied to a normal one.           All that it is
required to prove is that it is possible for a spasm which is not dis
continuous to be as effectual for the doing of external work as a normal
contraction. It can hardly be disputed that the contraction of a vera-

 an    intrinsic  nervous    system that it has this property.        In another
 important respect it resembles the motor apparatus of the cord, namely,
 that its relations to stimuli are governed by what has been called the
 " all or not at all " principle. It either does not respond or, if at all,
 responds completely.           In these respects, therefore, the action of the
 l|eart is comparable neither with that of muscle acting independently,
 nor even with that of the muscle nerve preparation, but rather with
that of muscle acting under the direction of the motor neuron which
governs it.
    ,1 began the investigation of the electrical phenomena of the heart's
beat in 1881 with Mr. Page.               We made out two new facts, namely,
that the electrical change which is evoked by excitation of the surface
is propagated, at a rate dependent on temperature, not in one direction
only but in all, as Engelmann had already shown to be the case with
regard to the wave of contraction ; and secondly, that the monophasic
variation is not, as had been supposed by previous observers, an instan
taneous change, but lasts during the whole period of energetic systole.
But neither Mr. Page nor I understood then the nature of the initial
" spike," which is so striking a feature in the photographic record of
this variation in the uninjurrd heart.         For its explanation I am indebted
to Mr. Burch, whose investigations on the use of the capillary electro
meter for measuring the electromotive force of -currents of short
duration have been of so much value to physiologists. The moment it
was understood that the spike indicated a diphasic variation analogous
to that of the muscle, I felt that I had the key to the complete under
standing of my own previous observations.                I was, moreover, able to
bring these into complete harmony with those of Professor Engelmann
made about the same time with the rheotome and galvanometer.
     Let me ask your attention to the photographic curves of the diphasic
and monophasic variations which I have placed one above the other in
synchronic relation to each other.            It is to be noticed that the move
ment of the recording surface is very slow, about a centimetre a second
only. To obtain the monophasic curve you have to place the distal
electrode on a spot which has been devitalised by scorching, and which
is consequently physiologically inactive, the proximal electrode on the
living surface near the junction between auricle and ventricle. The
instantaneous       stimulation is applied to the auricle some couple of
millimetres distant from the proximal leading-off electrode.            The J'ri--
nvlle is propagated from the auricle to the base of the ventricle and
then on to the devitalised spot, so that before it arrives at the contact
it is extinguished.* Consequently the change which is expressed by
the electrometer-curve         takes place exclusively at the proximal contact-
surface.       It differs only from the monophasic variation of skeletal
    * This mode of observation corresponds to the first fundamental eiperiraent  in
 muscle (tee p. 45).

muscle in the longer duration of the period which intervenes between
culmination and decline, and consequently bears a greater resemblance
to the effect of a short continuous       excitation of muscle than to that of
an instantaneous      one.
    Turning to the diphasic variation obtained when the surface under
lying the distal contact is not devitalised, we see that during the whole
intervening period just referred to, the two contact surfaces are ap
proximately equipotential.         This of course does not mean that both
are physiologically inactive, but simply that the influence of the one
exactly balances that of the other.            This meaning of the diphasic
variation is (with the exception of the initial spike) that which was
assigned to it in 1882.       It results from the mutual interference of two
monophasic variations, the dip of the curve at the end indicating that
the effect of the distal contact overlasts that at the proximal.
    The general result of these observations is that, just as from the
mechanical point of view the systole of the ventricle has lately been
shown to be entirely analogous to the response of a muscle to an in
stantaneous stimulus, provided that we substitute volume for length
and lateral pressure for tension, t so as regards the electrical phenomena

 there is a 'complete analogy between the monophasic and diphasic
variation of the heart and of muscle, respectively, provided that we
bear in mind that the one is a response to a short continuous stimula
tion, the other to an instantaneous     one.

   My last example of motion and its accompanying electrical phe
nomena    I will take from the plant. As everyone knows, there are
certain parts of some of the higher plants which respond to stimulation
like the motor organs of animals.       These instances have been regarded
as indications of the close relationship which exists between plants and
animals as regards their elementary physiology.          The subject attracted
the  attention  of Mr.  Darwin   in relation to  certain insectivorous plants,
and it was at his suggestion that the observations to which I am now
about briefly to refer, were made. The electrical changes can be most
easily studied and appear in the most striking way in the leaf of
Dionaea.    The leading-off contacts are applied to the opposite surfaces
of one lobe of the leaf.    In the resting state the one surface is found
to be positive to the other. At a certain moment, a hair on one lobe
some 10 or 12 millimetres away from the place under investigation, is
touched by a camel-hair pencil or excited by an induction current.
The surface which was before positive becomes less so, and the curve
described resembles, as you see, the monophasic heart curve.
   It is not necessary on the present occasion to do more than refer to
this typical experiment, by which it was shown for the first time that
the migration of liquid, and consequent sudden closure of the lobes on
excitation, is accompanied by an electrical change analogous to that in
contracting muscle, and that in the leaf this is propagated at a rate
varying with temperature.       Although the experiment is one of extreme
simplicity the method of investigation has not, so far as I know, been
pursued by any plant physiologist. The criticisms which were bestowed
on it by animal physiologists I was able to answer in my second com
munication to the Royal Society, and have now the satisfaction to find
that the experimental data set forth in that paper are given in full in
                                         '
Biedermann's important treatise on Electro-Physiology.' .
   I have now, thongh in a very incomplete way, described the pheno
mena bearing on my subject so far as           I  have been able to observe
them.     May  I  be permitted to submit to you the indications which
they seem to me to afford t
   In striated muscle the primary effect of every excitation is a process
of oxidation having its seat at the excited part. It may be surmised
that this consists of two stages, namely, liberation of previously intra
 molecular   oxygen, and actual oxidation.           In a single element of

muscular structure the duration of this process, when induced by an
instantaneous     stimulus, must be exceedingly short, and corresponds
with that of the excitatory variation ; but in the whole organ may
last until the development of tension has reached its maximum.
    We have further learned that the monophasic variation is a pheno
menon of great regularity, ami may be taken as the type from which
all other forms of response to stimulation may be derived, either by
 repetition, prolongation, or interference.
    Although no attempt has been made to settle the question whether
 the natural contraction of muscle is discontinuous, it has been shown
that the electrical phenomena of reflex contraction afford no ground
for supposing that it is so. The efficiency of the veratrine spasm
 seems, at least, to justify us in doubting whether discontinaity is an
 essential quality of muscular contraction.
     Finally, reasons have been given for thinking that the phenomena
known as the " muscle current and the " demarcation current are

    In the      '
          Annals of Botany for 1897,* one of us published a short
note on a curious organism — or rather association of organisms —
obtained in Paris, and said to have come from Madagascar, where it
occurs as           " an excrescence on the
                                            sugar-cane."
    It    consistsof a bacterium associated with at least one yeast, and
grows in saccharine solutions, producing clumps so like the ginger-beer
plantt that the assumption seemed warranted that we had here a
symbiosis of the same kind as that proved to occur there.
    Moreover, the general course of events in the use of this body, which
is employed to make a fermented effervescing drink from common
brown sugar in water, points to the same conclusion.
    In moderately strong solutions containing 15 to 20 per cent, of
 common sugar in water, the clumps referred to induce a powerful fer
 mentation, resulting in the liberation of relatively enormous quantities
 of carbon dioxide and some acid, the saccharine liquid being thus
 converted into a not unpleasant acid drink, with some resemblance
 to lemonade or ginger-beer.
    From the fact that this fermentation occurs rapidly when the corked
 flask is entirely filled with the recently boiled sugar solution, infected
 with a few clumps of the organism, it is clear that oxygen is not
 necessary in any quantity.
    This conclusion is also confirmed by the observation that if a bottle
of soda-water is opened, and a handful of sugar added with a few of
the clumps, and at once corked and wired, the pressure of the carbon
dioxide liberated during the active fermentation which at once ensues
becomes so great in three or four days at 22° C., as to cause danger of
bursting the flask ; and if a manometer tube with mercury is attached,
as described in the paper above referred to,J the bubbles of gas pressed
out come off steadily for many days, or even weeks, at ordinary
temperatures, until no more sugar is left.
    The general resemblances to the well known kephir, also referred to
in the previous paper, led one of us to repeat the above experiments
with sugar and milk, instead of soda-water, with the result that carbon
dioxide came off as before until all the sugar had disappeared, the milk
meanwhile undergoing coagulation into clots, but since these clots
remained unaltered for weeks or months, this experiment suggests

that the organism— unlike kephir — does not ferment the milk itself,
but only the added sugar, and that the clots are simply due to the acids
liberated as the sugar is destroyed, a conclusion fully borne out by
subsequent investigations.
    A preliminary experiment with the ginger-beer plant showed that it
also behaves in the same way as regards milk ; the fermentation only
occurs   if sugar   be added, and lasts  only so long  as  any sugar remains.
    In the cases both of the present organism and of the ginger-beer
plant, if a clump be placed in sterilised beer wort, the resulting fermen
tation gives a frothing liquid with a beer-like taste and smell, and a
rapid deposit of yeast occurs.       This primary fermentation is very soon
finished, and it is abundantly proved by the experiments that this
medium favours the yeast — or one of the yeasts — in the clumps, so
that we may regard this fermentation as merely a particular case of
an impure alcoholic fermentation, such as is got in ordinary brewing.
    During these preliminary trials, and with the object of testing
whether acidification of the liquid from the first would affect the matter,
it happened to one of us to select lemon-juice as the medium in one
case, partly to acidify the medium, and partly to add vegetable matter
other than sugar. The result was somewhat astonishing.            The mixture
of soda-water, sugar,      and  lemon    passed   into violent fermentation   in
 three days, and carbon dioxide came off abundantly, under a pressure
 of about 12 inches of mercury, and continued to do for many days.
    Such a flask started on    April  9, 1897, was evolving gas actively on
 the 12th   ; this went on without any apparent diminution until May 24,
and even on       June 24 gas was still coming off, though now under less
 pressure.     No sugar had been added in the interval, and the flask,
 still unopened, remained on a side bench in the laboratory until
January 18, 1898. On that date it was opened and examined.                    It
 still stood at a pressure of 6 inches of mercury, and gave off gas as
 soon as the pressure was reduced.             The microscopic examination
 showed that here, again, as in the beer wort, the medium had favoured
 one of the yeasts, and although the bacterium was discoverable, it was in
 abeyance, and the compound organism as a whole was not increasing.
    In another similar case the flask was started on May 28, 1897, and
 the pressure of the gas evolved was still supporting nearly 12 inches of
 mercury on April 23, 1898, and again only yeast predominated in the
 deposit, and examination showed this to be fully alive; it at once
 renewed its activity when placed in sugar solutions.
     These preliminary experiments will suffice to show that we have in
 this compound of associated organisms an agent or agents capable of
 setting up very active fermentation in various saccharine liquids, such
 as ordinary sugar and water, or soda-water, beer wort, milk, and sugar,
 or an infusion of vegetable substance, such as lemon pulp, and it is
 clear that the fermentation,     though differing in details in each case,

always results in the destruction of the sugar, and the production of
enormous quantities of carbon dioxide.            Obviously, also, these fermen
tations are anaerobic.
    In order to put this last point beyond all cavil, however, we placed
a clump of the- compound organism             into a mixture of a 15 per cent,
solution of sugar to which 10 per          cent, gelatine had been added, and
kept the tubes      at 30°   C.,  while the  air was  pumped out from the fluid
mass and pure carbon dioxide allowed to filter in, and this process was
repeated four or five times, and the de-oxygenated gelatine, still in an
atmosphere of carbon dioxide, was then allowed to set. In a fortnight
the solid gelatine in all these tubes had visible submerged colonies
throughout the mnss, and examination showed these to consist of the
bacterium and yeast found in the original clumps.
    Similarly, streak cultures on the same sugar-gelatine medium, grew
normally on the sloped surface in tubes filled with carbon dioxide, and
in these again were observed the same bacterium and the same yeast as
had been found predominating in the original clumps.
    These    cultures — still preliminary in nature and only dealing with
 the composite organisms of the clumps as a whole— suggested an
obvious method for separating at least this prominent bacterium and
yeast from the clumps.
    Sugar-gelatine, made as before, was infected with a small piece of a
clump, rubbed up by a platinum loop in sterile water, and plates made
in the ordinary way in Petri dishes ; the dishes were then placed under
a receiver, attached to the pump and exhausted, and then filled with
carbon dioxide, with proper precautions as to the purity of the gas,
filtration through cotton-wool plugs, &c., and the cultures put aside in
an atmosphere of carbon dioxide at the ordinary temperature.                 In a
week     the  solid  gelatine    showed   two   kinds of colonies, one consisting
entirely of a yeast, the other of a bacterium, and closer investigation
showed them to be identical with the prevailing yeast and bacterium
in the original clumps.
    Repeated plate-cultures made in this way gave consistently the same
results, and there was no room for doubt that these are the two essential
organisms of the clumps, though they are not the only species found
in the original material, there being at least one other yeast-like
organism, so common that for some time it was thought it must play
an essential part. Since this latter — and certain much rarer forms
occasionally found — will not grow in the atmosphere of carbon dioxide,
however, there can be little doubt that the two anaerobic microbes
 isolated by the above process are the essential constituents in the
 fermentations referred to.
     Their further separation by means of repeated plate-cultures, as
 above, was comparatively easy, the yeast especially being readily
  picked out and further cultivated in sugar-gelatine tubes.

     As it is not at present proposed to deal with the yeast, which                              ap
pears to be a mere variety of S. cerevisice, we pass on to the cultures of
the bacterium only.
    On repeating the plate cultures exactly as before, except the exhaus
tion and filling with carbon dioxide, it was found that mixtures of the
yeast and bacillus grew as well in air as in carbon dioxide.           At first it
seemed possible that this was because the yeast rapidly consumed the
oxygen and so prepared an oxygen-free atmosphere for the bacterium,
but further experiments proved that this is not necessary, and that
both yeast and bacterium can be grown in air as well as in carbon
dioxide or in hydrogen.
    The appearance of the separated bacterium on the sugar-gelatine
plates is that of circular, raised, dome-shaped, watery-looking colonies,
stiff, like a firm jelly, and lifting as a whole on the needle.             Each
colony       is,

chains, the cell-walls of which are so swollen as to furnish the zoogloea

though    much  longer  rods  and filaments  occur  in other   media.
    Having once obtained the organism in pure culture,                   was, of   it
course, easy to test its behaviour on various media.          It unnecessary  is
to enumerate all the media tried, or to give details of the cultures,
which amount to several hundreds            enough that all ordinary media

special ones devised to meet the suggestions which arose during the
course of the investigation.
  A striking fact comes out on surveying these cultures, namely, this
Schizomycete    practically refuses to grow in or on any pabulum devoid
of sugar, and, further, only certain sugars are capable of supplying                              it
with its necessary food.    No growth at any temperature could be
obtained           in normal gelatine-peptone     media, or in broth, milk, or other
animal       extracts,      e.g.,   serum-agar,   such    as      is   used   by the animal
pathologists.

manner.
   On saccharonal-yeast-extract-gelatine     similar raised streaks were
obtained, but less luxuriant than on brown sugar; possibly because
the temperature was lower, or only 10 per cent, saccharose was em
ployed, or from lack of minerals.
   Beer-wort gelatine gave very slight indications of growth, soon
stopping, and never attaining anything like these dimensions, the mere
traces observed being probably due to saccharose in the wort.
   Certain mineral solutions — e.g., Kleb's solution — appeared to inhibit
the growth in the black sugar and gelatine.
   We have here gathered together the principal facts of its behaviour
on gelatine media, because they seem to bring out clearly that the
gelatine itself has little or no part to play in the nourishment of the
bacillus: mere traces of superficial liquefaction occur, and several
experiments show that it is of no slight importance what is added to
the gelatine, e.g., the surprising results of beer-wort gelatine.
                                      Ayar.
   Agar (2 per cent.) made up with black sugar and yeast water rapidly
formed large slimy blister-like colonies in four days, both at 25° C. and
at 19° C. The contrast between these large, slimy, flat, and extended
colonies and the small, raised, dome-like, stiff ones, on gelatine was very
marked.
   Streak cultures on black sugar agar, with yeast extract, grew rapidly
as a dull, honey-like slime, spreading all over the surface in two days
at 16—18° and at 23 — 25° C., as well as at 36—37° C.
   Agar made up with peptone, &c., was of no use whatever, nor was
potato-agar.    Even peptone-agar with black sugar proved unsuitable.
   Similarly unsuitable was agar made up with yeast extract and sac
charose, which had been filtered through porcelain, though a pale
dotted streak formed at first at 25, 27, and 31° C.
   Agar (2 per cent.) made up with 10 per cent, saccharose and yeast
extract not filtered through porcelain, on the other hand, was an
excellent medium.     In twenty-four hours at 30 — 31° C., a rapidly
growing slimy streak had formed, consisting of filaments up to 60 /*
long and more, breaking up into segments of all lengths down to l-o           /<.

well in gentian violet by Gram's method, and were non-motile.             At
23J and 20° C. the growth was similar but slower.
   Wort-agar, however, was unsuitable, cultures parallel with the above,
showing very slight growths at any temperature ; results quite conform
able with previous experience.
   Here, again, we must conclude that the agar is of little or no import
ance, except as a support.    The significance of the failure on agar, to
which porcelain-filtered yeast extract and saccharose was added, appears
significant, and we shall return to this in order to discuss what happens
to the yeast extract and sugar when this mode of sterilisation alone is
relied on.
                                 Beer  Wwi.
   In beer wort (unhopped)     the bacterium       grows fairly well at first,
rapid turbidity following the infection, and a dirty yellowish deposit
soon falls, consisting of the flocculent bacterial masses carrying down
colouring matter ; but the liquid is not viscous, and the deposit scarcely
slimy, and growth soon ceases.
   When we reflect that beer wort— ;>., malt extract — is usually an
excellent medium for the growth of fungi, it is somewhat surprising
that this sugar-loving bacterium should do so badly in it. Thinking
that the failure might be owing to the kind of sugar in beer wort being
unsuitable, we tried adding saccharose, but no obvious improvement
was effected.    We have seen (p. 69, above) that beer wort and gelatine
gave poor results, and we concluded provisionally that some unfavour
able substance occurs in wort.
   Struck by the success of the preliminary trials with cane sugar, and
remembering the alleged original habitat of the organism, it was deter
mined to try the effect of beet : this was done not only because beet
is a well-known source of cane sugar, but also because one of us had
previously observed in a certain beet disease, that a bacterium very
similar to the one under investigation spreads in the tissues of the
sugar-beet, and is connected in some way with the disease itself.
                                Bee t Extract.
    Cold water extract of crushed sugar-beet was found at an early stage
 of the work to be a favourable medium.          In tubes at 25° C., cultures
in carbon dioxide rapidly become turbid, and on the third day, a dense
slimy zooglrea-like deposit had fallen to the bottom carrying with it the
colouring matters, and containing embedded bacteria.            The same at
 15° C. in carbon dioxide, the growth being simply somewhat slower.
   Parallel cultures — from the same tubes — in broth, gelatine, or agar,
devoid of sugars, showed no growth either in air or in carlxm dioxide,
at 15° or at 25° C.

   Tubes of raw beetroot, infected with the gelatinous bacterial clumps,
showed     evident sinking into the tissues in twenty-four to forty-eight
hours at 18", 25°, and 31°, and in six days the depressed area showed
collapsed and browned cells under' the microscope.             A curious white
zone surrounded the discoloured patches.            The impression gained was
that the bacterium draws out the sugary sap and thrives on it : no
proof of direct entry into the cell walls could be obtained.*
    Cooked, i.e., sterilised, beet gave a mere wet patch at first, but in a
week raised gelatinous lumps of the typical kind were formed.
    Here, then, we appeared to have proof that it is really the cane sugar
which decides the success or otherwise of the cultures of this gelatinous
bacterium, and we entered on what proved to be a very long series of
trials with various kinds of sugars to decide this.
                               Trials u-itli Sugars.
   A series of preliminary experiments in which cane-sugar, glucose,
and milk-sugar were employed, made up in various ways, soon showed
that this bacterium grows far better in cane-sugar than in the others,
and better in solutions made up with yeast-water than in such containing
mineral salts, asparagin, tartrates, &c.
   We, therefore, made series of parallel cultures at various tempera
tures, in air and in carbon dioxide, and all infected from the same tube,
using the following sugars and solutions :— Levulose, pure glucose,
cane-sugar, saccharon, lactose, maltose, dextrin, and a body known in
Griibler's catalogue as " dextrin-zucker-losung." The sugars were all
made up in 10 per cent, solutions, and definite quantities — equal in
each case — of the other ingredients added.
   Summing up the results of numerous experiments, it was found that
no growth occurred in any medium at temperatures of 35° C. and
upwards, except in the case of certain agar cultures, where rapid
growth occurred at and near 37° C. for a few days only.
                                   Cane-Sugar.
    The most striking results were obtained in all       cases with cane-sugar,
especially in a very pure re-crystallised form labelled
                                                                   " Saccharon,"
though we also employed ordinary lump-sugar, and a coarse dark brown
 moist sugar known locally as " Black sugar."
    Made up as Mayer's solution, the brown sugar rapidly became turbid
and viscous, and a dense gelatinous deposit of bacteria formed below

the surface.      This occurred even in tubes to which a few drops of abso
lute alcohol were added — a result not obtainable with dextrin-Mayer.
    Far better growth was got with cane-sugar and yeast-extract how
ever.
    The best growth was got with saccharon (10 per cent.) and yeast
extract, where at all temperatures from 16 — 27'5° to 31° C., the liquid
became opalescent and viscous in two or three days, and deposited the
typical gelatinous zoogloea at the bottom of the tubes.
    The results so far show that only the various forms of saccharose
and beet extract (containing this sugar) afford any pronounced growth
of this bacterium, the best results being got with pure saccharon and
yeast extract, as indicated by the rapid turbidity and viscosity and the
clump of gelatinous deposit.              Since other sugars seem quite unsuit
able, or only induced slight growths expressed as temporary turbidity
and flocculent deposits, it may probably be assumed that in " dextrin-
zucker "* and in " glucose solutions, where indication of the viscosity
                                    "
and gelatinous      deposit occur, traces of saccharose were contained.
                                        Glucose.
    Pure glucose and yeast-water encouraged an excellent growth at
first, the liquid becoming turbid and a flocculent deposit settling down
in a few days.           No signs of viscosity appeared, however, and the
deposit     was   quite loose and easily shaken up. The fairly abundant
flocculent growth at first led to the expectation that prolonged cul
tures, or cultivation at different temperatures, might result in the
development        of the typical sliminess and viscosity, but repeated
attempts show that such is not the case.                 This sugar did not appear to
injure   the   bacterium,    for   the  deposit   was   alive  after three weeks.
    Nor would it grow on or in gelatine made up with glucose.                        The
slight growth obtained          in   certain cases    where    commercial glucose was
used may have been due to admixtures.                     The total results show that
glucose is not a favourable medium.
                                    Levulose   (F-ruclose).
    Solutions of levulose prepared as the other solutions became slightly
turbid in three or four days, and then the bacteria deposited as a very
thin layer, no trace of slime or gelatinous matrix being formed, and
 the impression resulted that either traces of some other sugar must
have sufficed for what activity was evinced in ordinary glucose solu
 tions, because no growth worth mentioning compared with the pre
 ceding had occurred, or levulose is to a slight extent a food for the
 organism.
    * This proved to    be true  of this medium    ; it consists of dextrin and cane sugar
 with a little alcohol.

    Similar tubes placed in a vacuum also showed no growth beyond the
 formation of the flocculent deposit, hardly slimy, and easily shaken
 up into the clear supernatant liquid — a point of constrast of some
 importance, for in successful cultures in cane-sugar the viscosity of the
 liquid above is so great that it is very difficult to shake up the deposit,
 which is also dense and gelatinous.
    Repetitions of these cultures gave the same results — a rapid develop
 ment of a very slight turbidity and formation of a small non-gelatin
 ous deposit which falls and leaves the liquid clear.
    Some attempts were made to see if varying the strengths and
composition of the levulose solutions would affect the matter— «.r/.,
Mayer's solution made with levulose gave little or no signs of growth
at all with the bacterium, though it proved a splendid medium for the
yeast.
    Curiously enough, a mixture of beet extract and this levulose-
Mayer's solution, though it encouraged abundant growth of the
bacillus, rapidly becoming turbid and then clearing as the deposit
fell, showed no viscosity nor was the deposit slimy, as occurs in beet
extract alone.
    Even made up with yeast-extract, no viscosity could be obtained :
 nothing beyond the slight flocculence, and it wjis clear that levulose is
 at best a poor food material for this bacillus.
                               Mixed Sugars.
    Proceeding from the observation that the bacterium undoubtedly
inverts saccharose, cultures were made as follows: — Dextrose-yeast-
extract and levulose-yeast-extract were mixed, and infected with the
bacterium: an excellent growth of the organism resulted, at both
32° and 24° C., but the deposit which resulted, consisted entirely of
the non-sheathed bacterium in flocculent masses, and it remains a
puzzle why the sheaths are formed in saccharose and not in the
two sugars resulting from its inversion. The only conclusion seems
to be that proportion of constituents has something to do with the
matter.
                          " Dextrin-Zurker-Losunfj."
    Under the above name, Griibler supplies a syrupy sugar in which
the microscope shows delicate needle crystals, and — merely in the
spirit of trying all experiments — this was tried with the following
results : —

curious opalescent change in the liquid ahove the whitish dense deposit,,
and it became markedly viscous so as to draw out into strings.
    Made up in Mayer's solution also, the same viscidity and gelatinous
growth occurred, and this both in air and in hydrogen.        -We have since
learnt that this syrup consists  of  dextrin, cane-sugar, and a  little alcohol.

    The difficulty as to the nature of " Dextrin-Zucker             referred to
above, led IK to try dextrin itself, and owing to the kindness of Dr..
 Ruhremann some very pure material was to hand.                With Mayer's
solution several experiments demonstrated that no obvious growth
 occurred, and it was clear that this dextrin is not the same for
 nutritive purposes as the "Dextrin-Zucker" used previously.
    Nor was dextrin made up with yeast-water of any use, though
occasionally very slight indications of growth occurred during the
first twenty-four hours, but no viscosity or sheathed bacteria formed.
                                Malto-dextrin.
    Owing to the kindness of Mr. Ling, we were furnished with some
 prepared malto-dextrin, but neither as Mayer's solution, nor made up
 with yeast extract, was this sugar of any use as a medium for the
 growth of this bacterium.
                                    Maltose.
    This sugar, made up as Mayer's solution, was found unsuited for the
 bacterium, either at high or low temperatures.         Nor was it more suc
 cessful made up with yeast extract ; a faint turbidity and flocculence
 occurred, but no trace of viscosity at 25° occurred in four days.
                                 Milk-Sugar.
    Milk-sugar, whether made up with yeast-water, Mayer's solution,
asparagin, or peptone, proved quite useless as a food for the bacterium :
 no signs of growth appeared in the solutions at all, at high or low tem
 peratures, in air, or in carbon dioxide.         The organism was dormant
 only, however.
                                Soluble Starch.
    It seemed worth while, in view of the gelatinous nature of vigorous
 growths, to see how the bacterium would behave towards soluble
 starch, but in no case could any evidence of growth be obtained in
 solutions containing 2 per cent, of soluble starch made up with Mayer's

solution,    or with yeast-water.    The bacteria  lay dormant only at the
bottom, as experiments showed.
    It is evident from the foregoing that of all the sugars tried, saccha
rose is the one which favours the growth of the bacterium, but even in
saccharon the growth is distinctly favoured by the addition of yeast
extract.     Some experiments      were consequently    started to test the
effect of the yeast extract.
                               Haw Yinist-lVater.
    Fresh yeast, squeezed and drained, and then ground up with kiesel-
guhr and .extracted with water, was allowed to stand all night and
filtered through porcelain.       Employed alone it was of no use as a
medium for the growth       of the  bacterium ; nor would the latter develop
in this raw yeast-water, to which 5 per cent, of cane-sugar was added.
The latter fact was thought to be possibly due to the raw yeast-water
having inverted the saccharose, and we have seen that glucose and
levulose are not suitable media ; and we explained similarly the failure
of saccharon-Mayer's solution, to which this raw yeast-water was
added, as well as failures with brown sugar, and with beet extract
similarly made up. That failure should follow with dextrin, with
maltose, with levulose, milk-sugar, and with beer wort similarly made
lip, was only to be expected from experience with these media con
cocted with boiled yeast-water.
    Further experiments, however, led to the conviction that matters
were more complicated than would be implied by this explanation.
     At one stage in the investigation, being impressed by the stimulus
to growth afforded by the addition of (boiled) yeast-water to the saccha
rose solutions, we tried the effect of adding sugar to the raw yeast
extract and sterilising by filtration through porcelain only, and were
surprised to find that no growth whatever occurred at any temperature,
e.g., 18°, 23°, and 30" C.     This was afterwards explained as above —
the yeast extract inverts the sugar before it has time to filter.
     We then tried a series of experiments as follows : — Cultures at
 17 — 20°, 25', and 31° C., were made in 10 per cent, saccharon +
 10 per cent, yeast- water mixed raw and sterilised by filtration only;
 no traces of growth occurred in 10 days.            The same failure was
realised with 10 per     cent, saccharon alone sterilised by filtration only ;
with yeast extract only sterilised by filtration only ; and with yeast
extract sterilised by filtration and then boiled before adding to the
filtered sterile 10 per cent, saccharon solution. In no case did any sign
of growth occur.
     It  is therefore clear that the filter either holds back some body
 necessary for the nutrition of the bacterium, or destroys it in its passage
 through the pores. Also that raw yeast extract in some way spoils the

 sugar (saccharose) as a food material, probably by inverting it.                       And'
 nevertheless the hacterium flourishes in conjunction with the                        living
 yeast in saccharose solutions.               Here is a puzzle which we have not
  succeeded in explaining.
     It  may be merely noted that numerous trials were made in other
 media than those mentioned, among which glycerine and yeast extract,
 alcohol with saccharon and yeast extract, starch treated with diastase,
 also potato, carrot, and milk are the most important.                      No growth of
 significance      was    obtained    in   any   case,   and   the   results  may be neg
 lected.
                                The Acvlity of the Cultures.
    Several    tests showed         that the cultures       of the bacterium are acid^
 and the following experiments were made.                    Sterilised blocks of marble
 were placed in the culture tubes before they were steamed, and then.
 the infections       made as before.        In saccharose yeast extract, the active-
 growth which resulted was accompanied by a more diffused viscosity
 than before, and gas bubbles (CO^) ascended for days. Tubes of mixed
 dextrose and levulose with yeast extract, treated exactly similarly,
 became turbid, and gave off bubbles, but no trace of viscosity resulted -f
 the abundant flocculent deposit consisted entirely of the non-sheathed
 form of the bacterium.
    As will appear later, the acid which causes this liberation of COa is
 mainly acetic acid.
                   On the Nature of the Gelatinous Matrix or Slime.
    A   number of experiments were made to determine the nature of the
viscous slime and the jelly-like matrix holding the bacteria.                     Although
reasons have already been given for concluding that this is really
 nothing more than the swollen cell-walls or sheaths investing the
bacteria, the possibility of the opalescence and viscosity of the saccha
rose media being due to the direct action on the sugar of some enzyme
or other body excreted by the organism requires investigation, for it is
conceivable that such slimes might arise in any of three ways.
    (1) As products of metabolism from the interior of the cells, such as
certainly occur in the glands of higher plants, e.g., the mucilage hairs
of ferns.*
    (2) As products of the action outside the cells of some enzyme-like
body which escapes from the organism and acts directly on the sugar, t
    (3) As products of conversion of the cell-walls of the organism,
these swelling up and becoming diffluent as in the case of the ginger-

    It  seemed impossible to test the first suggestion on such minute cells,
but attempts        were made to test the second one by the following
experiment : —
    The bacterium       was grown in saccharose yeast extract inside a porce
lain filter plunged into the same solution ; the gelatinous matrix was
formed in abundance intiile the filter, but none was developed outside
although the liquids communicated freely through the pores of the
filter. Of course the reply may be made that an enzyme of this
nature may be unable to traverse the fine pores, and the question
must be regarded as still open.
    These gelatinous sheaths or "capsules" are now known in many
Schizomycetes, among the best examples being that of B. vermiform?'
and LeuconostocJ and it is now pretty generally agreed that these
sheaths are composed of dextran.J and Liesenberg and Zopf§ made a
curious observation with reference to its formation ; they found that
the addition       of calcium chloride favoured the development of the
sheath.
                                     Calcium Chlmide.
    Zopf's   paper suggested that we should test the effect of CaCla, and
accordingly solutions of Liebig's extract, peptone-saccharon, and CaCla
were tried.
    In the slightly alkaline liquid at 32° a mere shimmering turbidity
was observed in twenty-four hours, and in four days a dense gelatinous
clot formed below the turbid liquid.
    At 23° the alkaline liquid showed similar turbidity on the second
day, and had formed very little gelatinous deposit in four days.                 In a
week, however, it resembled that at 32° C.
    The same solution slightly acidulated with a drop of HC1 was
slightly more turbid in twenty-four hours, but very little of the jelly
formed even in a week.
    At    the end of the week both set of tubes were distinctly acid, and
evidently the formation of the jelly is favoured by the slight alkalinity
of   Cad,.
    This seemed to strengthen the supposition that our bacterium may
be the same as Van Tieghem's Leufonostoc,             but a close comparison does
not bear out this view.
     It  is nevertheless      interesting    to observe that Leueonostuc inverts

    The differences may bo important in various degrees.
appears smaller and shorter, and withstands high temperatures ; it
 succeeds well in grape-sugar ; its characters on gelatine media appear
 to be different ; it can be cultivated in milk, and it forms lactic acid
 in sugar solutions.
    How far the differences can be insisted upon cannot be determined
 until both organisms have been tested side by side.
    There is one further observation to be made in support of our con
 tention that the viscosity depends on the deliquescence of the swollen
 cell-walls. On agar media, which exude water, the growths are slimy
 rather than gelatinous, and the longer the gelatine cultures are kept,
 provided they are not allowed to evaporate, the more diffluent the
gelatinous lumps become. In liquid cultures, moreover, the gelatinous
 clot does not spread evenly through the liquid, but remains around
 the motionless organism.
                                Mixed Cultures.
    Several  attempts    were made to obtain       the typical  clumps of the
 compound organism by infecting tubes of yeast extract and saccharon
and other media with both the bacterium and the yeast separately
 cultivated pure.     The success was only partial, however, though it was
not difficult to obtain a viscous clot at the bottom of the tubes in
 which both bacteria and yeast were embedded, the typical stiff jelly
clumps floating in the liquid were not formed, and here again we
must conclude that some definite proportion of each is necessary.
            On the Chemical Cluingfs in<ident to the Fermentalions.
    The jelly-like masses of which the organism consisted set up a very
vigorous fermentation in beer wort and in solutions of various sugars.
Careful cultures showed, as already stated, that the jelly was composed
essentially of a bacterium associated with a yeast, and a long series of
our experiments has been directed towards ascertaining what part
each played in the fermentation, and how far they assisted or impeded
each other.
    In the greater number of these experiments five flasks were used,
each of about     250 c.c. capacity.    150 c.c. of the culture fluid were
placed in each, and four of them were sown with pure cultures : (a) of
the yeast alone ; (/?) of the bacterium alone ; (y) of the yeast and the
bacterium separately ; (S) of the two in their ordinary condition of
association, forming a lump of the jelly.         The fourth flask contained
only   the culture-fluid with no organism    of  either kind.
   The culture-fluids were usually a 10 per       cent, solution of some par
ticular sugar to which 10 per cent, of its volume of yeast-water had

                             A Sugar Bacterium.                                  79
been added to furnish the necessary combined nitrogen for the growth
of the organism.     The yeast-water was prepared by boiling yeast in
water for several minutes, and then filtering and sterilising. In one
experiment an ordinary beer wort was used without addition of more
nitrogenous matter.
   The liquids were carefully and repeatedly sterilised in the flasks
before the organisms were added.
   The fermentations were conducted       at a temperature         of about 20° C.
The marked feature of the fermentation set up by the conjoint organ
ism was the production of a considerable acidity, the liquid after a
few days having the appearance and flavour of lemonade. The acidity
proved to be due to acetic and succinic acids.
   As considerable differences of behaviour were soon manifested, we
subjoin the results of typical fermentations.

   The formation of the alcohol was thus shown to be due exclusively
to the yeast, and in its production the influence of the bacterium was

not manifested.     The yeast was found to be capable of fermenting
both glucose and fructose (levulose), but to be more active in the pre
sence than the absence of the latter.    Only half the amount of alcohol
was formed when the fructose was excluded.         The latter sugar was
more favourable also to the acid fermentation by the yeast.         If we
compare Experiments        II
                           and III, we find that while the same quantity
of alcohol was formed in both cases, the proportion of both acetic and
succinic acids was about doubled in the presence of fructose.
    The bacterium, however, was responsible for the greater amount of
the acid formation. While it caused the production of both acetic and
succinic acids in greater proportion than the yeast, it yielded far more
relatively of the former. In the experiment with beer wort it produced
fifteen times as much acetic acid as the yeast ; it only gave rise to four
to five times as much succinic.     With cane-sugar solution it formed
seventy times as much acetic and ten times as much succinic acid as
the yeast.    The same result was obtained with cane-sugar and
fructose.
     With grape-sugar the bacterium, like the yeast, could do but little.
It produced about the same amount        of acetic acid, but scarcely more
than one-third as much succinic.
   The experiments on the fermentations confirm the view expressed in
the early portion of the paper, that cane-sugar is the most favourable
medium for the bacterium, but before it is of use to           it,   it
                                                             undergoes
inversion.
   The association of the two organisms together introduced some          a
what curious feature of the fermentation.     The yeast continued to
produce   alcohol in the same proportion  as when alone, but the acid
fermentations    were modified   considerably. Comparative experiments
were made with cane-sugar, dark brown sugar containing fructose, and
grape-sugar.    In the first two cases the amount of both acetic and
succinic acids produced by the conjoint organism was distinctly less
than that which was formed by the bacterium alone.         In the grape-
sugar fermentation the contrary was the case.
   The association of the two organisms into the jelly-like clumps was
not without its effect upon the progress of the fermentation, and this
effect again appeared in connection with the process of the acidification.
   With the dark brown sugar the conjoint organism produced twice as
much acetic acid as the two separate constituents working together, but
only one and    a half times as much succinic.   With grape-sugar there
was a diminution of the succinic acid, which fell to one-half the
quantity produced by the yeast and the bacterium, while not in such
close association. The acetic acid, on the other hand, increased. In the
first two              the presence of the yeast was very considerably
            cases again,
inhibitor}' of the activity of the bacterium, the latter producing far
more acid of both kinds when     was alone in the fermenting liquid.

    One   or two features of the fermentations call for comment.             The
 progress of    the   fermentation  in  an acid liquid  was  so great as to sug
 gest that an enzyme was excreted by the organism, but careful
 search proved that this was not the case.             Both the conjoint organ
 ism and its two constituents are normally aerobic, but in all cases the
 fermentations will proceed, though with slightly less vigour, in an
 atmosphere of CO.;.        The decomposition effected by the bacterium is
 accompanied by only a very slow evolution of this gas, not greater
 indeed than would be due to its respiration. In one experiment which
 was carried on for two months, there was an output of 0'00o gram of
C02 per day, the gas being absorbed by caustic potash as it was given
off, and the fermentation being consequently aerobic.
    The intimate association of the two organisms in the lumps of jelly
suggested a symbiotic relationship.            Experiments made to ascertain
how the two affected each other failed however to bear out this view.
The influence of the bacterium we have seen to be largely shown in
the formation of relatively considerable quantities of both acetic and
                    '
succinic acids. Cultivations of the yeast were consequently made in
the presence of different proportions of acid, with the expectation of
finding that an acid medium would be advantageous to it.
    Three flasks were prepared, each containing 90 c.c. of 10 per cent,
solution of cane-sugar to which 10 c.c. of yeast- water were added.
These were then carefully sterilised.          To flask A, acetic acid was added
till 0'l per   cent,   was present ;  B  contained  0-25 percent., and C 0-5 per
cent, of the same acid.        Each was then infected with 1 c.c. of a pure
culture of the yeast, and they were allowed to ferment at the labora
tory temperature (about 10° C.). A control was prepared in a fourth
flask, no acid being added.            The fermentation which resulted in A
was about equal to that in the control ; that in B was less vigorous,
and that in C was very feeble. After two days, while the fermentation
was still active, they were all filtered on to tared filters, and the
quantity of yeast weighed.           The control was then found to contain
0-09 gram of yeast, while the other flasks contained respectively — A,
0-106, B, 0-079, and C, 0-027 gram.           So far as the growth of the yeast
was    concerned, 0'l per cent, of acetic acid was favourable ; but 0-25
per cent, was slightly inhibitory, while 0'5 per cent, was markedly so.
    The alcohol was then distilled off and estimated.          A contained 2 per
cent.,  B  1 -33 per cent., and C 1 per cent., while the control contained
1'66   per   cent,  of the spirit.    These figures agree with the conclusion
based upon the weight of the yeast.           The same results were obtained
when lactic acid was substituted for acetic.
   As in the original experiments made with cane-sugar, the bacterium
produced more acetic acid than the highest proportion used in these
fermentations, it is clear that the bacterium does not conduce in this
way to any increase of growth or activity of the yeast.
                                                                      G  2

     It                 that the bacterium might assist the latter by
          seemed possible
fixing nitrogen  from the air, as bacteria have been found to do in other
cases of symbiosis.   Careful experiments showed, however, that neither
the conjoint organism nor the bacterium alone could grow in a culture
fluid which did not contain combined nitrogen. A quantitative esti
mation of nitrogen was made of two fermentations of cane-sugar, one
by yeast alone, the other by the conjoint organism, a control of the
culture fluid alone being examined simultaneously. The nitrogen was
determined by KjeldahPs process.         The initial amount of nitrogen
present was 0'013 gram.       Neither flask showed any variation from
 this quantity at the end of the fermentation.
    The presence of the bacterium was seen consequently to be of no
service to the yeast, but on the other hand to be disadvantageous      to
its growth.
    The yeast was, on the other hand, found to bo of some value to the
bacterium.    During the fermentations the former was found to excrete
a certain amount of various extractives into the liquid, which had a
distinctly nutritive value to the latter. The bacterium grew very
much better at the expense of these extractives than it did when sup
plied with combined nitrogen in the form of ammonium tartrate, or
of asparagin.      Comparative experiments made with the extractives
prepared from a fermentation showed that neither asparagin nor an
ammonium salt could minister to its development so readily as they
did. This view was also supported by the fact that yeastwater had
already been found to be the best form of supplying combined nitrogen
artificially to cultures of the isolated bacterium.
   The alcohol was of no nutritive value to the latter. When it was
cultivated in the presence of varying quantities of the spirit, it made
no use of     it,
               and the original quantity of alcohol was found to be pre
sent in the liquid at the conclusion of the experiment.

acid has been produced to cause        secondary inhibition.

sugar seems to be a direct one, causing a formation of acid at the

tion. Bacterium aceti (Brown) has also this power in the presence of
oxygen, but      can oxidise alcohol in addition.

                                 A   Sugar Bacterium.                             8:;
Though the bacterium flourishes in solutions of cane-sugar, it does not
convert the latter immediately into the acids of the fermentation, but
hydrolysis takes place first.         In one experiment 150 c.c. of a 10 per
cent. solution of cane-sugar, containing 15 c.c. of yeast water, were
infected in a sterile flask with a pure culture of the bacterium, and
fermentation was allowed to proceed for twelve days at the tempera
ture of the laboratory.            At the end of that time the acetic acid was
distilled off, and the residue poured into alcohol to precipitate another
 constituent, which will be referred to below.              The remainder of the
sugar was left in solution in the alcohol.           After filtration the alcoholic
liquid was evaporated to a syrupy consistency, and the residue taken
 up with water.        It was then divided into two equal portions, and one
 of them was acidified with sulphuric acid till the concentration of the
 latter was 2 per cent.           It was then boiled on a water-bath for two
 hours    and carefully neutralised.          An aliquot part of each was then
 titrated    with Fehling's solution, and the cupric oxide formed was
 weighed.       The weights of the two were almost identical, differing by
 only 0-002 gram.          The inversion of the cane-sugar by the organism
 had consequently been practically complete.
     A  few bacteria     only have been found to secrete invertase.           Fermi
 and Montesano         found    that   Bacillus  megatherium,   B. fluorescenx lique-
faciens,    the   red   Kiel bacillus,    and Proteus vulgaris were capable of
 producing it      in bouillon to which cane-sugar had been added.               Van
 Tieghem showed that it was secreted by             Leuamostoc  mesentenovles.    To
 these the      bacterium     under   observation    must now be added.          The
 following experiment shows that the inversion noticed in the last case
 was due to an excreted enzyme.
     A  good culture was made in cane-sugar solution, and, after a few
 days, was filtered under pressure through a Chamberlandt's porcelain
 tube.     Three flasks were taken, and 15 c.c. of cane-sugar solution of
 2 per cent.     concentration placed in each.          They were' then carefully
 sterilised. To A and B, 2 c.c. of the filtrate from the culture were
 added, the filtrate having been found free from organisms by careful
 microscopic examination ; B was then boiled and allowed to cool
 slowly.      They were all kept for a few days at the temperature of
 22° C. in an incubator.            On titration with Fehling's solution, C, the
 control, gave no reduction, B a slight one, and A threw down a con
 siderable precipitate of cuprous oxide.            The small reduction in B was
 due no doubt to a trace of invert-sugar present in the culture fluid
 added to the flask.          The much greater reduction in A was due to
 invertase which the bacteria had excreted.
     The experiments quoted in the early part of this paper show, how
  ever, that the inversion must take place gradually and the fructose
  be supplied almost as     it is wanted.     In presence of fructose only, growth
  is almost impossible.

84                           A   Sugar Bacterium.
   Attention has been called in the first part of this paper to the
amount of viscous material which the bacterium produces in solutions
of cane sugar.    There is a great similarity between its action in this
respect  and that  of Van Tieghem's Lntcmostoc.
   An examination was made of the viscous material, a special culture
being made in a large flask for the purpose.        The slimy material was
found to be slowly soluble in water, yielding an opalescent solution.
When poured into an excess of alcohol, it gave a bulky flocculent pre
cipitate. This was allowed to settle and the alcohol was decanted, and the
wet precipitate thrown on to a filter.      When all the spirit had drained
away, it was taken from the filter and stirred with water in a beaker.
A considerable quantity dissolved, but a good deal of residue was left
in suspension.    The watery solution was filtered off and examined.
   It gave a reddish-purple colour on the addition of iodine, but had no
action on Fehling's fhu'd.       Heated with 2 per cent, of sulphuric acid
on a water-bath for two hours and then neutralised, it gave evidence
of the presence of sugar.        It reduced Fehling's fluid on boiling, and
yielded an osazone when treated with phenylhydrazine acetate.              It
deflected a ray of polarised light, and had a specific rotatory power of
[a]D= +130.
   The residue, which was insoluble in water, was coloured violet on
the addition of iodine.       It had no action on Fehling's solution, but
was converted into a reducing sugar by boiling it with 2 per cent, of
sulphuric acid.     It was readily soluble in a 10 per cent, solution of
caustic soda, and less freely in a 1 per cent, solution.      Neutralisation
or dilution did not cause it to be reprecipitated.     The solution had no
action on polarised light.
   There were thus found to be present in the viscous liquids two dis
tinct carbohydrates, which possessed much in common with Scheibler's
dextran, but which were not quite identical with the latter.      They both
appeared to be -members of the hemi-celluloses.
   The exact relation of these bodies to the bacterium         has not been
determined.     While there are some grounds for thinking that they are
not   so much products    of fermentation in the strict sense as of its ordi
nary biological processes, being perhaps only the substance of the
different sheaths to which allusion has been made in the first part of
this paper, it is not certain that they may not be regarded as products
produced altogether outside the organism, in consequence of an altera
tion of the fructose produced by the hydrolysis.            It is altogether
unlikely  that they   resulted  from   the glucose moiety of the inversion,
as this sugar is not a favourable medium for the growth of the organ
ism, and such cultivations as are possible in solutions of glucose do not
show the presence of any viscous material.

   Much information has been obtained regarding the structure of
metals by the methods of microscopic examination initiated by Sorby and
successfully pursued by Andrews, Arnold, Charpy, Martens, Osmond,
 Roberts-Austen, Stead, and others.    When a highly polished surface of
 metal is lightly etched and examined under the microscope, it reveals
 a structure which shows that the metal is made up in general of irre
gularly shaped grains with well defined bounding surfaces.              The
 exposed   face of each grain has been found to consist  of  a multitude  of
 crystal facets with a definite orientation. Seen under oblique illumi
 nation, these facets exhibit themselves by reflecting the light in a
 uniform manner over each single grain, but in very various manners
 over different grains, and, by changing the angle of incidence of the
light, one or another grain is made to flash out comparatively brightly
over its whole exposed surface, while others become dark.
   It is also well known that the grains are deformed when the metal
is subjected to such processes as cold hammering,       or cold rolling, or
wire-drawing. On polishing and etching a piece strained in any such
way, the grains are found to be on the whole longer in the direction in
which the metal is extended than in other directions.       But on heating
the metal sufficiently a re-formation of structure occurs, and the grains
are found to have again assumed forms in which there is no direction
of predominating length. In iron this recrystallisation occurs at a red
heat.   It is also known that prolonged exposure of iron to a tempera
ture of about 700° C. tends to produce a larger granular structure than
is found if the metal is somewhat quickly cooled from a higher tem
perature.
  The grains appear to be produced by crystallisation proceeding, more
or less simultaneously,  from as many centres or nuclei as there are
grains, and the irregular more or less polygonal boundaries which are
seen on a polished and etched surface result from the meeting of these
crystal growths. The grains are, in fact, crystals, except that each of
their bounding surfaces is casually determined by the meeting of one
                                 is is,
growth with another.    This     we believe, the view usually accepted
by metallurgists   but there

the part played by foreign  matter in possibly contributing to form                            a
cement at the intergranular junctions.

   The experiments, of which this is a preliminary account, have been
directed to examine the behaviour of the crystalline grains when the
metal is subjected to strain.
   For this purpose we have watched a polished surface under the micro
scope while the metal was gradually extended until it broke.              By
arranging   a small  straining machine on the stage of the microscope, we
have been able to keep under continuous observation a particular
group of crystalline grains while the piece was being stretched, and
have obtained series of photographs showing the same group at various
stages in the process.     Strips of annealed sheet iron, sheet copper, and
other metals have     been examined in this way.       We have also observed
the effects of strain on the polished surfaces of bars in a 50-ton testing
machine by means of a microscope hung from the bar itself, and have
further observed the effects of compression and of torsion.
   When a piece of iron or other metal exhibiting the usual granular
structure is stretched beyond its elastic limit a remarkable change
occurs in the appearance of the polished and etched surface, as seen
                             " vertical " illumination.  A number of sharp
by the usual method of
black lines appear on the faces of the crystalline grains : at first they
appear    on a few grains only, and as the straining is continued they
appear   on   more and more grains.         On each grain they are more or
less straight and parallel, but their directions are different on different
grains.    At first, just as the yield-point of the material is passed, the
few lines which can be seen are for the most part transverse to the
direction of the pull. As the stretch becomes greater oblique systems
of lines on other grains come into view.
    The photograph, fig. 1 (Plate 1), taken from a strip of transformer
plate (rolled from Swedish iron and annealed after rolling), gives a
characteristic    view of these lines as they appear after a moderate
amount of permanent stretching, but long before the iron has reached
its breaking limit.
    The appearance of each grain is so like that of a crevassed glacier,
 that these dark lines might readily be taken for cracks. Against this,
 however, was the consideration         that an over-strained piece of iron
 recovers its original elasticity after a period of rest, though, as we
 found, the dark lines did not disappear when recovery took place, and
 further that sharp lines of the same nature were not seen on the surface
of metal which was polished and etched after straining.
    The real character of the lines is apparent when the crystalline
constitution of each grain is considered.          They are not cracks, but
stips along planes of cleavage or gliding planes.
    Fig. 2 is intended to represent a section through the upper part of
two contiguous surface grains, having cleavage or gliding planes as
indicated by the cross-hatching, AB being a portion of the polished
surface.     When the metal is pulled beyond its elastic limit, in the

direction of the arrows, yielding takes place by finite amounts of slips
occurring at a limited number of places in the manner shown at
a, b, c, d, e (fig. 3).     This slip exposes short portions of inclined
surfaces, and when viewed under normally incident light, these surfaces
appear black because they return no light to the microscope.       They are
consequently seen as dark lines or narrow bands, extending over the
polished surface in directions which depend on the intersection of the
polished surface with the surfaces of slip.
   We have proved the correctness of this view by examining these
bands under oblique light.      When the light is incident at only a small
angle to the polished surface, the surface appears for the most part
dark ; but here and there a system of the parallel bands shines out
brilliantly, in consequence of the short cleavage or gliding surfaces which
constitute the bands having the proper inclination for reflecting the
light into the microscope.     Fig. 4 is the photograph of a strained piece
of Swedish iron illuminated in this way.         The magnification is 280
diameters.     The groups of parallel bright bands which appear in the
photograph may readily be observed under the microscope to be
exactly coincident with the black bands seen under vertical illumina
tion  ; and by changing the angle of incidence of the oblique light, the
same bands may be made to appear        dark on a faintly luminous ground.
Rotation of the stage to which the strained specimen is fixed makes
the bands on one or another of the grains flash out successively, with
kaleidoscopic effect. In what follows we shall speak of these lines as
slip bands.    Fig. 1, through a mixed illumination, shows some of the
slip bands bright and some dark.
   Incidentally fig. 4 illustrates the fact that oblique lighting picks out
the boundaries of the crystalline grains, showing that these boundaries
are marked by inclined surfaces connecting grains whose faces are at
different levels.    This is observed also in the etched surface of the
metal before straining.       The boundaries, which appear dark under
vertical light, are bright on one side of each crystalline grain, when
the light falls with grazing incidence from one side.       But the sloping
surfaces which mark the boundaries between the grains have by no
means the sharply definite inclination which characterises the surfaces
which form the slip bands.        One or more groups of slip bands will
shine out very brightly when the light has a particular angle of inci
dence, and will vanish when the incidence is slightly changed.          The
boundaries are not in general so bright, but they remain fairly bright
while the incidence is changed through wide limits.
   When the metal is much strained a second system of bands appears
on some of the grains, crossing the first system at an angle, and in
some cases showing little steps where the lines cross.      These bands are
clearly due to slips occurring in a second set of cleavage or gliding
 surfaces.   An example of the crossed systems of bands will be seen in

88               Mr.   J.  A. Ewing and Mr. W. Roseuhain.
fig. 8.    The crystals in metals are generally cubical, but the angle at
which the intersecting systems of bands cross depends on the inclina
tion of the polished surface to the planes of cleavage. Occasionally a
third system of bands may be seen.
    As straining proceeds the originally smooth surface of the specimen
becomes roughened by the surface grains changing in their relative
levels and also becoming more or less inclined, as well as more or less
stepped.      All this  happens in consequence of the slips which they and
their neighbours      undergo.      To this is due the dull appearance which
an originally bright surface assumes when the metal is overstrained.
Under the microscope the strained surface is seen to be full of ups and
downs, and a continuous alteration in focus is required to trace the
system of bands, even over the face of a single grain.
    When the experiment is made with a polished but unetched specimen
the slip bands appear equally well.            The boundaries of the grains are
invisible before straining ; but they can be distinguished as the strain
proceeds, for the slip bands form a cross-hatching which serves to mark
out the surface of each grain. To strain a polished but unetched
specimen reveals in a striking way the granular character of the
structure.*
    Figs. 5, 6, and 7 are selected from a series of photographs showing
under a magnification of 140 diameters, the same group of crystalline
grains in a specimen of soft wrought iron at various stages of straining
by pull. The arrows show the direction in which the pull was applied.
    Fig. 5 shows    the group before straining began.          Fig. 6 is the same
group after the strain      had  been   carried some way past the yield point.
Fig. 7 is the same group after the piece had suffered considerable
further extension      in the same direction. Comparison of the three will
show how the grains change their shape in consequence of the slips
 which occur in them, and also how the faces of the grains become tilted
and altered in relative level.
    Fig  8 is another    sample of iron strained by pull.        The specimen in
 this case was a bar of Swedish iron, in which a comparatively large
 crystalline structure had been developed by annealing for some hours at
 700° C.     The photograph was taken after the bar had been broken in
 the testing machine, and shows with a magnification of 400 diameters
 a portion of the surface not far from the place of fracture. The large
 grain which appears to the left in fig. 8 measured 0'16 mm. in the
 direction of the arrows before straining, and was extended by the
 strain in that direction to about 0'2 mm. The slip bands upon it are
 on the average 1/400 mm. apart.              This applies to both of the two
 systems of bands which appear in the photograph.                  The apparent
    * The fact that the crystalline   structure is revealed when a specimen with a
 polished unetched surface is strained has already been pointed out by Charpy
 (' Comptes Rendua,' vol. 123, 1896, p. 225).

 width of the slip bands themselves is too small to be measured
 with any accuracy ; it does not appear at any place here to exceed
 1/2000 mm.
     The slip-bands are developed by compression as well as by extension.
 Fig. 9 is a photograph (at 400 diameters) from the polished and
 etched side of a block of Low Moor iron compressed in the testing
 machine sufficiently to give it a considerable amount of permanent set.
 The bands developed by compression have apparently all the character
 istics   which they present in stretched pieces, and we could not, by
 microscopic     examination of the surface, distinguish, in this respect
 between the effects of compression and extension.         The irregular dark
 patches in fig. 9 are streaks of slag.
     By twisting an iron bar well beyond the elastic limit the slip-bands
 are made to appear, for the most part in directions parallel and per
 pendicular to the axis of twist.
    A strip of sheet metal, such as iron or copper, in the soft state, when
 bent and unbent in the fingers shows them well developed by the
 extension    and compression of the surface.
    We have developed the slip-bands in iron, steel, copper, silver, lead,
 bismuth, tin, gun-metal, and brass.        In silver they show particularly
 well, the crystalline structure being large and the lines straight. In
copper also the lines are straighter and more regularly spaced than is
general in iron.      Most of these metals have been tested in the form
of blocks under compression.         A beautiful development of slip-bands
may readily be produced by pinching a button of polished silver or
copper in a vice.
    In carbon steels we have found         the slip-bands  considerably   more
difficult to observe than in wrought iron. The smaller granular struc
ture of steel apparently makes the slip-bands correspondingly minute.
In mild steel they are seen readily enough, but in a rather high carbon
steel we succeeded in seeing them only with difficulty in the
                                                                    " ferrite "
areas under a magnification of 1 ,000 diameters.          A cast piece of the
nearly pure     iron used   for dynamo magnets      showed  a relatively very
large granular structure and well marked slip-bands.
    These experiments throw what appears to us to be new light on the
character of plastic strain in metals and other irregular crystalline
aggregates.      Plasticity is due to slip on the part of the crystals along
cleavage or gliding surfaces.       Each crystalline grain is deformed by
numerous internal slips occurring at intervals throughout its mass.          In
general these slips no doubt occur in three planes, or possibly more,
and     the combination of the three allows       the grain to accommodate
itself to its envelope of neighbouring grains as the strain proceeds.
The action is discontinuous : it is not a homogeneous shear but a series
of finite slips, the portion of the crystal between one slip and the next
behaving like a rigid solid.      The process of slipping is one which takes

90                      Experiments in Micro-metallurgy.
time, and in this respect the aggregate effect is not easily distinguish
able from the deformation of a viscous liquid.
     We infer from the experiments that " flow
                                                       "
                                                         or non-elastic deforma
tion in metals occurs through slip within each crystalline grain of
portions of the crystal on one another along surfaces of cleavage
or gliding surfaces. There is no need to suppose the portions which
slip to be other than perfectly elastic.          The slip, when it occurs, in
volves the expenditure of work in an irreversible manner.
     It is because the metal is an aggregate of irregular crystals that it is
plastic as a whole, and is able to be deformed in any manner as a result
 of the slips occurring in individual crystals.          Plasticity requires that
 each portion should be able to change its shape and its position.            Each
 crystalline grain changes its shape through slips occurring within itself,
and its position through slips occurring in other grains.*
     From what is known about the break-down in elasticity which occurs
 as the immediate effect of overstrain and the subsequent recovery of
elasticity after a period of rest, it would seem that the surfaces over
 which slip has occurred are at first weak, but heal with the lapse of
 time.     To discuss these points, however, lies beyond the scope of a
 preliminary notice.
     The experiments were made in the engineering laboratory at Cam
 bridge, and are being continued.         We wish to take this opportunity of
 thanking Sir W. Roberts- Austen and Mr. T. Andrews for the great
 kindness with which, at the outset of our work, they gave us the
 benefit of their experience in preparing and observing microscopic
 specimens of metals.
                                      — In a specimen of cast nickel, which
      [Note added April 14, 1899.
 showed after etching a crystalline structure much resembling that of iron,
 but on a considerably smaller scale, straining developed minute slip-
 bands, which are clearly apparent under a power of 1,000 diameters.
      We have also examined a specimen of pure gold by compressing a
 cast button with a polished face, not etched.             The straining reveals
 crystalline structure on a large scale, and in each of the crystalline
 grains there is a superb development of slip-bands.               They are long,
 nearly straight, exceedingly numerous, and very closely spaced. A
 power of 1,000 diameters is required to see them well.                 Two inter
 secting systems are common, and three are well seen in some of the
 grains, forming a regular geometrical network.                The intergranular
 boundaries      are sharply defined by the meeting of the slip-bands on
 each grain with those on its neighbours.            The slip-bands in adjacent
 crystals meet     in  a way    which demonstrates    the absence of any appre
 ciable quantity of foreign matter in the intergranular junctions.]
     * Attention should be called in this connection to the experiments of Messrs.
  McConnel    and Kidd on the plasticity of glacier ice (' Roy. Soc. Proc.,' vol. 44,
  p. 331).   They found that bars cut from glacier ice, which is an aggr•gate of
  irregular crystals, are plastic.

                                     (Abstract.)
    The cerebro-spinal fluid removed from cases of brain atrophy, particu
larly from cases of General Paralysis of the Insane, produces when
injected into the circulation of anaesthetised animals (dogs, cats,
rabbits), a fall of arterial blood pressure, with little or no effect on
respiration. This pathological fluid is 'richer in proteid matter than
the normal fluid, and among the proteids, nucleo-proteid        is present.
The fall of blood pressure,    is,
                                 however, due not to proteid, nor to inor
ganic constituents, but to an organic substance, which           soluble in
                                                                          is
alcohol. This substance       isprecipitable by phospho-tungstic acid, and
by chemical methods was identified as choline.        The crystals of the
 platinum double salt, which, when crystallised from 15 percent, alcohol,
 are characteristic   octahedra, form the most convenient test for the
 separation and identification of this base.
     The nucleo-proteid and choline doubtless originate from the disinte
gration of the brain tissue, and their presence indicates that possibly
some of the symptoms of General Paralysis may be due to auto-intoxi
 cation these substances pass into the blood, for the cerebro-spinal fluid
        ;
 functions as the lymph of the central nervous system.      We have iden
 tified choline in the blood removed by venesection from these patients
 during the convulsive seizures which form      prominent symptom in the
                                                    a
disease.
   Normal cerebro-spinal fluid does not contain nucleo-proteid or choline,
or if  these substances are present, their amount       so small that they
                                                           is
cannot be identified. Normal cerebro-spinal fluid produces no effect on
arterial pressure neither does the alcoholic extract of normal blood or
                  ;
of ordinary dropsical effusions.
   The presence of choline in the pathological fluids will not explain
the symptoms of General Paralysis         for instance,
                                            ;              will not account
                                                                it
for the fits just referred to. Its presence, however,          an indication
                                                                     is
that an acute disintegration of the cerebral tissues has occurred.             If
other poisonous substances are also present, they have still to be dis
covered.
   Our proof that the toxic material we have specially worked with              is
eholine, rests not only on chemical tests, but also on the evidence
afforded by physiological experiments        ;    the action of the cerebro-spinal
substance exactly resembles that of              choline.   Neurine, an alkaloid
closely related to choline,   is not present in the fluid its toxic action
                                                                ;               is
much more powerful, and        its effects differ considerably from those of
choline.

       The  doses employed   were from    1  to 10 c.c. of a 0-2 per cent, solution,
   either of choline or of its hydrochloride.        These were injected intra
   venously.
       The fall of blood pressure is in some measure due to its action on
   the heart, but is mainly produced by dilatation of the peripheral vessels,
   especially in the intestinal area.     This was dmonstrated by the use of
  an intestinal oncometer.       The limbs and kidneys are somewhat lessened
  in volume ; this appears to be a passive effect, secondary to the fall in
  general blood pressure.       The drug causes a marked contraction of the
  spleen, followed by an exaggeration of the normal curves, due to the
  alternate systole and diastole of that organ.
      The action on the splanchnic vessels is due to the direct action of the
  base on the n euro-muscular mechanism of the blood vessels themselves ;
  for after the influence of the central nervous system has been removed
  by section of the spinal cord, or of the splanchnic nerves, choline still
  causes the typical fall of blood pressure.           The action of peripheral
  ganglia was in other experiments .excluded by poisoning the animal
  previously with nicotine.
      Section   of the vagi  produces   no effect on the results      of injecting
  choline.
      We have obtained     no evidence of any direct action        of the base on
 the cerebral vessels.
      Choline has little or no action on nerve trunks, as tested by their
  electrical response to stimulation.       This aspect of the subject has been
 taken up by Dr. Waller and Miss Sowton, who will publish their
 results fully in a separate paper.
     Choline has no effect on respiration.
     The effect of choline soon passes off, and the blood pressure returns
 to its previous level.      This is due partly to the great dilution of the
 substance injected by the whole volume of the blood, and may be
 partly due to the excretion of the alkaloid, or to its being broken up
 into simpler substances by metabolic processes.           We could not find it
in the urine.
     If the animal has been previously anaesthetised with a mixture of
morphine       and atropine,   the effect    produced by choline is a rise of
arterial pressure, accompanied by a rise of the lever of the intestinal
oncometer.        Other anaesthetics cause no change in the usual results.
We consider this observation of some importance, for it shows how the
action of one poison may be modified by the presence of another.
This has some bearing on General Paralysis, for the arterial tension in
that disease is usually high, not low, as it would be if choline were the
only toxic agent at work.

                        Physiological A<tion of Neurine.
     The doses employed varied from 1 to 5 c.c. of a 0-1 per cent, solu
 tion.   These were injected intravenously.
     Neurine produces a fall of arterial pressure, followed by a marked
 rise, and a subsequent fall to the normal level.      Sometimes, especially
 with small doses, the preliminary fall may be absent. Sometimes,
 especially with large doses, by which presumably the heart is more
 profoundly affected, the rise is absent.
     The effect of neurine on the heart of both frog and mammal is much
 more marked than is the case with choline ; in the case of both choline
 and neurine, the action on the frog's heart is antagonised by atropine.
     The slowing and weakening of the heart appear to account for the
 preliminary fall of blood pressure ; in some cases this is apparently
 combined with a direct dilating influence on the peripheral vessels.
     The rise of blood pressure which occurs after the fall, is due to the
 constriction of the peripheral vessels, evidence of which we have
 obtained by the use of oncometers for intestine; spleen, and kidney.
    After the influence of the central nervous system has been removed
 by section of the spinal cord, or of the splanchnic nerves, neurine still
 produces its typical effects.
    After, however, the action of peripheral ganglia has been cut off by"
 the use of nicotine, neurine produces only a fall of blood pressure.
 It therefore appears that the constriction of the vessels is due to the
action of the drug on the ganglia ; in this, it would agree with nicotine,
 coniine, and piperidine.
    Section of the vagi produces no influence on the results of injecting
neurine.
    In animals anaesthetised with morphine and atropine, injection of
neurine causes only a rise of blood pressure, which is accompanied with
constriction of peripheral vessels.
    Neurine produces no direct results, so far as we could ascertain, on
the cerebral blood vessels.
    Neurine is intensely toxic to nerve-trunks (Dr. Waller and Miss
Sowton).
    It produces a marked effect on the respiration. This is first greatly
increased, but with each successive dose the effect is less, and ultimately
the respiration becomes weaker, and ceases altogether.          The animal
can still be kept alive by artificial respiration.
    The exacerbation of respiratory movements       will not account for the
rise of arterial pressure ; the two events are usually not synchronous,
and an intense rise of arterial pressure (due, as previously stated, to
contraction of peripheral blood vessels) may occur when there is little
or no increase of respiratory activity or during artificial respiration.
    As confirmatory of Cervello's statement that neurine acts like

 curare on the nerve endings of voluntary muscle, and to which he
 attributes the cessation of respiration, we may mention that after an
 animal has been poisoned with neurine, asphyxiation causes little or
 none of the usual convulsions.

       April   20, 1899.
                                        (Abstract.)
    The experiments detailed in the full paper deal with the absorption
 from the intestine of the animal's own serum, and of solutions of
glucose and peptone.            The method employed has been that introduced
by Leubuscher,          in which two loops of intestine are simultaneously
employed,      the   one  the experimental, and the other the control, loop.
    The conclusions arrived at are as follows :—
    1. A physiological activity of the intestinal epithelium in the act of
absorption      is demonstrated      by —
    («) The absorption by an animal of its own serum (or even plasma)
            under conditions in which filtration into blood capillaries or
            lacteals, osmosis, and adsorption are excluded.
    (//)  By the cessation or diminution of the absorption of serum when
            the epithelium is removed, injured, or poisoned, in spite of the
            fact that removal, at any rat«, must increase the facilities for
            osmosis and nitration.
    2.   The activity of the cells is characterised        by a slower uptake of
the organic      solids  of  the serum   than  of the water,  and a rather quicker
uptake of the salts than of the water.              The relations to one another
of the absorptions of these various constituents is variable in different
regions of the intestinal canal (upper ileum, lower ileum, and colon).

                           On. Intestinal Absorption.                       95
   3.    No evidence can   be obtained   of specific absorptive fibres in the
mesenteric nerves.
   4. The state of nutrition of the cells is the main factor in their
activity, and this is intimately associated with the blood supply.
   5. In reduction of the rate of absorption, without detachment of
epithelium, the absorption of the various constituents of serum is
reduced in the proportion in which they exist in the original fluid.
   6. The activity of the cells may be raised by stimulation with weak
alcohol, without evidence of concomitant increase of blood supply.
   7. The bile has no stimulant action on the cells.
   8. The cells exhibit an orienting action upon salts in solution (sodic
chloride especially).     In a loop of gut with injured cells sodic chloride
enters the lumen from the blood, at a time when it is being actively
absorbed from a normal control loop in the same animal.             (This fact
was first noted by 0. Cohnheim.)
   9. The absorption of water from solutions introduced into the gut
is dependent upon two factors : —
   («) The physical relation of the osmotic pressure of the solution in
            the gut to the osmotic pressure of the blood plasma.
   (b)    The  physiological regulation of the difference of osmotic pres
            sure by the orienting mechanism of the cells.
    10.   The chief factor in the absorption of peptone is an assimilation
(or adsorption) by the cells, while in the absorption of glucose, diffu
sion, variable by the permeability of the cells (and so, probably, related
to their physiological condition) is the main factor.
    1 1 . By removal    of the epithelium, the normal ratio of peptone to
glucose absorption is upset, and the value tends to approach that of
diffusion of these substances through parchment paper into serum.
    12. Absorption in the lower ileum is greater for the organic solids
of serum, and less for peptone and glucose than in the upper ileum.
The relative absorption of water in the upper and lower ileum is
variable.
   13.    The relative impermeability of the lower ileum to glucose dis
appears with removal of the epithelium.
   14. Absorption in the colon is for all constituents     of serum, and for
peptone and glucose far less per unit of measured surface than in the
middle region of the ileum.
   15. The normal relative excess of salt absorption from serum over
water absorption, observed throughout the intestine, is most marked in
the colon, and more marked in the lower than in the upper ileum.
   16. Finally it is suggested that the cell activity which causes serum
to pass over to the blood is of the same nature as that involved in the
orienting action of the cells upon salts in solution.

     The characters                   used in current classifications           of Ferns need streng
thening.                   In recent years the more detailed knowledge of the prothallus
has been used for this purpose, but while not denying its value in
certain specific cases, the author holds that the vegetative development
of the prothallus is an uncertain guide to a general classification.  On
the other hand the archegonium is so uniform in its character that                                     it
gives little help ; the comparison of the antheridium     however,                          is,        a
useful aid, though not sufficiently varied to serve hi detail.*  Accord
ingly the sporophyte   must  be  the main   basis. Its vegetative organs
have lately been largely used for systematic purposes by Christ      but                          ;t
the same objection holds here as in Phanerogams to the use of these
as characters of first rank for comparison. An attempt has therefore

   These divisions are primarily based on the order of appearance of the
sporangia in the sorus, the Simplices having all the sporangia of the
sorus formed simultaneously, the Gradatae having them disposed in
basipetal succession, and the Mixtae having the sporangia of different
ages intermixed.     But it is found that other important characters run
parallel with these : thus the Simplices and Gradatae have an oblique
annulus (where definitely present), the Mixtae (with very few excep
tions) have a vertical annulus.   None of the Mixtae have been found to
have a higher spore-output per sporangium than sixty-four, but this
number is exceeded by some of the Gradatae, and large numbers are the
rule in the Simplices. The Simplices and Gradatae have relatively short
thick stalks, the Mixtae usually have long and thin stalks. The
orientation of the sporangia in the Simplices and Gradatae is usually
definite, in the Mixtae it is indefinite. The receptacle is often elon
gated in the Gradatae, but not in the Simplices or Mixtae.     The sum of
these characters, which for the most part run parallel to one another,
appears to give a substantial basis to the classification.
   Evidence as to the transition from type to type has been collected.
In the case of the transition from a simultaneous to a successive sorus
it does not amount to a demonstration : but it is specially pointed out
how slight a step it is from such a sorus as that of Gleichenia ilichetoma
to that of an AlsojMla : that given a basal indusium and marginal
position, the similarity of sporangial structure and dehiscence between
Gleichenin and Loxsomti is suggestive ; as also the sporangial structure
and high spore-output     in Hymenophylhim.    Though we may recognise
these lines of similarity, they do not focus upon any one genus as the
actual transitional link from the simultaneous to the basipetal.        But
the transition from the basipetal   to the mixed sorus can be followed in
detail ; intermediate steps are seen in the Dennstaedtiinae, while the
fully mixed type is seen in the closely allied Damllia. Probably this
is only one of several such lines of transition from the basipetal to the
mixed type.
   It is shown that a biological advantage would be gained by the
suggested transitions.     In the Simplices the few sporangia are large,
and, arising simultaneously, make a demand all at once on the nutri
tive resources of the part. In the Gradatae the smaller sporangia are
produced in succession upon an elongating receptacle, and the drain on
the part is spread over a longer period. But with the assumption of
the mixed character the drain may be spread over an equally long time,
while, as the elongated receptacle disappears, the surface from which
nourishment can be derived is enlarged, and the distance through
which it has to be transferred is shortened.       Thus it appears biologi
cally reasonable that the succession should be as suggested.
   It is shown how the various types of dehiscence, and the action of
the annulus stand in close relation to the orientation of the sporangia,

and    to their arrangement in the sorus. Thus the position of the
annulus, which has played so important a part in classification, has
 been placed upon a footing of adaptation.
    Estimates of numerical output of spores per sporangium have been
 made with a view to illustrating the relation of the Eusporangiate and
 Leptosporangiate ferns in this respect.            The estimated output in the
 Marattiaceae has been shown to h>e high ;* that of the Polypodiaceae
is sixty-four or less.     The result of numerous countings is to show
that, of all Leptosporangiate ferns, Gleichenia approaches most nearly
to the Marattiaceae (Gl. flaMlata may produce over 800 per sporan
gium) ; Oxmurula may have over 500, and Lygodium 256. The most
interesting results were derived from the Hymenophyllaceae, in which
Hym. tunbridgense may have over 400, while species of Trichmnanes
may produce as few as thirty-two per sporangium.                  These results,
when taken with those derived from the filmy Ttxlens, make it seem
probable that the filmy habit is a condition leading to reduction of
output per sporangium, and indicate that the Hymenophyllaceae are
a derivative series of reduction.
    A most important commentary upon the classification proposed is
derived from comparison of the antheridia, which Heimt found to be
the most dependable part of the Gametophyte for comparative pur
poses.    He recognises two types according to their dehiscence : the one
type includes, with the exception of two genera of Schizaeaceae, our
Simplices and Gradatae, while the other includes the Mixtae.                I can
only regard this correspondence of parts, so aloof from one another as
the antheridium and the sporangium, as establishing the relations of
the Simplices and Gradatae upon a firmer footing ; the facts also give
substantial support to the distinction of the Gradatee and Mixtae.
  •
    The effect of the observations and comparisons in this memoir is
rather confirmatory of the current classifications than disturbing. The
divisions suggested would supersede those of Eusporangiatae and Lep-
tosporangiatae,    though these terms would still be retained in a
descriptive   sense.   If the sub-orders Osmundaceae, Schizaeaceae, and
Marattiaceae be transferred from the end of the Synopsis Filicum to
the beginning, and grouped with Gleichenia and Malonui, we have the
" Simplices " before us. The Gradatae include the Cyatheaceae, Dick-
sonieae (Excl. Dennstaedtia),       Hymenophyllaceae,        and Loxsomaceae,
sequences probably of distinct descent, and, in my view, derivative
from some prior forms such as the Simplices ; and in the arrangement
of Sir AVm. Hooker they hold a position following on the Gleichenia-
ccae.   The family of Dennstaedtiinae, founded by Prantl to include
Dennstaedtia and Microlepia, also has its place here, but         it leads on by
intermediate steps to undoubtedly mixed forms                such   as  Damlliti,

 the lines along which mixed forms are believed to have been derived

 upon    details   of which he cannot have been aware.

    The importance of fertility as a factor in the survival of a species is
 admirably demonstrated by Hafkine,* whilst Professor Karl Pearsont
 shows that fertility when correlated with other characteristics works a
progressive change, and that not only is fertility a race characteristic,
but may be a class characteristic in the human species.
    Among domesticated animals, although fertility may be a racial
characteristic, its importance may be much reduced from a variety of
circumstances.
    Among sheep there is undoubted evidence of the racial character of
fertility, but the quality of the wool or the value of fat sheep of a par
ticular breed may render that breed worth keeping in spite of a low
rate of fertility as compared with other breeds.                Then the rate of fer
tility may be artificially increased, as when certain rams of undoubted
value as progenitors, but useless as breeders if left to themselves,
become valuable sires by the help of the shepherd.                 In the same way a
certain    breed   of  sheep, kept   in one  district  and   managed in a particular
manner, may be more liable to abortion, or to barrenness, or to mor
tality among the lambs, than the same breed in another district
managed       in another way, and yet the former may, on account of the
supply of food which it is possible to grow there per acre, prove the
most remunerative.
    From these and many other similar reasons the survival of a particular
breed or its retention in, or importation to, a particular district is not
necessarily due to natural fitness or adaptability.              At the same time a

 wider knowledge of the racial character of fertility among sheep might
 exercise considerable influence on the survival of certain breeds in the
future. Just as the number of Long-horn cattle is rapidly becoming
reduced in this country on account of the length of time they require
to come to maturity and fatten, so the low fertility of Southdowns if
it cannot be increased may lead to the retention of that breed in the
hands of only a few special breeders.
   The following account is a brief abstract of information obtained
from 397 sheep breeders who have supplied me with records of flocks
containing 122,673 ewes for the breeding season of 1896-97. Table IV
records certain  particulars of eight pure breeds separately, and of ten
                                                "
pure breeds jointly (" Various Pure Breeds        ; details of only a small
number of flocks were supplied for each of these ten breeds).         These
are totalled, particulars of fifty-nine flocks of various cross-bred sheep
subjoined, and the totals for all breeds finally arrived at.
   Besides the figures contained in Table IV, other statistics were sup
plied regarding the age of rams and ewes, the size of breeding flocks,
the proportions of rams and ewes therein, the usual and the highest
percentages of barrenness experienced, &c. To this were added remarks
on the food given to rams and ewes at specified times, on their condi
tion during the breeding season, on various methods of management of
breeding flocks, and on numerous views regarding matters which are
supposed to influence fertility, abortion, and barrenness amongst ewes ;
finally particulars of districts, subsoils, and weather were noted, and the
subject considered statistically from all these various points of view for
each breed.
   The variation in the numbers of flocks and of ewes concerned in the
various calculations for each breed (see Table IV) is due to the inability
of all flock-masters to supply the whole of the information asked for in
the schedule, which, by the kindness of the Royal Agricultural Society,
vas distributed to them, and is not due to my selection of flocks.

  It   is to be noted the number of lambs returned does not always repre
sent the number born     ; that information, although asked for, was not
always forthcoming and sometimes the number of lambs alive when
the schedule was filled up was given instead.  The percentage of twins
given   is,
         however,  a  check on this element of error, and in the follow

four breeds, in which the records have been most carefully kept, the
Suffolk, Shropshire, Kent and Southdown breeds, their fertility         is
demonstrated   to be   a   racial character.

              OIL the  Fertility of different Breeds of Sheep, $c.       101
    The Suffolk breed is by far the most fertile, while the Southdowns
are at the bottom of the list : the value of the former as a prolific
breed is incontrovertible, while the record of the latter, as shown both
by the percentage of twins and lambs, is so low as to suggest cause for
some anxiety and to show urgent need for close attention on tho part
of breeders.
    The Hampshire breed also stands low both with regard to twins and
lambs, especially when its low percentage of loss from abortion and
barrenness is considered ; whereas the Lincoln breed, although recording
only lll'1 per cent, of lambs, shows 29-09 per cent, of ewes bearing
twins, and the fault, with this breed, is obviously not so much low
fertility as heavy mortality among lambs and a high percentage of
loss from abortion and barrenness.
    The most fertile of all pure breeds of which I have records, is the
Wensleydale breed, in which six flocks with a total of 319 ewes pro
duce 177-43 per cent, of lambs (included in "Various Pure Breeds").
It is to be noted that both Wensleydale and Suffolk ewes when covered
by rams of other breeds, do not appear to produce a larger percentage
of lambs than they produce when covered by rams of their own breed ;
if anything, they     seem to produce    a somewhat   smaller  percentage   of
lambs.     On the other hand, Dorset Horn ewes are more usually fertile
and are more prolific with Down rams than with Dorset Horn rams.
    It is a very usual practice with Dorset Horn flock-masters to keep a
Down ram to cover those ewes which fail to become pregnant to a Dorset
Horn ram, and, when pure-bred ewes are discarded from their breeding
                                     " in        "
Hocks, they generally sell them            young   to Down rams, when they
frequently produce      as many as 170 per cent, of lambs.
    It appears, therefore, that whereas the fertility of Suffolk and Wens
leydale ewes is at its maximum when they breed to rams of their own
kind, Dorset Horn ewes require to be covered by rams of another
breed, in order that they may be stimulated to the greatest generative
activity.
    Apart from the percentage of ewes which abort or are barren from
accident or constitutional defects, the fertility of ewes is chiefly affected
 by their condition and by the condition of the ram at tupping time.         I
 have overwelming evidence that flocks in strong condition at tupping
 time produce a higher percentage of lambs than flocks in poor condi
 tion at that period (Suffolk, Kent, Hampshire, Dorset Horn, and
 Lincoln breeds) ; on the other hand, fat rams and ewes are associated
 with a high percentage of barrenness, and not with a high percentage
 of lambs.
    In close connection      with this subject is the production of twins.
 Fifty-five per   cent, of the flock-masters who send information on this
 head, report   that  twins   are usually born early in the lambing season,
 and many of them add that otherwise the crop of lambs is small. That

102                               Mr. W. Heape.
is to say, that most twins are produced by the ewes which first come in
season, and I interpret that to mean that it is the ewes with the most
active and most vigorous generative system, those which are in strong
breeding condition at that time, which bear the most twins.                It is of
interest to note that among Southdown and Hampshire flocks, a com
paratively small proportion of twins are born early in the lambing
season, and these breeds produce the smallest percentage of twins.
    The effect of locality upon the fertility of a breed is worthy of con
sideration, and statistics are given in Table V to illustrate this point.*
In considering these figures, numerous other important influences
must be borne in mind, which the information at my disposal makes it
impossible to dissociate from locality ; and in all cases, except those of
the Shropshire and Lincoln breeds, where a wide difference in fertility
is shown in different districts, it is possible that the variation in
fertility may be due to one or other or all of these various influences,
apart altogether from locality.
    The fertility of a flock is greatly influenced by its management and
by the conditions under which it lives ; the condition, kind, and
amount of food available before tupping time will affect the condition
of the ewes and the percentage of twins subsequently born ; the season
may be more favourable for tupping or for lambing in one district
than in another ; cold, rain, or want of rain, will affect the feed, the
ground, and the ewes themselves ; while, owing to mortality among
ewes during lambing or at other times in the preceding year, the
 flocks in one district may consist of a larger proportion of shearling
ewes than the flocks in another district, and this may affect the birth
rate of a flock.
    These and numerous other such influences, combined with the undue
 proportionate value of excessive loss or fertility in one flock, where
 only a few are kept in a district, is sufficient to account for a much
 greater variation than is shown for most breeds in Table V.                 At the
 same time the difference in fertility of Shropshire flocks kept in
 Staffordshire, as compared with other flocks of the same breed kept
 elsewhere, and of Lincoln flocks kept in Yorkshire, as compared with
 those kept in the home county, is very remarkable.                 They certainly
 suggest   that  Yorkshire   is  a   more   satisfactory   habitat for the Lincoln
 breed than is the home county, and although it is quite possible the
 method of farming and other influences, in Lincolnshire, are responsible
 for some of the difference, they can hardly be responsible for all of it.
 I do not believe that the high percentage of loss in the Lincolnshire
wold flocks is due altogether to mismanagement, but if 50 per cent, of
 the difference between the losses of the wold flocks and the Yorkshire
 flocks was added to the percentage of twins of the former, there would
still be a difference of 17 per cent', of twins in favour of the Yorkshire
                           *       "
                              See    Percentage of Twins."

            On   the   Fertility of different Breeds of   Sheep,   fyc.   103
flocks. So also with the Shropshire breed in Staffordshire and the
home county, if 50 per cent, of the difference between the losses was
added to the percentage of twins in the home county, they would still
have 12 per cent, less than the Staffordshire flocks; and it is not
probable that a different method of farming in these two neighbouring
districts can account for such difference in fertility.
   The returns of the Suffolk flocks in Essex are misleading, inasmuch
as some of the flocks with the highest percentage of lambs do not show
the percentage of twins ; at the same time I am disposed to think that
Essex is not so favourable a county as Suffolk for this breed of sheep.
   The difference in the return of lambs for Southdowns in East
Anglia and in the South, is probably due to the more careful records
which the smaller size of the flocks and the method of farming in
East Anglia allows, and I suspect the difference in the percentage of
twins may be similarly accounted for.
   In neither of the cases where different breeds are represented in the
same locality, does the percentage of twins of the foreign flocks
approach that of the home breed.        Southdowns do not approach the
fertility  of Suffolks in  East  Anglia, nor do Hampshires become as
fertile as Dorset Horns in the West country.
   The Suffolks, Hampshires, and Dorset Horns are most fertile in their
home districts ; in the case of the Shropshire breed, Staffordshire may
be considered a part of the home district ; and only in the case of the
Lincolns is it demonstrated that any breed thrives better in a foreign
district than at home. This was to be expected, for it can hardly be
doubted that natural selection, as well as artificial selection, has been
at work on the different breeds of sheep in this country.
   In the case of the Lincoln breed it is of interest to note, in this con
nection, that the method of farming in some parts of Lincolnshire has
greatly altered in modern times ; for instance, the facility which the
soil on the wolds affords to grow especially fine crops of roots, enables
the flock-masters in that district to keep more sheep per acre than is
possible on the low-lying farms ; this leads to crowding and to other
even more artificial conditions which, as the statistics indicate, are not
favourable to the fertility of the breed ; on the other hand several of
the more successful flocks m Yorkshire are run on grass chiefly and
under more natural conditions for sheep.
   The variation in fertility in different districts does not, however,
affect the racial character of the fertility of the different breeds (com
                           "
pare Tables IV and V — Per cent, of Twins           "),
                                                     except in the case of
the  Lincolns, where   the returns of  the Yorkshire flocks suggest that
this breed should be placed in the first rank with the Suffolks and
Shropshires, instead of in the second rank with Dorset Horns, Oxford
Downs, and Kents. The position of the Southdowns at the bottom of
the list remains unaltered.

104                             Mr. W. Heape.
   While the percentage of lambs and of twins in cross-bred flocks is
greater than the same percentage for the total pure-bred flocks, the
ewes of certain pure breeds are undoubtedly more fertile than the
average cross-bred ewe.
   The flock percentage of lambs in 306 pure-bred flocks, ranges from
203-8 to 59-09 per cent., the percentage for 89,370 ewes being 120'4
per cent.     The most frequent percentage in these 306 flocks is between
110 and 120 per     cent.; the following Table (I) shows this, and as the
column    for  "under 110 per cent." includes all failures, the excess in
the 110 per cent, column is all the more marked.
   There "are more flocks of between 100 and 200 ewes than of any
other number, and it is in these flocks the highest percentage of lambs
occur  ; broadly speaking, the frequency of a high percentage of lambs,
and the height of that percentage, vary in proportion to the number
of flocks and to their size.
                            Abortion and Barrenness.
   There is an element of error in these statistics, due to the fact that
some ewes abort at an early stage of gestation, when the foetus is small
and the circumstance liable to be overlooked by the shepherd ; some of
these ewes come " in use
                              "
                                 again and are again served by the ram, but
some do not again come " in use," or, owing to the fact that they have
already been drafted into a flock without a ram, they are not again
covered ; in either of these cases they are put down as barren.         Thus,
although    I do not believe the error is a great one, the percentage of
abortion in ewes may be higher and the percentage of barrenness lower
than is represented in Table IV.
    The total loss from both these causes amounts        to  7'1 per cent, for
all pure-bred ewes ; of these the Lincoln sheep suffer the most (12 per
cent.) and the Hampshires the least (4-01 per cent.), a very startling
difference    and of specially grave significance     to  Lincolnshire  flock-
masters on the wolds (see Table V).
                                     Abortion.
    In 300 pure-bred      flocks   the percentage of abortion varies from
 23'75 per cent, to 0, while the percentage for 85,878 ewes is 2-39.
 The Dorset Horn (4-11 per cent.) and the Lincoln (4 per cent.) breeds
 suffer most, while all other breeds except Southdowns have less than
 2 per cent.     The causes which induce a high percentage of abortion
are little understood, and severe losses are from time to time experi
enced from no known cause         (Lincolns    20 to 30 per cent, and Dorset
Horns).
    Statistics supplied  indicate,   that an undue proportion of shearling

ewes    in  a flock is associated with a high percentage of abortion
(Lincolns), and that ewes of a particular breed run on certain subsoils
or in certain districts are more liable to abortion than the average for
that Tweed, as, for instance, Lincolns run on the wolds and Hampshire*
on oolite formation.
   In some parts of Lincolnshire abortion sometimes approaches, if it
does not actually assume, an epidemic form; at such times several
neighbouring flocks may experience between 30 and 40 per cent, of
aborted ewes ; I am unaware of a similar form of abortion in any other
district.
   Unsuitable food, causing indigestion and intestinal irritation, said
poor food, resulting in poor nutrition, are probably responsible for the
greatest proportion of abortion in ewes.      It is not the kind of food, as
is frequently supposed, but the condition of that food which is at fault,
and, as a result, my schedules show that poor condition of ewes during
gestation is undoubtedly associated with a relatively high percentage
of abortion.
   The highly artificial conditions under which sheep are kept in many
districts in this country, renders the question of the most suitable food
for breeding ewes a very important question, and it is one regarding
which but little attention has been paid.
   The most frequent percentage of abortion experienced in 300 pure
bred flocks is shown in Table   II to be under 1 per cent.      The highest
percentage is relatively more frequent in large than in small flocks, and
this table shows that much more irregularity is experienced in abortion
than Table I shows is the case for fertility.
                                 Barrenness.
   In  327 flocks of pure-bred ewes the percentage     of barrenness varies
from 51-42 per cent, to 0, while the percentage for 96,520 ewes is 4-71.
The Lincoln (8 per cent.) and the Shropshire (6'06 per cent.) breeds
suffer the most, while, with the exception of Hampshire Downs, Dorset
Horns, and Suffolks, no pure breeds record less than 5 per cent, loss
from this cause.
   The district or subsoil on which ewes are run is associated, in certain
breeds, with the proportion of barrenness experienced : thus, Lincoln
sheep run on the wolds, Shropshire sheep on new red sandstone subsoil,
and Hampshire sheep elsewhere than on chalk downs, are associated
statistically with a relatively high percentage of barrenness ; an exces
sive proportion of shearling ewes in a flock is also frequently found
associated with a high percentage of barrenness ; but the quality of
 the food given and the condition of the rams and ewes at tupping time
is no doubt the chief factor which influences the barrenness percentage.
    Fat is well described as an enemy to fruitfulness, while the want of

                                On Red-water or Texas Fever.                             Ill
     sufficiently nutritious food also results in poor returns of lambs.
     Among Suffolk and Shropshire ewes, which are highly fed as a rule, a
     high percentage of barrenness occurs in cases where they are exces
     sively highly fed ; on the other hand, among Dorset Horn, Lincoln,
     and Kent ewes, which are certainly not too highly fed as a rule at tup
     ping time, the highest percentage of barrenness occurs among the
     poorest kept flocks.
         The most frequent percentage of barrenness experienced in 327
     flocks is 1 to 2 per cent., but, as Table               III  shows, the returns are
    much more irregular than was the case for abortion, and there is a
    much larger proportion of flocks in the " 10 per cent, and over
                                                                                             "
    column. The slightly excessive proportion of flocks in the 5 per cent,
    column suggests generalised results rather than accurate returns, but
    the number of flock-masters who are responsible for this is obviously
    very small.
         In  conclusion   : —
         1. Whereas     the total loss from abortion and barrenness is fairly con-
Istant for most pure breeds of sheep, the Suffolks and Hampshires are
    markedly free from, and the Lincolns markedly liable to, heavy loss
   from these causes.
  .      2. Although the loss from the above causes does exert an influence
   on the returns of fertility of the various breeds, it does not account for
    the wide variation which exists in this respect.
         3. The ewes of certain pure breeds are conspicuously                 more fertile
   than the average cross-bred ewe ; and
        4. The fertility of certain pure breeds is sufficiently marked to con-
'
   stitute a racial characteristic.

       1. The blood of animals, themselves healthy, from a red-water area is dangerous
  if inoculated into an imimal which suffers coincidentally from another disease.
       2. That the blood of animals suffering from mild or modified red-water may be
  safely used to inoculate a healthy animal subcutaneausly, but is dangerous when
  injected into a vein.

tional evidence as to the'communicability of the disease by the use of
blood derived from animals which have been either recovered from the
sickness for a very considerable time or which have been inoculated
many months previously to the date on which their blood has been used.
   On the 8th December, 1898, I withdrew some blood from animal
No. 18, which has been continuously under observation since it was
inoculated     on the       22nd   December,    1897.        After defibrinating the
blood, 20 c.c. was used to inoculate a young ox (No. 54) by intravenous
injection. On the following day a sharp rise of temperature occurred,
which reached to 106'6 F. On the following morning it was observed to
have fallen to 99'8° F. Three days later the temperature was again over
104° F., but fell previous to the next morning. From this time onward
an erratic course of temperature was observed, and on the twenty-fifth
day, subsequent to inoculation, it was seen to be ill, refused food, but had
no definite symptoms of " red-water."     Three days later it died.      The
blood on examination was seen to contain the spherical forms of the
parasite.
   On post-mortem examination, the bladder and urine were quite
normal.   The liver was not enlarged, but was somewhat discoloured
in patches, and the biliary ducts were distended with bile.    The bile
was much altered, being stringy and of a greenish-yellow colour.     The
spleen was normal in size and consistence.  The  kidneys were  enlarged
and the pelves were filled up by a yellowish gelatinous exudation.
The cortex was somewhat congested, but there was no evidence of any
true inflammatory change. The general muscles were pale in colour,
and there was slight evidence of jaundice. This experiment serves to
show that an animal which has been inoculated with infected blood,
while it may not develop much illness as a result of               it,
                                                         really infected

and, moreover, its blood,    drawn as late as
                                   if             year subsequently,
                                                             a                          is
yet so infective that an intravenous injection of                  it,

lent when iujected into a vein in another animal,       it   issafely to be inferred that
the animal suffering from the mild form becomes              more or less immunised or
" salted."
   On these grounds would suggest a method of protective inoculation against red-
                    I
water in the following manner. Having procured           a    healthy animal from a red-
water area, or one which     inown to have been      l'
                             is                         salted," inoculate it by injecting
5 c.e. of red-water blood into the jugular vein and     5  c.c. subcutaneously.   In cages
where the operator      unable to attempt the vein inoculation
                       is                                          I   would recommend
the subcutaneous inoculation of     c.c. in four different sites.
                                    5
   Allow at least twenty-eight days to elapse, and if any degree of illness     is  recog
nised, the blood of this animal may be used, after being defibrinated, to inoculate
healthy cattle. For such inoculation only       c.c. should be injected into small
                                                 5
nnimals and not more than 10 c.c. into larger.
  Seeing, however, that the presence of other maladies renders such a proceeding
unsafe,I  would recommend that      should only be practised during the autumn or
                                        it

  animals,  will certainly infect, and may even kill, although after  a some
 what extended period of time.
     Very important corroboration of this is furnished by the experience
 of inoculation for red-water, which has lately been adopted in the Cape
 Colony. Four animals which were immune to red-water (three by reason
 of having had the disease and recovered, and one by being born and
 reared on permanently infected veld) were sent from Fort Beaufort to
 Queenstown to be used by the veterinary surgeon there for inoculation
 purposes.     The animals to be used for inoculation had been " fortified,"
 i.e., re-inoculated with virulent blood, seven weeks previously.
     Twenty animals were inoculated with defibrinated blood from one
 animal, the doses used being 10 to 20 c.c., according to age.       All had
 a febrile reaction and some slight symptoms of the sickness, but easily
 recovered.     From one of the other of the four animals blood was taken
 and used to inoculate seven head, giving doses of 10 to 15 c.c.       These
 also all had a reaction, but made good recovery.
     On November 1st the four animals were re-inoculated with virulent
 red-water blood, and in each case 5 c.c. was injected intravenously and
 10 c.c. subcutaneously.     Twenty-nine days later they were bled. With
 this blood two lots of cattle were inoculated.
     One lot consisted of 107 animals which had not ever been exposed to
 red-water infection. The doses used were increased beyond those
 which I had recommended, namely, 10 to 25 c.c. were used, according
 to age. Of these animals no less than seventeen died of characteristic
 red-water.     The remainder made a good recovery.
     The second lot consisted of fifty-three head of cattle, all of which,
 with one exception (an imported animal) had been born and reared on
 red-water veld.     The imported animal was the only one which showed
any signs of reaction, but it made a good recovery.
    This experience has sufficed to show that it is not always safe to
exceed the doses which I have recommended, unless the animals which
have been used for withdrawing blood have been untouched for at
least a considerable   number of months.
    I  have been able, with the co-operation of several farmers, to carry
out experiments by which inoculated cattle have been fully exposed to
infection at later dates. In May, 1898, I inoculated ten head of old
cattle with blood from an animal which had been inoculated, six months
previously, with virulent blood. These cattle were immediately removed
from the Institute, and later sent to an infected area in company with
ten head of young animals which were uninoculated, but, as is com
monly known in this colony, are not so liable to death from this dis
ease as are   older animals.    Of the young stock all have been infected
by exposure in the veld, and three have died.            Of the older, more
susceptible, animals not one has shown the slightest signs of illness,
and the cows have given birth to healthy calves.

    Mr.  J. H. Webber had twenty-eight head of Fish River cattle inocu
lated on the 7th November,      1898, and subsequently  had them removed
to his farm, which is well known to be one of the worst infested
areas in the eastern province.       Previous experience has shown that if
clean cattle are placed there they become very quickly affected with
the disease.     On the 5th December one died from gall-sickness, but,
with this exception, all have done very well, and are at this date
in perfect health.
    This method of inoculation has proved so satisfactory to the
fariners themselves that it is being very generally adopted, and the
farmers have petitioned the Government to arrange for an inoculating
station being placed at Graham's Town, so that clean cattle coming
from clean Karroo areas for transmission to the coast may be inocu
lated previous to entering the infested belt.

   For incandescent gas mantles, it is found that certain definite mix
tures of the rare earths are necessary, in order to obtain the maximum
luminosity.     For instance, in the ordinary Bunsen gas flame, a mantle
consisting of pure thorium oxide, or of pure cerium oxide, will only
give about one-eleventh of the light that is given by a mantle com
posed of 99 per cent, of thorium oxide, and 1 per cent, of cerium
oxide, which is the mixture at present used by the Welsbach Com
pany.
   In order to explain this remarkable fact, several different and some
what contradictory theories have been propounded, one of which implies
catalytic or other chemical action between the oxides and the consti
tuents of the Bunsen flame.
   In order to investigate this question, it is obviously important to
note the behaviour of the rare earths at high temperatures without
contact with any flame, and endeavours have already been made to
effect this by heating the oxides in specially constructed furnaces.
Under these conditions, only very minute differences could be detected
in the amount of light given by different oxides and mixtures, but it
appears doubtful whether the very high temperature of the Bunsen
flame was really attained.
   It has occurred to the writer, that very high incandescence could be
produced by enclosing mantles in a vacuum tube, and subjecting them
to bombardment      by means of cathode rays, when the mantles would
not  be  in contact with anything except the cathode rays themselves,
and the comparatively small amount of residual gas that remains in
the tube at the requisite high degree of exhaustion.
   Since the date of Sir William Crookes's early researches, it has been
known that a very high temperature could be produced in a body
placed at the focus of the convergent rays from a concave cathode.     In
this manner Crookes melted platinum and glass, and brought carbon
wool to bright incandescence.        The writer has made many experi
ments on this subject, using instead of the interrupted continuous
currents employed       by previous investigators,   alternating electric
currents, which appear to have many advantages for this purpose.
At the Royal Institution, in February, 1898, the writer showed that
very brilliant incandescence could be obtained for a short time in a
small block of lime, placed in a suitably exhausted tube midway
between two concave electrodes, connected to an alternating electric
supply at about 6000 volts pressure, and in June, 1898, at the Royal
                                                              K 2

 116      Mr. A. A. Campbell Swinton.        On the  Luminosity
 Society, he exhibited in action a similar arrangement, but with the
 block of lime replaced by a flat plate of thorium oxide.     In this case
 the concave electrodes were of such a curvature and were placed so far
 apart, that the two sides of the thorium plate in each case intersected
 the diverging cone of cathode rays.     Under these conditions nearly a
 square  inch  of the  thoria  surface on each side of the plate became
 highly incandescent, and a very powerful light was obtained for some
 minutes at a time, but only at a critical and highly unstable degree of
vacuum.
    The writer has now applied this method to the investigation of the
 comparative luminosity of different mixtures of the rare earths.
   One form of the tube employed was constructed as shown in the above
figure, where C, C' are two spherically concave discs of aluminium 1-125
inches diameter,   and  6 inches radius of curvature.    These electrodes
are placed about 7 inches apart, and were connected to the secondary
terminals of a 10-inch Ruhmkorff coil, the primary of which was
supplied through a variable resistance, with alternating electric current
at 100 volts pressure from the main.          The tube was connected
through a drying tube, containing phosphorus pentoxide, to a pair of
Toepler pumps, and also to a McLeod gauge.
   The mantle M M to be experimented upon, was mounted on a
platinum wire frame and placed between the two electrodes, so that
as the electric current alternated, and each electrode became in turn
cathode, the mantle was subjected on alternate sides to cathode ray
bombardment.      The curvature of the electrodes was such as to give
almost parallel beams of cathode rays, so that a considerable ring

     of  the  Hare Earths when heated in Vacuo by Cathode Rays.         117
  shaped,    and slightly hollow, area on each side of the mantle was
  subjected to the rays, and could be brought to high incandescence.
    A   preliminary experiment was made with a mantle of asbestos,
 powdered over in patches with pure thorium oxide.         With this it waa
 found that at a suitable degree of exhaustion, the patches of thoria
 became brilliantly incandescent, with an intensity of cathode rays that
  made the asbestos barely red hot.
    Experiments were next made with mantles          consisting entirely of
  thoria and ceria, both separately, and mixed in different proportions.
  These mantles were prepared in a similar manner to the Welsbach
 incandescent gas mantles, by saturating a carefully purified cotton
 fabric with ammonium nitrate of thorium and cerium, and then
 burning out the cotton.       Very thick and closely woven cotton lamp
 wick, freed from foreign matter by treatment with caustic so'da,
 hydrochloric acid, and ammonia, was employed in place of the thin
 fabric usually used, so that the resulting mantle after burning out the
 cotton, was very close in texture, and fully 0'2 inch thick. This was
 found necessary, as otherwise some of the cathode rays passed through
 the mantle and melted the opposite aluminium electrode.
    In order to obtain accurate comparisons between pure oxides and
different mixtures, the mantles were made in patchwork, each complete
mantle being made up of two or four sections, separately impregnated
with different solutions, and then sewn together with impregnated
cotton before being burnt.
    The mantles were so mounted in the vacuum tube that the cathode
rays impinged equally upon the portions that consisted of different
mixtures, so that an equal amount of energy was imparted to each
sample.
    With a compound mantle prepared in this way, composed one-half
of pure thorium oxide, and the other half of a mixture of 99 per cent,
thorium oxide plus 1 per cent, of cerium oxide, it was found after
exhaustion that on starting the cathode discharge the thoria plus ceria
heated up to incandescence more rapidly, and, on stopping the dis
charge, cooled more rapidly than the pure thoria.        Further, when at
full incandescence and observed through a dark glass, the thoria plus
ceria was slightly more luminous than the pure thoria, though the
difference was very small, probably not more than 5 per cent.       Owing
to the difficulty of maintaining a constant vacuum, accurate photo-
metrical measurements were not possible, but the amount of light
under    favourable   conditions was roughly estimated at, at least, 150-
candle power per square inch of incandescent surface, this being
obtained with an expenditure of electrical energy in the secondary
circuit at about 8,000 volts pressure of approximately 1 watt per
candle.       The amount of exhaustion suited to give the best results
varied with the dimensions of the tube and the conditions mentioned

  118       Mr. A. A. Campbell Swinton.          On the Luminosity
  below,   but was approximately about 0-00005 atmosphere, the maxi
  mum luminosity being obtained when the dark spaces of the two
  cathodes just crossed at the centre of the bulb.          Owing to the large
  amount of gas occluded by the mantle, a proper degree of permanent
  exhaustion was very difficult to arrive at, and required continuous
  pumping for many hours with the cathode rays turned on at intervals.
  Even then the conditions of maximum luminosity were exceedingly
  unstable, owing to the further liberation of occluded gas on the one
  hand, and on the other to the rapid increase in the degree of exhaus
  tion owing to absorption of the residual gas by the electrodes.        That
  such absorption probably took place in the aluminium electrodes, and
  not in the mantle, was demonstrated by other experiments with a tube
 in which there was no mantle, but only two electrodes of aluminium
 wire.
     After the cathode rays had been allowed to bombard the mantle for
 •A short time, the latter was found to have become discoloured where
 bombarded.      That portion which was composed of pure thoria became
 dark blue, while the thoria plus ceria became brown.             This effect,
 which appears to be analogous to those observed by Goldstein with
 lithium chloride and sodium chloride,* seems to be due to a partial
 reduction of the oxides by the cathode rays.         The admission of a very
 minute quantity of air to the tube while the cathode rays are acting on
 the mantle, and the latter is in parts incandescent, causes the dis
 coloration to disappear instantaneously on the incandescent, but not
 upon the cool portions, probably by re-oxidation of the partially
reduced oxides, while the discoloration also slowly vanishes in a day
 or two with the mantle cold if air at ordinary atmospheric pressure is
 admitted to the tube.       By continuing to bombard the mantle with
cathode rays, and alternately allowing the vacuum to increase and
letting in small quantities of air, the discoloration can be made to
appear and to disappear over and over again as often as desired.           At
the moment of admitting the air, the amount of light was foimd
momentarily to increase, this being probably due to the increased
temperature due to the re-oxidation of the partially reduced oxides.
    After repeating this process of letting in small quantities of air, and
allowing them to be absorbed, several times, it was found that the
degree of exhaustion which gave the maximum incandescence had
altered from 0-000047 to 0-000112 atmosphere, as measured by the
McLeod gauge. Similar effects were obtained with a tube containing
no mantle, but only aluminium wire electrodes, the inference being
that some change takes place in the residual gas which renders it less
conducting.
    At a higher degree of exhaustion than that which produced incan
descence of the mantle, the pure thoria was found to fluoresce blue,

     of the. Har* Earths when heated in Vacuo by Cathode Rays.          119
and the thoria plus ceria with a yellowish light.       The fluorescence in
 each case was much less bright    when  the oxides were white than when
 they had become discoloured by previous bombardment.            With very
 high exhaustions the thoria plus ceria fluoresced the more brightly ; at
 lower exhaustions the pure thoria gave the brighter fluorescence.
    On the suggestion of Mr. W. Mackean, the tube was pumped up to
a very high vacuum and oxygen admitted.          A similar experiment was
 made with hydrogen, the tube being completely filled with the gas,
and then pumped to the proper degree of exhaustion.         Though at low
 exhaustions these gases gave distinctive appearances to the discharge
in the tube, no difference in the behaviour of the mantles with them
and with air could be detected when once the vacuum reached the
degree required for producing incandescence of the mantle.
    Further experiments were made with a similar tube containing a
compound mantle made up of four sections, composed as follows : —
(1) pure ceria, (2) pure thoria, (3) 50 per cent, thoria 50 per cent, ceria,
(4) 99 per cent, thoria 1 per cent, ceria.
    With an intensity of cathode rays that gave a brilliant light with
Nos. 2 and 4, Nos. 1 and 3 were found to give practically no light,
becoming barely red hot ; while, as before, No. 4 was found to give
slightly more light than No. 2, and to heat up more rapidly and cool
more rapidly than the latter.
   These experiments show that thoria and ceria, both alone and mixed,
behave quite differently when heated by cathode ray bombardment
than when heated in a Bunsen flame.           In the latter, 99 per cent,
thoria plus 1 per    cent, ceria gives many times as much light as pure
thoria alone, while, when incandesced by cathode rays of equal inten
sity, the difference, though in a similar direction, is exceedingly small.
Again, in the flame pure ceria gives just about the same amount of
light as pure thoria, while with a given intensity of cathode ray bom
bardment thoria gives a brilliant light, while ceria gives practically
none.
   In arriving at any finally satisfactory theory of the luminescent pro
perties of the rare earths, these results with cathode rays, which differ
materially from those obtained by other methods of heating, will
require to be taken into account.

         Vapours." By HAROLD A. WILSON, B.Sc. (Lond. and Vic.),

      The experiments described in this paper were undertaken with the
 'object of following up the analogy between the conductivity of salt
  vapours and that of Rontgenised gases, and especially of getting some
  information about the velocities of the ions in the flame itself.
     They are to some extent a continuation of the research of which
 an abstract has already been published in the 'Proceedings of the
 Royal Society.'*
     The paper is divided into the following sections :—
     (1) Description of the apparatus for producing the flame.
     (2) The relation between the current and E.M.F. in the flame.
     (3) The fall of potential between the electrodes.
     (4) The ionisation of the salt vapour.
     (5) The relative velocities of the ions in the flame.
     (6) The relative velocities of the ions in hot air.
     (7) Conclusion.
     The apparatus used for producing the flame was similar in principle
to that used in the investigation referred to above. Carefully regu
 lated supplies of coal gas and air were mixed together along with spray
of a salt solution, and the mixture burnt from a brass tube 0'7 cm. in
diameter.
     The flame thus obtained was steady, and measurements of its con
ductivity, when      a particular salt solution was sprayed, did not differ
more than 1 or      2 per cent, on different days.      The height of the inner
sharply     defined  green   cone  was  l-5  cm., and   that of the outer cone
7-5 cm.
     The current between two gauzes of platinum wire, each 14 cm. in
diameter, and placed horizontally one above the other in the flame, was
measured for E.M.F.'s up to 800 volts, and with various distances
between the gauzes.
     The current with    a large E.M.F. was found to be independent of the
distance     between   the electrodes when the upper electrode or gauze
was positively charged, provided that the distance between the elec
trodes was not so great that the upper one was in the cooler parts of
the flame near its point.          When the upper gauze was comparatively

cool the current was much smaller, but               if the upper gauze was kept
hot by passing a current through              it,
                                        then the current with     large a
E.M.F. was independent of the distance between the electrodes, even
when the upper electrode was above the point of the flame.
      both of the electrodes were hot, then the current, as the E.M.F.
     If
was increased, attained    nearly constant value.
                             a                    Cooling the positive
electrode by raising     in the flame caused the current to increase
                           it
towards this saturation value much more slowly than before, while
cooling the negative electrode, the positive one being hot, caused the
current to show no sign of arriving at maximum value. The current
                                                 a
was much greater when the negative electrode was hot, and the positive
electrode cool, than when the negative electrode was cool, and the
positive one hot.
   The fall of potential in the flame between the gauzes was examined
by putting in an insulated platinum wire, and finding the potential           it
took up. When both the electrodes were hot, the fall of potential
closely resembled that observed in gases at low pressures. That   to say,
                                                                        is
near each electrode there was      comparatively sudden fall of potential
                                   a
much greater near the negative electrode than near the positive, with
a  small and nearly uniform gradient in between.           either of the
                                                               If
electrodes was cooled, then the fall of potential near that electrode
became much greater, and often was nearly equal to the total drop of
potential between the electrodes.    This effect was usually much more
marked in the case of cooling the negative electrode than with the
positive electrode.
    If the positive electrode      was uppermost and somewhat cool, then
with small E.M.F.'s       practically all the potential fall occurred near to
the positive electrode; but      if    the   E.M.F. was sufficiently increased,
then   a drop of potential appeared at the negative electrode, and with
a  still greater E.M.F. this became greater than that at the positive
electrode, as   it in gases at low pressures.
                     is
   Some of the results obtained pointed to the conclusion that nearly
all the ionisation of the salt vapour takes place at the surfaces of the
glowing electrodes, and not throughout the volume of the flame. A
variety of experiments were tried to test this view, all of which con
firmed its correctness. Thus, with two platinum foil electrodes opposite
one another in the flame, no increase in the current between them
occurred when     a    bead of salt was put between them, so that the salt
vapour from     it   passed between them without touching either electrode.
If  the vapour came in contact with the negative electrode, there was
a great increase in the current, and    considerable but smaller increase
                                             a
when     came in contact with the positive electrode.

   The relative velocities of the ions of alkali metal salts in the flame
were estimated by finding the potential gradient necessary to make the
ions travel down the flame against the upward current of gases.

122       Electrical Conductivity         of Flames containing Salt Vapours.
   This was done by putting a bead of salt between the two gauze
electrodes, and finding what E.M.F. was necessary to produce an
increase in the current between the electrodes when the bead was
put in.
   The potential gradient corresponding to this least E.M.F. was then
determined.     In this way it was found that the positive ions of salts
of Li, Na, K, Rb, and Cs, all have nearly the same velocity in the
flame, whilst the negative ions of various salts of these metals also
have equal velocities which are about seventeen times as great as the
velocities of the positive ions.
   The velocity of the positive ions was estimated to be about 60 cm.
per second for one volt a cm., and that of the negative ions was about
1000 cm. per second.
  The relative velocities of the ions of various salts was also deter
mined in a current of air at about 1000° C., which was obtained by
passing the air through a platinum tube 1'3 cm. in diameter, and 50
cm. long, heated in a gas-tube furnace.    The method used was exactly
analogous to that used in the flame.     The ions could be divided into
three classes, in each of which all the ions had equal velocities, viz. : —
                                                                                 Velocity.

     It     appears that those ions which in solutions carry equal
          thus
charges have equal velocities in the gaseous state. This points to the
conclusion that the velocity of a gaseous ion in a given medium de
pends only on its charge.    The velocities are less than those calculated
for ions consisting of one atom, so that each ion appears to be a cluster
of atoms.          If    we regard this cluster as held together by the charge on
it,   then   it   is   reasonable to suppose that the size of the cluster will be
determined             by the charge.     Hence those ions having equal charges
will be of equal sizes, and consequently of equal masses, since the
atoms forming the cluster probably come from the medium rather
than from the small quantity of salt present. Consequently they all
have the same velocity under similar conditions.
   The two main results arrived at in this paper, viz., that the ionisa-
tion of the salt vapour in the flame takes place only at the surfaces of
the glowing electrodes, and that the velocity of the negative ions in
the flame     very much greater than the corresponding velocity of the
                 is
positive ions, enable the phenomena of unipolar conduction to be very
easily explained.             For example,   if    one electrode         is   much hotter than
the other, then          if   the hot electrode    is   negative,   will give off negative
                                                                    it

 favourable to their being dragged away from the electrode before they
 can recombine, so that the current is very small unless a very great
 E.M.F. is applied.

                                 (Abstract.)
    The first part of the paper contains an account of the instrument in
its present form, an account of the investigations leading up to the
form adopted being relegated to an appendix.
    The principle of construction is as follows :— A quartz thread
(which requires to be prepared with much care) is stretched horizon
tally between two supports,     to which it is soldered.   At one end the
point of attachment is the centre of a spring of peculiar construction,
designed so as to be capable of displacement in the direction of the
thread, but incapable of any transverse motion or vibration.
    At the other end the thread is attached to the axle of a vernier arm
moving over a sextant arc ; by turning the axle the thread may be
more or less twisted, the amount of twist being ascertained in terms of
the divisions of the sextant arc.
    Midway between the two supports the thread is soldered to a short
length of fine brass wire, which is adjusted so that the centre of
gravity of the wire does not lie immediately above or below the thread,
but at some distance from it. The wire forming the " lever " is then
rotated about the thread as axis in such a manner that the two halves
of the thread are twisted through about three whole turns, and the
torsion of the thread is then of such a value that the lever assumes a
horizontal position.     This adjustment is made by weighting the lever
with a small speck of fusible metal. The " balance," which determines
the position of the lever with respect to the horizontal plane through
the thread, is composed of the earth's gravitational force on the one
hand, and the forces of resilience of the twisted thread on the other.
Were gravitational force to increase, the centre of gravity of the lever
would fall, the end of the lever would move out of its sighted posi
tion, and the thread would have to be slightly twisted by the vernier
axle in order to bring the lever back to its sighted position.
   Differences in the gravitational intensity at different stations are
expressed in terms of the amount by which one end of the thread

  124              Messrs. R. Threlfall and   J. A. Pollock.
 has   to  be   twisted or untwisted to bring the lever to its sighted
 position.
    In carrying out the construction of the instrument on the principle
 thus explained the following conditions have to be fulfilled : —
    The instrument must be portable, and must be able to withstand
 the rough usage inseparable from travelling, without being put out of
 adjustment.      It must have a sensitiveness of at least one part in
 100,000 of the value of "g," i.e., a change in the value of "g"
 amounting to one part in 100,000 must be shown by the balance.
    These conditions have been satisfied in the following manner : — The
thread supports form part of a girder mechanism which is itself con
tained in a thermally insulated tube. During transport the lever is
arrested by a mechanism which clamps it with a definite pressure in a
definite position.      The end of the lever is observed by a microscope
which is always brought into the same relative position with respect to
the horizontal plane through the thread by means of sensitive striding
levels.    It is shown as a consequence of the mechanical conditions
that the lever will be in unstable equilibrium when its centre of
gravity rises above the horizontal plane through the thread by about
3°.   Consequently the accuracy with which the lever can be brought
to its sighted position is very great, for the position selected as the
sighted position is within a small fraction of a degree of the position of
instability.
    As it is necessary either to keep the balance in an atmosphere of con
stant density or to correct the observations for changes in the barome
trical pressure, the former course was decided upon, and consequently
the instrument is contained in an air-tight space. This involves working
the vernier axle through a stuffing box which must be practically fric-
tionless, a condition satisfied by a sort of mercury sealing.
    The difficulty in making the apparatus arises from the fact that
quartz fibres, though infinitely better than any other material, are not
really sufficiently perfect in their elastic properties for the present pur
pose, and it is only by a judicious balancing of advantages that it is
possible to arrive at the necessary sensitiveness.     Even after two years'
twisting    the  thread   of the  instrument  still  undergoes a continual,
though small, viscous deformation ; this, however, becomes sensibly
constant, and can be allowed for.
    A further complication arises from the fact that as the temperature
rises the quartz becomes stiffer. so that at a given station the circle
readings are a function of the temperature.         We have found that the
relation between the circle reading and the platinum temperature is a
linear one at ordinary temperatures.
    An essential feature of the apparatus, therefore, is a platinum wire
thermometer      placed alongside the thread.
    The following statement      shows concisely    the effect on a determi

 nation    of  gravity of the various observational          errors which are
 possible.    The instrument of course only refers differences of gravity
 to a known difference.      The results are expressed in round numbers,
 gravity being taken at its value in the latitude of Sydney.
    Our temperature observations may be inconsistent by at most one-
 hundredth of a centigrade degree ; this would correspond to an uncer

    The accuracy with which the microscope can be set on the lever is
 much greater than the accuracy of reading the sextant arc.              If our
 estimate of the latter is wrong by 5" the resulting value of
                                                                        " " is

 affected to the extent of one part in 1,300,000.
    The errors of levelling may amount to one part in 700,000 in the
 value of " g." This gives a possible maximum uncertainty of one part
 in 300,000 in the value of " g." The daily rate of the instrument does
 not introduce an uncertainty of anything like the amounts mentioned
'above, and can in any case be eliminated by observing alternately at
 two stations, the difference in the value of gravity between them being
 the subject of observation.
    Obsermtions. — Two observers      are required,   one for the balance and
 one at the thermometer     resistance box.
    It  is only possible to observe with sufficient accuracy when the tem
 perature is nearly steady ; we always observe therefore at a time when
 the temperature passes through a maximum or a minimum value.
 With the instrument as constructed of various metals it is also neces
 sary to avoid observing    too soon after any great and sudden variation
 of temperature.
    Journeys. — We have travelled with the balance from Sydney to Mel
  bourne by train, from Melbourne to Hobart by steamer, from Hobart
 to Launceston (in Tasmania) by train, back to Melbourne by steamer,
 and to Sydney by train.         We have also made many less extended
 journeys in New South Wales, having travelled over more than 6000
 miles with the instrument.
     Most of these journeys led to our making improvements in the
 instrument, and therefore are not to be regarded as forming surveys.
     If, however, a consistency of one part in 50,000 in the value of "g "
  be considered satisfactory, then the Tasmanian stations may be consi
 dered as surveyed, and the values assigned to gravity at these stations
 to be referred to the Melbourne-Sydney difference.         Since this journey
  was undertaken the instrument has been so much improved in detail
  that we do not discuss its results from a gravitational point of view.
     We have, however, made three test journeys between Sydney and
  Hornsby in New South Wales under proper conditions, and the result
  of these observations shows that at Hornsby the thread has to be
  untwisted at one end by the following amounts as referred to the
  reading at Sydney :—

126           Miss M. A. Whiteley and Prof. Karl Pearson.

   Journey     3. — Mean    of  Sydney — Hornsby     and  Hornsby   — Sydney.
        Difference   18-1 sextant minutes.
   The maximum difference is thus 0-4 sextant minute, and corresponds
to an uncertainty in the value to be assigned to the acceleration of
gravity at Hornsby as compared with that at Sydney taken as known
of one part in 500,000.         This we believe to fairly represent the accu
racy attainable by the instrument in actual field work. It is about
double of the outside accuracy attainable by invariable pendulums, not
connected by telegraph, and the observation takes about half an hour,
but the time depends on the time required for the temperature to
become steady.        The observations quoted took about three hours each.
Packing and unpacking takes about an hour and a half, and the actual
observing about five minutes, but the temperature must be watched to
the maximum or minimum before the observations begin.
   The weight of the instrument and of appliances taken directly from
the laboratory and packed in strong boxes is 226 lbs. ; by making
special appliances with a view to lightness this weight might be reduced
to one-half.

" Data for the Problem of Evolution in Man.                I. A First Study
       of the Variability and Correlation of the Hand." By Miss
       M. A. Whiteley, B.Sc., and Karl Pearson, F.R.S.               Received
       April 6,— Read April 27, 1899.
    1. In  a more purely theoretical    discussion of the influence of natural
selection on the variability and correlation of species, which one of the
present writers hopes shortly to publish, a number of theorems are
proved which it is desirable to illustrate numerically.        But the quanti
tative measures of the variability and correlation hitherto published
are comparatively few in number, especially when, as in the present
case, we desire to have their values for a number of local races of the
same species.      ¦When we have once realised that neither variability nor
correlation    are constant    for local races but are modified in a determi
nate manner by natural selection, and further that their differences are
the sure key to the problem of how selection has differentiated local
races, then the importance of putting on record all the quantitative
measures      we   can possibly ascertain of variability       and  correlation
becomes apparent.         For some five years past various    members of the

                  Data for    the Problem    of Evolution in Man.                127
Department of Applied Mathematics in University College, London,
have, so far as their other work allowed, been collecting and reducing
data concerning the variability and correlation of different organs and
characters in man.           So far as variability is concerned, 160 cases of
organs     in divers   races  of man were worked out by Miss Alice Lee, Mr.
G. U. Yule, and one of the present writers some years ago,* and since
then the more laborious task of measuring the correlation of characters
and organs in man has been going steadily forward, until at the present
time a considerable mass of material is reduced and ready for publica
tion.     The present series of short papers is intended to cover this
ground.        It will  simply state the numerical results reached and any
obvious conclusions to be drawn from them, leaving to a later date the
consideration of the material as a whole, and in particular its bearing
on the general problem of evolution and the relationship of local races
of man.
     2.  This first study deals only with one character of the hand in one
 sex and one race.          A wider range of material on the skeleton of the
 hand in another local race is already being dealt with.              But while the
 correlation of the anatomically simple parts of the hand is of very
 great importance, it does not follow that the complex members of the
 living hand may not be equally, or even more, significant when we have
 to deal with fitness for the struggle for existence.          So far as we have
 been able to ascertain, although much has been written as to the fitness
 of the hand for its tasks, no attempt has ever been made to ascertain
 quantitatively the degree of correlation of its parts. t Hence our
 first object was to get some idea of the correlation of the parts of the
 hand from an easily measured and in practice important part.                  Is the
 hand as highly correlated as the long bones, or as loosely correlated as
 the parts of the skull, or does it occupy some intermediate position like
  that of strength to stature ? We accordingly selected as an easily
  measured but still important character the first joint of the fingers.
  The measurement therefore covers, besides the fleshy parts, the head of
  the metacarpal bone together with the proximal phalange.                It is thus
  not anatomically simple, but it probably has much importance for the
  fitness of the hand, and is a measurement which with a little care can
  be made with considerable           accuracy.     Our measurements were taken
  with   a  small   boxwood     spanner graduated to 1/10 inch, and provided
     •  A diagram was exhibited at a soiree of the Royal Society three years ago, and
  we shall   be glad to send a photograph of that diagram to any one working at the
  problem of variation.    The data without the diagram are published in a paper on
  " Variation in Man and Woman." ' The Chances of Death,' vol. 1, pp. 256 — 277.
     t Here, as in other cases, both zoologists and anatomists have since the days of
   Cuvier, talked a good deal about correlation, but would even to-day be unable to
   reconstruct, with anything like quantitative accuracy, a skeleton from a long bone,
   a hand from a finger-joint, or a skull from a fragment.

 with a vernier, so that the readings could be nominally made to
  1/100 inch.    Both the hands of 551 women were measured. At first it
 was proposed to include only those of more than 20 years of age, but
 no sensible difference was found for the means of those between 18
 and 20, and accordingly some sixty or more between these years
 were included in the final results.         While more than a moiety of the
 measurements and nearly all the laborious arithmetical reductions were
 made by one of us, Miss M. A. Whiteley, we owe measurements on
 the students of University, Girton, Newnham, and Westfield Colleges
 to the energetic assistance of Miss Dorothy Marshall, B.Sc., and a
 further ninety sets, principally from the students of Bedford College,
 to Miss Edith Humphrey, B.Sc., to both of whom we wish to acknow
 ledge our great indebtedness.
     In the tabulation of results the grouping was done to 1 ,'20 inch, and

 of correlation, together with their probable errors, calculated by the
 processes and formulae already fully described in papers of the series

 the present writers.      Pianists were specially noted on the data cards,
 but their numbers did not seem sufficiently large to justify any con
 clusions as to the effect of use on variability and correlation — a subject
 which deserves very careful and special investigation.*

     We conclude at once that these joints in the right hand are very
sensibly larger than in the left.          In every case there is a, difference of
about 0'02,    and   this  is  many times larger than the probable error of
the difference, i.e.,    N/2 x 0-003 about.
    We might, therefore, conclude that the right hand is larger than the
left.    This conclusion is directly opposed to that of W. Pfitzner :* he
asserts that there is no quantitative difference between right and left
for the simple anatomical parts of the hand skeleton.                        His own
measurements, however, really do show such a sensible difference for
the first phalange.        All then we assert at present is that the first joint
and the first phalange are larger in the right than in the left hand of
women.       We prefer to state no more sweeping view at present as to
other parts of the hand, however strong our private opinion may be.

fingers of the right hand are less, the ring and little fingers more
variable     than those       of the left hand.        But if we use the more
reasonable coefficient       of variation, we see that all the first joints for
the left hand are more variable than the corresponding joints for the
right hand, and this is precisely what we might expect if there be                        •,
greater adaptation by selection, or by use of the right hand.                        The
greater the selection, the less the variability.
     In the left hand the relative order of variability (as measured by
the coefficient of variation) is that of the relative size of the fingers ;
in the right hand this is slightly modified.t           The work has been care-

    t The divergence is not one on which real stress can be laid considering the
 probable error of the coefficient of variation.   The hand confirms what we have
 already learnt from the long bones ('Roy. Soc. Proc.,' vol. 61, pp. 347 — 348),
 that 5 per cent, closely measures the variability of the chief parts of the human
 body.

fully re-done but no error has                    been discovered.       It would thus appear
that in the right hand the index finger is less variable than the middle
ringer.            The general order of utility of the fingers would appear to be
middle finger, index finger, ring finger, little finger, and this exactly
agrees with the order of increasing variability in the left hand.                          The
only doubt about this order appears in the relative efficiency and utility
of the middle and index fingers, which have a different order of varia
bility in the right hand.
     As all our subjects belonged to the educated classes, it is just possible
that the great use of the right hand index finger in writing has some
thing to do with this diversity.

    Now these tables indicate very important conclusions :—
     (i) The hand        a very highly correlated organ, far more highly
                         is
correlated than the skull and even somewhat more so than the long
bones.*     We are accustomed to give man precedence in life on
account of his brain power, and              might, perhaps, be thought that
                                              it
the brain case would be highly correlated in its parts.               Yet what we
find  is  that the skull       extremely individual, its correlations are low
                                   is
and a man could be readily identified by head measurements, whereas
hand measurements would be immensely less safe.                   In other words
the hand so far as its dimensions go (we put aside markings)                      far       is
closer to   a type than the skull.
   (ii)  The   parts of the left hand are distinctly more closely corre
lated than those of the right.          The only exception         the correlation
                                                                         is

difference here     isconsiderably less than the probable error of the differ
ence, and the general rule appears to be quite certain.              Now this
most remarkable result, but again how                to be interpreted
                                                       is   it                Is     1

that the greater the selection the less the variability and the less the
correlation.      Exceptions there can be, which will be discussed else
where, but this appears the general rule. Is the less variability and
correlation of the right hand a result of greater selection, or                 afteris  it
all result of use
     a                   ?   the latter we see how hopeless
                              If                                        to associate

constancy    of  correlation,  or  even  of regression  coefficients with   the idea
of local races.      Indeed the further we enter into the quantitative side
of the problem of evolution the more important appears the de
termination of the influence of growth and use on both variability and
correlation. Why            the right hand less variable and less highly
                              is
correlated than the left          Is the answer the same as to the question

       6. Index    Correlations. — One   present writers has previously

     expressed doubts of the validity of using index correlations as a
     measure of organic correlation, t At the same time it may not bc
     without value to put on record the correlations between the finger
     joints expressed in terms of the first little finger joint as unit.
        There are two methods of obtaining index correlations,             either
     directly by forming the actual ratios and then grouping them in cor
     relation tables, or indirectly from the variations and correlations of the
     absolute quantities by means of the formulae given in the memoir cited
so   in the footnote.    The latter is by far the easier process, but it neglects
     what are usually small quantities of the third order.           In order to
     justify the use of the latter method, the values of the constants for
     in = R i/R iv and       =
                                  ii/R iv were found by both methods. They

   It will   be seen at once    that the means and standard deviations
obtained by the two methods are very close, but that in the coefficients
of variation and correlation there may be a difference of some 3 per
cent.     Sensible as this            is,
                                its amount did not seem to justify the

correlations for organic relationship.

  It would    thus appear that the indices        for the left hand are all
larger   than for the right, or the index,       middle and ring fingers
relatively larger with respect  to  the   little finger in the left than the
right hand.    On the whole the variability of the right hand still
appears less than that of the left, i.e., two cases against one.

  Here, but not so decisively as in the case of absolute magnitudes,
the left hand exhibits higher correlation.   This higher correlation
becomes absolutely decisive, however,                        if   we consider the spurious cor
relations given below.

   Tn every wise the right hand exhibits more spurious correlation thun
the left, and our previous conclusion is thus thoroughly confirmed ;
the left hand exhibits higher organic correlation of its parts than the
right.    How is this to be explained 1 It is all important that further
researches should     determine whether it is selection or use which
differentiates the two hands.        It would be hardly possible to fmd a
sufficiently large group    of left-handed  persons to mark how far varia
tion and correlation were modified ; but measurements on the hands
of children, of the educated and uneducated, and of workmen following
particular trades might possibly throw light on the extent to which use
modifies correlation.
   We append the correlation tables giving the data upon which our
numerical values are based.

    This paper is a continuation of a paper under a similar title, published
in the 'Philosophical Transactions,' A, vol. 189, 1897.
    It was  there shown that between    the splash of a rough and that of a
polished sphere falling    the same distance  into water, there is a remark
able difference from the first moment of contact.        The causes of this
difference are now investigated.
    The configuration of the water surface below the general level, when
a rough sphere enters, is first studied by instantaneous photography,
and the origin is traced of the bubble that follows in the wake of the
sphere and of the emergent jet which follows its disappearance.           The
depression     or crater formed round the entering sphere is surprisingly
deep.     This cavity segments, the lower part following as a bubble in
 the wake of the sphere, while the upper part fills up by the influx of
surrounding water, which gathers velocity as it converges towards the
axis of the disturbance, and so produces the upward spurt of the jet.
    Experiments are described in which some idea of the actual dis
placements in the liquid has been obtained by letting the sphere
descend between two vertical slowly ascending streams of minute
bubbles liberated by electrolysis from two pointed electrodes.
    It is found that with a gradual increase in the height of fall of .
well-polished sphere, the splash changes in character, and that the
 sphere soon begins to take down air. But the height at which this is
 first noticeable is largely dependent on minute differences in the con
 dition of the surface, and even on its temperature.         It was further
found that dropping a smooth sphere through a flame, under certain
conditions, invariably alters entirely the course of the splash.         This
action of the flame is proved to be no action of electrical discharge,
and reasons are given for attributing it to the burning off of fine dust
which has collected on the surface during the fall.
    The influence of dust was proved by dusting one side only of a
 polished sphere, a proceeding which always results in completely
 changing the character of the splash on the dusted side.

    A           general explanation of all the phenomena is found in
        satisfactory
the view that with a smooth sphere, cohesion is operative in guiding
the advancing edge of the liquid sheath which rises over and closely
envelops the sphere.  If the surface is not rigid (e.g., is dusty), or is
rough, then the momentum   of the sheath carries              it,
                                                    once for all, away
from the surface of the sphere, and the subsequent motion      quite          is
different. The persistence of the remarkable radial ribs or flutings
observable in the film that ensheathes   smooth entering sphere
                                                  a                                    is
completely explained by the assumption of      viscous drag spreading
                                                        a
from the surface of the sphere outwards, and these flutings are always
absent from any part of the sheath that has left the sphere.     Their
presence      is   an   indication that there    is   no    finite slip at the solid
surface.
   Experiments made with water mixed with glycerine show that, up
to a certain point, the character of the disturbance          but slightly
                                                                     is
affected by large changes in viscosity.    With pure glycerine, however,
a  thin film of water absorbed from the atmosphere equivalent to a
layer -^ mm. thick, was found completely to change the course of                       a
splash,   a striking proof of the importance of the initial motion in
determining that which       to follow.
                                 is
   Experiments conducted in maw prove that the presence of the air
has no noticeable influence on the early course of    splash, but that its
                                                              a
pressure subsequently prevents cavitation of the liquid under what
would otherwise be negative pressures.
   The paper concludes with a reference to the remarkable similarity
between the splash at the surface of        liquid and that caused at the
                                                 a

with the suggestion that the explanation may be found in the argument
of Poynting,* which demands an increase of molecular mobility with
increase of pressure.

that offspring produced by parthenogenesis exhibit little or no vari

    The dimensions taken were : —
    (1) The total length of the body measured along a line passing ventrally
 from the base of the spine and cutting the convex surface of the head
 opposite the middle of the compound eye      (AB,   see figure).
    (2) The length of the protopodite of the 2nd antenna of the right side.
The measurement was made on the posterior surface of the proto
podite along a line parallel to the dorsal edge.           At the articulation
with the head the exo-skeleton of the protopodite possesses a well
defined point, which forms a good inner limit to the measurement
(CD).
    Since, under favourable conditions,    these animals     continue  to grow
throughout life, the second dimension       was expressed in terms of the
            Length of B. protopodite x
first, thus                               l(m
              Total length of body
    The mean of the relative length of the protopodite sinks as the
animal grows, but between a body length of 2-4 mm. and 3-6 mm. (the
total range of size) the change would not be large.          I find that at the
time of measurement      the offspring were constantly somewhat smaller
(0-4 to 0-5 mm.) than the parents, but as this applies to all the broods
which were measured, the rise in the mean of the offspring would not
affect the correlation surface.
    From twenty-three Daphnia (themselves          originating by partheno
genesis) broods were produced consisting of three to six individuals.
The parents were measured, and the offspring were allowed to grow up.
On measuring the offspring it was at once obvious that the children of
the   same brood exhibited very considerable variability.
   In the following table (p. 156) the results of the measurements          are
displayed in a correlation surface.
   The table illustrates the variability of children of the same partheno-
genetic family, and we can further see, for example, that offspring
with a parentage of 169'5 thousandths exhibited a range of variation
159'5— 181-5 thousandths.

    According to Mr. Galton's theory of ancestral heredity, a child, on
the average, inherits       l/4th of any inherited character from either of its
parents, l/16th from any one of its grandparents, l/64th from any one
of its eight great grandparents, and so on.
    From a mathematical standpoint Professor Pearson* has examined
Mr. Galton's theory, and he finds that if it             be expressed    in the form
              . i vn                 S.D. of offspring
                     S.D. of individual parent of the nth generation
the coefficients of correlation and regression between offspring and any
generation of ancestors flow directly from it. Professor Pearson shows
t  hat the total regression of the progeny on the mid-parent of any genera
tion is constant and is equal to 0-6, while the correlation and regression of
an individual parent of the nth generation (supposing equal variability
for all generations) = 0-6(£)" and the correlation of the mid-parent
of the nth generation          = 0-6
                                       --T-
     Hence the coefficients of correlation and regression of an individual
parent of the 1st generation (i.e., father or mother) = 0-6(J)' = 0-3, and
the coefficient of correlation of the mitl-parent =                        = 0-424, and
                                                              0-6^-^j
the coefficient of regression, as we have just seen above, = 0-6.
     Now, on comparing observation with theory, we see that the par-
 thenogenetic mother appears to act like a mid-parent ; the coefficients
 of    correlation and       regression being        respectively 0-466 and 0-619.
 Further, we know S.p.

 six grandchildren, the offspring of seven grandparents.                     With these

0'272±0-12, and the coefficient of regression = O5 + 0'2, while, accord

    The evidence of these measurements cannot be said to be conclusive,
and   I  am about to test the theory on some other parthenogenetic
animal.     If, however, this kind of inheritance be found to hold at all
generally in parthenogenesis, it would be a fact of very considerable
significance, and might conceivably give some insight into the physio
logical causes of heredity and variation.
"             equina (Willd.) : a Horn-destroying Fungus."           By H.
   Onygena
       MARSHALL WARD, D.Sc., F.R.S., Professor of Botany in the
       University of Cambridge.        Received  April   6, — Eead  May 4,
       1899.
                                 (Abstract.)
    The genus Onygena comprises half a dozen species of fungi, all very
imperfectly known, remarkable for their growth on feathers, hair,
horn, hoofs, &c., on which their sporocarps appear as drum-stick
shaped bodies 5 — 10 mm. high.         A cow's horn, thoroughly infested
with the mycelium of the present species, yielded material for the
investigation, and the author has not only verified what little was
known, but has been able to cultivate the fungus and trace its life-
history, neither of which had been done before, and to supply some
details of its action on the horn.
    The principal new points concern the development of the sporo
phores, which arise as domed or club-shaped masses of hyphae and
stand up into the air covered with a glistening white powder.         Closer
investigation shows this to consist of chlamydospores, formed at the
free ends of the up-growing hyphae. Their details of structure and
development are fully described, and their spore nature proved by
 culture in hanging drops.        The germination, growth into mycelia,
 and peculiar biology    of these  hitherto unknown spores were followed
in detail, and in some cases new crops of chlamydospores obtained
 direct in the cultures.
    When the crop of chlamydospores on the outside of the young
 sporophore is exhausted, the hyphae which bore the spores fuse to
 form the peridium clothing the head of the sporocarp, and peculiar
 changes begin in the internal hyphae below.
    Minute tufts or knots of claw-like filaments spring from the hypha'
 forming the main mass of the fungus, push their way in between the
 latter, and so find room in the mesh-like cavities.        Here the closely
                             —
 segmented claws form asci they are the ascogenous hyphae — and the

               Onygena equina      :   a Horn-destroying    Fungus.          159
details of development      of the asci, their nucleated      contents,  and the
spores are determined.          As the spores ripen, the asci, which are
extremely evanescent, disappear, and in the ripe sporocarp only spores
can be seen lying loose in the meshes of the gleba.           The ascomycetous
character of the fungus is thus put beyond question, though the
peculiar behaviour of the developing ascogenous tufts at one time
rendered it questionable whether the older views as to the relationships
were not more probable.
    No one had hitherto been           able to trace the germination of these
ascospores — the only spores           known previously — and De Bary ex
pressly stated his failure to do it.         The author finds that they require
digesting in gastric juice, and        so  in nature they have to pass through
the stomach of the animal.               By using artificial gastric juice, and
employing glue     and  other  products of hydrolysis of horn, the details of
germination and growth into mycelia, capable of infecting horn, were
traced step by step under the microscope and fully described.
    No trace of any morphological structure comparable to sexual organs
could be discovered, though many points suggest the alliance of this
fungus with Erysipheae and Truffles.
    The author also found that similar digestion promotes the germina
tion of the chlamydospores, and in both cases has not only traced the
germination step by step, but has made measurements of the growth
of the mycelium, induced the formation of chlamydospores                  on the
mycelium again,      and  by   transferring    vigorous  young   mycelia to thin
shavings of horn has observed the infection of the latter.
    It thus becomes evident that the spores of Onygena pass through the
body of an animal in nature, and, as might be expected from this,
extract of the animal's dung affords a suitable food medium to re-start
the growth on horn. Probably the cattle lick the Onygena. spores from
their own or each other's hides, hoofs, horns, &c., and this may explain
why the fungus is so rarely observed on the living animal : it is recorded
from such in at least one case however.
    Very little is known as to the constitution of horn, and some experi
ments have been made to try to answer the question — what changes the
 fungus brings about.      The research has also obvious bearings on the
 question   of the  decomposition of hair, horn, feathers, hoofs, &c., used
as manure in agriculture.        Although a bacterial decomposition of hoof
substance is known to       the  author, special investigation of the question
showed that in the present case no symbiosis          between bacteria and the
 Onygena exists.
    For the details    as to the     literature, the discussion  as to the syste
matic position of Onygma, the experimental cultures, growth measure
 ments, and the histology, the reader is referred to the full paper, which
 is illustrated by plates and numerous drawings.

   Tlie   External      Features    in the     Development of Lepidosiren

       A. SEDGWICK, F.R.S.             Received April 11, — Read May 4,
       1899.
                                      (Abstract.)
    The paper opens with a short account of the habits of Lepidosiren as
observed in the Gran Chaco.              A description is then given of the
external features in the development.            The more important points in
this may be summarised as follows.
    The egg is very large, 6'5 — 7 mm. in diameter.            It is surrounded
 by a special capsule at first thick and almost jelly-like in appearance,
later on (after fertilisation) thin and horny. Outside this was found in
 rare cases a thick jelly resembling that of the common frog's egg.
 The egg is without a trace of dark pigment.              Segmentation is com
 plete, resembling    most  nearly   that of  the  egg of  Amia, and leads to a
 condition with an upper hemisphere of small cells with large segmenta
 tion cavity, and a lower of large yolk cells.         Gastrulation begins with
 the appearance of a row of depressions, or a continuous groove along
 about one-third of the whole extent of the margin between small and
 large cells.   During its progress the small-celled portion spreads over
 the lower yolk cells by the addition to its margin of small cells split
 off from the yolk cells. As the groove referred to deepens into a slit
 to form the archenteron,          it becomes gradually shorter, and the
eventual complete blastopore is a crescentic slit only about a quarter of
the length of the original groove.           The medullary folds soon appear
running forwards from the blastopore.           There is no trace externally of
a blastoporic or protostonuil seam running along the back between the
medullary folds.       The folds are low and inconspicuous, and they are
continued into one another behind the blastopore, which becomes the
anus.    There are only slight traces of overarching of the medullary
folds to enclose a neural canal.         During the later stages of intraoval
development,     the  posterior end of the body becomes much more con
spicuously folded off the yolk than the head end.              The Lepidosiren
hatches out as a tadpole-shaped larva, still completely devoid of dark
pigment.      Just  about the time of hatching the cloacal opening closes
temporarily.       As the larva develops it becomes extraordinarily
amphibian-like.       It possesses large pinnate external or somatic gills,
four on each side, corresponding to branchial arches I, II, III, and IV.
A large cement organ is also present, which during its early stages is
of the characteristic crescent shape so usual in the embryos of Anura.
Pigment begins to appear about ten days after hatching — first in the
retina, then over the dorsal surface, especially anteriorly.          The larval
condition lasts during the first six weeks after hatching.          Towards the
end of this period the cement organ undergoes atrophy.              The somatic

              Thermal Expansion     of Pure Nickel and     Cobalt.        161
 gills atrophy later.  During the process of their doing so, the Lepido
 siren passes through a condition in which the stumps persist evidently
 corresponding to that well known in the young Protopterus, the group
 of external gills with their common stalk having come by differential
 development to be situated immediately above the fore limb.            After
 the close of the larval period the Lepidosirens become much darker in
 colour and more lively in their movements. Young were obtained from
 the nest up to a length of 60 mm.       About this time the cornea begins
 to assume the white unhealthy appearance that it has in the adult.        In
 the young of this size, small yellow spots appear, and in the young of
 90 mm. these are conspicuous.     Occasional yellow blotches persist in the
 young Lepidosiren of eighteen months, but in the adult they disappear.
    The paper concludes with general remarks on the phenomena de
scribed.    The segmentation approaches most closely that of Ganoids.
 The shortening up of the invaginating groove is considered to illus
 trate a process which has taken place in phylogeny in the passage from
 the primitive holoblastic egg to the meroblastic condition.         The con
 tinuity of the medullary folds behind the anus is adduced, together
 with the evidence accumulating of the prolongation of the blastopore
along the floor of the medullary groove in other forms (Amphibia,
Ceratodus, e.g.) as affording potent evidence in favour of the hypothesis
which derives the Vertebrata from ancestral forms as primitive as the
Coelenterata, and possessing a nelongated mouth traversing the neural
surface.    The occurrence of external gills in the young of three so
comparatively primitive groups of Vertebrata as Crossopterygians,
Dipnoans, and Amphibians ; their occurrence on four branchial arches
in Lepidosiren, and on at least the hyoid arch in Crossopterygians, and
the occurrence of a probable homologue on the mandibular arch in
Urodela, are taken as suggesting that these structures are organs of
great antiquity in the Vertebrate stem, and that there was formerly one
present on each visceral arch.     It is pointed out that were this so, it
would afford a theory of the origin of the vertebrate limb, which
would be supported by much of the evidence brought forward by the
supporters of the Gegenbaur view, and which at the same time would
avoid the most important difficulties in the way of this view.

   The author has carried out    a series of re-determinations    of the co
efficients of thermal expansion of these two metals with the aid of the
interference dilatometer described in a former communication to the
    VOL. LXV.                                                       N

162            Thermal Expansion of Pure Nickel and Cobalt.
Society.*      Since   the determinations made by Fizeau in the year 1869,
a   large   amount of additional knowledge has been accumulated with
reference     to nickel and cobalt,         including the discovery of the liquid
nickel carbonyl, which places processes of purification in the hands of
the chemist of a character so superior to the older methods, as to
render it highly desirable that re-determinations of the physical con
stants of these interesting elements should be carried out with speci
mens of the metals thus purified.                  By the kindness of Professor
Tilden, who has prepared such specimens with infinite care for the pur
poses of the investigation of other physical and chemical characters,
the author has been enabled to carry out determinations of the thermal
expansion with rectangular blocks varying in thickness from 8 to
 13 mm.       The blocks were furnished with parallel and truly plane
surfaces     by the makers of the dilatometer, Messrs. Troughton and
Simms.        The range of temperature of the observations was from
6°   to 121°.
     The results of the determinations of the coefficients of linear expan
sion a are as follows : —
                                a.  =            a      +          2bt.
           For nickel           a = 0'000 012 48 + 0-000 000 014               81.
           For cobalt           a = 0'000       012 08 + 0'000 000 012 8t.
     Nine different determinations were carried out for each metal, three
 in each of the three rectangular directions, in order to eliminate any
 slight error due to directional strain in the metallic blocks.                    As the
 metals crystallise in the regular system, the expansion should be the
 same in all directions.           The metal in each case had solidified after
 fusion in an oxy-hydrogen flame in presence at the last of excess of
 oxygen.       The individual results are highly concordant, the highest
 result for cobalt being still lower than the lowest of the nine values
 obtained for nickel. Hence there can be no doubt that the above
  coefficients represent the true relationships.
     The main result of the investigation may be summarised as fol
  lows : — The coefficients of linear expansion a of pure nickel and cobalt
  exhibit a slight but real difference, the coefficient of nickel being
  distinctly greater than that of cobalt.             This is true with respect to
  both    the   constant    «,  the    coefficient  for  0°, and the increment per
  degree, 2//, of the general expression for the coefficient at any tempera
  ture t, a. = a + 2bt. The difference is consequently one which augments
  with the temperature ; at 0° it amounts to 3-2 per cent., while at 120",
  the upper limit of the temperatures of the observations, it attains 4'5
  per cent.      Similar rules apply naturally to the cubical coefficients.
  The metal possessing the slightly lower atomic weight, nickel, is thus
  found to expand to a greater extent than the metal, cobalt, which is
   endowed with the higher atomic weight.

    In a communication to the Russian Scientific Congress, which met
at Kieff, last summer, Professor S. Nawaschin summarised the brilliant
results of his recent work on the fertilised embryo-sac of Lilium Mar-
logon and Fritillariu, tenelUi (August 30, 1898).                 The report of this
                                                               '
paper, published in the 'Botanisches Central blatt for January 4, 1899,
led Professor L4on Guignard to contribute a short account of his hitherto
unpublished researches on similar stages in the life-history of some
species of Lilium (L. martagon, L. pyrenaicum, and others) to the Aca-
de"mie des Sciences of Paris (April 4, 1899).
    The results thus obtained independently by two distinguished
botanists are in perfect accord, and present the greatest theoretical
interest.      They find that both the male generative nuclei on emerging
from the pollen tube are elongated in shape, and that each is more or
less twisted on its own axis.            The nuclei, in fact, appear to have been
killed by the fixative in the act of spontaneous movement within the
embryo-sac.         M. Guignard compares this motion to that of a non-
ciliated antherozoid.* The " vermiform shape can be traced in the
                                                       "
 male nucleus for some time after it has joined the nucleus of the
 ovum.t
     The most startling discovery, however, is that the second generative
 nucleus unites with the upper polar nucleus of the embryo-sac, and
 that both then fuse with the lower polar nucleus.                 Thus the definitive
 nucleus of the embryo-sac, which later on gives rise by repeated divi
 sion to the endosperm nuclei, is formed by the coalescence of three
 nuclei of very different origin.             One is the sister-nucleus of the male
 element in the fertilised ovum ; another, the sister-nucleus                    of the
 female element      ;  and the third has all the characters           of a vegetative
 nucleus.      Professors     Nawaschin and Guignard are in complete agree
 ment as to these facts.            M. Guignard adds that occasionally the polar
 nuclei have united before the arrival of the " antherozoid," and gives
 a number of figures in which the triple fusion is perfectly clear.
     I am fortunate enough to possess a few preparations from the fer
 tilised embryo-sac of Lilium Martagon, which, so far as they go, com
 pletely confirm the results of Professors Nawaschin and Guignard.
 The material was fixed in absolute alcohol for researches which were
 never even begun, but I cut a few hand sections from it immediately

Fourteen sections were kept, all of them stained with methyl green
and acid fuchsin.      As this, though a brilliant, is rather a diffuse stain,
I have lately re-stained eight of the preparations with Renault's hema
toxylin and eosin, which gives more precise results.
   None of these preparations show the vermiform nuclei free in the
embryo-sac.     In every case conjugation has already taken place ; the
male nucleus is applied to the female nucleus in the micropylar end of
the embryo-sae, and the second generative nucleus is applied to both
polar nuclei.    In one case only the two polar nuclei are not in contacte

    Excluding all doubtful cases, eight embryo-sacs show the male and
 female nuclei not yet fused but in contact.        In six of these the male
 nucleus is more or less elongated. It may be distinctly coiled (fig. 1, g.n),
 or merely horse-shoe or kidney-shaped, and commonly lies on the upper

or lower side of the much larger female nucleus.             (See Guignard's
figs.  3, 4, 8, and  10.)  In two    cases the male nucleus    is rounded, or
but slightly elongated.
    Eight embryo-sacs show the polar nuclei near the centre.            In five
cases the mass is clearly made up of three nuclei, and the generative
nucleus is distinguished from the other two by its irregular shape, the
differentiation of a slender chromatic ribbon, and by the absence of a
nucleolus.      In three embryo-sacs      two resting nuclei are applied to
each other near the centre.
    The pollen tube is very clear in several preparations, and it com
monly contains two small nuclei, stained green, and of irregular shape.
Since both generative nuclei are accounted for, these are probably due
to division of the vegetative nucleus.

       ceived March 6,— Read          April  27, 1899.
    In working with      coherers, made of iron or steel, some special diffi
culties are encountered in the warm and damp climate of Bengal. The
surface    of the metals soon gets oxidised, and this is attended with
 variation of sensitiveness of coherer.         The sensitiveness, it is true,
 does not altogether disappear, hut it undergoes a considerable diminu
 tion. The presence of excessive moisture in the atmosphere introduces
another difficulty. Substances to be experimented on become more or
 less opaque by absorption          of water vapour.    As fairly dry weather
 lasts in Bengal only for a few weeks in winter, the difficulties alluded
 to above are for the greater part of the year serious drawbacks in
 carrying out delicate experiments.           To avoid as far as possible the
 partial loss of sensibility of the receiver due to oxidation, I tried to
 use metals less oxidisable     than iron for the construction of the coherer.
 In my earlier     experiments I derived considerable advantage by coating
 the steel spirals with deposits of various metals.            Finding that the
 sensitiveness depends on the coating metal and not on the substratum,
 I used in my later experiments fine silver threads wound in narrow
 spirals.     They were then coated with cobalt in an electrolytic bath.
  The coating of cobalt was at first apt to strip off, but with a suitable
  modification of the electrolyte and a proper adjustment of the current,
  a deposit was obtained which was very coherent.           The contact surface
  of cobalt was found to be highly sensitive to electric radiation, and the
  surface is not liable to such chemical changes as are experienced in the
  case of steel.
     I  next proceeded ' to make a systematic study of the action of dif
  ferent metals as regards their cohering properties.             In a previous
  paper* I enumerated the conditions which are favourable for making
  the coherer sensitive to electric radiation.          These are the proper
  adjustment of the E.M.F. and pressure of contact suitable for each
  particular receiver.     The E.M.F. is adjusted by a potentiometer slide.
  For very delicate adjustments of pressure I used in some of the fol
  lowing experiments an U-tube filled with mercury, with a plunger in
  one of the limbs ; various substances were adjusted to touch barely the
  mercury in the other limb. A thin rod, acting as a plunger, was made
  to dip to a more or less extent in the mercury by a slide arrangement.
  In this way the mercury displaced was made to make contact with the

  May,  1895.

             Study  of the Cohering Action of different Metals.         167
  given metal with gradually increasing pressure, this increase of pres
  sure being capable of the finest adjustments.      The circuit was com
 pleted through the metal and mercury. Sometimes the variation of
 pressure was produced by a pressure bulb.           In the arrangement
  described above the contact is between different metals and mercury —
 metals    which were even amalgamated by mercury still exhibited
 sensitiveness to electric radiation when the amalgamation did not pro
 ceed too far.    In this way I was able to detect the cohering action of
 many conductors, including carbon. For studying the contact-sensitive
 ness of similar metals I made an iron float on which was soldered a
 split-tube in which the given metal could be fixed, a similar piece of
 metal being adjusted above the float, so that by working the plunger
 or the pressure bulb the two metals could be brought into contact with
 graduated pressure. The other arrangements adopted were the contact
 of spirals compressed by micrometer screw, and filings similarly com
 pressed between two electrodes.
    With the arrangement described above the action of radiation on
 metallic contacts was studied, a brief account of which will be given
 under their respective groupings. It may here be mentioned that
 certain metals which do not usually show any contact-sensitiveness can
 be made to exhibit it by very careful manipulation.     The nature of the
 response  of a coherer   is to a certain extent modified  by its condition
 and particular adjustment. A coherer freshly made is more difficult to
 adjust, but at the same time far more sensitive.       The action is more
 easily under control and more consistent after a few days' rest, but the
sensitiveness is not so abnormally great.      The contacts of bright and
 clear surfaces are difficult to adjust, but such contacts are more sensi
 tive than those made by tarnished surfaces.      Pressure and E.M.F., as
 previously stated, also modify the reaction.     For example, a freshly
 made and very delicately adjusted coherer subjected to slight pressure
and small E.M.F. showed an increase of resistance by the action of
radiation. The galvanometer spot, after a short interval, resumed its
former position, exhibiting a recovery from the effect of radiation.
The coherer continued to exhibit this effect for some time, then it
relapsed into the more stable condition in which a diminution of
resistance is produced by the action of radiation.        Another coherer
was found apparently irresponsive to radiation, there being the merest
throb (sometimes even this was wanting) in the galvanometer spot,
when a flash of radiation fell on the receiver.       Thinking that this
apparent immobility of the galvanometer spot may be due to response,
followed by instantaneous recovery, the galvanometer needle being
subjected to opposite impulses in rapid succession, I interposed a tele
phone in the circuit ; each time a flash of radiation fell on the receiver
the telephone sounded, no tapping being necessary to restore the sensi
tiveness.    The recovery was here automatic and rapid. After twenty
                                                                0 2

168      Prof.  J. C. Bose.    On a Self-recovering Coherer and     the
or   thirty flashes, however,    the receiver    lost its power of automatic
recovery,    and the sensitiveness    had then     to be restored by tapping.
An interesting observation was made to the effect that on the last occa
sion the receiver responded without previous tapping, a rumbling noise
was heard in the telephone which lasted for a short time, evidently due
to the re-arrangement of the surface molecules to a more stable condi
tion, after which the power of self-recovery was lost.
    The state of sensibility described above is more or less transitory,
and is induced, generally speaking, by a somewhat unstable contact
and low E.M.F. acting in the circuit.        In the majority of metals, the
normal tendency is towards a diminution of contact resistance by the
action of electric waves.        The occasional increase of resistance, in
general, disappears when the pressure and E.M.F. are increased.          But
in the case to be presently described we have an interesting exception,
where the normal state of things is just the reverse of what prevails in
the majority of metals.
                                  Alkali Metals.
    In the following     investigations the radiator is a platinum sphere
 9'7  mm.  in diameter.    The coherer was placed at a short distance, so
that the intensity of incident radiation was fairly strong.
    Potassium. — In working with this metal, the exceptional nature of
the reaction became at once evident.          The effect of radiation was to
 produce an increase of resistance. The pressure of contact was adjusted
 till a current flowed through the galvanometer, the galvanometer spot
 of light being at one end of the scale.      On subjecting the receiver to
 radiation the spot of light was deflected to the opposite end, exhibiting
 a great increase of resistance.      When the pressure and E.M.F. were
 suitably adjusted     a  condition  was   soon attained, when a flash of
 radiation made the spot of light swing energetically in one direction,
 indicating an increase of resistance : the receiver, however, recovered<
 instantaneously with the cessation of radiation, and the spot violently
 swung back to the opposite end, indicating the normal current that
 flows in the circuit.    This condition was found to persist, the receiver
 uniformly responding with an increase of resistance followed by auto
 matic and instantaneous recovery.        To prevent oxidation, the receiver
 was kept immersed in kerosene.          When the receiver was lifted from
 the protecting bath, it still continued to respond with an increase of
 resistance, but with a gradual loss of power of automatic recovery.
 This power was again restored on again immersing the coherer in
  kerosene.    The receiver in vacuo, or under reduced hydrogen pressure,
  would have been preferred, had the necessary appliances, been available.
     Sodium. — As we pass from potassium to the neighbouring metals,
 there is a gradual transition of property as regards the nature of
  response to electric waves.       With sodium the adjustment is a little

more     difficult than with potassium, but the response is somewhat
similar to that of potassium.             Though in general there is an increase
of resistance produced by electric radiation, there are occasional excep
tions when a diminution of resistance is produced.               With some trouble
the adjustment could be made so that the recovery is also automatic,
but it is not so energetic as in the case of potassium.
    Lithium. — Specimens of this metal not being available, I obtained a
deposit of it on iron electrodes by electrolysis of the fused chloride.
The action produced by electric radiation was sometimes an increase
and sometimes a diminution of resistance, the increase of resistance
being     the more      frequent.      With some difficulty it was possible to
adjust    the  sensitiveness   so  that  the recovery was automatic, but it was
not energetic nor did this power persist for a long time.
                              Me tuls of tlie Alkaline Earth.
    Pure metals of this group being not available, I had to rely on the
•deposit obtained by electrolysis.            Chloride of calcium was fused in a
 crucible, and deposits were produced on iron cathodes, the anode being
& carbon rod.        The deposit was not very even. One of the iron rods
 with the deposit was tested by immersion under water, when hydrogen
was evolved.        I did not succeed in getting deposits of either barium or
strontium, the temperature available not being sufficiently high.
    On making a coherer with calcium, and keeping it immersed in
kerosene, an action similar to that produced by sodium was observed.
The tendency of self-recovery was, however, very slight.
                            Magnesium, Zinc, and Cadmium.
    In these metals and in the succeeding groups there is a pronounced
tendency      towards a diminution of resistance by the action of electric
radiation. Magnesium being easily oxidisable, there is a thin coating
•of oxide on the surface.         When this is scraped, the metal makes a very
highly    sensitive    receiver.      The adjustment is not difficult, the metal
allowing a considerable latitude of pressure and E.M.F.                     It has
already been stated that the metals which are slightly tarnished can
 be more easily adjusted.
    Though there is in this metal a decided tendency towards a reduction
of contact resistance, yet it is possible by careful adjustment to obtain
an increase of resistance.           Indeed it is sometimes possible to so adjust
matters that one flash of radiation produces a diminution of resistance,
and the very next flash an increase of resistance.                 Thus a series of
flashes may be made to produce alternate throws of the galvanometer
 needle.     The more stable adjustment, however, gives a diminution of
 resistance, and receivers made with this metal could be made extremely
sensitive.      The tendency towards recovery is almost wanting.

   Copper   required  a much smaller     E.M.F.    The sensitiveness was only
 moderate.
    Gold was more difficult to adjust, but the action is a little stronger.
   Silver. — The receiver was extremely unstable.           It exhibited some
times a diminution and at other times an increase of resistance.
   It will  be seen from the above that all metals exhibit contact sensi
tiveness to electric radiation, the general tendency being towards a
diminution of resistance.
   The most interesting and typically exceptional case, however, is the
receiver made with potassium, which not only exhibits an increase of
resistance by the action of radiation, but also a remarkable power of
self-recovery.    In the accidental instances of increase of resistance
exhibited by other metals, an increase of pressure or E.M.F. generally
brought the coherer to the normal condition, which showed a diminu
tion of contact resistance by the action of electric waves. With potas
sium I gradually increased the pressure till the receiver grew insensi
tive.   All along it indicated an increase of resistance, even when one
piece was partially flattened against the other. I increased the E.M.F.
many times the normal value ; this increase (till the limit of sensitive
ness was reached)     rather augmented the sensibility and power of auto
matic recovery.      I allowed the receiver a period of rest, the nature
of response remaining the same. As far as              I have tried, potassium
receivers always gave an increase of resistance, a property which seems
to be characteristic of this metal, and to a less extent, of the allied
metals.
   It will   thus be seen     that the action   of potassium receiver is not,
strictly speaking,     a cohering    one.  For   it is difficult to sec how a
cohering action and consequent better contact could produce an in
crease of resistance.      It may be thought that the sudden increase of
current may, by something like a Trevelyan rocker action, produce an
interruption of contact.       But such a supposition does not explain the
instantaneous action, and the equally instantaneous recovery.
   In arranging the metals according to their property of change of
contact resistance, I was struck by the similarity of action of electric
radiation on potassium in increasing the contact resistance, and the
checking action of visible radiation on the spark discharge.             In the
latter case too potasium is also photo-electrically the most sensitive.
But the action is confined to visible radiation, and is most efficient in
the ultra-violet region.      I was indeed apprehensive that the action on
potassium receiver which I observed might be in some way due to the
ultra-violet radiation of the oscillatory spark.        But this misgiving was
put to rest from the consideration that the receiver was placed in a

glass vessel filled with kerosene, through which no ultra-violet light
                                                                  I
could have been transmitted. To put the matter to final test, lighted a
magnesium      wire in close proximity to the receiver without producing
any    effect.  Thick blocks of wood of ebonite and of pitch were inter
posed without checking        the action.    I then used polarised electric
radiation, and interposed a book analyzer, 6 cm. in thickness; when
the analyzer was held parallel, there was a vigorous action, but when
it was held in a crossed position all action was stopped. No visible or
heat radiation could have been transmitted through such a structure,
and there can be no doubt that the action was entirely due to electric
radiation.
    It  would be interesting to investigate whether the observed action
of electric radiation on a potassium receiver is in any way analogous
to the photo-electric action of visible light. I have commenced an in
vestigation on this subject, the results of which I hope to communicate
on another occasion.

        Mechanics in the University of Cambridge, and W. Rosen

        sity.  Delivered May 18, 1899.
                                   (Abstract.)
    In   a previous communication,     read to the Society on March 16, a
preliminary     account  was given  of  some of the results the authors had
arrived at in studying metals by the microscopic methods initiated by
Sorby, and pursued by Andrews, Arnold, Behrens, Charpy, Osmond,
Roberts-Austen, Stead, and others.         The present paper deals with a
development       and extension of the same work.         It relates chiefly,
though not exclusively,      to  the effects of strain, and  the relation of
plasticity to crystalline structure.
    It is well known that the etching of a polished surface of metal
reveals, in general, a structure consisting of irregularly shaped grains,
with clearly marked boundaries.        Each grain is a crystal, the growth
of which has been arrested by its meeting with neighbouring grains.
 This view, as Mr. Stead has pointed out, is strongly supported by the
appearance of the etched surface under oblique illumination, when the
 several grains are seen to reflect light in a way which is consistent only
 with the idea that on each there is a multitude of facets with a definite
orientation, constant over any one grain, but different from grain to
 grain. The formation of such a structure is well exhibited, on a rela
 tively enormous scale on the inner surface of a cake of solidifying

                     The Crystalline    Structure   of Metals.            173
bismuth, from which the still molten metal has been poured away.
 Another striking example of this structure is seen in steel containing
about 4£ per cent, of silicon.         The fractured ingot of this material
exhibits large crystals, and by deeply etching a polished surface
 Mr. Stead has obtained a beautiful development of the regularly
oriented elements of which the crystalline grains are built up* on a
scale so large as to require but little magnification.
    The authors have obtained much evidence that this structure is
typical of metals generally. Probably under no condition does any
metal cease to be crystalline.
    The crystalline character of wrought-iron bars or plates is seen when
the polished surface is etched, not merely by the general appearance of
the grains under oblique light, but by the development of geometrical
pits on the surface.     These pits have a definite orientation over each
grain, and the orientation changes from one grain to another. Usually
in the purest commercial iron their outline is that of plane sections of
a cube, but occasionally they are apparently plane sections of an octa
hedron. In some instances isolated and comparatively large pits only
are seen ; in others nearly the whole surface of a grain, when viewed
under a magnification of 1000 or 2000 diameters, is found to be
covered with small as well as large pits, geometrically similar and simi
larly oriented.     Photographs of these are given in the paper.
    For the purpose of producing smooth surfaces in the more fusible
metals, without polishing, the metal was poured in a molten state on a
plate of smooth glass.        The surface produced in this way shows well
the boundaries between the grains, and in some cases it also exhibits
 tho crystalline character of the grains in a remarkable way by means
of geometrical pits, which are apparently formed on the surface in con
sequence of the presence of small bubbles of air or, more probably, of
gas given out from the metal itself during solidification.          Cadmium
shows these particularly well, and they are to be observed also in tin and
zinc.    These air-pits are seen, under 1000 diameters, to be negative
crystals, similar and similarly oriented on each grain, and, in cadmium,
to have outlines which suggest that they are sections of hexagonal
prisms.     Their characteristics are exhibited in the photographs, which
also show how the boundaries between the grains are emphasised by
the collection there of air or of gas given off by the metal during
solidification. The true boundary is merely the trace of a surface on
a plane, but it may be broadened out in this way into a wide shallow
channel.
    The effects of strain have been examined        in many metals, using sur
faces prepared either by polishing or by casting against a smooth plate.
When any metal is strained beyond its elastic limit in any way, the
surface of each crystalline grain becomes marked by one or more
                • ' Journal of the Iron and Steel Institute,' 1898.

174            Prof. J. A. Ewing and Mr. W. Eosenhain.
systems of lines running in a generally straight and parallel fashion
0ver it.    The direction of the parallel lines changes from grain to
grain.    Thus these lines serve to mark out one grain from another in
a metal   which, although polished before straining, has not been etched
to develop the boundaries.     As straining proceeds, the lines become
more and more numerous and emphatic, and two, three, or four
systems appear on each grain.
    The nature of these lines has been described in the authors' paper of
March 16. They are slips along cleavage or gliding planes in the
crystals.    The effect of each slip is to develop a step on the polished
face. The short inclined surface forming this step looks black under
vertical illumination, but shines out brightly when oblique light of
a suitable incidence is used.   These  slip bands, as  they were named in
the previous    paper, are thus seen as narrow dark or bright bands,
accordingly to the nature of the lighting.
    The authors have developed slip-bands in iron, copper, gold, silver,
platinum, lead, tin, bismuth, cadmium, aluminium, nickel, as well as
steel, brass, gun-metal, and various other alloys.    So far as the observa
tions go, they occur in all metals.
    The slip-bands are in themselves an evidence of crystalline structure,
and, further, they show how such a structure is consistent with plas
ticity, and how it persists after plastic strain has occurred.          The
 " How " or non-elastic strain of a metal occurs through numerous finite
slips taking place on the cleavage or gliding surfaces in each of the
crystalline grains of which the metal is an aggregate.      The elementary
pieces which slip on one another retain their primitive crystalline
character.
    Further, if the movement of the pieces with respect to each other
in any one grain is a movement of translation only, their orientation
should remain uniform in each grain.
    That this is actually the case is demonstrated by examining speci
 mens of metal which had been violently deformed without any subse
 quent annealing or heating. In metal that has been rolled or hammered
in the cold state, or deformed by tension or compression or strain of
any kind, however severely, the grains are still seen where a surface is
polished and etched.     Their form is much changed by the strain which
 the piece has undergone.      But the fact that they have retained their
.crystalline structure is demonstrated when, after polishing, the piece
 is subjected to a slight additional strain of any kind, for the effect of
 this additional strain is to develop slips of the same general character
 as before.    Further evidence to the same effect is given by the fact
 that etching the polished surface of a very severely strained piece
 develops geometrical pits, which are similar and similarly oriented
 over the face of each grain, notwithstanding the great distortion which
 the grain has suffered as a whole.      The effects of oblique lighting in

 metal which is polished and etched after severe straining are referred
 to as illustrating the same point.    The persistence of crystalline struc
ture is demonstrated by micro-photographs of the section of a bar of
 Swedish iron which had been rolled cold from a diameter of         f  inch to
a diameter of £ inch without subsequent heating.        The outline of the
grains is much distorted, but the orientation of the crystalline ele
ments remains constant within each individual grain.
    The slips in metals which exhibit a cubical crystalline structure on
etching are in some instances parallel to the faces of the cubes, and are
very frequently inclined to the faces, apparently along the octahedral
planes.     Stepped lines are frequently seen, and also lines which appear
curved probably in consequence of numerous steps which are unre
solved even under the highest powers.         In exceedingly plastic metals-
such as lead, copper, and gold, the lines are particularly straight.          A
piece of lead cast against glass     to  produce   a smooth    surface gives,
 when slightly strained, a splendid display of slip-bands, and the
boundaries of the grains are sharply defined by the meeting of the
lines on one grain with those on its neighbours.       Another way to get
a clear lead surface for the purpose of showing slip-bands is to press a
freshly cut piece of the metal with considerable force against a smooth
object.    Photographs of slip-bands in iron, gold, silver, lead, copper,
 and other metals are given in the paper.
    -When a metal is fractured the grains do not as a rule part company
at their boundaries, but split along cleavage surfaces.     It is to this that
the crystalline appearance, obvious in many fractures, is due.
    In several metals the authors find that " twinning " takes place in
the crystalline structure as an effect of strain.      Samples of copper,
which in the original cast state gave no evidence of the existence of
twin crystals, were hammered or otherwise wrought, and were then
found to be full of twins.        The twinning produced in this way sur
vived after the wrought copper had been raised to a red heat and
allowed to cool.     Similar results were obtained in gold and in silver ;
the metal in the cast state did not show twins, but they were found
after the metal had been wrought and subsequently softened by
annealing.     An example of twinning was observed in nickel after the
application of a somewhat severe strain. Twins were readily developed
in cadmium by strain, apparently as a result of the slight strain which
was applied for the purpose of developing slip bands.        They were also
found in lead, zinc, and tin, either as a primitive feature in the crystal
lisation or produced by straining.      The twinning frequently takes the
form of a large number of parallel bands within a single grain, and a
twin band due to strain in one grain is sometimes associated with a.
twin band in neighbouring grains, the bands being continuous except
for a change in orientation in passing from grain to grain.
   Photographs of twin bands in copper, gold, lead, and other metals are

given, showing the twin bands as revealed by a cross-hatching of
 parallel slip lines, the sets of lines being parallel to one another in
.alternate bands of the twin.        The twinning under strain which we
 have observed in various metals is similar to that which is known to
 occur in calcite.      It may be regarded as a result of slip accompanied
 by   a  definite   and   constant amount of rotation on the part of the
 molecules.
    From this point of view there are two modes in which plastic yield
ing occurs in a crystalline aggregate.         One is by simple slips, where
 the movements of the crystalline elements are purely translatory and
 their orientation is consequently preserved unchanged.           The other is
 by twinning, where rotation occurs through an angle which is the same
 for each molecule in the twinned group.        Both modes are often found
 not only in a single specimen of metal but in the same crystalline
grain.
    At   the suggestion of Messrs. Heycock and Neville, the authors'
•examination of the effects of strain has been extended to certain
 eutectic   alloys.     The structure of such alloys has already been
•described   by Osmond, with whose observations these are in agreement.
'The alloy generally exhibits rather large grains, the structure of which
 is very different from that of pure metals, for it consists of an intimate
 intermixture of two constituents, one of which appears as separate or
dendritic crystals on a field formed of the other constituent.       The two
 are seen forming an exceedingly minute and complex structure within
.each of the large     grains of which the alloy is made up. Straining has
 the effect of making this intimate structure more apparent, by causing
.slips which set up differences of level between pieces of one and the
other constituent.
    A study of the micro-structure of alloys suggests a possible explana
 tion of the peculiarities they present in regard to variation of electrical
 conductivity with temperature.         The two constituents may behave
 individually as pure metals in this respect, but if their coefficients of
.expansion are different the closeness of the joints between them will
.depend on the temperature.        Thus if the more expansible metal exists
.as plates, or separate pieces of any form within the other, the effect of
 heating will be to make the joints between the two conduct more
 readily, with the result of reducing the increase.of resistance to which
 heating would otherwise give rise, and in extreme cases with the effect
.even of producing a negative          temperature   coefficient.   The high
 resistance of alloys generally may be ascribed to the large number of
joints across which the current has to pass.
    In casting metals against glass and other smooth bodies for the
purpose of getting a surface fit for microscopical examination, a surface
 is occasionally produced which not only shows the true boundaries be
tween the crystalline grains, but also additional markings which simulate

       The Yellow Colouring Matters accompanying Chlorophyll.            177
boundaries in a very curious manner.         These pseudo-boundaries      are
often polygonal in form, like the real boundaries, and have an intimate
geometrical association with them.       Under low powers they are in
some instances difficult to distinguish from true boundaries ; but the
distinction is apparent under high powers, and it becomes obvious as
soon as slip-bands are developed by the straining of the metal.          The
pseudo-boundaries    are found to consist in small variations of level
in the surface of the grains in which they occur. Their form suggests that
they are projections upon the surface of real edges below.        They occur
very conspicuously    in  cadmium,  especially  when  it is  cast  on a cold
surface, and less conspicuously in zinc. It is probable that in the
strain set up by unequal cooling after the metal has solidified, the lower
edges of the crystalline grains project a sort of image of themselves on
the surface by slips, or possibly by narrow bands of twinning.           The
         resembles that  of a            "

inequalities of the surface, corresponding to a pattern behind, cause
light reflected from the mirror to produce an image in which a ghost of
 the pattern may be traced.
    The authors regard their experiments as establishing the conclusion
briefly stated in their previous paper, to the effect that the plasticity of
metals is due to the sliding over one another of the crystalline elements
 composing each grain, without change in their orientation within each
 grain, except in so far as such change may occur through twinning.

          Yellow Colouring Matters accompanying Chlorophyll, and
        their Spectroscopic Relations."       By C. A. SCHUNCK.        Com
        municated by EDWARD SCHUNCK, F.R.S. Received April 20,

                                  [PLATE 6.]
     The yellow colouring matters dealt with are those accompanying
 chlorophyll in healthy green leaves and which are extracted along with
 it by means of boiling alcohol.
     This group of yellow colouring matters is generally known by the
  name xanthophyll, a term first used by Berzelius, who was the first
  observer to express the belief that a yellow colouring matter pre-exists
 along with the green co'ouring matter in alcoholic extracts of green
 leaves.    The subject has subsequently received the attention of many
 investigators — Fremy, Michels, Millardet, Miiller, Tinisnaseff, Ger-
 land, Raunenhoff, Askcnasy, Stokes, Sorby, Tschirch, Kraus, Filhol,
  Hansen, and Schunck. The principal results arrived at by these
  investigators are as follows : — Filhol noticed that by treating crude
  alcoholic chlorophyll solutions with animal charcoal it is possible to

178         Mr. C. A. Schunck.     The Yellow Colouring Matters
remove   the green constituent of the mixture when a yellow coloured
solution remains, the colour of which he believes is evidently due to a
pre-existing colouring matter or matters associated with the green one.
Kraus — to whom we are indebted for a most elaborate study of the
physical properties of the yellow constituent of crude chlorophyll
solutions   — confirmed   the observations   of   Filhol, and added a number
of new ones which lead, according to him, to an explanation of the
absorption spectrum of crude chlorophyll solutions which has hitherto
teen   universallyaccepted as the correct one.        The author used
amongst      other
                methods,   for  the purpose   of  separating the yellow
colouring matters from the green, their different solubility in alcohol
und benzol or, correctly speaking, benzoline.    An alcoholic solution of
chlorophyll, treated with benzoline, retains, according to him, the yellow
colouring matter or mixture of colouring matters, while the benzoline
takes up the green constituent.      By an investigation of the spectro-
scopic properties of these solutions, compared to the original one,
Kraus arrived at the result that the ordinary chlorophyll spectrum,
which has been described with considerable accuracy already by
Brewster, is a complex one, i.e., that some of the absorption bands are
due to the green constituent and some to the yellow.       The former, he
says, is characterised by six bands, four of which (comprising the well-
known chlorophyll spectrum) are situated between the solar lines B
and E ; the fifth between F and G, and the sixth in front of G. The
yellow constituent shows two bands, one at F or just behind          it,
                                                                       and
the second in front of G.      These observations, according to Kraus,
explain the constitution of the spectrum of crude chlorophyll solutions,
the first four bands of which being due solely to the green constituent,
the fifth to the yellow, and the sixth to a combination of the sixth
band of the green constituent and the second of the yellow. The fifth
band of the green constituent being very faint, and situated between
the fifth and sixth bands of the mixture, does not, according to him,
appear at all. These explanations,      however, as will be shown, are
erroneous.
   Sorby using carbon bisulphide as the separator in place of benzoline
states that along with chlorophyll in the crude alcoholic extracts of
the green leaves of the higher plants there are three accompanying
yellow colouring matters present which he names orange xanthophyll,
xanthophyll, and yellow xanthophyll, each showing         couple of bands
                                                          a
in slightly different positions in the more refrangible visible portion of
the spectrum, but none in the less refrangible part, and also that
there are other yellow colouring matters present, which he groups
under the term lichnoxanthine, which obscure the more refrangible
portion but exhibit no bands.       He also states that chlorophyll (the
green constituent) of the higher plants separable by the same means
                                             is
into two colouring matters which he terms " Blue Chlorophyll
                                                              "
                                                                and

   accompanying Chlorophyll, and their Spectroscopic Relations,        179
" Yellow    Chlorophyll," the former being the chief constituent, the
latter being present in only a small relative quantity, and each give a
series of bands situated throughout the visible portion of the spectrum.
    Hansen's method of isolating the yellow colouring matters is dif
ferent from those of the previous observers.       He treats the alcoholic
extracts of green leaves with caustic alkali, evaporates the liquor to
dryness, and extracts from the residue the yellow colouring matter by
means of ether, the study of which lead him to believe that the yellow
constituent shows only two bands.
    Schunck obtains from all crude alcoholic chlorophyll extracts minute
 sparkling red crystals which are deposited on standing, and to which
he has not applied a name, but which he considers identical with the
erythrophyll of Bougarel and the chrysophyll of Hartsen. On dilution
 the yellow solutions of these crystals gave two absorption bands in the
 more refrangible portion of the spectrum, but none in the less re
 frangible, and, though not in the same positions as the similar bands
(the fifth and sixth) shown by crude chlorophyll solutions, he considers
 these latter bands not due to chlorophyll but to an accompanying
 yellow colouring matter.
    Finally, Tschirch, who used Hansen's method for separating the
 yellow from the green constituent, describes two yellow colouring
 matters, to which he gives the names xantho-carotin, showing three
 bands in the more refrangible part of the spectrum and to which,
 according to him, tho bands in the blue and violet shown by crude
 chlorophyll solutions are due, and xanthophyll proper, which shows no
 bands whatever but only a total obscuration in the violet region.
    It will be seen that the results obtained by the various observers do
 not agree, and a renewed study of the yellow constituent of crude
 chlorophyll solutions appeared to be desirable.   My own results differ in
  many respects from the hitherto generally accepted ones ; they relate not
 only to the physical nature of the yellow colouring matters in question,
  but also enable us to characterise chlorophyll proper in a different
  manner than was possible before.     The preparation of pure chlorophyll
  seems  to baffle all attempts, but so far the physical properties of this
  substance, the knowledge of which would guide an experimenter in
  reaching the goal have, as it proves, not been known with sufficient
 completeness.
     I will now give the results of the experiments I have made, in the
  endeavour to separate these yellow colouring matters from the accom
  panying chlorophyll, dealing more especially with their spectroscopic
  relations as compared to those of chlorophyll in the violet and ultra
  violet region of the spectrum investigated by aid of photography — a
  means which, with the exception of Tschirch, former observers have
  not applied — and by which means I have been able to ascertain one or
  two new facts, and have, I think, been able to clear up the much

 180      Mr. C. A. Schunck.             The.   Yellow Colouring Matters
 debated point whether the absorption bands in the violet and ultra
 violet region shown by crude chlorophyll solutions are due to chlo
rophyll itself or to the accompanying yellow colouring matters.
    The chlorophyll solutions experimented upon were obtained in the
 usual manner by extracting the colouring matter from the leaves with
 boiling alcohol.      I have already shown* that chlorophyll solutions pre
 pared in this way show three characteristic absorption bands on proper
 dilution, in the violet region of the spectrum, giving in the less
 refrangible region the well-known spectrum of four bands which in
 very pure solutions may be said to be reduced to three, so faint does
 the fourth band appear.
    If the extracts are concentrated enough one finds invariably on
 standing for a day or so minute sparkling red crystals deposited on
 the sides of the containing vessel or along with the fatty deposit,
 coloured green by chlorophyll, which generally comes out of the extracts
 on standing.        These crystals are found in variable quantities, but
 more often than not in a minute quantity.
    This is the first yellow colouring matter one comes across and is the
erythrophyll of Bougarel, and the chrysophyll of Hartsen and
Schunck. t That chrysophyll is always to be found in chlorophyll
solutions proves that either it pre-exists as such along with chloro
phyll in its alcoholic extracts, or that it is formed spontaneously
from one of the colouring matters, and is not, according to Hansen,J
formed under certain conditions only by the decomposition of a deri
vative. Chrysophyll thus obtained is not a very stable substance, and
in order to preserve it unchanged it should be placed in a glass tube
through which a current of hydrogen has been passed before sealing,
and kept in the dark.           Its alcoholic solutions are bleached rapidly
when exposed to the air and sunlight, and even when kept in the
dark a change very soon takes place in its solutions as shown by its
spectrum, though there is no apparent change in colour.                     According
to Arnaud§ it is identical with carotin. Chrysophyll gives no absorp
tion bands in the red, yellow, or green, but three very distinctive
bands in the violet region of the spectrum which, as I have shown,||
are almost identical in position with those of carotin.               They (Plate 6^
fig 5) occupy       intermediate     positions compared       to   the   three bands
shown by crude chlorophyll solutions in the same region, being shifted
more towards the red end of the spectrum.
   The method I have applied for separating the other accompanying
yellow colouring matters from the chlorophyll is that of treating the

crade alcoholic    extracts with an excess of animal charcoal in the cold
for about an hour, which removes all the chlorophyll and leaves a
yellow solution, which gives no absorption bands in the red, yellow, or
green, but four distinctive bands situated in the violet and ultra-violet
region of the spectrum.        The prolonged action of animal charcoal has
the effect of ultimately absorbing all the colouring matters, leaving the
solution colourless.      By this means the yellow colouring matters can
be obtained free from chlorophyll, but I have not been able to recover
the latter from the animal charcoal.             This was tried by boiling the
charcoal   with  ether, the result being a greenish-yellow solution, giving
the four bands in the violet as before, but, in addition, a faint band in
the red, showing that it consisted of a portion of the yellow colouring
matters which had been absorbed by the charcoal together with a trace
of chlorophyll which caused the greenish colour, and the faint band in
the red region of the spectrum.
    Yellow solutions obtained in this way from some chlorophyll
extracts  — which,   when freshly prepared, show signs of decomposition,
viz., the fourth band in the visible region of the spectrum darker
and the third fainter — show only the first two or three bands in the
violet region, the rest of the violet and ultra-violet being obscured.
In such cases a separation can be effected by ether, the yellow colouring
matter causing the obscuration remaining in the alcoholic portion, the
yellow ethereal portion now showing the four-banded spectrum as
before.    This colouring matter causing obscuration no doubt belongs
to the lichnoxanthine group of Sorby,* and corresponds to the so-
 called xanthophyll of Tschirch.t            These yellow solutions deposit on
spontaneous evaporation         an amorphous substance impregnated with
much fatty matter, which so far I have failed to remove and have been
unable to get in a crystalline form. It is insoluble in water, but easily
soluble in alcohol and ether, giving as before the distinctive spectrum
of four absorption bands in the violet and ultra-violet, but no bands in
the red, yellow, or green ; these bands, with the exception of the first,
 which is almost if not quite identical in position with the first band
 shown by crude chlorophyll solutions in the violet region, are in distinctly
 different positions_to the two remaining chlorophyll bands, or the three
 due to chrysophyll (figs. 1 to 5).        It appears to be much more stable
 than chlorophyll, resisting the action of light and air to a greater
 extent ; even from crude chlorophyll solutions which have been kept
for some time and show distinctly from their spectra the formation of
phyllocyanin, it can be obtained unaltered by the action of animal
charcoal.     The solutions, when exposed to sunlight, gradually become
colourless, but at a less rapid rate than those of chrysophyll, and appa
 rently without the formation of products of decomposition, as is the

case  with chlorophyll ; while away from the light it can be kept for a
considerable time without any apparent change taking place in its solu
tions.   Alkalis which induce so great a change in chlorophyll appear
to have no action upon it. From chlorophyll solutions which have
been boiled with potash or soda, and from which animal charcoal will
not now absorb any appreciable amount of colouring matter, ether
takes up this yellow colouring matter unaltered.         Likewise, if its
alcoholic solutions be boiled with an alkali, no alteration is discernible.
On the other hand, if hydrochloric acid gas be passed through its
alcoholic solutions the colour changes to a dull dark-red, giving no
bands, but a general obscuration in the violet and ultra-violet region
of the spectrum.    By this method I have obtained this yellow colouring
matter from two species of Fiats, from parsnip, clover, birch, and
Virginia creeper leaves, the extracts         of     the last-named,   when even
freshly prepared, showing a near approach to the phyllocyanin spec
trum. I have also examined the yellow colouring matter of autumnal
leaves, and find that it is identical with it both in properties and
spectrum (Plate 6, figs. 3 and 4) ; but in autumnal leaves invariably I
find the presence of the other yellow colouring matter which obscures
the spectrum, but which can be got rid of by separating with ether.
This supports the belief that the yellow colouring matter of autumnal
leaves is what remains after the chlorophyll of the healthy green leaf
has faded away, the latter being the less stable of the two (as has already
been shown to be the case), and fading first. I have examined the
colouring matter of some etiolated leaves, and here the presence of a
yellow colouring matter that obscures the spectrum in the violet and
ultra-violet region is undoubted.   I endeavoured to get rid of as in    it,
the former experiments, by separating with ether, but seemingly with
only partial success, the ethereal portion showing only three bands, but
in the same positions as the first three bands of the yellow colouring
matter under review, the rest of the spectrum in the violet and ultra
violet being obscured.

xanthophyll and yellow xanthophyll of Sorby,* whilst probably my
xanthophyll corresponds to his orange xanthophyll.

spar prism being used.      The question whether the bands shown by
crude chlorophyll solutions in the violet region are due to chlorophyll
itself, or to an accompanying yellow colouring matter, has not so far
been answered  in satisfactory manner. Some observers consider them
                     a
due to the former, whilst others, the -majority believe, attribute them
                                                                  I

chrysophyll    bands   are shifted  towards    the red end   of the spectrum
compared to those of crude chlorophyll, so that             chrysophyll pre  if
exists along with chlorophyll in its alcoholic extracts, the bands of the
two spectra would overlap, so as to produce one broad band extending
from F   to K/s but in all the freshly prepared normal crude chlorophyll

racteristic of allowing considerably moro of the ultra-violet rays to pass
through its solutions.     Comparing now the xanthophyll spectrum with
that given by crude chlorophyll solutions, it will at once be seen that
the character of the two spectra are quite different, and this points to
the fact that the bands are due to two distinct colouring matters.
This is supported by the fact that from crude alcoholic chlorophyll
solutions that have been acted upon with alkali, the xanthophyll can
be recovered unaltered by shaking up with ether, the chlorophyll being
so altered (though the colour of the solutions is unchanged) that animal
charcoal will not now absorb the green colouring matter ; this altera
tion has been shown by Schunck* to be due to the formation of an
alkali compound of alkachlorophyll.          Again, in crude chlorophyll solu
tions which have been kept a little time, and which show signs of
decomposition, owing to the formation of phylloxanthin and phyllo-
cyanin, the bands in the violet are no longer discernible on proper
dilution, yet act upon such solutions with animal charcoal, and we
get a yellow solution giving the four-banded xanthophyll spectrum,
showing that the xanthophyll was there all the time unaltered, but did
not affect the spectrum.     From the spectra of their alcoholic solutions
it will be observed the only xanthophyll band that could affect the
crude chlorophyll spectrum is the first, for it is the only one in a
similar position ; but I think I can show that this cannot be the case,
and that it is in no way connected with chlorophyll. If a crude chloro
phyll solution be examined in ether compared to alcohol, it will be
found that in the former solvent, the bands are all shifted towards the
more refrangible end of the spectrum, while the xanthophyll bands in
both solvents are in identical positions (Plate 6, figs. 6 to 11), so that
we see now the first xanthophyll band no longer coincides with the first
band    of crude   chlorophyll, and therefore can not have any influence
upon the chlorophyll spectrum.         And thus I came to the conclusion,
taking one experiment with another, that as with chrysophyll, xantho
 phyll is present in such a small relative quantity, compared to chlo
 rophyll, that the bands of its spectrum cannot be detected in the crude
 chlorophyll solution, and that the bands shown by the latter are due
 to chlorophyll itself, and not to any of the accompanying             yellow
 colouring matters which the majority of former observers believed
 they were due to. This belief may have arisen from the fact that
 without the aid of photography, only the first two bands of chlorophyll
 and the accompanying       yellow colouring matters in the violet region
 arc discernible in alcoholic solutions to the eye, and they thus failed to
 observe the complete spectrum which, from an inspection of the plate,
 will be seen makes in each case a vast difference to the character of the
 spectrum.

the three bands in the violet region, is I think a proof in itself that
they are due to the same colouring matter that produces the character
istic and unmistakable spectrum in the less refrangible region, or to a
very intimately connected colouring matter so far unknown.                 Seeing
also that all the chlorophyll derivatives give a characteristic absorption
in the violet and ultra-violet region, it would be strange that
chlorophyll proper should prove the exception, and it is an interesting
fact that its two chief, and intimately connected decomposition               pro
ducts inter se — phyllocyanin and phylloxanthin — should have, as I
have shown,* bands in the violet region in identical positions with
these three chlorophyll bands, the first of them corresponding to a
faint, but distinct one, observable in pure phyllocyanin solutions on
proper dilution, the other two to the two characteristic phylloxanthin
bands in the violet region.
                                       Summary.
    1.  I find in nil crude alcoholic extracts       of healthy green leaves, two
 yellow colouring matters        accompanying      the chlorophyll.   One chryso-
 phyll which deposits out of the extracts on standing in lustrous red
crystals, but more often than not in minute quantities, the other
obtained by treating the extracts with animal charcoal in the cold, the
charcoal taking up the chlorophyll, and leaving a yellow solution
which deposits on spontaneous evaporation an amorphous substance
impregnated with much fatty matter, and to which I have restricted
the name xanthophyll.          Another yellow colouring matter is sometimes
found along      with  xanthophyll which gives no absorption bands, but
 only an obscuration in the violet and ultra-violet region of the
spectrum, and in such cases a separation can be effected by ether.
There is also evidence to show that other yellow colouring matters
may     exist.   Xanthophyll, however, I believe, is the predominating
yellow colouring matter accompanying                chlorophyll in the healthy
green    leaf, and  I also  find  it to be identical    with the principal yellow
colouring matter of the faded autumnal leaves.
   2.  Chrysophyll and xanthophyll each give a characteristic absorp
tion spectrum in the violet and ultra-violet region ; the former consists
of three bands, the latter of four, but in slightly different positions.
Crude chlorophyll solutions also give, in addition to the characteristic
spectrum of four bands in the less refrangible region ; three characteristic
bands in the violet, and from observations by means of photography
I come to the conclusion that these bands are due to chlorophyll
itself, and not to any of the accompanying yellow colouring matters
which the majority of former observers believed they were due to. I
also find that phyllocyanin and phylloxanthin have bands in identical
 positions with these three chlorophyll bands.

" On
            the Chomical Classification of the Stars."              By Sir NORMAN
         LOCKYER, K.C.B., F.R.S. Received April 27,— Read May 4,
         1899.
                                           [PLATE 7.]
     In the attempts made to classify the stars by means of their spectra,
 from Rutherford's time to quite recently, the various criteria selected
 were necessarily for the most part of unknown origin ; with the excep
 tion of hydrogen, calcium, iron, and carbon, in the main chemical
origins could not be assigned with certainty to the spectral lines.
Hence the various groups defined by the behaviour of unknown lines
were referred to by numbers, and as the views of those employed in
the work of classifying differed widely as to the sequence of the
phenomena observed, the numerical sequences vary very considerably                  so
 that any co-ordination becomes difficult and confusing.
     Recent work has thrown such a flood of light on the chemistry of
 the stars that most definite chemical groupings can now be established,
 and the object of the present communication               is to suggest a general
 scheme of classification in which they are employed, in relation to the
 line of cosmical evolution which I have developed in former papers
 communicated to the Society.
      The fact that most of the important lines in the photographic region
 of the stellar spectra have now been traced to their origins renders
 this step desirable, although many of the chemical elements still remain
  to be completely investigated from the stellar point of view.
      The scheme is based upon a minute inquiry into the varying inten
 sities, in the different stars, of the lines and flutings of the under
 mentioned         substances   : —

    In a communication to the Societyt I stated the results arrived at
recently with regard to the appearances of the lines of the above sub
stances in stars of different temperatures, and the definition of the
different groups or genera to be subsequently given are based upon
the map which accompanied the paper, together with more minute
inquiries on certain additional points, the examination into which was
suggested as the work went on.
   So far as the inquiry has at present gone, the various most salient
differences to be taken advantage of for grouping purposes are repre
sented in the following stars, the information being derived from the
researches of Professor PickeringJ: and Mr. McClean,§ as well as from
the Kensington series of photographs.

   In order to make quite clear that both an ascending and a descend
ing series must be taken into account, I give herewith (Plate 7) two
photographs        showing the phenomena observed on both sides of the
temperature        curve   in reversing layers of stars of nearly equal mean
temperatures, as determined              by the enhanced lines.              The stars in
question are     : —
                                Sirius (descending),
                                a Cygni (ascending).

                                7 Cygni (ascending).          J
   The main differences to which I wish to draw attention are the very
different intensities of the hydrogen lines in Sirius and a Cygni, and the
difference in the width and intensities of the proto-metallic and metallic
lines in Procyon and 7 Cygni.              These differences, so significant from a
classification point of view, were first indicated in a communication to
the Society in 1887t, and the progress of the work on these lines has
shown how important they are.                I have based the group— or generic —
words upon the following considerations.
   As we now know beyond all question                      that a series of geological
strata from the most ancient           to the most recent brings us in presence
of different     organic forms, of which the most recent are the most com-

                Chi the   Chemical Classification    of the Stars.                    189
plex, it is natural to suppose that the many sharp changes of spectra
observed in a series of stars from the highest temperature to the lowest,
bring us in presence of a series of chemical forms which become more
complex as the temperature is reduced.      Hence we can in the stars
study the actual facts relating to the workings of inorganic evolution
on lines parallel to those which have already been made available in
the case of organic evolution.
  If  then we regard the typical stars as the equivalents of the typical
strata, such as the Cambrian, Silurian, &c., it is convenient that the
form of the words used to define them should be common to both ;
hence I suggest an adjectival form ending in tan. If the typical star is
the brightest in a constellation, I use its Arabic name as root ; if the
typical star is not the brightest, I use the name of the constellation.
   The desideratum referred has to a certain extent determined the
choice of stars where many were available.         I have to express my
great obligations   to Dr.  Murray   for  help generously afforded in the
consideration of some of the questions thus raised.      The table runs as

      We may tako for granted that as time goes on new intermediate
 genera will require to be established ; the proposed classification lends
 itself conveniently to this, as there are no numerical relations to be
 disturbed.
      A still more general chemical classification is the following, it being
 understood that in it only the most predominant chemical features are
 considered, and that there is no sharp line of separation between these
 larger groups.         The peculiar position of calcium and magnesium renders
  this caveat the more necessary.

      The detailed      chemical     facts to be gathered    from    the definitions of
  the several      genera indicate many important differences between the
  order   of appearance of the chemical substances in the atmospheres of the

   In the paper upon this subject, the principles upon which the theory
of interdiffusion of gases depends, are applied to the diffusion of ions
produced by Rontgen rays.           When a gas has been left to itself,
the conductivity gradually disappears.         When no electromotive forces
are acting, the loss of conductivity is due partly to positive and
negative ions coming into contact with each other, and partly to the
effect of the surface of the vessel, which discharges those ions which
come into contact with it.
    In order to illustrate in a simple        way the principles which are
involved, we take the case of a gas contained in a metal sphere, and
consider what happens to the ions after the gas has been removed from
the influence of the rays.     For present purposes we may neglect the
effect of recombination.
    The ions may be considered as constituting a separate gas, the
molecules of which may be either bigger or smaller than the molecules
of the gas in which they are immersed.        When an ion comes into contact
with the surface    of the sphere it loses its charge, so that the metal
may be regarded as a body which completely absorbs the ions.            The
reduction in the conductivity by the diffusion of the ions to the sides,
is   exactly analogous to the removal of moisture from a gas by
bubbling it through sulphuric acid. The more rapidly the water
vapour diffuses through the gas, the greater will be the number of
water molecules which come into contact with the acid round the
bubble.     If the quantity of moisture which is removed be found ex
perimentally, the coefficient of diffusion of water vapour into the gaa
can be deduced.*      It would be impracticable to use this method to
find the coefficient of diffusion of ions into a gas contained in a large
vessel, as the loss of conductivity due to recombination would be large
compared with the loss due to the sides.
    The method which was employed was to pass a uniform stream of
gas through fine metal tubing, and to allow the rays to fall on the gas
immediately before entering the tubing. The bore of the tubing can
be so adjusted that the number of ions which come into contact with
the sides will be large compared with the number which recombinc.
It is convenient to use tubing of such a length, that the conductivity
will be reduced to about one half its initial value.

                     Ttic Diffusion of Ions into      Gases.                  193
   In order to obtain the coefficient of diffusion when the reduction in
the conductivity has been found experimentally, the following problem
presents itself :—
   If a small quantity      of a gas, A, is mixed with another gas, B, and
the mixture passed along a tube, the sides of which completely absorb
A, to find what quantity of A emerges from the tube with B.
   It will  be immediately seen that if the gases diffuse rapidly into
each other, a large proportion of the molecules of the gas A will come
into contact with the surface of the tube and will there be absorbed.
If  on  the other hand        the   rate of interdiffusion   is very small,    the
molecules of   A will travel     d9wn     the tube in straight lines parallel to
the axis of the tube, and practically none of them will come into con
tact with the surface.
   The complete solution of the above problem           may be obtained from
the following equations : —

u, v, and w the velocities of the ions ; W the velocity of the gas B
through the tube ; K the coefficient of diffusion of the ions into the gas B.
   The partial differential coefficient with respect to the time, is omitted
from the equation of continuity, as we need only consider the steady
state.
   The term dp/ih may be omitted from the third equation,          as  it is small
compared with the other terms.

defined by the condition mt-Vt = total volume of gas crossing any section
in a time (, a the radius of the tube, and r the perpendicular distance
of any point from the axis.
   The forces X, Y, Z vanish since the electrification is too small to con
tribute appreciably to the motion of the ions.
   The boundary conditions are :—
                             p  = 0 when    r = a,
                             p  = constant when z = 0.

    The solution of the problem requires a somewhat lengthy analysis,
 so that we give here only the final result.
    The ratio of the number of ions (or molecules of the gas A)
 coming out of the tube with B to the number which enter is

   Let N be the number of molecules in a cubic centimetre of a gas at
pressure P, equal to the atmospheric pressure, and temperature                  15°
centigrade, the temperature at which u and k were determined.
   The quotient N/P may be substituted for njp in the above equa
tion, and since the atmospheric pressure P is 10° in C.G.S. units, we
obtain
                                        3 x 10%,
                                             K
   The following values of Ne thus obtained for different            gases are
                Air                            NeA = 1-35 x     1010
                Oxygen                         N<?0 = 1'25 x   1010
                Carbonic acid                  Nec = 1'30 x    1010
                Hydrogen                       NeH =   100 x   1010
   The values of u were taken from the table of mean velocities given
by Professor Rutherford.*         The values of k which were used, are the
mean values obtained for dry gases.
   Experiments on electrolysis show that one electrodynamic unit of
electricity in passing through an electrolyte, gives off T23 c.c. of
hydrogen at temperatures 15° and pressure 10° C.G.S. units.                    The
number of atoms in this volume is 2-46 N, so that if E is the charge
on an atom of hydrogen in the liquid electrolyte,
               2-46NE    =  1 electrodynamic unit of quantity
                          = 3 x 1010 electrostatic    units.
Hence                         NE    = 1-22 x 1010,
the charge  E being expressed in electrostatic units.
   Since  N is a constant, we conclude that the charges on the ions pro
duced by Rontgen rays in air, oxygen, carbonic acid, and hydrogen,
are all the same, and equal to the charge on the hydrogen ion in a
liquid electrolyte.
   Professor Thomsont has shown that the charge on the ions in
hydrogen and oxygen which have been made conductors by Rontgen
rays, is 6 x 10~10 electrostatic unit, and is the same for both gases.
   Taking this value for the charge e, wc obtain the number of mole
cules in a cubic centimetre of a gas
                                 N    = 2 x 1019.
   From this we deduce the weight of a molecule of hydrogen, p/N,
                               4-5 x 10~-4 gram.

    Since,   cos wo have shown, the charge on an ion produced by Rontgen
 rays   is equal to the charge on a hydrogen ion in a liquid electrolyte,
 this latter charge is also 6 x 10~10 electrostatic unit.
    Although the value of Ne for hydrogen is 25 per cent, less than its
 value for other gases, we are justified in including hydrogen in the
 above general conclusion, as we should expect the value of u for hydro
 gen to be too small.            Professor Rutherford makes no mention of
 having corrected for the presence of air in his apparatus, or of having
 used perfectly dry hydrogen. If we take the mean value of K for
 moist hydrogen, we obtain N«H = 1'15 x 1010.
    In order to prove that the charge on the positive ion is equal to the
 charge on the negative ion, the ratio of the coefficients of diffusion
 must be shown to be equal to the ratio of the velocities.                 Professor
 Zeleny* has shown that the negative ions travel faster under an elec
 tromotive force than the positive ions, the ratios of the velocities being
 1-24 for air and oxygen, 1'15 for hydrogen, and l-0 for carbonic acid.
    The experiments on diffusion show that the ratio of the velocities
 would be larger in dry than in moist gases ; but as this point has not
yet been examined by Professor Zeleny, we cannot expect a very close
agreement between the ratios which he gives for the velocities and the
ratios of the coefficients of diffusion.
    We are led to conclude that the charges on the positive and nega
tive ions are equal from another point of view.                  It has been proved
that the mean charge is the same as the charge on an ion of hydrogen
in a liquid electrolyte.        If the charges differed, one of them would be
less than the charge on the hydrogen ion, whereas experiments on
electrolysis show that all ionic charges are either equal to the charge
on the hydrogen ion or an exact multiple of it.

    In   a paper read     before   the Society on April 8, 1897, and in a sub
sequent paper,t Mr. Frank McClcan draws attention to the group
ing of lines other than those of helium and hydrogen in the spectra
of   (3  Scorpii, ft Canis Majoris,      /3 Centauri and ft Crucis, suggesting
that the      close  correspondence     between      the grouping of these extra
lines and the known lines of oxygen, points to the probable presence
of that gas in the atmospheres of these stars.

    In the latter paper    he writes,  " The most remarkable
                                                                  correspondence
 is in the case of the large group on either side of Hs.                 A slight
 shift of about a tenth-metre is required to bring the groups into identi
 cal positions.    However, the close similarity of the whole grouping of
 the two spectra as they appear on the plate, admits of little doubt that
 the extra lines actually constitute the spectrum of oxygen.            If this be
 established, the spectrum of the first division of helium stars would
 be due to hydrogen, helium, and oxygen."
    In his subsequent work* Mr. McClean concludes, " Taking everything
into account, the succession of coincidences between the extra lines of
/3 Crucifl and the oxygen spectrum          can only be accounted for on the
basis of the extra lines being in the main actually due to oxygen."
   This conclusion does not, as yet, appear to have been fully accepted
by spectroscopists, partly because, from the low dispersion used, the
lines of the groups are not separately shown.              It is very generally
known that the instrumental equipment of the Royal Observatory
at the Cape, has recently been enriched by a complete equipment
for Astrophysical research, the whole being the munificent gift of Mr.
 McClean, F.R.S.
    The slit-spectroscope, for attachment to the photographic refractor,
reached the Cape in the middle of January last, and I resolved that
its first published work should deal with Mr. McClean's interesting
discovery.
   As a complete account of the instrument and its observatory will be
subsequently published, it may be sufficient for the present to state
that the object glass of the photographic telescope has an aperture of
24 inches and focal length of 22 feet 6 inches, its minimum focus
being, at present, for rays about midway between H/j and Hy.
    The collimator of the spectroscope has an aperture of 2J inches and
focal length of 22£ inches, so that a cylinder of parallel rays 2 inches
in diameter falls on the prisms, and the latter are of sufficient size to
pass the whole of the rays which form the image of the spectrum on
the sensitive plate.       The instrument is provided with two camera-
telescopes of 2£ inches aperture, one being of about             36  inches  focal
length, the other of 16 inches.
   Only the larger of the two camera-telescopes have been employed in
the after-mentioned      observations.
   There are two cast-iron prism boxes ; one of them contains three prisms
of about 60° each, which for rays near Hy produces a deviation of 180',
so that the camera-telescope becomes parallel in the reverse direction
to the slit-telescope.     The other prism box contains a single prism of
62°. The prisms in both boxes are fixed, without screw adjustment,
in minimum deviation for 1 1>. The collimator is in the axis of a solid
drawn steel cylinder — the latter attaching by a flange at one end to

the butt end of the telescope, a cast-iron plate attaching to the flange
on the other end of the cylinder carries either one or other of the
 two prism boxes.
    The slit-slide iind 60° prism for reflecting the comparison spark on
 the slit (made on the plan of the Lick spectroscope) are contained in
 a strong cast-steel box which is permanently attached to one end of
 the collimator tube.      This latter is a very strong solid drawn steel
 tube, the external surface of which has been turned and finished to a
 true cylindrical form, and it rests in proper geometrical bearings
 formed in strong cast-iron diaphragms, which are fitted inside the
 cylindrical body of the instrument.
    A powerful slow motion permits the collimator to be slid along its
 axis so as to focus the slit upon the image of the star at any required
 reading of the focussing scale.      The object-glass of the collimator is
 mounted on the end         of another steel cylinder which also rests on
 geometrical    bearings  inside  the outer collimator tube, and it is also
provided with fine slow motion and a focussing scale. Both these
scales are illuminated at will by small incandescent lamps, and are
read by microscopes which are accessible from the outside.
   The whole instrument can be enveloped in felt to prevent any but
 very slow change of temperature.
   The comparison-spark apparatus is arranged with wide angle object-
glasses, in such a way that if the image of the spark shines on the slit
the object-glass of the collimator must be full of light.        Numerous
trials in all positions of the instrument have invarably given photo
graphs of the lines of the comparison        spectrum of iron rigorously
coincident with the corresponding lines of the solar spectrum, the
latter being obtained by exposing the slit in diffuse daylight.

attached to either telescope by a flange with bayonet joint.             The
focussing   scale  is divided  to  1/10 mm., and  the amount  of tilt of  the
plate-holder is measured on a graduated arc.
   As the large telescope is fitted with an object-glass prism of 24 inches
aperture (which, when the slit spectroscope is in use, is folded back in
the manner shown in the frontispiece of Mr. McClean's ' Spectra of
Southern Stars  '), heavy counterpoises are required to balance the tube
about the declination axis if    the spectroscope
                                                is   not attached.
   In designing the  slit spectroscope
                                    I     was  thus not limited by the neces
sity for lightness in its construction.     The complete instrument weighs
400 Ibs., being almost exactly the equivalent of the counterpoises and
focussing slide and camera, which are removed for its adaptation.         In
every detail the fittings of the spectroscope are designed with the
necessary geometrical limitations of freedom and no more, so that no
shake nor variation of adjustment can arise from imperfection of work
manship ;   that
               is  to say, all the adjustments depend on adequate spring

                 in  the Atmospheres      of certain Fica! Stars.                   199
 pressure    against   the  minimum      number    of  necessary    rigid points of

    The object-glasses of the spectroscope were made by Brashier, and
are all excellent.     The three dense prisms were also made by Brashier ;
their definition is very fine, but the glass is rather yellow in colour, and
produces great absorption of rays more refrangible than Hr.                        The
single prism, by Steinheil, gives excellent definition, and the glass is
much whiter than in Brashier's prisms.             The optical constants of the
prisms have not yet been determined.
    The mounting was constructed by the Cambridge Scientific Instru
ment Company to my designs, in the most careful and satisfactory
way.      I am greatly indebted to Mr. Horace Darwin for much care in
supervision of the work and for some very ingenious and important
improvements in detail which he carried out.
    Above all I am indebted to Mr. H. F. Newall, who has taken infi
nite trouble in making and testing the permanent adjustments of the
instrument and in supervising the arrangement of its final details.                  To
him I owe the fact that the instrument arrived at the Cape practically
in perfect adjustment and ready for work. After a series of prelimi
nary focussing trials by Newall's method,* a number of photographs of
star spectra were made with the three-prism box and long telescope.
The present paper deals chiefly with the results of measures of a
photograph of the spectrum of ft Crucis and of a comparison iron spec
trum obtained on March 15. The plate was exposed to the comparison
spectrum of iron immediately before and immediately after the expo
sure for the star spectrum.        (See Plate 8.)
    Lines of the iron spectrum cover the whole exposed length of the
plate from Fe A 4187-99 to 4563-99, the linear interval on the plate
between these lines being 70-367 mm.
    As a preliminary step, the intervals between successive pairs of iron
lines were measured with the micrometer of the old Eepsold astro-
photographic     measuring apparatus.t         If

of A™, and plotting these on millimetre paper with AA/As as ordinate
and Am as abscissa, that within the limits of error of plotting and
observation the resulting curve was practically a straight line : in other
words, the screw values can be represented by

regarded as sufficiently rigorous, four selected iron lines were measured
in terms of the millimetre scale which is attached to the instrument,

table with the argument — — -- — -'
    In this way the wave-lengths of the lines in the spectrum of ft Cracis,
given in the following table (pp. 203 — 204), have been determined : —
    Column (1) gives the wave-lengths           of all the known oxygen lines of
intensity 3 or brighter, between X 4303 and 4575, according to
Neovius as well as Trowbridge and Hutchins.*
    Column (2) gives the wave-lengths of all helium lines according to
Runge and Paschenj contained within limits of the spectrum under
observation.
    Column (3) gives the results of my measurements of the negative
 of the spectrum of ft Crucis, those under head I being my first essays
   n the measurement          of any photographed          spectrum, those under
 head   II  being the results of my second measurement, including all the
 lines which could be detected under most careful and repeated scrutiny.
 Each result in series I depends on two pointings, each in series               II on
 four pointings.
     The lines whose wave-lengths are given to two decimal places of the
  tenth-metre, were measured with a magnifying power of fifteen diameters,
  those give to one decimal place with a power of only three diameters
 —the lines of the latter class being very faint and only certainly
 visible under a very low power.             When possible, different iron lines
 were used in series I and II for determination of the wave-lengths of
 the stellar lines.
     The observations were not arranged for determination of motion in
 the line of sight, but the exact coincidence of the star line 4417-06
 with the air (oxygen) line, and the general agreement of the stellar
 hydrogen and helium lines with their known wave-lengths, tend to
 show that the relative motion of ft Crucis to the Earth on February 21
 did not exceed ± 3 kilometres per second. On that date the Earth in
 its motion round the Sun was moving towards /3 Crucis with a velocity
 of 18 kilometres per second, and consequently ft Crucis is probably
 receding from the Sun with a velocity of 18 kilometres ± 3 kilometres
per second.
     The whole of the known helium lines within the measured range of
 spectrum      are unquestionably present, as also are all known oxygen
 lines stronger than intensity 4.
     The exceedingly faint lines : —

                ITO the Atmospheres     of certain Fixed Stars.          205
but these coincidences are very doubtful, and it is improbable that
such very faint lines would be represented, whilst the neighbouring
line 4327-3, intensity 3, is wanting on the photograph.
    The oxygen lines of intensity 4 which are wanting, viz. :— Neovius
4465'4 and 4467-8 are in a portion of the spectrum which is some
what over exposed, and this fact probably accounts for the non-appear
ance on the plate.      Possibly also the relative intensities of the oxygen
lines at the temperature and pressure of the atmosphere of ft Crucis may
be different from their relative intensities in the conditions under which
Neovius determined the intensities of the air lines (spark spectrum).
    There remains however not the slightest doubt, that all the stronger
 oxygen lines are present in the spectrum of ft Crucis, at least between
 A 4250 and 4575, and this fact requires no further laboratory experi
 ments for its establishment.      It is almost equally certain that there is
 no trace of true nitrogen lines in this spectrum.
    The only measured lines of ft Crucis near known nitrogen lines
 are  : —
           Neovius 4341-8         Intensity  16     ft Crucis 4342-6
              „       4523-0           „     16          „    4522-84
 but it is improbable, although not impossible, that nitrogen lines of
 intensity (1) should be present whilst the strong nitrogen line 4507 -7,
 of intensity 6, is absent.
    Besides hydrogen, helium and oxygen, the spectrum of ft Crucis
 shows the probable        presence of carbon (4267'2)        and magnesiim
 (4481-17).    These lines were not included in the first measurement, in
 the former case because the line could not be distinctly seen with the
 higher power, in the latter because I was doubtful of the existence of
 the line on account of a slight defect in the film at that point, but
 other negatives confirm its existence.         A contact positive from the
 original negative of the spectrum is sent herewith for reproduction.
     The spectra of ft Crucis, ft and « Canis Majoris, and probably
 ft Centauri are all practically identical.        They all contain the three
 unknown strong lines

  besides the probable magnesium line 4481-17, the lines of hydrogen,
  helium, the stronger oxygen lines, and the probable carbon line 4267'2.
     Farther investigations on this class of stars will be subsequently
  communicated    ;  in the meanwhile I forward also for reproduction a
  contact positive from a negative of the spectrum of « Canis Majoris

   On March 15 the Earth by its motion round the Sun was receding
from e Canis Minoris, with a velocity of 17 kilometres per second,
which agrees with the direction of the displacement of the oxygen
lines.   There has not yet been time to determine the constants of the
single-prism spectroscope, but this does not affect the question of the
identification of the oxygen lines in the spectrum of t Canis Majoris.

    The object of the present preliminary series of experiments was to
determine whether the excitability (or, as I should prefer to say in this
connection, the mobility) of living matter can be gauged by the rate of
impact of a mobilising stimulus ; in other words, whether, for various
kinds of more or less mobile protoplasm, an optimum stimulation-
gradient can be found, above and below which the curve of stimulation
is less perfectly adapted to the movement caused by stimulation.             In,
e.g., the case of the   rolling of a ship, there is an optimum wave-length
                                                                      "
and wave-face outside the limits of whiclj the " mobilisation           is less
than maximal.      And just as the optimum wave-length giving greatest
movement by least energy harmonises with and gives therefore mea
sure of the oscillation-period       of a particular ship, so the optimum
gradient    of  mobilising energy    producing    greatest excitation by least
 energy, might be expected to give measure of the excitation-period
 proper to a particular tissue, awl to charncterw that tissue.
    The best instrument at our disposal for an examination of this point
is obviously a condenser, of varied capacity, charged at varied pres
 sure.     This method of excitation has been put into effect by several
                                                                          "

tractions upon human nerve, and came to the conclusion that the
greater and smaller effects of condenser discharges are governed by the
greater and smaller quantities of electricity in play. Hoorweg (11, 12),
Cybulsky and Zanietowsky (9, 10) studied the effects more closely
upon frog's nerve ; the first-named observer concluded that the effects
are a function of intensity ; while the last two observers, from very
similar observations, concluded that the magnitude of excitation is a
function of energy. Salomonsen (8), Boudet (2), and D'Arsonval (6, 7)

 but the energy (Joule or 10r ergs) of that quantity at that pressure.
 A nerve (or other excitable tissue) may be struck and stimulated by
 an electrical energy of so many ergs.      And we are adequately

                          The Characteristic       of Nerve.                       209
The number of the true minimal stimulus at optimum capacity and
voltage, is what I propose to designate as the characteristic, or other
wise stated — the characteristic is the constant of the curve of the
smallest discharge of energy that can provoke movement, or of the
discharge of energy provoking greatest movement.
   By suitable adjustment of capacity and voltage we may obtain the
discharge of any desired energy — at any desired rate, if we also know
the resistance through which discharge is made.                   From a small con
denser at high voltage, and from a large condenser at low voltage, we
may obtain the discharge (of equal quantities or) of equal energies,
but in the first case rapidly and in the second case slowly. We may
so adjust capacity and voltage, as to deliver constant energy in a
series of curves of varying steepness, and find by experiment the
more or less precise limits of steepness between which the motion or
excitation is greatest.      The number denoting that steepness of energy
discharge by which a nerve is most economically mobilised, signifies
the optimum adaptation of excitation to excitability, and is its charac
teristic. At that number the nerve is excited by the minimum of
energy.      With a stimulus of higher or lower number, more energy is
necessary to produce an equal effect.
   Taking either a series of stimuli of given energy, but of varying
gradients, as in experiments 1 and 9, we are to observe at what gra
dient the maximum effect is produced.               Or as in experiment 2, making
a series of trials with varying amounts of energy fiom varying
capacity and voltage, we are to observe at what minimum energy
discharge the smallest       perceptible     effect is produced, and        thence cal
culate the characteristic.
   And even without actually determining the characteristic by means
of its upper and lower limits, we may often usefully ascertain whether
it is above or below a lowest or highest constant at the end of a series
of experimental data.          Thus in experiment 6, a minimal energy has
not been reached, and we cannot therefore say that the characteristic
has been determined ; we know however, that it is less than 10-4. In
experiment 4 the characteristic, as defined above, has not been actually
11382 and 0-6 since the stimulus has not been truly minimal; but
these values have been those of the constants of suitable stimuli not
far from minimal, and we know therefore that the characteristic has
been nearer to the higher value at high temperature, nearer to the
lower value at low temperature.

0'2, the original energy is 0'002 erg, and the number indicating its rate of discharge
is 174.   If 0'0l mf. and 0'2 v. should ho the optimum capacity and voltage of a
minimal effect by excitation of a given nerve, i.e., a true minimal or optimal
minimal stimulus, then the number       174 is the characteristic of the nerve.

   Strictly speaking, the term minimal stimulus in, e.g., experiment 2,
applies only to the two values 0'00ll3i erg and O002 erg in the two
groups respectively, since in these two cases only is the energy of
the stimulus at its minimum.
   But in accordance with ordinary tests by induction currents, the
term " minimal is applied to stimuli that are certainly not of minimal
                 "
energy, but that produce minimal effects.    And in this loose sense all
the trials of the above groups give minimals, in the first group mini
mals of effective capacity at the several voltages, in the second group
minimals of effective voltage at the several capacities.
   The ambiguity may be provisionally neutralised by making use of
the expression " optimal minimal for the true minimal stimulus qua
                                   "
its energy value, and by avoiding use of the term minimal for stimu
lation by induction shocks, or by condenser discharges of a gradient
above or below the optimum or characteristic gradient.
   The meilwA followed will be most readily understood by considera
tion of the diagram.
   (A) The apparatus for excitation, composed of battery, condenser,
and a Morse key, is connected with the nerve of a nerve-muscle pre
paration by unpolarisable electrodes, the circuit being arranged so that
charge of the condenser is at contact a, and does not traverse the nerve,
while discharge is at contact b, and alone traverses the nerve.     During
excitation the key KI is closed, and the key K2 open.
   (B) The apparatus for measurement of resistance, composed of
battery, Wheatstone bridge, and galvanometer, is connected with the
nerve by opening the key   KI  (and closing the key K.,).

To illustrate   rate of energy discharge and approximate gradients when the
     constant has not less than two digits nor more than three digits. The shaded
     area indicates range within which the nerve characteristic must have fallen.
    The procedure was of three types :— (1) To take a series of com
binations between voltage and capacity, so as to deliver constant energy
at various rates; (2) to take a series of voltages and find for each
voltage the smallest capacity at which contraction was visible ; (3) to
take a series of capacities and find for each capacity the smallest voltage
at which contraction was visible.
    The first plan has the considerable advantage of permitting the use
of a myograph.         It is chiefly serviceable for the purpose of a pre
 liminary orientation, i.e., when it is desired to find quickly the range
at which the characteristic is to be looked for. Having obtained a
 minimal effect with any given voltage and capacity, the next test is to
 be made with half the voltage and four times the capacity, i.e., with
 the same energy as before, but with that energy falling by a curve
 with a constant equal to one-eighth of the constant of the previons case.
 If the effect is manifestly greater, the voltage is again to be halved and
 the capacity quadrupled from the starting point of a new minimal
effect.    If, on the other hand, after the first step in reduction of the

212                             Dr. A. D. Waller.
constant, there is no effect at all, a test is taken in the opposite direc
tion, with double the voltage and one-fourth the capacity, i.e., with
the constant of the original energy curve multiplied by eight.
    The second plan affords a rapid survey of the whole field of stimula
tion. When energy is varied by variation of voltage at any given
capacity, it varies as voltage squared, and the constant of its curve is
augmented directly as the voltage.              The step from maximal to sub
minimal stimulation is comparatively large when we test at a series of
diminishing voltages, and a voltage is soon reached at which no
increase of capacity, however great, can bring out an effective stimulus,
the constant of the energy curve being lowered as capacity is increased.
    The third plan is useful only for closer determination of an optimum
gradient, when the range within which it is to be sought for is approxi
mately known. When energy is varied by variation of capacity at any
given voltage, it varies directly as capacity, but the constant of its
curve diminishes as capacity is increased, i.e., a small increment of
energy is obtained at a reduced gradient, as compared with a large
increment      of energy   at   a raised    gradient obtained         by increase     of
voltage.

   The constant of the optimal minimal stimulus (i.e., the characteristic)
is 130.      The energy falls to    \ of its original value in nearly l010() sec.
   The second portion of this experiment, although less typical than
the first, exhibits a similar character.            The minimal stimulus is higher
and of higher gradient, but further experiments                     will be required
before we may admit this latter change to be other than an accidental
effect.     In other experiments there has been diminution of minimal
stimulus with lower gradient.

    Influence of Temperature.— The characteristic of nerve is very sensitive
to alterations of temperature, being raised by high 'temperature (30°), and
depressed by low temperature (5°). Gotch and Macdonald have shown
that stimulation of nerve by break induction shocks is favoured by heat,
disparaged by cold, and that stimulation by the constant current is
favoured by cold, disparaged by heat (13).t The present experiments
show clearly that short stimuli (energy curve of high number) are
   * In the first group of triah given voltages are taken, and the minimum effec
tive capacities sought for. The characteristic = 279.
   In the second group given capacities are taken, and the minimum effective volt
ages sought for.      The characteristic — 217.
   t  G\ and M. allude        to condenser excitation, but did not employ it correctly.
They supposed that a       " short " minimal    stimulus could be obtained from a con
denser of 0'5 microfarad.

  effective at high temperature, ineffective at low temperature, while long
 stimuli (energy curve of low number) are effective at low temperature,
 ineffective at high temperature.
     These results indicate further a point of probably considerable bio
 logical significance, inasmuch as the characteristic of frog's nerve at
 high temperature is found to approximate to that of mammalian nerve.
 Thus, whereas the characteristic of frog's nerve at room temperature
 (16° to 18°) is represented by a number of three digits, and that of
 human nerve at normal temperature (37°) by a number of five digits,
 the approximate characteristic (i.e., the constant indicating the gradient
 of a   suitable stimulus) of frog's nerve at high temperature (30°) is also
 expressed by a number of five digits.                  These and other data are
 tabulated in the concluding summary.

          Volt.
     The method            of trial was to start with given voltage and find mini
mum effective capacities.
     In the first group of trials the characteristic                                  is    2165   ;    in the second
it   is   613.
   The constants of minimum effective stimuli at various voltages are
higher in the first than in the second group.                                   '
   Short stimuli are relatively more effective in the first group long                                               ;
stimuli in the second group.

                                          Sensificatory Stimuli.
    In the attempt to determine                      a  " characteristic " of various         modes
of sensificatory           stimulation, I encountered the doubt, and, therefore,
difficulty, inherent to all investigations where the experimental
criterion is a subjective one — by appreciation of minimal sensation.
This broad distinction was, however, clearly apparent, that whereas
for series of stimuli of motor nerves the minimum exciting energy
decreased to a minimum from which it rose again (diminishing voltage
and increasing capacity), the energy of sensory stimuli of increasing
duration decreased indefinitely towards a minimum value.                                     Within
the limits to which my experiments extended, decrease of energy was
made up for by increase of its duration.
    Testing on the human subject for minimal felt effect, by looking for
minimum effective capacity at a series of given voltages, I found it
difficult to distinguish between apparently different                                  qualities of
minimal sensation.                In the case of cutaneous nerves, it was generally
impossible      to say whether the smallest                  "something felt" was directly
cutaueous       or directly            subcutaneous,        or indirectly subcutaneous, by

reason of some muscular contraction.         In the case of the eye it was
often difficult to tell whether the smallest
                                                   "                 "
                                                     something felt     were a
slight common sensation or a slight phosphene.
   In the case of the eye this point, however, came out with satisfactory
distinctness, viz., that low in the energy series, i.e., with longer stimuli
by lower voltage at greater capacity, the subject of experiment is
more conscious of a " flash

(common sensation), whereas high in the energy series, viz., with
shorter stimuli by higher voltage at lower capacity, the subject feels
a "stab" (common sensation) more readily than a "flash" (optical
sensation).   This indicates that longer stimuli are better adjusted to
the excitability of the retina, shorter stimuli to the excitability of
common sensory terminal organs.

at various gradients.           To this end I found it convenient to first settle
upon a    minimal      sensation at a given mean voltage, and then to make
two further trials, one at half the voltage and four times the capacity,
the other at double the voltage and one-fourth the capacity.                              Each
group    of three     tests  was  thus    at   the    same    energy,     but  with   the  con
stants of the three discharge curves in the proportion 1, 8, 64.                           The
minimal sensation having been settled with the constant at 8, it could
be inferred from equality or inequality of the effects at higher and

              TJic Parent-rock of    the  Diamond    in South Africa.          223
  " The Parent-rock of
                             the Diamond in South Africa." By Professor
         T. G. BONNEY, D.Sc., LL.D., V.P.R.S.              Received May 1,—
         Read June 1, 1899.
      So much has been written on the occurrence of diamonds in South
  Africa that   a very few words may suffice as preface to this communication.
  References to many papers on the subject are given in ' The Genesis
  and Matrix of the Diamond ' (1897), by the late Professor H. Carvill
  Lewis,* and others have been published since that date.t It may
  suffice to say that the diamond, first discovered in 1867 in gravels
  on the Orange River, was found three years later in certain pecu
  liar deposits, which occur locally in a region where the dominant
  rock is a dark shale, sometimes interbedded with hard grits, or asso
  ciated with igneous rocks allied to basalt.           These deposits occupy
 areas irregularly circular in outline, and bearing a general resemblance
  to volcanic necks. The diamantiferous material, near the surface, is
 soft, yellowish in colour, and obviously much decomposed ; at a greater
  depth it assumes a dull greenish to bluish tint, and becomes harder.
  At the well-known De Beers Mine, near Kimberley, the works in 1898
  had been carried to a depth of about 1,500 feet, and the diamantiferous
  material, for at least the last 100 yards, was not less hard than an
 ordinary limestone.       It has a brecciated aspect, the dark, very minutely
 granular, matrix being composed mainly of serpentine (about four-fifths
 of the whole), and of a carbonate of lime (with some magnesia and a
  little iron).    In this matrix are embedded grains of the following
 minerals : — Olivine, enstatite, smaragdite, chrome-diopside (omphacite
of some authors), a brown mica, garnet (mostly pyrope, but more than
 one variety observed), magnetite, chromite, ilmenite, with several other
minerals much morejsparsely distributed.
      Rock fragments are also present, variable in size, but commonly not
exceeding about an inch in diameter, as well as in quantity.                These,
occasionally, but not generally, are rather abundant.              In some cases
they are chips of the neighbouring black shale,          but  in others   they are
greyish-coloured with somewhat of a porcelain aspect. The latter are
generally sub-angular in form and externally banded or bordered with
u darker tint ; crystalline rocks have also been noticed, though these
appear to be far from common, such as granite, diorite, and varieties of

 eclogite.*       As to the genesis of the diamond, more than one opinion
  has been expressed.           Professor Lewis regarded the matrix as a porphy-
  ritic form of peridotite, once a lava, now serpentinised.t in which the
  diamond      had been formed          by the action of the molten rock on some
  carbonaceous material (probably the Karoo shale).                 Others regarded
 the    matrix     as  a true    breccia, comparing it with the agglomerates in
 volcanic rocks.         But among the latter, some thought that the diamond
 had been produced in situ by the action of steam or hot water in a
 subsequent solfataric stage of the volcano, while others (including
 myself) held that it had been formed, like the garnets, pyroxenes, &c.,
 in some deep-seated holocrystalline mass which had been shattered by
 explosions.    J
     The specimens which            I  am about to describe were obtained at the
 Newlands Mines, West                 Griqualand ; from 40 to 42 miles from-
 Kimberley, almost due N.W. Here the workmen occasionally came
 across well-rounded boulder-like masses of rather coarsely crystal
 line rock, studded with garnets, which are sometimes about a foot
 in diameter.         Specimens of these were found or obtained by Mr. G.
 Trubenbach, the London manager of the Newlands Diamond Mine
 Company, during a visit to the mines in 1897. His interest had
 already been aroused by picking up a specimen, presently to be noticed,
 in which some small diamonds occurred, very closely associated with
 a garnet ; so the boulders were brought back by him to England.                    OK
 careful examination a small diamond was detected on the surface of one
 of these. On breaking the boulder others were revealed.                   The most
 interesting fragment           was   sent by  Mr.  Trubenbach  to  Sir W.   Crookes,
 who showed it to me. Examination with a hand lens convinced me
 that the rock could not be a concretion of the " blue ground," but was
truly holocrystalline and allied to the eclogites.                 Sir W. Crookes
generously waived his own claim to study the specimen, and obtained
for me permission from Mr. Trubenbach to have slices cut from it.                     I
gladly take this opportunity of expressing my gratitude to both gentle
men ; to Sir W. Crookes, for allowing me to carry out this interesting
investigation, and to Mr. Trubenbach for his great liberality in placing at
my disposal a considerable suite of specimens (including other boulders)
from the Newlands mines, and for the trouble which he has taken in
affording me the necessary information.

                            Sitzungsber. u. Abhandl. der Isis (Dresden), 1893 (April),
p. 71, calls attention to the fact that these show signs of attrition and that they
range in size from a few cnbic millimetres upwards, being sometimes lorge boulders.
Among the materials (at Kimberley) he mentions both granite and eclogite.
    t For   the rock itself he proposed the name " kimberlite."
    J  In other words, that the volcano (as occasionally has happened) had ejected
little or no lava or scoria, discharging only steam and hot water, with shattered rock.
This view is held by Ma\ Bauer, in ' Edelsteinkuudc,' p. 225, which, however,         I
had not seen when this paper was written.

              Tlie Parent-rock of     the Diamond     in South Africa.          225
     Prior to the discovery, just mentioned, one or two instances had
 occurred at the De Beers Mine of a diamond apparently enclosed by
 or projecting into a pyrope.         One such, the garnet being the size of a
 rather large pea, is in the collection at Freiberg (Saxony), to which it
  was presented in 1802.*
     The specimen found by Mr. Trubenbach at the Newlands mine, was
  a piece of blue ground, with a pyrope projecting from one angle.
  A small, apparently broken, diamond seems embedded at the top.
  The others (five) are well crystallised, two on one side, three almost in
 contact on the other.          The pyrope (which has a kelyphite rim) seems
 to be indented by two, but to have once included the others, as they
 •are in contact with the unaltered mineral.           We were thus brought so
 far as to associate the diamond with the pyrope ; though this proved
  no more than the presence of garnets in the parent rock of the diamond,
 a,nd thus made the eclogite (already known to occur) highly probable,
 for, as observed by Professor R. Beckt, the specimen itself is blue
 ground. In confirmation of his statement I pulverised a fragment, J
 and find that the powder corresponds with the matrix of the blue
 ground when similarly treated.            The latest discoveries enable me to
 complete the chain of evidence.
                            itn  Bmtldm containing Dianumds.
     The first named, that containing several diamonds, is a fragment
 (perhaps     from a quarter to a third) of a boulder, which probably was
 ellipsoidal in shape, two of the axes being nearly equal and the third dis
 tinctly the longest. We may infer that it was rounded from a roughly
 rectangular block, since the curved surfaces are slightly flatter in the
 middle parts.       The axial lengths in the fragment (prior to removing a
 piece from one end) were approximately 4 in. by 3 in. by 2 in.
 The rock is coarsely granular, apparently composed of two green-
 coloured minerals, one darker than the other (possibly only different
 states of a single mineral), and of rich resin-pink coloured garnets,
 varying in size from a hemp seed to a pea, with slightly irregular
distribution.      The outer surface of the boulder, except for a very small
 " step "  on one side, is smooth, the garnets barely, if at all, projecting.
 The latter are covered with a rather soft, dark skin, sometimes slightly
 thicker than the thumb nail, which often has partly fallen off.              This,
as can be seen on the broken surfaces, becomes less conspicuous              in the
inner part of the boulder, and is sometimes invisible to the unaided eye.

   J  I could not advise Mr. Trubenbach to hare a slice cut from the specimen, as I
feared it might be injured, but he kindly detached a little fragment from the oppo
site end to that named above, which    I have thus examined.

Two small diamonds are exposed on the curved outer surface, one
about half the other about one-fifth of an inch from the edge of the cross
fracture.      On the latter surface, nearly an inch below the last named,
three small diamonds appear to lie in a line touching one another, and
near them are two others,* all four within a space about three-quarters
 of an inch square ; an eighth diamond is about an inch and a half
 away (on the same face) ; a ninth, about one-fifth of an inch from the
 top edge ; and a tenth occurs on the larger cross-fractured surface, but
 near to the edge of the other one.             These diamonds are octahedra in
form, generally with stepped faces          — one, at least, apparently twinned —
perfectly colourless, with brilliant lustre ; the largest being quite 0'15
inch from apex to apex ; the smallest not exceeding O05 inch.                      All
 seem to be embedded in the green part of the rock.                     As the outer
part    of the  boulder   looks  rather  more    decomposed    than  the inner,  I had
 a piece removed from one end, thus enabling me to study the mass to
a depth of more than an inch from the surface, and examined a strip,
about 4 inches long, in a series of five slices.
    The late Professor Lewis has given, in the volume already mentioned,
 so full an account of the minerals which occur in the
                                                                     " blue ground,"
that it will be needless on the present occasion to do more than refer
to his descriptions,t only calling attention to any variations in the
mineral constituents and their association in these eclogites.                  These
constituents are :     —
    1. (a) Garnet (Pyrope). — In the slice these appear a light tawny or
yellowish-red tint, retaining this tint (though much lighter) under the
microscope. J       They are generally clear, with frequent and irregular
cracks, but are occasionally          traversed by wavy bands of minute en
closures of a pale brown filmy mineral, which is rather irregular in
outline, very feebly pleochroic, and gives with crossed nicols fairly bright
polarisation tints. Similar minerals sometimes have formed along the
cracks.      They are probably mica, or possibly chlorite, and indicate
incipient decomposition.           The garnets towards the outside of the
boulder, as already said, are enveloped in a
                                                        " skin," and the
                                                                          microscope
shows that it usually exists inside, though there it is thinner. In the
former case it is generally browner in colour and more distinctly
crystalline, corresponding in cleavage, pleochroism, &c., with a mica of
the biotite group ; in the latter it is greener and more filmy with an
aggregate habit and seems to project into the garnet.               I regard it as due
   *  It is possible that these two form a twin crystal, but I think they arc separate.
A? the point is unimportant, I have not attempted to clear away the matrix.
   t We must also not forget the paper by Professor Maskelyne and Dr. Flight
(' Quart. Journ. Geol. Soc.,' vol. 30, p. 406), in which several of these minerals are
described, analysed, and identified.      In fact the authors ascertained everything
that was possible with the materials then obtainable.
   J Unless it is expressly stated, the use of a 1-inch objective may be assumed.

outer part and green within.                The constituents tend to a parallel
rather than a radial grouping. The garnets occasionally contain
minute branching root-like enclosures grouped in bands.                 Though these
act on polarised light, I regard them as empty cavities, and attribute
this to diffraction.

individuals are sometimes about a quarter of an inch long.                      In thin
slices it is a pale dullish green colour, inclining to olive ; under the
microscope, a pale sea-green, with a trace of pleochroism.                  It has one
strongly     marked      cleavage,   not  however     nearly so close as in ordinary
diallage, and        a second       weaker,   sometimes     approximately at right
angles to it.*       On examining flakes, obtained by crushing, I find the
strong cleavage to be clinopinacoidal and the other probably basal,

to  the  columns   and  cross-joints in some basalts.

and obtain on a clinopinacoid an extinction of 35° with a prism edge.
It is in fact identical with the pyroxene described by Professor Lewis*
as chrome-diopside.         In it (though rare) are small rounded enclosures
of   a greenish mineral aggregate much blackened with opacite.                      I
regard them as alteration products of a ferriferous olivine. This
diopside, at the exterior and along cracks, is often converted into
                                                                             "
a minutely granular to fibrous mineral, which gives a " dusty aspect
to that part of the crystal, when viewed with transmitted light, and
a whitish-green one with reflected          light. This often terminates in a
minutely       acicular  fringe, piercing the original diopside.          Its grains
occasionally are a little larger, showing a cleavage, dull green in colour,
fairly pleochroic, and having the extinction of hornblende.                A process
of secondary change, as in uralite, is no doubt indicated.                  Now and
then a tiny film of brown mica occurs in this part or even in a crack
in the diopside.
    It is this alteration product which gives the mottled aspect men
tioned above as visible to the unaided eye, so this is not indicative of
a third important constituent in the original rock. In one of the
slices the mica just named attains a larger size (about 0'03 inch across),
has a fairly idiomorphic (hexagonal prism) outline, and is not restricted
to the margin of the garnet.            In this case it is generally associated
with calcite,t which it tends to surround, and that in one place encloses
a radiating acicular mineral (1 a zeolite) ; in another the calcite, or some
other carbonate, is mixed with a serpentinous material. Distinct
granules of iron oxide are practically absent from the slices, though
here and there it may be indicated by some opacite.               I have not found
spinel,    or rutile, or zircon,  or pseudobrookite.     In  fact, putting aside the
diamonds, the rock in its unaltered condition was a coarsely holo-
crystalline mixture of chrome-diopside and garnet, with a few small
enclosures of olivine, in other words, it was a variety of eclogite and
of igneous origin.     J

rather oftener and in larger flakes ; perhaps the garnets (here also not
quite regularly distributed) are slightly more numerous.                 The outer

   t From the facts I think it probably of secondary origin. It reminds me some
times of the brown mica produced by contact melamorphism.
   J   I am, of course, aware that eclogite, in the past, has been regarded by some
geologists as a metamorphic rock. Apart from the fact that several rocks oner
assigned to this class are now, with good reason, regarded as igneous, I have had
several opportunities of studying eclogite, and have no doubt as to its origin. Take
away the alkali from a magma with the chemical composition of a diorite, and the
result would be gurnets in place of feUpar, i.e., an eclogite.

of the latter, which is about 0'03 inch in thickness.                Thin sections of
this boulder correspond almost exactly with those from the other, the
garnets showing precisely the same tints, though traces of a cleavage,
(roughly parallel throughout) are perceptible on close inspection, and
are distinct under the microscope.              In garnet such a structure com
monly indicates pressure, and the general parallelism accords with this
explanation, but the other constituents show no signs of crushing.

The " kelyphite rims to the garnets are perhaps slightly broader and
the brown mica passes into a green (chloritic 1) mineral, and occupies
cracks in the garnet a little more frequently, but as before the con
stituents tend to lie parallel rather than radially.              One or two of the
diopsides show fine oscillatory twinning.            The   cracks  are occupied with
calcite or some allied carbonate.          There is no real difference between
this eclogite and the last-named one.

    3. Part of a boulder,           which must have been about a foot in
diameter (found at 250 ft. level).          It presents a general resemblance to
the rocks described above, with, however, the possibility of a second
green constituent.         This is not confirmed on microscopic examination.
The rock consists, practically, of pyrope and diopside, as already
described, except that negative crystals are rather unusuajly con
spicuous in the latter.          Into the details of these, as the point seems
not to have any bearing on the present investigation, I do not purpose
to enter.
    4.   A  fragment, more irregular in form than the others, measures
very roughly, about 7 in. by 4J in. by 3£ in. It retains a good piece
of the outer surface, whi"h, though now a little corroded, was once

smooth.     The rock, which                israther decomposed and crumbly, consists
chiefly   of three minerals          :     garnet, not quite so large, paler and more
pink in colour than the last-named ; an emerald-green pyroxene, and a
yellowish or greenish-grey,        platy to fibrous mineral, suggestive of
a second more altered pyroxene.          In thin slices the paler and pinker
tint of the garnet is very perceptible, as well as the tendency to a
rude and generally parallel cleavage.           But we find in         under the    it,
microscope,   a  few microlithic enclosures, of an apparently colourless
mineral, which occurs in long prisms crossed at about 70° by an
occasional transverse cleavage, and extinguishing at an angle of about
26" with the longer edge.        Many of the cracks exhibit slight decom
position, starting from them, and are sometimes occupied by calcite.
The pyroxene, under the microscope, hardly differs from the one
already described, except that the green tint            slightly richer and one
                                                                 is
or two crystals contain the small dark brown negative crystals, com
mon in hypersthene and diallage.         The dominant cleavage, as before,                         is
along the clinopinacoid.* The third mineral proves to be an altered
enstatite, but  I  leave the details for the present, as               better pre

                                                                 is

(a) garnet, (b) diopside,        mica, (r/) enstatite.

      6.   The next fragment, measuring about 3 in. by 2£ in. by 2 in., and
                                                                       " found in the
   retaining part of its smooth oftter surface, is labelled
   yellow ground of No. 2 mine,* 50 feet deep." Though it is much more
   decomposed than the others, the purplish garnet, the emerald-green
  pyroxene, the altered enstatite (here very rotten), and a flake or twc-
  of     phlogophite (?) are easily          made   out.   It is obviously   a   more
  decomposed        specimen     of the rock represented      by the two preceding
  specimens.
      7.   The last of this group of specimens is a rock fragment,t measuring
  about 3i in. by 2 in. in length and breadth, and slightly exceeding an
  inch in greatest thickness.            Its outline is irregular, being determined
  by the fracture of the predominant diallage-like mineral. The crystals
  of this run large, an inch or more in length, breadth, and thickness.
  It is greyish-green in colour, having one dominant cleavage, with a
 sub-metallic lustre, and close subordinate cleavages, giving a somewhat
 fibrous aspect to that surface. Between these large crystalline lumps,
 numerous small, ill-defined garnets (pyrope) seem crowded, so as to
 form fairly continuous partings, generally hardly 0'l inch in thickness.
 As the readiness with which the rather soft pyroxenic constituent split
 away made it improbable that a good slice could be cut, and I was
 reluctant to injure the specimen, I contented myself with detaching a
 few flakes of this constituent for microscopic work, since the deter
 mination of its identity was sufficient for my purpose.             These show the
 mineral to have one easy cleavage and a rather fibrous structure ; they
 give straight extinction parallel with this.              As the usual rings and
 brushes can be seen on the face of easy cleavage, the mineral belongs to
 the bastite group.           The same is true of the enstatite in boulder (4),
 though, as it is slightly more fibrous, and not in quite so good a condi
 tion, the optical picture is less distinct. Thus we may name the rock
 from which the present specimen has been broken, a garnet-bearing
 bastitite.
     8.   This specimen, said to     bo a   fragment of a boulder, is very different
from the rest. It is a compact greenish-grey rock containing enclosures,
which give it the aspect, at first sight, of a pebbly mudstone.               Micro
scopic examination shows it to be a compact felspathic diabase, with
vesicles, which have been filled up with calcite, chlorites, and other
secondary minerals (probably zeolites), but not to have any special
interest.      Its relations appear to be with the rocks occurring in a con
glomerate which we shall mention in a later paragraph.
    * The others come from another mine

   Two areas of diamantiferous rock are now being worked at the
New lands Mines.      The shape of the, one which supplied most of the
specimens described in this paper is irregular, and, so far as I know,
exceptional.   Its outline at the surface may be roughly compared to a
rounded triangle into the base of which the point of a rather short
shuttle is thrust, the greatest breadth of the two being about equal.
Exploratory workings at a depth of 300 feet show that the former
area rather quickly narrows, and the latter terminates in clefts.  The
" blue ground," in fact, appears to fill a fissure, broadening in two
places to vents, which has been traced for some distance underground
southwards from the principal mass of diamantiferous rock, as repre
sented in the annexed section, where the latter is dotted.
   An igneous rock     (i)   occurs on either side.       It   is   compact,   a   greenish-
grey in colour, not unlike some of the less acid Welsh felstones.
Under the microscope          it  found to be much affected by secondary
                                   is
mineral changes, the iron oxides alone being in good preservation.
A few small crystals of decomposed felspar are scattered in yet more           a
decomposed matrix, of which the minor details are uninteresting.          The
rock may be classed with the compact, rather felspathic, diabases.
These walls of diabase, farther to the south, turn off rather sharply to
east and west.     In the interval, about 12 feet in width, between them,
              "       "
ribs of the     blue    and a mudstone alternate, the thickest one of the
former being from   3    to  feet in width, and the inner part of

fragments of shale.        Specimen (v) has a stratified aspect, being a dull
grey faintly mottled rock, with streaky, dark, rather carbonaceous-
looking bands ; the origin being doubtful, till it is seen under the
microscope.      A fourth specimen (iii) shows the mudstone traversed by
a vein of rather pale-coloured decomposed

inch in thickness.      A   fifth (ii)  is from near  the  diabase  on   the western
side, a dark compact rock, faintly mottled, here and there presenting a
                               "       "
slight resemblance to a blue traversed by thin veins of a carbonate ;
and a sixth (iv) from a like position on the opposite side is a generally
similar rock, but with wider veins filled with more coarsely crystalline
calcite.    A seventh specimen represents the " blue " in the " neck," a
few yards to the north and at the same level (300 feet). This, inferior
in preservation to the first-named, includes numerous rounded frag
ments a little darker than the matrix, with others, angular to sub-
angular, some also darker and some lighter than it.
    A brief summary of the results of microscopic examination may
 suffice, as these rocks do not materially differ from specimens obtained
in the De Beers Mine, of which I have published a full account.*
    The matrix is a mixture, in slightly variable quantities, of granules
of calcite or dolomite, serpentine, pyroxene, and iron oxides, in which
occur flakes with fairly idiomorphic outlines of a warm-brown mica,
moderately pleochroic, corresponding with that describedt in one or
 two specimens from De Beers Mine. The prisms a>-e about 0-002 inch
 in diameter, and sometimes nearly as thick. This mica, which, as
 stated in a former paper, I consider a secondary product, occurs abun
 dantly in all the specimens, but in that from the interior (on the whole
 the best preserved rock) it is locally assuming a green colour, no doubt
 by hydration.       In the specimens from the thick rib, the one last
 named contains mineral grains and rock fragments.                Except for a few
 flakes of the usual mica, the former are a mixture of two fibrous
 minerals, the larger part corresponding with actinolite ; the rest,
 giving lower polarisation tints, may be serpentine.                  This fact, and
 structures suggestive of the former presence of a cleavage more regular
  than that of olivine, make it more probable that diopside was the
 original mineral. Though iron oxide is present in specks and rods
  (especially in the worse preserved specimen), this occurs either in the
 outer part, or as though it had been deposited along cleavage planes.
 In the thin rib of " blue " (iii), some of the grains are composed partly
 of a fibrous mineral, as above described, and partly of a clear one, which
 often affords rather rich polarisation tints, and presents some resem
 blance to quartz.       Its precise nature is difficult to determine, owing
 to the absence of distinctive characters, but I believe it to be of second-

  ary origin.     Rock fragments       are not common      in the first (interior)
  specimen (vii) ; one, however, is probably an altered shale, and another
  possibly a limestone.       This is bordered by a pale, pyroxenic mineral
  piercing into the grains of calcite.        In the second specimen (vi) frag
  ments are rather common ; among them are those of diabase, ranging
  from fine to coarse, one specimen of the latter, originally, perhaps, an
  inch in diameter, showing an ophitic structure ; felspar and augite both
  being rather altered, seemingly by infiltration, and one small fragment
  resembles a subcrystalline limestone.        Specimen (v) does not materially
 differ, but seems to contain more carbonate than the others.           The dark
 streaking    is due  to grains of iron oxide  or serpentine  with much  opacite ;
  rock fragments are few and small.          Specimen (iii) from the thin vein
  contains a few very small rock fragments, mudstone or shale, more or
                                                                             "
  less altered, possibly also a compact diabase.       The " country rock is a
  mudstone, consisting of small chips of quartz and felspar, variable
 in size, embedded in a dusty matrix, including a carbonate, which ie
  more abundant within about a fiftieth of an inch from the junction.
 This part is slightly stained, but I was unable to detect any signs of
 contact metamorphism.           Specimens (ii) and (iv) are generally similar,
 but the former contains some small rounded bits of varieties of diabase,
 and one may represent a crystalline limestone.              The veins are filled
 with calcite and other secondary products, and are bordered by a very
 thin film of a brown micaceous mineral, like that described as often
 permeating the "blue." Both specimens suggest micromineralogical
 changes, such as might be produced by the passage of hot water.
     Other specimens of the sedimentary rock in the immediate neigh
 bourhood of the blue have been forwarded to me by Mr. Trubenbach.
 One, from the adit o"n the southern side of the section mentioned above,
 is a grey mudstone, containing a flattish rectangular pebble, of a dark
 green compact rock.         Two others are from No. 2 mine, or about 700
yards    to the  south-west.    One, struck in the shaft at a depth of 200 feet,
is a conglomerate, composed of well-rounded rock fragments, with some
scattered grains of quartz.         Each of the former is bordered by a zone
of a crystalline carbonate (impure calcite), and the interstices are
filled, sometimes by a clearer variety of the same, but more often by
some minutely granular secondary product. Of the rock fragments, one
is a subcrystalline dolomitic limestone ; two, perhaps, are chalcedony; the
remainder are igneous ; the majority being varieties of diabase, some
times rather decomposed ; the rest trachytes, mainly andesites.             Their
general aspect and the not unfrequent presence of vesicles (now filled
with viridite) suggest that they have been furnished by lava-flows.
Another specimen, obtained in the same working at a depth of 400 feet,
is a rather felspathic diabase, not unlike one of the varieties in the
conglomerate.        It is a good deal decomposed, is not improbably from
a lava-flow, but docs not call for a minute description.

             Tlie Parent-rock of     the Diamond in South Africa.               235
                                      Conclusion.
    Thus the diamond has been traced up to an igneous rock.                     The
"  blue ground
                  "
                     is not the birthplace either of it or of the garnets,
pyroxenes, olivine, and other minerals, more or less fragmental, which
it incorporates.      The diamond is a constituent of the eclogite, just as
much as a zircon may be a constituent of a granite or a syenite.                  Its
regular   form   suggests  not  only   that  it was   the first mineral  to  crystal
lise in the magma, but also a further possibility. Though the occur
rence of diamonds in rocks with a high percentage of silica (itacolumite,
granite, &c.) has been asserted, the statement needs corroboration.
This form of crystallised carbon hitherto has been found only in
meteoric iron (Canyon Diablo),* and has been produced artificially by
Moissan and others with the same metal as matrix. But in eclogite
the silica percentage is at least as high as in dolerite ; hence it is diffi
cult to understand how so small an amount of carbon escaped oxidation.
I  had always expected that a peridotite (as supposed by Professor
Lewis), if not a material yet more basic, would prove to be the birth
place of the diamond.        Can it possibly be a derivative mineral, even
in the eclogite ? Had it already crystallised out of a more basic
magma,t which, however, was still molten, when one more acid was
injected, and the mixture became such as to form eclogite ? But I
content myself with indicating a difficulty, and suggesting a possi
bility ; the fact itself is indisputable : that the diamond occurs, though
rather sporadically, as a constituent of an eclogite, which rock, accord
ing to the ordinary rules of inference, must be regarded as its birth
place.

Besides two unworn pieces of pyrite and a rough bit of eclogite, about
three-quarters       of an inch in diameter, the pyroxenic constituent of
which was a bright emerald-green (t smaragdite), I find part of a sub-

flakes of the usual mica, a well rounded garnet fully 0'6 inch across,
and half a well worn pebble of eclogite, about one inch long and half an
inch thick. The rounded waterworn look of the great majority of
the smaller constituents        (chiefly garnets and pyroxenes),     about the size
of hemp     seed, is   very obvious.     I had suspected some of the grains in
washings     from    the  Do  Beers   Mine  to have been similarly treated ; but
here it is indubitable, indeed many of the dark green specimens are so
smooth outside that they could only be identified after fracture.                The
ordinary diopside can, however, be recognised, with some of a clearer
and brighter green.         Most of the garnets are pyropes, but a few re

  Photographic Researches on Phosphorescent Spectra : on Vic-
       torium, a New Element associated with Yttrium."                         By Sir
       WILLIAM CRO0KES, F.R.S. Received May                      2, — Read May 4,
       1899.
                                       [PLATE 9.]
   It  has long been known that certain substances enclosed in a vacuou,,
glass bulb phosphoresce brightly when submitted to molecular bom
bardment from the negative pole of an induction coil.                      The ruby,
emerald, diamond,       alumina, yttria, samaria, and a large class of earthy
oxides and sulphides, emit light under these circumstances.                 Examined
in a spectroscope the light from some of these bodies gives an almost
continuous spectrum, while that from others, such as alumina, yttria,
and samaria, gives spectra of more or less sharp bands and lines. Since
1879 I have been working on these phosphorescent spectra, chiefly in
connection with the earths of the yttria group, and by chemical frac-
tionation I have succeeded in separating from this group bodies whose
phosphorescent     spectra consist      chiefly of single    groups   of lines, other
groups being absent. For the last six years the research has been
extended beyond the visible spectrum, and photographs of the ultra
violet portion of the spectra are now being taken with a spectrograph
with a complete quartz train. Some of the results of this investigation
were exhibited at the soirte of the Royal Society, on the 3rd of May.
A preliminary mention of the discovery of a new element was made in
my address to the British Association in September last, when I pro
visionally called it Monium ; but for several reasons I now consider the
name Vi<torian more appropriate.
   The complicated scheme of fractionation carried on for so many years
is illustrated in the accompanying diagram (Plate 9). This must be
considered only as an indication of the methods employed, and not as
an actual representation of every operation through which the material
has passed.      Crude yttria, from samarskite, gadolinite, cerite, and
other similar minerals, is the raw material.             The first operation is to
free it roughly from earths of the cerium group — an operation effected
by taking advantage of the fact that the double sulphates of potassium
and the yttrium metals are easily soluble in saturated potassium
sulphate solution, while the corresponding double sulphates of the
cerium group of metals are difficultly soluble.
   After this preliminary treatment the crude yttria is converted into
nitrate, represented by the topmost circle on the diagram.                The nitrate
is exposed to    heat   until  it fuses   to  a clear liquid,   care  being taken to
distribute the heat uniformly through the mass. Presently the liquid
mass commences to decompose, giving off red vapours.                   After this has
proceeded     for  a  little  time   the   fused  mass    is  carefully poured into
    vot,.  rxv.                                                               T

238                                    Sir W. Crookes
water, and the liquid well boiled.                A white precipitate of basic nitrate
forms, while the undecomposed nitrates remain in solution.                         These are
separated by      filtration,     the    precipitate going      to the  right  and  the solu
tion to the left. The basic nitrate is dissolved in nitric acid, and the
right and left solutions are then evaporated to dryness and fused as
before.    Partial decomposition by heat again divides each of these
portions into two lots, soluble and insoluble.                       The soluble from the
left-hand lot goes still further to the left, and its insoluble portion to
the right.     The soluble from the right-hand portion goes to the left,
where it mixes with the insoluble from the other portion, while its
insoluble goes still further to the right. This series of operations is
continued for as long a time as the material will hold out.* From a
description the process seems to be more complicated than it really is,
but a study of the diagram and the direction of the arrows make it
clear.    The number of times this operation is performed varies with
each lot of earth fractionated.                  The portions submitted to fusion
rapidly diminish in quantity, and the operation is continued until the
material becomes too scanty.
    The last horizontal line of fractions spectroscopically examined in a
radiant matter tube shows differences in the visible spectrum.                           For
many years      I    recorded       these   differences     in  coloured    drawings,  which
have served on several occasions to illustrate papers before this Society. t
In the year 1893 I commenced to record the differences between the
various spectra by photographing them in a spectrograph having a
complete quartz train, and since that time attention has chiefly been
directed to the variations in the number, character, and positions of the
lines and bands in the ultra-violet spectrum : these are more striking
than those which are visible, and as they are self-recording, results are
 more rapidly attained.               A description of this instrument is given
further on.
     On placing the photographed spectra of one of the horizontal lines
of earths in order, several differences are detected.                          One striking
 difference is    seen      in  the   behaviour      of   a  group   of  lines  in the ultra
 violet. It is nearly absent in the end fractions, gradually becoming
 stronger towards the middle, and attaining a maximum in the fractions
 situate about two-thirds towards the right.                     This shows that at least
 three different bodies are present : one, the great bulk, having a nitrate
 difficult to decompose ; another whose nitrate is easiest to decompose ;
 and a third body, occupying an intermediate position, whose nitrate
decomposition        occurs at temperatures between that required by the
 others, but nearer that of the nitrate easiest decomposed.

   The above method of fractionation is not so effectual if more than
two bodies are present.     In that case the process fails, in any reason
able time, to yield practically pure specimens of more than two out of
a group of closely allied earths.     Thus, if there are three earths — say,
A, B, and C — whose positions in reference to the chemical process em
ployed are in the written order of sequence, we may get a specimen of
A as nearly as we please free from B and C, and a specimen of C as
nearly as we please free from A and B, but we cannot get a specimen
of B practically free from A and C. The law seems to be that to ob
tain practically pure specimens of three closely allied earths, it is essen
tial to have recourse to at least two different chemical processes. The
mere continued repetition of the same process will not do, unless indeed
the operations are repeated such a vast number of times as to make the
approximate expressions no longer applicable, even though the sub
stances are chemically very close.
    For this and other reasons it is advisable to change the method of
fractionation after one process has been in operation for some time.
It is evident that any process of fusion, crystallisation, or precipitation
can only divide the mass of material into two parts, a soluble and
insoluble portion, crystals and mother liquor ; and after a time a
balance of affinities seems to be established, and further fractionation
appears to do little good.    It is better then to change the operation.
    Following the diagrammatic scheme, the portions of earths contain
ing most victorium are collected together and fractionated by the crys
tallisation   of the oxalates  from a solution strongly acidulated      with
nitric acid in the following manner :—
    To a boiling acid solution of the nitrate a small quantity of hot
solution of oxalic acid is added.    The solution remains clear, and it is
only after vigorous stirring that a small quantity of insoluble oxalate
is formed.      The whole is thrown on a hot-water filter and slightly
washed with boiling water.       To the boiling filtrate a fresh lot of hot
solution of oxalic acid is added, and stirred till -more insoluble oxalate
comes down. This is again filtered off, and the operations of precipi
tating, stirring, filtering, and washing are repeated, always keeping
 the temperature as near the boiling point as possible, until the whole
 of the earths are precipitated.     Generally the initial earth is divided
 by this method of fractionation into from six to twelve portions. Each
 of these oxalates is dried, ignited, dissolved in nitric acid, and the
 a,bove-described operations repeated. Photo-spectroscopic tests are con
 stantly taken <hiring the progress of this fractionation, and portions
 are mixed together according to the data thus obtained, as shown on
 the diagram by the lines joining the fractions ; the object being to
 avoid lateral spreading as much as possible, and, while concentrating
 the special line-giving earth, to prevent its too great diffusion over a
 large number of fractions.      When the fractionation by the oxalate
                                                                 T 2

method     has   proceeded for a considerable time, the fractions rich in
victorium     are collected together and submitted to another mode of
treatment.
    These   fractions are converted       into nitrates, and a small  quantity is
thrown out by partial decomposition           by heat, according  to the method
already deseril>ed.      The nitrate is evaporated to dryness and again
fused so as to throw out a little more.           This operation is repeated as
long    as any   soluble  nitrate  is left.   Generally from six to twelve por
tions are thus obtained.        These form a regular series, differing accord
ing to the stability of the nitrate under heat. On testing, the
victorium is found to concentrate in the centre portions, being less
easily decomposed than the earths of the cerium group and more
easily decomposed than those of the yttrium group.
    The fractions rich in victorium are converted into sulphates and
 mixed with a hot saturated solution of potassium sulphate.              The pre
 cipitate is dissolved in boiling water and mixed with a further quantity
 of solution of potassium sulphate.           This produces a small quantity of
 a precipitate.     The nitrate from the first precipitate is also mixed with
 fresh   potassium sulphate, and the operations are repeated, mixing the
 centre solutions to one lot and the side solutions to another, as shown
 by the lines on the diagram.            It is found on photo-spectroscopic ex
 amination that the earths thrown out on each side are poorest in
 victorium, whilst those in the middle are richest.            After a time no
 further concentration is effected in this manner, all the earths that can
 be removed as being more or less soluble in potassium sulphate having
 been eliminated.
    In thus describing the method of fractionation, my object has            been
 not   so much to    give  a  description of the plan actually carried out in
 the laboratory    —  for the details have varied with each operation — but
 to give an intelligible idea of the general manner in which a very com
 plicated operation is effected. In the diagram I am supposing that one
 particular substance, victorium, is to be separated, and I have endea
 voured to show its migrations and gradual concentration as the work
 progresses, by tinting the fractions where it mostly would concentrate ;
 the depth of tint representing the amount of concentration.
     In the purest condition yet obtained victoria is an earth of a pale
 brown colour, easily soluble in acids. It is less basic than yttria and
 more basic than most of the earths of the terbia group.              In chemical
 characters it differs in many respects from yttria.           From a hot nitric
 acid  solution   victorium   oxalate   precipitates before yttrium oxalate and
 after terbium oxalate.         On fractional precipitation with potassium
 sulphate the double sulphate of victorium and potassium is seen to be
 less soluble than tho corresponding yttrium salt, and more soluble
 than the double sulphates of potassium and the terbium and cerium
 groups.     Victorium nitr.ilu is a little more easily decomposed by heat

than yttrium nitrate, but the difference is not sufficient to make this
reaction a good means of separating victorium and yttrium.                    Fusing
the nitrates can, however, be employed advantageously to separate
mixed victoria and yttria from the bulk of their associated earths.
    On the assumption that the oxide has the composition VcjOs, the
atomic weight of victorium is apparently not far from 117.
    The photographed phosphorescent spectrum of victoria consists of
•A pair of strong lines at about A 3120 and            3117 ; other fainter lines
are at 3219, 3064, and 3060.            Frequently the pair at 3120 and 3117
merge into one, but occasionally            I have seen them quite distinct.
The presence or absence of other earths has much influence on the
sharpness of lines in phosphorescent spectra, and it is probable that
these lines will be sharp and distinct when victoria is obtained quite
free from its associates.
    The best material for phosphorescing in the radiant matter tube is
not the earth itself, but the anhydrous sulphate formed by heating the
earth with strong sulphuric acid and driving off the excess of acid at
A red heat. The sulphate thus produced, probably also containing
some basic sulphate, is powdered and introduced into a bulb tube fur
 nished with a quartz window, and a pair of thick aluminium poles
 sealed into the glass with stout platinum wires.               The tube is well
•exhausted, keeping the current from a good induction coil going all
 the time. The pumping and sparking must continue until the earth
glows with a pure light free from haze or cloudiness, and continues so
 to glow during the passage of the current without deterioration.
 The exposure in the spectrograph usually occupies an hour.
    I give a diagrammatic plan of the two-prism spectrograph used in
 this research.     It is furnished with two quartz prisms, quartz lenses,
and condensers.        The slit jaws are of quartz, cut and polished accord
ing to the method I described in the Chemical News,' vol. 71, p. 175,
                                             '
 April   11, 1895.
    The prisms are made in two halves, according to Cornu's plan ; one
 half of each being right-handed and the other half left-handed.                 One
of the lenses also is right-handed and the other left-handed.                 By this
 device the effect of double refraction is so completely neutralised that
 with a five-prism instrument it is impossible, under high magnifying
 lx>wer, to detect any duplication of the lines.
    The lenses are each of 52 mm. diameter and 350 mm. focus. The
 focus of the least refrangible rays is longer than that of the most
 refrangible rays, and the sensitive film must therefore be set at an
 angle to get the extreme rays into focus at the same time.                  But this
 alone is not sufficient.       The focal plane is not a flat surface, but is
 curved,   and  the   film must    therefore be curved,* and it is only when

l>oth   these   conditions are fulfilled that perfectly sharp images of
spectral   lines extending from the red to the high zinc line 2138'30 can
be photographed on the same surface.           Celluloid films are used, glass
not being sufficiently flexible.
    Using the middle position showing the whole spectrum on a plate,
the angle is 40°, and the curvature is 190 mm. radius.
    The condensers are of quartz, and are piano-cylindrical — one being
double the focus of the other. The object of this, when spark-spectra
are being photographed, is to concentrate on the slit a line instead of
a point of light, as would be the case if ordinary lenses were used.
    When photographing phosphorescent spectra — or, in fact, any spectra
the wave-lengths of which are either unknown or require verification
— I always photograph on the same film a standard spectrum, usually
of an alloy of equal molecular weights of zinc, cadmium, tin, and
mercury.       This forms a hard somewhat malleable alloy, giving
throughout the whole photographic region lines the wave-lengths of
which are well known. The chief objection to this alloy is its volatility
— the    poles requiring   frequent adjustment.       Recently I have used
pure iron for this purpose ; this has the advantages of giving a great
number of fine lines whose wave-lengths are accurately known, and not
being very volatile, the poles do not rapidly wear away.          If the poles
are kept about 1 mm. apart there is little or no interference from
air lines.
    The most simple method of applying the standard lines to an
unknown spectrum is by the successive employment of two slightly
overlapping diaphragms immediately behind the slit, one being used
for the experimental and the other for the standard spectrum.          In this
way, without disturbing the instrument, the two spectra can be recorded
on the plate one over the other ; the overlap of 1 mm. being in the
optical centre of the train. The resulting negative is then transferred
to a micrometer measuring machine of special construction, having a
screw of 1/100 of an inch pitch, and a means of accurately determining
 1/1000 of its revolution
                             — thus measuring directly to the hundred-
thousandth of an inch.        In this way, in a five-prism spectrograph
having lenses 700 mm. focus, it is possible to determine wave-lengths
of photographed lines to the sixth figure.

During the eighteenth century the infection doctrine was frequently
discussed by physiologists, and since Lord Morton, in 1820, addressed
                                                                                      "
a letter to the Royal Society on the subject, believers in " infection
have been increasing all over the world, with the result that one seldom
now hears of breeders or fanciers who are not influenced by the doc
trine, while physicians and others interested in the problems of here
dity either as a rule take telegony for granted or see nothing improbable
                      "
in the " infection hypothesis.
   It must, however, be admitted that, notwithstanding the criticisms of
Weismann and others, very different views are entertained by the
believers in telegony, not only as to the cause, but as to the results, of
" infection." By some telegony is confounded with
                                                                 simple reversion or
atavism, while the better informed generally assume that " infection

invariably results in the subsequent offspring repeating more or less
accurately the characters of the first or of a previous sire. In a
breeders' journal of some standing there appeared recently under the

heading                                      following sentence :— Greys show

to other colours in the Stud Book, but they reappear and no doubt go
back to the Arab, and prove telegony to be a fact."*                     This shows

states that an ordinary cat which had kittens to a tailless Manx cat
subsequently produced several tailless kittens to a normal cat of her
own breed,   t
   An extended series of experiments with various kinds of animals has
led me to the conclusion that if there is such a thing as telegony, it is
more likely to result in the subsequent offspring " throwing back

telegony   (which has not been insisted on hitherto) will be made at once
evident by an example.           A sable collie crossed with a Dalmatian pro
duced three pups which in their coloration are extremely like young
foxhounds ; instead of numerous small spots each has a few large
blotches.    According to the common view of telegony this collie, if
infected, should next produce with a dog of her own breed one or more
Dalmatian-like pups. If, however, the offspring of a collie and a Dal
matian are like foxhounds, the subsequent offspring to a collie of the
same colour and strain could hardly be expected to present Dalmatian

 ancestors of the sire or the dam, it will be extremely difficult, if not
 in many cases impossible, to distinguish telegony from simple rever
 sion.*
     But though " infection," if it does take place, is likely, as a rule, to
 lead the subsequent offspring to resemble the ancestors of the dam, it
 may in certain cases possibly lead to their " throwing hack" to a pre
 vious sire. This result might follow if the previous sire happened to
 be highly prepotent.    For example, Highland heifers often produce to a
 Galloway bull hornless black offspring indistinguishable from pure
 Galloways. If infected by the Galloway bull, these heifers might
 afterwards produce Galloway-like calves when mated with long-horned
 bright coloured bulls of their own breed.
     It is now commonly believed that if there is such a thing as telegony
 it results from the unused germ cells of the 'first (or previous) sire
 infecting — blending with — the unripe germ cells in the ovaries of the
 dam.      Were this possible, the subsequent progeny would in all proba
 bility   in a mild way resemble the previous sire, but if this is impos
 sible, then infection— due perhaps to some obscure change in the con
stitution or reproductive system of the dam— is more likely to lead to
 more or less marked reversion to the ancestors of the dam. All my
observations     point to its being impossible in the Equidae for the
 unused male germ cells of the first sire to infect the unripe ova.        The
spermatozoa lodged in the upper dilated part of the oviduct of the
 mare are dead, and in process of disintegrating, eight days after insem
 ination ; they probably lose their fertilising power in four or five days.
 There is no reason for supposing that in the Equidle they survive
 longer in or around the ovary. Further, though at the time of fertili
 sation there may be several large Graafian follicles in each ovary con
 taining maturing ova, all these follicles disappear long before the
 period of gestation is completed.       The subsequent foals are developed
 from successive new crops of ova into the composition of which it is
 inconceivable any of the spermatozoa of the first sire could by any
chance enter.      A study of the ovaries hence tends to confirm the view
 that " infection

to a black Arabian horse. One might even go further and without
much exaggeration assert that the tolcgony hypothesis at the present
moment mainly rests on an allegation by Sir Gore Ouseley's stud
  It has been generally assumed that Lord Morton's mare (a nearly
                              "         "
purely bred chestnut Arab) was infected   for two reasons (1) because
the subsequent offspring were of a yellowish-brown colour and more or
less striped, and (2) because, according to Sir Gore Ouseley's stud
groom, the mane of one of the striped foals had always been upright,
while in another it arched to one side clear of the neck. The presence
of stripes in the subsequent offspring has never been questioned, nor
yet is there any doubt that when Lord Morton in 1820 inspected the
" colts " the mane in the filly was upright as in the
                                                           quagga, while that
of the colt resembled the mane of Lord Morton's quagga hybrid.
There  is,  however, an absence of reliable evidence that the filly's mane
had always been upright as alleged to Lord Morton by Sir Gore
Ouseley's stud groom.
   Were the evidence in support of this allegation satisfactory, there
would think be no escape from the conclusion that Lord Morton's
       I
mare was " infected
                        "
                          by the quagga.    Hitherto the presence of stripes.
on the    "  colts
                   "
                     has generally been looked upon as affording strong
evidence of    " infection." Believers in telegony admit that stripes are
not uncommon in Norwegian and certain other breeds of horses, but,
with Mr. Darwin, they have taken for granted that they never or very
rarely occur in Arabs.
I    find, however, that though in Arabia dun-coloured horses are dis
liked and never used for breeding, stripes even in the most renowned
strains are not so uncommon as          generally supposed.
                                       is                    I    have now a
purely bred Arab filly of about the same colour as Lord Morton's filly,
but, unlike the filly we have heard so much of, both the fore and hind
legs are marked with distinct dark bars, and there are faint indications
of stripes across the withers and      adistinct dorsal band.     The history
of this filly (bred by Mr. Wilfred Scawen Blunt at Crabbet Park,
Sussex, and very kindly presented to me)             iswell known for many
generations  ;   none  of her ancestors could possibly  have been "infected"
by a zebra. The dun colour and stripes arc doubtless the result of
simple spontaneous reversion, for, unlike Lord Morton's mare, there        is
no history of    a cross in her pedigree.     This filly proves that even in
high-caste Arabs of tbc best desert blood a dun colour and stripes may
unexpectedly     appear.

           Experimental         Contributions   to the  Theory   of Heredity.        247
    As to the occurrence of stripes in other breeds I could give, were it
 necessary, many instances.            A year ago I had in my possession a light
 bay (or yellow dun) pony,            which   showed nearly as many stripes on
 the trunk as the Gore-Ouseley filly, and in addition had several in
 terrupted narrow stripes on the forehead.* Moreover, the stripes on
 the Gore-Ouseley " colts," while agreeing with stripes occasionally seen
 in horses, differ in their arrangement from the stripes in the quagga.
 The stripes themselves are evidence of reversion, but nothing more,
 and seeing that pure bred horses sometimes show quite as many stripes,
 we are not justified in assuming that but for the dam of the " colts
                                                                                        "
 having been first mated with a quagga the stripes would not have
 appeared.
    Hence unless it is proved that the mane in the filly and colt were
                                                                "

 Morton's mare will be lost. It may be well to quote the passage from
 Lord Morton's letter referring to the mane. It is as follows : — " That
 of the filly is short, stiff, and upright, and Sir Gore Ouseley's stud
groom alleged it never was otherwise.               That of the colt is long, but so
stiff as to arch upwards and to hang clear of the neck, in which circum
 stance it resembles that of the hybrid.               This is the more remarkable
as the manes of the Arabian breed hang lank and closer to the neck
.than that of most others."t
    I  am not prepared to accept the allegation as to the manes for the
following reasons        : —
    1.  I  have     had    twelve zebra     hybrids     under observation,       and   in
 each case the mane,           though erect to start with, always after a time
arched     over    to one or both sides.           The stud groom's statement, it
 seems    to me, proves too much.            If in the quagga hybrid and in all
 my horse hybrids the mane, sooner or later, falls to one side, it is
a little remarkable that in the pure bred two-year-old filly it had been
always upright.
    I  may here mention that the hair of the mane of zebra hybrids is
shed annually ; it is for this reason that the mane in hybrids is never
long enough to        hang close to the neck.
    2. The mane       in the drawing of the filly by Agasse is not represented
 as upright, but      as    lying to one side.    If  the mane had remained erect
during the first      two years, by virtue      of shedding its hairs, it could not
 very well have        lost this habit and      fallen completely over to one side
subsequently, say, during the fourth           year.     From the mane being erect
in 1820, and hanging to one side                in 1821 or 1822, when Agasse's
                                                                               " colts "
drawing      was   made,     the presumption is that the mane of the
had been cut some time before they were examined by Lord Morton.
    Two years ago I had a bay Arab with a mane which was to start
        • See   Fig. 36. 'The Penycuik Experiments,'      A. and C. Black, 1899.
           '
        t    Phil. Trans.,' 1821.

   248              Lord Arthur Cecil and Dr.          J. C.  Ewart.
   with short, stiff, and upright, some months later it arched freely to
   one side, as in my zebra hybrids, and later still it hung lank and close
   to the neck.
        3. There is always an intimate relation in the Equidae between the
   mane and the tail, when the mane is short and erect the upper third or
   so of the tail is only covered with short hairs, which, like the hairs of
   the mane, are annually shed.           Lord Morton noticed nothing peculiar
   about the tail of the " colts," and the tail of both the colt and filly in
   Agasse's drawings is the tail of a high-caste Arab.             This seems to me
   to warrant the conclusion that the filly's mane           had  been hogged some
   time before Lord Morton's visit.
        It thus appears that the evidence in support of the belief that Lord
   Morton's mare was " infected
                                        "
                                           by the quagga is at the best far from
   satisfactory.    The same may be said of the evidence in support of all
   the other supposed cases of telegony in the Equidae — of, amongst
   others, Lord Mostyn's mare, referred to by Darwin ;* of the mule-like
   mare in the Paris Gardens, referred to by Tegetmeier and Sutherland :t
   and of the African ass (Equus asinus), still in the Zoological Gardens
   (London), which now and then has a reddish-coloured foal, like the
   cross-bred foal she produced in 1883 to an Asiatic ass (E. hemionus).
        Although I am now satisfied that Lord Morton's case throws little
   light on the telegony hypothesis, like many others I had no very
   decided views on the subject some years ago, and hence when ar
   ranging in 1894 to make a collection of horse embryos, I decided to
   repeat, as far as circumstances permitted, what is commonly called
   Lord Morton's experiment.            For this purpose, I procured early in
    1895 three zebras and a number of mares.              Two of the zebras died
   during    the winter   of  1895,  but   the  third — a handsome stallion of the
   Chapman variety (E. burchelli v. chapmani) still survives and is now
   thoroughly acclimatised.
        During 1895 I only succeeded in mating the zebra with one mare,
   and hence there was only one hybrid born in 1896.                 During the last
   two years however, quite a number of hybrids have made their appear
   ance, and the dams of several of the hybrids have subsequently pro
   duced pure-bred foals.        The time has hence come, when some of the
   results of the experiments          may with propriety be communicated
   to the Royal Society.

                                     horses, and are hence perhaps related
to Mexican and Argentine horses, so often dun-coloured and partially
striped. Mulatto's hybrid (Romulus, born 12th August, 1896) is on
the whole more a zebra than a pony both mentally and physically.
He is especially remarkable in being more profusely striped than his
sire (the zebra Matopo), in having a heavy semi-erect mane, which is
shed annually, and in having a mule-like tail, from the upper third of
which the longer hairs are periodically shed. The body colour of the«
hybrid varies from a dark orange colour to a mouse dun ; the stripes
of a reddish-brown colour on the head are dark brown or nearly black
on the trunk and limbs.
   In the number and plan of the stripes, the hybrid agrees more
closely with the Somali zebra than with any of the Burchell zebras.
Over the brow, e.g., there are narrow rounded arches instead of some
what broad pointed arches as in his sire, the neck and trunk have
quite double the number of stripes found in the sire, while over the

croup in the position of the gridiron           of the mountain zebra there
were at birth irregular rows of spots which in course of time blended
to form somewhat zig-zag, narrow, transverse bands.               The ears are
nearly as large as in the sire, while the eye-lashes are longer and dis
tinctly curved.    In his movements the hybrid resembles his sire, and
like his sire he is always on the alert, very active and suspicious of
unfamilar objects.    Further in his call he agrees far more with his sire
than his dam. In being profusely striped, Romulus differs greatly
from the quagga hybrid bred by Lord Morton, in which the stripes
were fewer in number than in many dun-coloured horses.
   Mulatto's second foal arrived in July, 1897, the sire, Benazrek,
being a high-caste grey Arab horse.              Like Lord Morton's colts,
Mulatto's foal by the Arab      horse, in  make,    action, and temperament,
agreed    with  ordinary  foals,  but   it differed     from the majority of
foals in presenting quite a number of indistinct stripes — subtle mark
ings only visible in certain lights. These stripes differed but little
from the body colour, which varied from dark bay to brown. Though
few references have been made to the occurrence of stripes in foals,
they are, we find, far from uncommon.               As is well known, Mr.
Darwin once bred a striped foal by putting a cross-bred bay mare to
a thoroughbred horse.      This foal was for a time marked nearly all
over with obscure dark narrow stripes, plainest on the forehead, but
also distinct over the croup.*
   There is no figure of Mr. Darwin's striped foal, but from the descrip
tion given, there can be little doubt that the markings were more
abundant than in Mulatto's second foal.         In this foal (as in Mr. Dar
win's) the stripes became more and more indistinct, and by November
                     * 'Animals nud Plants,'   vol. 1, p. 60.

  they had almost vanished.           Unfortunately,    the foal died when about
  five months old, and hence       it is impossible to say whether any of the
  stripes would    have  persisted. It will be evident that Mulatto's second
  foal helped but little to clear up the vexed " infection
                                                                         "
                                                                           problem.
  Mulatto missed having a foal in 1898, but she recently produced at
  Knole, Kent, her third foal.             The sire (Loch Corrie) of this foal
  belongs to the Island of Rum section of the West Highland ponies,
  and closely resembles Mulatto.             The third foal has about as many
•
  stripes as the second. As in the second, they are most distinct over
  the croup and hind quarters ; and as in the second, they differ both
  from the markings in the previous sire, the zebra, and from the
  markings of the hybrid Romulus.
      This third foal, which was born on the 6th of May, 1899, seemed
  like the second, to lend some support to the " infection
                                                                      "
                                                                         hypothesis.
  Fortunately, since it made its appearance, two other West Highland
  mares have had foals to Loch Corrie.           These foals put all doubt as to
  the nature and significance of the stripes on Mulatto's second and
  third foals at an end.
      One of the dams is of a brown colour, the other is nearly black.
  Though neither the brown dam nor the black has ever seen a zebra,
  both foals are marked in very much the same way as Mulatto's, and
  some of the stripes in one of the new foals look more like persisting
  than the stripes on Mulatto's third foal.           Hence, in order to account
  for the markings on Mulatto's foal to the grey Arab, and on her foal
  to the black West Highland pony, it is unnecessary to fall back on the
  " infection  "
                  hypothesis.

     III.  Experiments with Shetland, Iceland, Irish, Thoroughbred,
                     and other Ponies."         By J. C. EWART.
      An effort was made to cross four Shetland ponies with the zebra
  stallion, but I only succeeded in obtaining one hybrid.                  The dam
  (Nora) of this hybrid closely resembles, except in size, the Island of
  Rum ponies — she is a small edition of Mulatto.              Her first foal, by a
  black Shetland pony, was of a dun colour and nearly as striped as
  Sir Gore Ouseley's filly ; her second is the most zebra-like of all my
  hybrids ; her third closely resembles her sire, a bay Welsh pony. For
   some time after birth there were faint indications of stripes over the
   hind quarters of this foal, but now it is a year old there are no mark
  ings or any other suggestions of a zebra.            It is not a little suggestive
  that the foal   bred  from  this   pony   before she   was mated with the zebra
  was distinctly striped, while the subsequent pure bred foal has no
  stripes.
      Of five Iceland ponies put to the zebra only one produced a hybrid.
   This hybrid was faintly striped, and showed less of the zebra than any

of the others.       The dam, a prepotent yellow and white (skewbald)
pony, had first of all a light bay foal to an Iceland pony.       Her third
foal, by a bay Shetland stallion, is a skewbald, and in the size and
arrangement of the brown patches closely resembles the dam.           There

zebra.
   Several   Irish mares were put to the zebra, and two of them (bays)
have   first produced hybrids and subsequently pure bred foals.            A
cream coloured Irish-Canadian marc unfortunately died before her
hybrid foal was born. One of the bay mares had a bay hybrid richly
striped ; the other a hybrid with but indistinct stripes.       The subse
               —
quent foals one by a chestnut thoroughbred horse (Tupgill), the
other by a hackney pony (Mars Royal) — are bays, not only devoid of
stripes but affording no indication whatever that their dams had been
previously mated with a zebra.
   Although I experimented with seven English thoroughbred mares
and an Arab mare, I only succeeded with one, a small chestnut.          This
mare produced twin hybrids last summer ; yesterday she had a foal to
a thoroughbred chestnut horse (Lockstitch).          One of the twins died
soon   after   birth, the other, richly but unobtrusively striped, in its
colour and make strongly suggests its dam. The chestnut mare's new
foal neither in make, colour, nor action in any way resembles a young
zebra nor a zebra hybrid.       In 1897 a bay mare by a bay Arab horse
(Hadeed) was for some months in foal to the zebra.                Since she
miscarried in 1896 she has had two foals to a thoroughbred horse
(Lockstitch).      Neither of these foals in any way suggests a zebra. In
this case the unused germ cells of the zebra had presumably a better
chance of reaching the ovum from which the first of the two pure-bred
foals was developed than is usually the case.
   Attempts were made to cross Welsh, Exmoor, New Forest, Nor
wegian, and Highland ponies with the zebra without success, and
though a cross-bred Clydesdale has twice had a hybrid, she has not yet
produced a pure bred foal.       The experiments as far as they have gone
afford no evidence in support of the telegony hypothesis.

   My Lord and Gentlemen, — The most important modern methods of
prophylactic treatment are based upon the fact that an attack of
disease from which an individual recovers leaves in him condition of   a
relative immunity to another attack.
   The method of turning this result to advantage for the protection
of whole communities was first demonstrated to us by Mahomedan
physicians, to whom the world thus owes what proved to be one of the
most fertile principles of modern science.
   The successes of Jenner and Pasteur, who utilised cultivated virus
for preventive treatment, have led to general conception that there
                                                    a                                      is
the possibility of creating artificial immunity to diseases by treating
the organism with morbid virus rendered by some special means
harmless.
   This view involves         a   generalisation        which led to a considerable

details from what has appeared in the Lancet1 of June 24, and British Medical

number of instances did not give the expected results.
                  Derivatives from Microbic Virus and their Effect.
      When we cultivate a pathogenic      micro-organism in a liquid medium,
two different elements are obtained mixed together : the bodies of the
microbe and the liquid which it has modified, and into which it has
secreted its own products.
   A modification of the     entire preparation, as represented by this
mixture, can be first of all obtained by filtering and separating the two
elements just mentioned, and considering each of them by itself.
   Or else the two can be left together, and only the vitality of the
microbe destroyed by some physical or chemical agent.
  Or the constitution and the properties of each, or of both of these
elements     can be,   to a desired degree, altered by the admixture of
chemicals,    or by subjecting them to physical processes.
      Or, the vital and pathogenic properties of the microbe can be modi
fied by artificial breeding,     and then the microbe itself, or the products
of such a modified microbe, used for treatment.
    The immediate effect which a given virus or its derivate produces
•on   an animal differs with the kind of virus taken, the process of
modification to which it has been subjected, and the species of animals
upon which it is used. The following instance may give an idea of
these variations.
   The ordinary Indian grey, as well as the brown, monkey are sus
ceptible to the plague virus, and may contract a fatal disease from being
simply pricked with an infected needle. The rabbit and guinea-pig are
also susceptible to the disease.    The horse, on the contrary, contracts
no fatal disease after being infected even with large doses of the
living virus.
    If, however, a plague culture be heated and the microbes killed in     it,
the relative susceptibilities of the monkey and the horse seem to be
reversed, the guinea-pig remains comparable with the monkey, while
the susceptibility of the rabbit     now like that of the horse, and not,
                                     is
as previously, like that of the monkey.
    It will require, according to several observers, very large dose of
                                                          a
•virus so treated to produce in the monkey or in the guinea-pig any
marked rise of temperature, or any alteration of the skin at the seat
of injection while the horse answers to the injection by almost as brisk
              ;
an attack of fever as      the virus were a living one, and at the seat of
                           if
inoculation a tumour        produced which,
                            is                    the dose be at all con
                                                  if
siderable, may lead to a complete mortification of the tissue.         The
rabbit similarly answers to the injection by an attack of fever and by
the formation of hard tumour at the seat of injection.

                    is

different animals, so varied is the result of the application of such
virus from the point of view of immunity conferred by it.
   There are animals in whom the inoculation leaves no lasting effect
whatever.     In others a very temporary immunity is created, vanish
ing entirely in a few days.      In other cases again, a condition appears
that produces the impression that, after the treatment, the animal has
become more susceptible to a subsequent infection than is a normal
animal not   so treated.
   And lastly, there may be found animals in which the same virus
will produce a firm and enduring immunity.
   In general I believe it to be admissible that in the case of every
disease, and with regard to every species of animal, a form of pro
phylactic treatment may be found that will produce immunity in that
particular case ; but that same method of treatment may or may
 hot be applicable to another animal or to another disease affecting the
same animal.
   It is the failure of taking into account this variation of circumstances
that, I believe, more than anything else has checked the success of
a number of experimenters.
   Immunity from Altact; and     Resistance to actual Symptoms of Disease.
   The study of the anti-cholera inoculation in India has revealed a new
problem in the subject of prophylactic treatment.
   The particular character of cholera epidemics, which appear un
expectedly, do not last, and in places where they are permanent, are
spread and scattered over large areas, makes the study of that disease
and the demonstration of the effect of a preventive treatment in its
case a matter of much greater difficulty than is the case in localised
contagious diseases, like smallpox, or in plague ; and although a large
amount of material has been collected already, it is desirable that
further observations be still added to the present ones confirmatory of
the results obtained.
   The information collected permits, however, already of pointing out
very important features in the working of the anti-cholera inoculation.
   The most extended and continuous observations on the subject were
organised by the Municipality of Calcutta, upon the enlightened
initiative of Professor W. J. Simpson, late Health Officer, and under his
continuous supervision, as well as my own.          These observations refer
                                                                            "
to the cholera stricken suburbs of Calcutta, the so-called " busties
or groups of huts situated round the tanks, where rain-water is collected
during the monsoon.
   Some    8000 people were inoculated in those localities, and for two
years observations were made and the results collected as to the occur
rences of cholera in the huts inhabited by the inoculated.

                           On Preventive Inoculation.                         255
    In   the vast majority of cases there lived in the same families
members who had not been inoculated, together with others inoculated,
and the possibility thus presented itself of comparing the incidence of
the disease in individuals of the same households, exposed as much us
it is possible to the same chances of infection.
    During the time under observation cases of cholera               occurred   in
seventy-seven huts.        The interval which elapsed between the applica
tion of inoculation in each particular hut and the occurrence of cholera
in it was as follows : —
    Among nninoaulated members of the families cholera occurred            — 1, 2,
3, 4, 5, 6, 9, 12,      13, 15, 17, 22, 34, 37, 44, 57, 62, 63,        71, 95, 99,
 109, 114, 118, 119,      120, 129, 132, 139, 143, 162,     189, 191, 203, 240,
251, 271,     281, 284,     300, 309,   318, 319,  334, 356,    359, 362,     370,
 372, 378, 383, 384, 389, 391, 393, 394, 401, 404, 408, 416, 433, 446,
 448, 453, 472, 493, 498, 673, 720, 723, 724, and 738 days after the
 inoculation     of  the   other members     of these  families.     Among     the
 inoculated members      of the families cholera   occurred  — 0,   2, 3, 4,  219,
 421, 459, 512, 688, 735, and 738 days after their inoculation.
    Thus for a period of 738 days, cases of cholera occurred               among
the uninoculated, so to say, at all intervals after the date of inocula
tion ; whereas the figures referring to the inoculated showed a striking
variation of the incidence when compared at various distances from
the time of inoculation.            Cases continued to occur among the
inoculated for a period of four days after the treatment, and then for
 416 days they practically remained free from the disease, only one
 death from cholera having occurred among them during that time.
 From the 421st day up to the end of the observations six cases occurred
among them again.
    The relative immunity in the inoculated considered                 separately
during those three periods shows that during the first four days the
inoculated had proportionately 1'86 times fewer deaths from cholera
than the uninoculated.
    During the period between the 5th and 420th days, i.e., for a period
of nearly fourteen months, the number of deaths among the inoculated
was 22'62 times smaller than amongst the uninoculated.               And for the
 rest of the time under observation the proportion in their favour fell
 to 1 to l-54.*      The plan has since been formed of trying the effect
 of larger doses and of stronger vaccines, in order to obtain a more
lasting protection.
    While thus the absolute number of cases and deaths from cholera
 appeared so strikingly influenced by inoculation, the peculiarity that
became apparent from the observations in Calcutta as well as in other
   * Vide Health Officer's Report to the Chairman of the Calcutta Municipal Cor

places was that the proportion of deaths to cases was not changed by
the treatment.
   Thus, in the observations made in a camp of coolies of the Assam-
Burmah Railway Survey, out of thirty-three attacked among the
uninoculated portion of the camp twenty-nine died, and of four
attacked among the inoculated all four died.
   In the Durbhanga prison out of eleven uninoculated attacked all
eleven died, while five inoculated attacked lost three.
   In the Gaya gaol twenty uninoculated attacked lost ten, and eight
inoculated attacked lost five.
   In a group of tea plantations in Assam 154 cases in uninoculated
had sixty deaths, fifteen cases in inoculated had four.
    In the East Lancashire Regiment in Lucknow 120 uninoculated
attacked had 79 deaths, and 18 inoculated attacked had 13.
   This circumstance, the non-reduction of the case mortality by a
treatment which influenced unmistakably the case incidence, appears
an astonishing divergence       from the result of small-pox vaccination,
where both the number of attacks and their fatality are reduced by the
treatment.
   The new aspect of the problem of preventive inoculation which thus
presented itself in these observations on human communities consisted
in the possibility of a prophylactic treatment being directed separately
towards the reduction of the number of attacks, leaving the fatality of
the disease unchecked, and towards the mitigating of the character of
the disease and the reduction of the case mortality in those who get
attacked.
   Possible relation between Immunity from Attack and Hesistnnce   to actual
                              Symptoms of Disease.
   In analysing the nature of this particular result, the following two
facts well known in laboratory practice      presented themselves to me as
of essential significance.
   In patients who recover from an infectious disease the pathogenic
microbe does not disappear from their body for a considerable time
after their recovery.      It does not do them harm any longer, though
when transferred to another animal it may still cause a fatal attack.
Similarly, as in the case, for instance, of a guinea-pig inoculated with
the bacillus of chicken cholera, a naturally immune animal can breed
for weeks, in an abscess, microbes of an intense virulence without in
the least suffering in its own general health.
   A condition seems to set in in the convalescent patient, or to exist in
naturally immune animals, by virtue of which they do not suffer from the
results of activity of a pathogenic microbe, i.e., from its morbid products ;
and from that time the presence of the microbe in the system, even in

                          On Preventive Inoculation.                    257
the tissues, becomes innocuous.       Immunity against morbid symptoms
generated by     the  products  of microbes does not seem to imply neces
sarily the ridding of the system of such microbes.         It is known now,
*ince the discoveries     of Behring and Kitasato, that such a resistance
to these products can be originated artificially, by gradually treating
the system with increasing quantities of toxines. The system reacts by
developing anti-toxines tending to neutralise the effect of the toxines.
    On the other hand, Gamaleia first drew attention to the fact that it
is possible to create in an animal resistance to lethal doses of virulent
 microbes without that animal acquiring any resistance to a dose of the
products prepared from the same microbes in the laboratory.
    One seems justified therefore in considering separately two kinds of
immunity : One against the living microbe, which would prevent it
from entering the system and causing an attack ; and another against
 the fatality of the symptoms of the disease caused by the products of
the microbe when the latter overcomes the initial resistance and does
invade the system.
    In the inoculation against cholera, which is done with the bodies of
 microbes, the first result alone is obtained.
    These   considerations were confirmed by a set of laboratory experi
ments    by Pfeiffer and Kolle, intended to verify our Indian results,
and in the course of which they detected in the serum of men inocu
lated with only one dose of cholera vaccine an extremely high pro
tective power, equal to that which, in goats for instance, could be
created only after a very prolonged treatment, extending over five
or six months, and including injections with gigantic doses of cholera
vaccine.
    On analysing, however, in detail the properties of that serum they
found that it possessed an intense power of destroying the cholera
microbes, but exhibited no antitoxic properties capable of neutralising
the effect of the products of those microbes.
                     The  Plan of Anti-plague Inoculation.
    When, in 1896,    I was confronted with the problem of working out a
prophylactic treatment against the plague,      I  determined to put to test
the ideas originated by the observations on our cholera patients, and to
attempt, in the new preventive inoculation, to obtain at once a lower
ing of the susceptibility to the disease, and a reduction of the case
mortality.
   This I resolved to obtain by treating the system with a combination
of the actual bodies of microbes and of the concentrated products of
their activity.
   In presenting the above considerations, I beg that they may be con
sidered as provisional, subject to modification or to complete refutation.

258                           Dr. W. M. Haffkine.
There may exist already facts unknown to me, which are opposed to
the guesses implied in them.     It was those guesses which led to the
results obtained in the plague inoculation ; but, in giving the reasoning
which I passed through while working out the method, I am yielding
only to a demand expressed to me to that effect, as I considered that
part of my communication       unnecessary ; the more so that the theo
retical conjectures above enumerated are not shared even by very
eminent experimenters, such as Pfeiffer himself, to whose results I owe
some of my premises ; and the correctness of the composition of the
plague prophylactic, with regard to the extracellular toxines which I
have added to      it,
                   the so-called supernatant fluid of the plague prophy
lactic has been the subject of an animated dispute.
   It certain that no theoretical views conceived by one experimenter
       is
are binding, or need even be interesting, to others.   What    obligatory
                                                                   is
is the acceptance of the results obtained.
                              Tlie Plague Prophylactic.
     In order to accumulate      for the plague prophylactic   alarge amount
of extra-cellular toxines,     the bacilli are cultivated on the surface of a
liquid medium where they are suspended by means of drops of clarified
butter or of cocoanut oil.
    The bacilli grow down in long threads into the depth of the liquid,
and produce what         Ihave termed      stalactite growth in broth, an
                                              a
appearance quite peculiar      to this microbe, and which,     hope, will be
                                                               I
accepted as the specific diagnostic feature of this microbe.
    The products of their vital exchange — the toxines — are secreted by
 the stalactites into the liquid and accumulate there.
    The growth     isperiodically shaken off the surface of the broth, after
which   a new    crop appears underneath that surface.
    Thus    a large quantity of the bodies of microbes     collected at the
                                                          is
 bottom of the cultivation vessel, and the liquid itself gets gradually
 permeated with increasing quantities of toxines.
    The process    iscontinued for period of five to six weeks, at the end
                                          a
of which the bodies of the microbes become extremely deteriorated.
   It will be seen from this that, in my eagerness to put to test our ability
to influence the case mortality       may have, perhaps, paid less atten
                                          I
tion than    I might  have  done  to the  problem of reducing the number
of attacks; and    I have now sketched out        simple plan whereby to
                                                   a
test this  circumstance,  and  to  try  to  improve our results from this
point  of view.
   In order to render harmless the inoculation of the virus above
described,  I    determined   to   kill
                                     the microbes by heating the material up
to 65 to70° C.          The virus so treated, differing from what  observed
                                                                    is
in some other instances, loses at once, for the animals susceptible to the

                          On Preventive Inoculation.                     259
disease,   almost  all its pathogenic power; and it was a question to
determine, whether it contained the qualities that were sought for,
viz., the power of creating in man a useful degree of resistance to
plague.
    The plan has been contested by a number of experimenters who tried
a material similarly prepared on different animals and failed to detect
in it any immunising properties.
    Among other forms of plague virus which were tested by us, and by
other experimenters, a large number were found to be too dangerous
to use ; in other instances the mode of application was inadmissible in
the case of men ; in others, again, the effect appeared too transient to
be of practical use.
                   The Properties of the Pkigue Prophykictic.
    The immunising effect of the plague prophylactic, as above described,
was worked out on domestic rabbits, and its actual efficiency was
verified and confirmed by a number of investigators who experi
mented on the infection with virulent plague of protected and unpro
tected rabbits.
    Comparing the rabbit with other laboratory animals, such as the rat,
the guinea pig, the mouse, the monkey, one may consider the rabbit as
the one that perhaps required the least amount of protection, as its
natural resistance to plague is relatively high. The most altered virus,
i.e., such as was rendered the most harmless of all, was found to confer on
the rabbit a very considerable degree of immunity, enabling it in a few
days to resist ten or fifteen-fold lethal doses of virulent plague microbes.
The same treatment applied to animals of a more susceptible nature
would, on the contrary, in many instances fail.
    The Questions whi<h were  to be solreil by Experiments on Human Beings.
    At  the end of our laboratory experiments a set of questions stood
before   us that were to be solved by direct experiment on human
beings.    Those questions were : —
    1. Would man behave with regard to the prophylactic like the
animals upon which its protective power had been worked out t
    2. If it so happens that the answer is affirmative, what would the
dose of the prophylactic, and the method of administering it 1x3 ; and
would not the dose required be so high, and the reaction to be pro
duced so severe, or the number of inoculations to 1x3 repeated so great,
as to render the treatment inapplicable to men, or impracticable 1
    3. How many days counting from the date of inoculation would it
take to produce in man a useful degree of immunity 1
    4. How long would that immunity last 1

260                        Dr. W. M. Haffkine.
    And lastly, there followed two questions, to which my experience
of the anti-cholera inoculation entitled me to give a reassuring answer,
but the correctness of which it was necessary to demonstrate afresh in
the case of plague, viz. :
    5. During the period of reactionary fever and all the other symptoms
produced by inoculation, will the resistance of the inoculated exposed
to plague be, for the time being, reduced, or remain the same, or be
increased 1 i.e., would it constitute a danger to apply the inoculation
in localities actually affected with plague 1 and
    6. When a man who happens to be incubating the plague, or to have
initial symptoms of the disease already, chances to be inoculated,
would it aggravate his condition, of have no effect, or on the contrary,
help him 1
             Demonstration of the Harmlesmess of tlie Treatment.
    The perfect harmlessness of the inoculation was first of all demon
strated by the officers of the Laboratory, the Principal and Professors
of the Grant Medical College, a large number of leading European and
native gentlemen of Bombay, and their families and households, being
inoculated.    And then, in the last week of January, 1897, when the
plague broke out in Her Majesty's House of Correction at Byculla,
in Bombay, the option of inoculation was offered to the prisoners.
    The Experiment  in Her Majesty's Byculla House of  Correction, Bombay.
    The Byculla House of Correction is a long-term prison. There are
no children, nor very young people among the inmates, there being in
 Bombay a separate establishment, the Sassoon Reformatory, where
minor criminals are sent.
    The prisoners of the House of Correction present a well-fed, well
clad, regularly worked, and almost as uniform a set of people as can be
seen in a regiment, amongst whom one could scarcely see a single
infirm or very caged individual.
    At  the appearance of plague the prisoners numbered 346 souls.
    The inoculation was introduced after nine cases of plague had
already occurred, five subsequently ending fatally; there remained
thus 337 individuals to be dealt with.         Of these, 154 only volun
 teered for inoculation, and 183 remained uninoculated.
    On the 30th January, in the forenoon, before the inoculation was
applied, six more cases occurred, of which three afterwards proved
fatal. The inoculation was applied in the afternoon, and afterwards
 it was discovered that one more prisoner had already a bubo on him
 when inoculated, while two prisoners developed buboes the same evening
 after their inoculation. These three cases, attacked on the day of
 inoculation, proved also fatal.

     After that, the difference which was observed in the fate of the two
 groups, the inoculated and uninoculated, is                  seen    from the subjoined

    * During    the time under observation the number of uninoculated was reduced
on the second, fifth, and sixth day after inoculation by three, one, and one dis
charged prisoners, whoso terms of confinement expired on those days ; and it was
increased on the third and seventh day by two and two prisoners newly admitted
into the jail. The number of inoculated was reduced on the third day after inocu
lation by four released prisoners.
   No information as to the subsequent history of these few released (uninoculated
liml inoculated) prisoners reached the authorities or the officers of the Laboratory,
but the question had no interest for the experiment, since their conditions of life
and their exposure to plague ceased to be comparable from the time the prisoners
were discharged into a large city, with various chances of infection, different in its
different quarters.       The observations referred only to the prisoners who remained
exposed to plague     under  the conditions of the jail.

262                              Dr. W. M. Haffkine.
    With the exception of the fourth day, cases of plague continued to
occur among the uninoculated group for seven days after inoculation,
their average daily strength throughout the week being 173; altogether
twelve cases occurred among them with six deaths ; while in the 148
inoculated there was one case on the next day after inoculation, who
rapidly recovered, and one on the last day of the epidemic, who
recovered also.
              Analysis of    the Hesults  of the  Bymlla   Jail  Experiment.
    A    glance at the above table will show the progress which was made
in    our information by that initial experiment, and how far it carried
 us ahead from the state of uncertainty which surrounded the question
originally.
    The dose of prophylactic administered to the prisoners was 3 c.c.
     They all had the customary attack of fever from the operation, with
the discomfort accompanying               that condition, — a headache in many
cases, nausea, loss of appetite for a couple of days, a feeling of fatigue
and lassitude, recalling a mild attack of influenza, with swelling and
 pain in the inoculated side.           Did, however, all this make them more
susceptible to the disease than were their non-inoculated fellow inmates 1
 It is certain that the results testify unmistakably to an opposite
 effect.
    Further, the incubation period in plague appears to be on the average
five days, extending, however, not unfrequently up to ten.
    As to the few newly admitted (uninoculated)       prisoners mentioned above, none
 •were   subsequently attacked, and the cases of plague stated in the table refer all to
 old residents, who wore present in the jail on the day, and long before the day, of
 inoculation.     Had a case of plague occurred in any of the uninoculated new
 comers, it would not have been included in the comparison with the occurrences
 among the inoculated inmates, since such new-comer had been exposed outside the
 jail  to conditions of infection other than those which existed inside the jail.   Not
 withstanding     this, it was  permitted  that  the number   of  the uninoculated  new
 comers should be added by the jail authorities to the strength of the uninoculated
 as quoted in the table, since this tended to weaken, and not to exaggerate, the pro
 portion of immunity obtained by inoculation.
    In a similar way, in the outbreak of plague in the second (Umerkadi) Bombay
 jail, described below, one of the three attacks among inoculated persons, as reported
 by the jail authorities, namely in a man named Sital Vary, prisoner No. 7542.
 occurred    after he had been set at liberty in the city.   Had it been an attack in an
 uninoculated perron, it would not have been admitted into the comparison with the
 inoculated, for the reason mentioned above, i.e., because the conditions of infection
 outside the jail were not comparable with those in the jail. But as this was a case
 in an inoculated subject, and tended to present the results in a less favourable light,
 it was included in the record.
    Every prisoner attacked with plague and taken away to the isolation or plague
 hospital was excluded on the subsequent day from the strength of those who
 remained in the jail and were still liable to an attack.

                        On Preventive Inoculation.                    263
   Of the twelve prisoners in the unmodulated group who developed
plague during the next few days after the date of inoculation a large
proportion, if not all, must have been already incubating the disease
on that day ; and seeing the perfect similarity of conditions under
which the inoculated and the uninoculated, who belonged to the same
crowd of people, were living, one could infer safely that a similar group
of individuals incubating plague was present among the inoculated
also at the time when the inoculation was performed on them.
   The inoculation, however, did not aggravate their condition, as the
number of inoculated who developed plague, counting from the first
twelve hours of inoculation, was proportionately five times smaller
than the corresponding number among the uninoculated ; and the two
cases that appeared among the inoculated, one on the very next morning
after inoculation, both ended in recovery.
   As far as that first experiment went, therefore, men behaved like the
laboratory animals upon "which the prophylactic properties of the drug
had been worked out.
   For communicating that protection one injection of prophylactic
appeared sufficient, with a dose of 3 c.c., which dose, however, in our
subsequent operations was further reduced to 2£ c.c.
   The difference in favour of the inoculated appeared within some
twelve hours after the operation ; but the man who was inoculated with
plague on him, and the two who developed clear symptoms of plague
the same evening, did not benefit by the operation.
   This completed the first information gathered with regard to five of
the six questions enumerated above.       No answer could be given us to
the final duration of the effect of inoculation, except that the operation
appeared to be useful in a localised already existing epidemic, extending
over seven days.
          The Experiment in the Umcrhuli Common-     Jail, Bombay.
   In the next  case the strictness  of the conditions of the last experi
ment was enhanced further.       This was in the second Bombay jail, the
 Umerkadi Common Jail.
   The plague broke out there at the end of December, 1897, and by
the 1st of January three prisoners were attacked and all of them sub
sequently died.
   In the interval between the operations in the two jails, some 8000
people in the free population of Bombay had already availed them
selves of the inoculation.
   This time the whole of the prisoners, numbering 401, appeared willing
to undergo the preventive treatment.       In view of the novelty of the
operation, however, and of our responsibilities before the government
and the public, and the necessity of demonstrating clearly the effect of

 264                         Dr. W. M. Haffkine.
inoculation, the prisoners were not allowed to undergo the treatment
in a body, and it was resolved that only one half of them should be
permitted to do so.
    The manner in which that half was selected guaranteed the elimina
tion of all possible errors usually inherent to observations on human
 communities.
    The population of a jail in India is gathered into several groups,
the largest being the ordinary convicts divided into simple prisoners
and hard labour convicts; then there is a group of civil prisoners,
debtors ; a group of under-trial prisoners, of convict; warders, of cooks,
 Lakers, men employed in the infirmary, 'fec. ; and a separate group of
female prisoners.
    On the morning of the 1st of        January, 1898, in the presence of
 Major   Collie,  I.M.S.,  and  Dr.  Leon,   medical officers, Mr. Mackenzie,
 the superintendent, and of all the officials of the jail, the above groups
 were brought one after the other into the jail-yard, and asked to seat
 themselves in rows; and after all were seated, every second man
without further distinction was inoculated, excepting two of them, who
did not volunteer for the treatment.
    From this moment the even numbers, the inoculated, were left to live
 with the uninoculated, under conditions identical with those under
 which they were living before.        They had the same food and drink,
 the same hours of work and of rest, shared with them the same
 yards and buildings, Ac.
    In this case fatal attacks continued to occur in the jail for thirty
days, during which time an almost equal number of prisoners, inocu
lated and uninoculated, were discharged from jail, and thus excluded
from further observation.
    The average daily strength of the uninoculated who remained in the
 jail up to the end exposed to the plague was 127 ; and of the inocu
lated, 147.
    In the smaller uninoculated     number,    ten cases  of plague occurred,
six of them proving fatal ; while the larger inoculated number pro
duced three cases, of whom all recovered.
    In these three  cases, however,  in the inoculated, the character of the
disease was so much mitigated that the authorities of the Government
hospital at Parel, Bombay, where they were sent, hesitated to return
them as plague, and the Director-General of the Indian Medical Service,
who examined two of them, diagnosed them as mumps.                 They were
returned as cases of plague in order that no possibility of error in
favour of the inoculation should be admitted.
                     The Experiment   in the  Dharwar  Jail.
    On the third and last occasion, when the plague broke out in a jail,
the    authorities did not feel justified in withholding the inoculation

                        On Preventive Inoculation.                       265
from any of the inmates, and all were permitted to be inoculated.
This was in Dharwar, at the end of October and the beginning of
November, 1898, during the terrible outbreak of plague in that town
and district, the news of which must have reached you even here.
   Five cases of plague, of which one was imported, and four in old
residents of the jail, occurred, all five ending fatally.
   The prisoners, then numbering 373, submitted in a body to inocula
tion, and only one case followed, in a man attacked two days after
inoculation, and he recovered, the only one of the six.
              The Experiment of Undhera, in a Free Population.
    The most carefully planned    out and precise demonstration of the
working of the prophylactic system among          a free population, exposed
to a great amount of infection, was that made in the village of
Undhera, six miles from Baroda.
    The following was the mode of operation adopted : —
    A detailed census was made by the authorities of all the inhabitants
of the place, and on the 12th February, 1898, when a committee of
British and native officers arrived to carry out the inoculation, the
people were paraded in the streets, in four wards, family by family.
    Major Bannerman, I. M.S., of the Madras Medical Establishment,
and myself, accompanied by the Baroda officials, went from one house
hold to another, and, within each, inoculated half the number of the
male members, half that of the females, and half that of the children,
compensating for odd figures that happened to be in one family by odd
figures in another.     I, personally, and the officers who were with me,
directed special attention to distributing the few sick in the two groups
of inoculated and uninoculated as equally as our judgment permitted
us to do.
    The plague, which had carried off, before inoculation, seventy-nine
•victims, continued afterwards in this instance for forty-two days and
appeared in twenty-eight families, in which the aggregate number of
uninoculated was sixty-four, and of inoculated seventy-one.
    The total number of attacks in those families was thirty-five, and
they were distributed as follows : —
             The 64 uninoculated had    27 cases  with  26 deaths ;
             The 71 inoculated      „    8      „        3    „   ,
thus showing 89'65 percent, of deaths fewer in the inoculated members
of the families than in the uninoculated.
    There were no deaths from other causes in the inoculated of the
village, while among the uninoculated there were three deaths attri
buted to causes other than plague.
    The subjoined figures show the number of days which elapsed

   •266                       Dr. W. M. Haffkinc.
  between the date of inoculation and the occurrence         of a death from
  plague in the families.    The first row of figures refers to occurrences in
  uninoculated members, the second to occurrences in inoculated, while
  the small figures show the number of deaths which occurred in each
  group on those days : —
      Deaths from plague occurred in uninoculated —
  33   41 58 72 83—10' 11s i2i           151 16i 19i 201 21i 241   321 an<l 42ir
  and    in inoculated
                  91        12i and  141
                                              days after date of inoculation.
      There had elapsed therefore eight days, during which eleven deaths
  from plague occurred among the uninoculated members of the families,
  before the first death took place in an inoculated case.        The inocula
  tion has again acted, so to say, immediately ; or, to use the mode of
  expression which we have adopted, has exercised its protective effect
  within the time necessary for the subsidence of the general reactionary
  symptoms produced by the inoculation.
     The investigation in this village was carried out by Surgeon-General
  Harvey, the Director-General of the Indian Medical Service, and a
 committee of British and native officials.      Every member of the family
 who survived was seen, his particulars verified from the documents,
-and every detail was confirmed from the registers kept at the time,
 and from the testimony of the whole of the villagers, who were present
 throughout the inquiry.
          Experiments on a Large Scale.   Average of  the Results obtained.
  •
     I  have dwelt so long upon the description of the above experiments
 not because they were the largest in volume or the most striking
 which were made, but because they were the most precise of all, and,
 so far as I am aware, free from any possible loophole of mistake.
     I  made prolonged and detailed observations in very severely affected
 communities of Lanowlie, in a population of 700 people, and among the
 followers of the artillery at Kirkee, numbering at the time 1530. Very
 complete data were collected by Professor Robert Koch and Professor
 Gaffky, of the German Government Plague Commission, by Major
 Lyons, I. M.S., of the Bombay Medical Establishment, and by myself,
 in the Portuguese colony of Damaon, in a population of 8230 indivi
duals, during a frightful outbreak of plague there, which lasted more
than four months, in 1897. A minute investigation extending over
four months, was made by me in the Khoja Mussulman community of
Bombay, numbering some 12,000 people, where about half of the total
number were inoculated under the auspices of His Highness the Aga
Khan. A most comprehensive inoculation campaign, and with widely

                         On Preventive Inoculation.                      267
  reaching and most satisfactory results, was carried out, under Mr.
 Cappel, late Collector of Dharwar, by Captain Leumann, I.M.S., Dr.
 (Miss) Corthorn, Dr. Hornabrook, Dr. Foy, Dr. Chenai, and others, in
 three adjacent small towns of Hubli, Dharwar, and Gadag, where
 80,000 people were inoculated.        The latter was the most magnificent
 piece of work done, from the point of view of practical application of
 the method, and of the testing of its general efficiency.
     With the extension of the number of inoculated the exactitude and
 precision of observation certainly suffer. A number of questions and
 objections arise with regard to points of detail, which it is not always
 possible to answer with certainty.          Such wholesale observations are,
 however, required to enable us to judge whether the application of the
 method as a general measure answers to the expectations formed;
 whereas the exact extent of the results is only to be gathered from
 mathematically precise experiments, imitating the conditions of labora
 tory practice, such as were those which I have detailed above.
     The difference in the mortality from plague in inoculated and unin-
 oculated sections of communities was estimated to average over 80 per
 cent., approaching often 90, as was the case in Undhera described
 above. The lowest proportion ever observed in the experiments which
 I made personally was 77'9 per cent. ; this was at Kirkee.
                          Hffect on the Case Mortality.
    A  very accurate set of data were collected in almost all the larger
 hospitals where inoculated plague cases were admitted, upon the fatality
of the disease in inoculated.         These were to the effect that the case
mortality among them was some 50 per cent, lower than among
uninoculated plague cases.       A number of documents on this point has
been collected by the Indian Plague Commission and will, I trust,
appear in their records.
          Minimum Duration of     the  Effect of the Plague InocuMion.
    As to the duration of the effect of the plague inoculation, the only
statement which can be made for the present is that it lasts at least for
the duration of one epidemic, which, on the average, extends over
four to six months of the year.
    The Government of India have recognised the inoculation certifi
cates, entitling the holder to exemption from plague rules, as being
valid for a period of six months ; on the understanding that if accurate
data are forthcoming as to the effect lasting longer, the holders
will be permitted to renew their certificates for another period, without
being reinoculated.

  The further Problems pursued in    the Bombay Plague Research Laboratory.
    The task which lies now before the Plague Laboratory in connection
with prophylactic inoculation comprises the following problems : —
    The perfecting of processes for turning out large and uniform quan
      tities of material, and avoiding the variations due to the character
      of the plague microbe, and to the differences in the composition of
      the cultivation media ;
    The further investigation of the different constituents of the plague
      prophylactic, with a view of intensifying those which produce
      definite and beneficial results ;
    The possible mitigation of the reactionary symptoms after inocula
      tion j and
    The study of the effect of antiseptics used for preserving the prophy
      lactic ;
while the most important general problems concerning plague relate to
the study of the curative treatment and to the life-history of the
plague microbes in nature.
                            The Typhoid Ino<ulation.
    The inoculations against cholera and plague, which are the outcome
of the work of Jenner, Pasteur, and Koch, and their admirable succes
sion of pupils, contain in their turn a promise of development and
success,   which, I trust, will be only enhanced at every subsequent
step, and which, it seems to me, already warrants the application of
the same kind of effort to other diseases and epidemics.
    In this order of ideas permit me to enter a plea in favour of a
new inoculation campaign, which has been inaugurated already, and
which I hope will be carried out successfully, for the benefit of a large
number of soldiers of this country residing in India, and of white men
in general in all tropical countries.
    The problem of typhoid inoculation has quite a special interest for
 Europeans, as much as cholera has for the natives of India.          Typhoid
proved    to be a more  difficult disease  to eradicate from military  canton
 ments than cholera.     It is possible that the explanation of this lies in
 what is already known of the character of the microbes of these
 diseases.
    The typhoid bacillus when subjected to different chemical and physical
 agents, such as acids or antiseptics, or a high temperature, or desicca
 tion, or the admixture of other microbes, appears far more resistant
 than the cholera microbe.
    Such a character would ensure for the typhoid bacillus an existence
 in more varied media, under more various climates, and a greater inde

                            Oil Preventive Inoculation.                  269
  pendcnce from seasonal or local changes, than is the case with the cholera
 microbe.
     Outside the endemic area cholera remains in one and the same place
 but for a few weeks, and in any given part of a town often for a few
 days only. It is rare that it visits the same barrack more than once in
 five, sometimes     ten years, and when it occurs, a temporary evacuation
 of the place puts a stop to the disease.
     The typhoid virus, on the contrary, sticks to an infected locality for
 years, and causes a continuous incidence of the disease for which occa
 sionally nothing short of a complete desertion of the station is
 effective.
     At  the same time, while the cholera       infection seems to be almost
 exclusively confined to the water supply, in typhoid the improvement
 of the water appears to leave intact a large number of other sources of
 danger which up to the present have escaped detection.
     While thus differing in their life-history in nature, the bacilli of
 cholera and typhoid present important common features in the manner
 in which they behave in the human and animal body.
     The chief centre of infection in both instances is the intestinal canal,
 the circulatory system remaining free from invasion.       When inoculated
 into animals, both microbes admit of the same kind of transformation
 by passages from animal to animal ; and against both immunity can
be created in laboratory animals by the same preparation of virus as
used in the inoculations for cholera ; while, when examining the tissues
 of immunised animals, the same modifications are detected in them as
 those observed after the anti-cholera inoculation.
    These considerations have led us to expect from the typhoid inocula
 tion in man a similar protective effect to that observed in the inocula
 tion against cholera ; and seeing that the period of life during which the
 newcomers to India remain susceptible to typhoid extends only over a
few years, it would seem that the application of the system, when
properly organised, is likely to prove of a very high practical value.
                   Inoculation and General Sanitary Measures.
    The anti-cholera inoculation, the inoculation against plague, and that
against typhoid thus came to put themselves on the same line as
vaccination, and represent attempts at dealing with epidemics on a
plan differing from measures of general sanitation. During the last
few years the question has, therefore, been frequently debated as to
the relation in which the two stand to each other.
    It is scarcely necessary to say that inoculation cannot be substituted
for a good water supply, the draining, cleansing, or improvements in
the building of cities, or for the admission of a larger amount of light
and air into over-crowded localities, for all those measures to which the
                                                                 x  2

nations owe the marked       improvement     in health which has taken place
during the present century.
   Only, injustice would be done to the sanitarian by calling him in
when a patient lies already on his sick-bed, or when an epidemic
actually breaks out in a community, and by asking him to stay the
sickness, or the epidemic, to improve the health of the population, so to
say, while you wait.
   To be dealt with, epidemics, like individual diseases, require specifics,
promptly administrable remedies, and measures of general sanitation
can be no more advised for arresting a sharp outbreak of cholera or
plague than an individual patient be directed to build for himself a new
house, or to dry up the marshy lands or to cut down the jungle round
his habitation when he requires a dose of quinine to arrest an attack
of ague.                         .
   The part of vaccination      and  of preventive inoculation in combating
epidemics stands in the same relation to general sanitary measures as
therapeutics and the art of the healing physician stand to domestic
hygiene and sanitation.       It is certain that neither of these can ever be
substituted for the other.
               Inoculation and tlrf Segregation-Disinfection Method.
   A   comparison of another kind now very actively discussed is that
between the methods of combating epidemics by separation of sick and
healthy, and disinfection, on the one hand, and by preventive inocula
tion of the people, on the other.
   From this point of view the following distinction between infectious
diseases is to be made : —
   When wo take some affected tissue from a leper, or a pustule from a
small-pox patient, or virulent saliva from a rabid animal, or some
syphilitic matter, and throw it into milk, broth, or any organic sub
stance such as is to be found in the ordinary surroundings of men,
it produces no modification in the medium, and in the course of time
loses its infective properties and dies out.         When, on the other hand,
 we repeat the experiment with cholera, or plague, or typhoid products,
instead of dying out, the contagion begins to grow and multiply,
spreads in the medium and soon transforms the whole of it into one
 mass of infectious matter.
    It is evident that such a distinction — the strictly parasitic nature
 of one microbe and the capacity of the other to lead both a parasitic
and saprophytic life — must influence most directly the ways in which
these diseases spread and assume epidemic forms, and also the measures
 which are likely to be effective in combating them.
    In  the first instance the infection must remain        confined entirely, or
 almost so, to the body of the patient, and the disease can be propagated

                            On Preventive     Inoculation.                         271
    only directly from individual to individual, or by means of their im
    mediate belongings.   It is the inability of a virus to grow in lifeless
    nature that communicates to that disease a strictly contagious cha
    racter.
,      In the second    case, provided the surrounding conditions be favour
    able to     the virus will spread widely around the original focus, and
              it,
    the sources from which infection reaches fresh individuals will grow in
    number rapidly.
       From the point of view of preventive measures, therefore, in diseases
    like rabies, or syphilis, or small-pox, or leprosy, where infection    to be
                                                                              is
    found in the patient alone, precautions of isolation taken with regard
    to the sick and their immediate surroundings, must affect directly the
    prevalence and propagation of the disease whereas in typhoid, cholera,
                                                       ;
    or plague, where the patient     isonly one, and proportionately    limited,
                                                                          a
    source of danger, his isolation, and the destruction of his belongings,
    leaves unaffected the vast cultivations of infection which are going on
    in nature besides. Measures taken for circumscribing the prevalence
    of an epidemic by isolating and destroying the foci of infection are less
    likely to succeed in this category of diseases attempts at eradicating
                                                           ;
    an epidemic or at protecting individuals by ways which appear effec
    tive in merely contagious diseases will be in this case easily eluded            ;
    and the necessity of personal protection by means of          prophylactic
                                                                    a
    treatment will soon be urgently felt and acknowledged.

"   A     Preliminary Note on the Morphology and Distribution of the
           Organism found in the Tsetse Fly Disease."      By H. G.
           PLIMMER and J. ROSE BRADFORD, F.R.S., Professor Super
          intendent of the Brown Institution.  Received June 12, —

                    (From the Laboratory of the Brown Institution.)
                     are the result of an inquiry entrusted to us by
     These observations
the Tsetse Fly Committee of the Royal Society, at a meeting of the
Committee on March 16, 1899.
   The material for our investigations was obtained in the first place
from a dog and a rat, inoculated with the blood of a dog suffering
from the disease, by Mr. H. E. Durham, at Cambridge.
   The organism found in the Tsetse Fly disease was discovered by
Major Bruce, R.A.M.C., F.R.S., and was classed by him as a Trypano-
soma.      These belong to the order Flagellata, and, according to
Biitschli, to the sub-group Monadina.
   We will, in the first place, describe the adult form of the organism,
such as is met with most frequently in the blood of a susceptible animal
affected with the disease.
              A. Description of       the   Adult Form of   the   Trypanosoma.
     In freshly drawn blood            examinedhanging drop, or as a very
                                                   as a
thin layer in a cell, the adult form of the Trypanosoma can be easily
studied.    The latter method is the better, as the organism can be
better seen and more accurately examined, in the thin, uniform layer
of fluid than in the rounded drop.      The easiest method of examining
the blood in this way is to make, with a red-hot platinum loop and a
small piece of paraffin, a thin ring of paraffin on an ordinary glass
slide ; the drop of blood is placed in the centre of the ring and a
cover-glass placed on           it,
                          the thin layer of paraffin preventing pressure.
If    be desired to keep the blood for continuous examination,
     it                                                            should        it
be drawn into       graduated
                     a         Pasteur pipette,  and one-tenth  part of
         cent, solution of sodium citrate should be drawn up after                    it, a
5   per
then the blood and citrate solution should be carefully mixed in the
bulb the tube should then be sealed up, and drops can be taken from
        ;
it   as desired.
   Under ordinary conditions of illumination the Trypanosoma, as seen
in the blood, appears to consist of       uniform, homogeneous mass of
                                                  a
protoplasm,    of worm-like form, with at one end   thick, stiff extremity,
                                                                  a
and at the other       long, wavy flagellum.
                         is a

motion,  and    this  seen to be caused by the rapid lashing movement
of the flagellum, and by the rapid contractions and relaxations of the

             On the Organism     found in the Tsetse Fly Disease.                  275
mass of protoplasm forming the body, and by the movements of an
undulating membrane which is attached to one surface of the body,
and which appears to undulate synchronously with the contractions of
the protoplasmic body. This membrane                     is,
                                          excepting at the free edge,
very transparent, and can be seen much better in citrated blood which
has been thickened by the addition of a small drop of            per cent,   1
gelatine solution, when its contour and attachments can be much
better made out, owing to the slower rate of vibration effected by the
thickened medium.
   The general shape of the Trypanosoma, when rendered quiescent by
this means but not killed,    that of
                                is        long oval, with one end blunt
                                                a
and the other continued into the flagellum    the membrane
                                                         ;      then seen    is
to be attached to one side of the body         begins;  little in front of
                                                         it         a
the blunt end of the organism, and        continued at the end into the
                                                is
flagellum.
    But with better illumination, such as            a very oblique pencil of rays,
or, better still, with monochromatic light (green or blue), the proto
plasm   is seen not to be homogeneous.             The organism appears then as
a  highly refractive body, and near the middle, or between                   and the
                                                                              it
flagellate  end, is   seena   large  dark    body  much   more   refractive than  the
rest of the protoplasm; this          is    the macronucleus.       Near the thick,
stiff end   of   the  body a    tiny  still   more refractive body (with mono
chromatic light nearly black)        is  seen, which       the micronucleus.
                                                               is                The
addition of a drop of    5    per  cent,  acetic acid makes both of these bodies
much more distinct.        At the stiff end of the Trypanosoma, in varying
relation to the micronucleus,        is seena    vacuole.   There      no suggestion
                                                                        is
of  a mouth    or  of any organs,    but   the protoplasm    with   the most careful
illumination appears not to be uniform, which suggests an alveolar
structure, as described by Biitschli.           With the ordinary simple stains
(haematoxylin,      fuchsin,   methylene-blue,      thionin) the differentiation    is
not much better than can be observed by careful illumination of living
unstained organisms, as these stains are with these, and similar
organisms, too diffuse to be of any service.                 Acting on a method
which Ehrlich originated in 1889, and which Romanowsky modified in
 1891, and which has still been further elaborated by Ziemann in 1898,
we have used     a    mixture of methylene-blue and erythrosin, which has
enabled    us   to  follow   the different stages of the Trypanosoma with
certainty. This method depends on the fact that when                    basic and an
                                                                         a
acid stain are mixed together in certain proportions,                  third neutral
                                                                        a
body    is formed,     which   hasa    specific   colour  reaction   with chromatin.
By the use of this method we have been able to trace the various
stages of the organism in the blood and organs of the affected animals,
which   is  not possible with the ordinary stains, these being useless for
many of the forms to be presently described.                 With this method the
macronucleus of the Trypanosoma            is  stained clear, transparent, crim
                                                               a

 son lake, the micronucleus      a deep red, and the protoplasm a delicate
 blue; these reactions      are constant throughout all the stages of its
 life-history.
     The protoplasm of the adult Trypanosoma does not stain uniformly,
 as does that of some of the other forms, but there are parts faintly
 stained and parts unstained which is again in favour of the alveolar
 structure mentioned above. The vacuole is quite distinct as a clear
 round space, when the organism is stained by this method.
     The macronucleus is generally of an oval or elongated shape, and it
 may be either unform in colour, or in the form of fine threads ; this
 latter is seen especially in those forms which show other signs of division.
 The micronucleus is seen as an intensely stained round dot, or as a short
 rod, this latter form again being seen in those'forms which show other
 signs of approaching division.       With the highest powers (l-5 apochro-
 matic objective and 18 compensating eyepiece of Zeiss) we have not been
 able to make out any special structural characters in this body.         The
 flagellum is not stained by this method, but if the preparation has
 been well fixed, it is easily visible; the vibratile membrane also is
 unstained, and can be generally better studied in specimens stained by
 simple stains, preferably thionin.
    As regards the movements of the organism, in preparations where no
 pressure is exercised, they can be seen moving either with the flagellum
 or with the blunt end in front ; but we think that the commoner mode
 of progression is with the flagellum forward.
    The size and length of the body varies very much with the period of
 the disease at which the blood is examined, and with the kind of animal.
 The largest forms we have seen have been in rat's blood, just after death,
and the smallest in rabbit's blood, early in the disease.
                      B. Distribution of  the Trypanosonui.
    1.  In the body of Normal Animals.
                      —
    (a) In the Blood. -We have found       the flagellate form in the greatest
numbers      in the blood of the mouse, towards the end of the disease.
In the rat also they occur in great numbers, and in both these animals
they can be found in the blood on the fourth or fifth day.         In the dog
large numbers can be seen in the blood from the sixth day.             In the
cat they are fewer in number in the same lapse of time than in any of
the animals before mentioned.
    The rabbit   seems to be the most   refractory animal of any we have as
yet used, and the Trypanosoma are found in the blood in small num
bers only, and at very uncertain intervals.
    (4)  In the Lymphatic, Glands. — In the superficial glands nearest to the
point of inoculation the flagellate organism can be found earliest.         In
the rat the Trypanosoma can be found in the nearest superficial gland

               On the Organism        foimd in the     Tsetse   Fly   Disease.        277
in twenty-four hours after inoculation. We have not found that
generalisation of the organism in the lymphatic glands occurs until
nearly the end of the disease, when the organism is present in very
large numbers in the blood.   In the rabbit, in which the organisms are
few or rare in the blood, the glands do not show any marked change,
and the Trypanosoma are not readily found in them.          Many other
forms are found in the glands, to which reference         will be made
below.
   (c)   In    the Spleen. — The
                           adult Trypanosoma       found in but small
                                                                is
numbers in the spleens of the various animals  we have  examined     but         ;
other forms are found there which will be described later.      The en
largement of the spleen     post mortem the most obvious fact in the
                                 is
morbid anatomy of the disease      may attain even to four or five times
                                         ;   it
the average volume — this    especially the case in the rat.
                                   is
   (d) In the Bone-marrow. —  We have found either very few flagellate
organisms or none at all, in the bone-marrow of the various animals we
have worked with.      The marrow        altered in colour and structure,
                                                  is
but there does not seem to be a greater number of Trypanosoma than
can be accounted for by the blood in the marrow.
   In the other organs and parts the number of organisms present
depends upon the relative quantity of blood in the part.
   2. In the Body    Spleenless Animals. — As the spleen in the ordinary
                       of
animals      the organ which
              is                  most obviously altered in this disease,
                                        is
we have made a series of inoculations into animals (dog, cat, and
rabbit) from which the spleen had been removed       year ago. In the
                                                                 a
dog, the  adult forms of the Trypanosoma   are not found so early in the
blood of spleenless as in that of ordinary animals (seventh day as com
pared with fourth day after inoculation).      The glands, after death,
are much more generally enlarged, and are reddish in colour, and con
tain many more organisms than in the normal animal. Both the blood
and glands contain, however, numerous other forms to be described
below.
   This marked difference in the colour of the glands of spleenless
animals   isprobably due to the removal of the spleen, and the glands
consequently taking on some of the splenic functions.               •
   The bone-marrow      much altered, and in
                            is                   likewise are found
                                                            it                          a
large number of Trypanosoma both flagellate and what are termed
                                             :
below " amoeboid
                   "
                     forms.
   In the cat the conditions of experiment were altered, the blood c.c.)         (1
from the infected animal being introduced, with every precaution to
avoid contamination of the tissues, direct into the jugular vein.    In
this case the organism appeared in the blood in numbers on the fourth
day, and the animal died on the twelfth day. As the Trypanosoma
were introduced into the blood stream direct, there was no marked
glandular enlargement, but the glands were all reddish in colour, the

change in colour being due to the spleenectomy. A few adult organisms
were found in the glands and in the bone-marrow.
    In the spleenless rabbit a few Trypanosoma have been found in the
blood on two occasions, but the animal lived nearly two months, and
notwithstanding the failure to detect adult flagellate forms in the
blood on numerous occasions, the blood was always infective, and con
                                                 "
tained numerous forms termed " amoeboid and " plasmodial below.
                                                                    "
                                C. Infectivity.
    (a) In Ordinary Animals.
                              — The blood and organs of an animal dead
of the disease lose, before twenty-four hours after death, their infective
power.      This is apparently due to the rapidity with which decomposi
tion sets in after death, as we have found living Trypanosoma in film
preparations, made as described above, as long as five to six days after
removal of the blood from the body; and we have also found that
large    quantities (200 c.c.) of blood removed from the body into a
sterile vessel and kept in an atmosphere of oxygen, retain their virulence
for at least three days, notwithstanding the fact that the flagellate form
cannot be demonstrated.
    We have found that the blood of the dog is infective at least two
days before any adult Trypanosoma can be seen in the blood ; and we
have also found that the blood of the spleenless rabbit, in which we
have only on two occasions seen any adult forms, is invariably infec
tive.    This of course suggests the idea that the organisms must be
present in another form, and we have been able, by the use of the
method of staining described above, to demonstrate the presence of
other forms in the blood and organs, and have shown, by the experi
ments just mentioned, that the infectivity of the blood, in cases where
there are no flagellate forms discoverable, depends in all probability
upon the presence of one of the other forms which the Trypanosoma
assumes.
    Although a differential staining method, such      as  the one we have
used, is necessary for following and demonstrating the various stages
of the life-history of the Trypanosoma, still these stages can be seen in
unstained living specimens, with very careful illumination.            As a
matter of fact, our first observation of them was in unstained prepara
tions.
     In the blood of the dog, cat, rabbit, rat, and mouse, besides the adult
forms as described above, which, as mentioned, are very various in
size,   there are adult forms    undergoing division,     both longitudinal,
and transverse, to which reference will be made later.             Also two
organisms are sometimes seen       with  their micronuclei in close apposi
 tion, or fused together, with more or less of their bodies also
 merged together. Such forms we believe are conjugations. Again, there
 are other large forms, with or without a flagellum, in which the chro

            On the Organism found      in   the Tsetse   Fly   Disease.   279
matin of the macronucleus is broken up into a number of tiny granules,
not bigger often than the micronucleus.     Besides these there are other
forms, which we call for convenience here   "          "
                                              amoeboid forms, by which
term we mean single, small, irregularly shaped forms, with or without a
flagellum, but always with a macro- and micro-nucleus.     These nuclear
structures are generally surrounded by a very delicate envelope of
protoplasm, of greater or lesser extent, but occasionally forms are seen
which seem to consist only of chromatin, with or without a flagellum.
Besides these, again, there are other forms which we call, also for con
venience, "plasmodial" forms, meaning thereby an aggregation           or
fusion of two or more amoeboid forms.      In the blood these plasmodia
are not generally very large, but may show evidence of from two to
eight separate elements.    Signs of division are very common ; but in
the blood one does not often meet with a plasmodium dividing up into
more than four organisms of the adult shape.       The plasmodial form
also retains intact the two nuclear structures — the macro- and micro-
nucleus — which we believe divide in the plasmodium, thus increasing
its size.
   In the spleenless animals       the blood may contain no forms but the
amoeboid     and plasmodial,    such as is the case in the rabbit, yet this
blood is infective ; moreover, in the dog, before the adult organism
appears in     it,
                the blood   infective, and therein, at this period, these
                               is
plasmodial forms can be demonstrated.   In the glands these plasmodial
forms are found, but only in quantity in those animals from which the
spleen has been removed.
   The spleen     the organ which shows
                     is                         these forms in the greatest
abundance.    The whole spleen       is   crammed in every part with plas
modia, which are wedged in between the splenic cells in every direc
tion many anoeboid forms, and also immature flagellate forms are also
     :
seen, but the most striking thing   the enormous quantity and uniform
                                     is
distribution of the plasmodia.   The great enlargement of the spleen,
which we have found constant in all the animals we have used,               is
caused by this mass of plasmodia, which we have found in the spleen
within forty-eight hours from the time of inoculation.
   In the marrow these plasmodial forms are only found, so far as our
experience   goes, in those animals from which the spleen has been
removed.   In these cases there are both plasmodial and amoeboid forms
in the marrow, the latter the more abundant.
   The principal differences in the distribution of the plasmodial forms
in animals with and without spleens        this
                                            is   that in the animals with

                                                         " Brucii."
   Besides the forms mentioned          above, we have seen in the blood and
in the organs divisions of the adult form, both longitudinal and trans
verse, the former the more frequent ; but we think that this direct
mode of reproduction is far less common than the indirect by means
of conjugation (probably), breaking up of chromatin, production of
amoeboid forms, with subsequent division of these amoeboid forms, and
the formation of plasmodia by the aggregation                 or fusion of the
amceboid forms,         and  these finally giving off flagellate forms, at first
small, and gradually increasing up to the normal adult form.
   So that we should tentatively summarise the life-history             of the
Trypanosoma found in Tsetse Fly disease, which we think might properly
be called " Trypanosoma Brncii," in recognition of the work done in
connection with it by its discoverer Major Bruce, F.R.S., as follows : —
    1. Reproduction by division, this being of two kinds : —
          («) Longitudinal, the commoner.
          (//)• Transverse, less frequent.
   2.   Conjugation, consisting essentially, so far as our observations go,
of fusion of the micrormclei       of the conjugating organisms.
   («) After this we are inclined to place those forms mentioned above,
in which the chromatin is broken up, and scattered more or less uni
formly through the whole body of the Trypanosoma, since this occurs
after conjugation in other organisms not far removed biologically from
this one. The next stage in our opinion is the amoeboid ; we think
that the flagellate form becomes amoeboid perhaps after conjugation,
but also probably apart from this process.
   (b) Amoeboid forms.          These are found with and without flagella, of
various shapes and sizes, but always possessing a macro- and micro-
nucleus.        These forms are constantly seen in the process of division,
and sometimes are very irregular in shape, with, in this case, an
unequal number of macro- and micro-nuclei, the latter being the more
abundant.         The amoeboid forms then fuse, or aggregate, together to
form—
   (c) The plasmodial forms.           Whether these are true plasmodia, or
whether they are only aggregations of amoeboid forms it is not yet
possible to say, but as many related organisms form true plasmodia
we are inclined to look upon these masses, provisionally, as true plas
modia.       In the spleen these plasmodia reach a large size. From these
again   are    given off—
   (tf) Flagellate forms, which increase in size, and become the ordinary
adult form.        Small flagellate forms are not infrequently seen in pro
cess of separation from the margin of these plasmodial masses.
   Besides these forms we have observed frequently, especially in rat's

           On the Organism found      in  the Tsetse Fly Disease..      281
blood after death, the adult forms arranged in clumps.         They appear,
upon watching them for a considerable time, to get tangled together
to form a large writhing mass ; then the movements become gradually
slower in the centre of the mass, and are only seen at the periphery.
At this stage, if the specimen be fixed, the mass appears to be made up
of a quantity of macro- and micro-nuclei, as the protoplasm does not
stain, except in the organisms at the periphery, i.e., those which have
arrived latest. Eventually these, too, become motionless, and the mass
becomes an indistinct collection of granular matter, which is not
infective, so that we look upon these tangles as a proof of death.
   Since  these observations   were made, there has been published an
important paper on the Eat     Trypanosoma, by Lydia Rabinowitsch and
Walter Kempner in the ' Zeitschrift f iir Hygiene,' vol.   30, Part 2.  We
have been able to confirm many of the observations and statements as
to the morphology and reproduction of the Trypanosoma made by
these writers.   But there is no mention made of the plasmodial stage,
or of any reproductive stage elsewhere than in the blood ; and the
writers recognize only three methods of reproduction, namely, longi
tudinal and transverse division, and division by segmentation.         This
segmentation, they consider, arises from one -organism, and they state
that it may divide up into as many as ten to sixteen elements.         This
segmentation   form  would   seem  to correspond   to our plasmodial stage,
but we have seen much larger masses than those mentioned above, and
they do not notice the enormous masses of plasmodia which infil
trate the spleen in every direction, and which can be found also in
glands, and marrow.        Moreover, their amoeboid stage (Kugelform)
                                                                           "
would precede the segmentation form, and therefore the " Kugelform
should be much larger than the ordinary adult form, but we have
observed that as a rule, our amoeboid forms are very much smaller
than the adult forms, some not being visible with any but the highest
magnifying powers ; so that we have been unable to accept this form of
division by segmentation, except in the form in which we have
described it above, i.e., our plasmodial stage.

282          The Colour Sensations      in Terms of Luminosity.

                                    (Abstract.)
  This paper deals with a determination of the colour sensations
based on the Young theory by means of measures of the luminosity
of the three       different colour components in a mixed light which
  matches white.        At the red end of the spectrum there is only one
 colour extending to near C, and there is no mixture of other colours
 which will match       it, however selected.       At the violet end of the spec
 trum, from the extreme violet to near G, the same homogeneity of
 light exists, but it   is   apparently due to the stimulation of two sensa
 tions,a    red and a blue sensation, the latter never being felt unmixed
 with any other.          Having ascertained this,  it     remained to find that
 place   in   the   spectrum    where    the   blue  sensation  was to be found
unmixed with any other sensation except white. By trial            it    was found
that close to the blue lithium line this was the case, and that a
mixture of this colour and pure red sensation gave the violet
 of the spectrum when the latter was mixed with              a    certain quantity
 of white. The red and the blue sensation being located,            it    remained
 to find the green sensation.             The complementary colour to the
red in the spectrum gave        a     position in which the green and blue
 sensations were present in the right proportions to make white, and
 a point nearer the red gave a point in which the red and blue sensa
tions were present in such proportions as found in white, but
 there was an excess of green sensation.               By preliminary trials this
 point    was    found.      The   position   in   the  spectrum of the yellow
colour complementary to the violet was also found.                  The colour of
bichromate of potash           was  matched     by using a     pure red and the
last-named green.         To make the match, white had to be added to the
bichromate colour.        A    certain small percentage of white was found
to  exist  in  the   light  transmitted    through a bichromate solution with
which the match was made, and this percentage and the added white
being deducted from the green used, gave the luminosity of the pure
green sensation existing in the spectrum colour which matched the
bichromate.        Knowing the percentage composition in luminosity of
the two    sensations    at this point, the luminosity of the three sensations
in white was determined by matching the bichromate colour with the
yellow (complementary to the violet) and the pure red colour sensa
tion. From this equation and from the sensation equation of the bi
chromate colour already found, the composition of the yellow was
determined.  By matching white with mixture of the yellow and the
                                            a

                     Tlie Conductivity of Heat Insulators.               283
 violet, the sensation     equation to white was determined.       The other
  colours  of the spectrum were then used in forming white, and from
 their luminosity equations their percentage composition in sensations
 were    calculated.   The percentage curves are shown.      The results so
 obtained were applied to various spectrum luminosity curves, and
 the sensation curves obtained.      The areas of these curves were found,
 and the ordinates of the green and violet curves increased, so that
 both their areas were respectively equal to that of the red. This gave
 three new curves in which the sensations to form white were shown by
 equal ordinates.
    A comparison of the points in the spectrum where the curves cut
 one another, and of those found by the red and green blind as matching
 •white, show      that the two sets are identical, as they should be.
 The curves of Koenig, drawn on the same supposition, are called attention
 to, and the difference between his and the new determination pointed
 out.
     The red below the red lithium line, as already pointed out, excites
 but one (the red) sensation, whilst the green sensation is felt in greatest
 purity at A 5140, and the blue at A 4580, as at these points they are
 mixed only with the sensation of white, the white being of that
 whiteness which is seen outside the colour fields.

    The comparative efficiency of materials used as insulators has been
the subject of several investigations ; the majority of these have been
conducted at fairly high temperatures, and it may be questioned
whether the results can be applied to the same materials when used as
a lagging to protect bodies at low temperatures.              Moreover the
methods adopted do not seem susceptible of any considerable accuracy.
The method to be described was devised with the object of using
lower temperatures and smaller ranges than had been used in previous
experiments, to attain a perfectly steady state of heat transference,
and allow of greater accuracy and simplicity in the measurements.
    The substances selected for experiment so far have been those which
could easily be tested in the dry state, without being made up into
cements; they include air, sawdust, charcoal, pine shavings, paper,
asbestos, sand, silicate cotton, hair felt, rice husks, and a heat insulator
known as " kapok."
    The method employed consisted in placing the material under test in
the space between two cylindrical copper pots, kept at a definite distance
apart by pieces of vulcanised fibre ; the inner pot contained a small
                                                                 Y  2

motor with a fan attached to the axis ; a tin-plate cylinder, open at the
top and with holes at the bottom, was put inside to direct the currents
of air over the inner surface of the inside pot, in the direction of the
arrows shown in Fig. 1. Energy was supplied electrically to a heating
                                 Fie.  1.

coil within as well as to the motor : this constituted an internal supply
of heat, which maintained the temperature within the pot at any
decided upper limit.    The motor and heating coil were connected in
series, and leads were carried through a small hole in the lid of the
pots to measure the current and potential difference, and thus the

                  Tlic Conductivity of Heat Insulators.                                  285
power expended on internal heating was measured.           The outer pot
was immersed in a tank kept overflowing from the water main, the
lid of the pot being made into a sort of saucer, into which the incoming
water ran, thus the outer pot's surface was kept at a uniform and
constant temperature.       The resulting temperature differences were
measured by means of thermo-electric junctions of copper and iron, in
a way shortly to be described.    The current was allowed to pass steadily
into  the inner pot, driving  the motor and fan, until the inner thermo
electric junction arrived at a steady value ; this usually occurred in
about three hours or so ; when this was the case, the supply of energy
by the current was just equal to the heat conducted through the insu
lator and carried off by the water. Knowing the temperature gradient
and the number of watts supplied and the dimensions of the system,
we can deduce the specific conductivity of the material.
   The general arrangement is shown in Fig. 1. (P) is the outer pot
which stood in the tank ; its approximate dimensions were 8 inches in
diameter and 16 inches high; (Q) is the inner pot, with one inch clearance

                                           g
D'Arsonval pattern. The junctions used were always made of exactly
the same length to keep the total resistance constant, and on calibra
tion were found to give a linear relation between temperature difference
and deflection on the galvanometer within the ranges which were to
be used, and during each experiment           check calibration at two known
                                                 a
temperatures     was    made    by means of a third junction in water at
another known temperature.          When        steady state was attained, the

                                           were measured by the deflections
and calibration tests. The reason for the above indirect method of
measuring the difference of temperature between             and  B  was to avoid
                                                                            C

value of  A    was calculated from careful measurements of their dimen

for the sides, and from the top and bottom of the inner, to the bottom

were determined in the manner described.          At least two tests of each
material were made, the mean temperature throughout being about 40'

    It will be noticed that hair felt was the best insulator that was tested.
The insulation in the case of brown paper was practically that of air
with subdivided     spaces, as the paper occupied relatively a small volume :
a comparison of this with insulation by air only will show how great
an improvement in air-lagging such a simple expedient will give.
    In repeating the experiments with wider ranges and a higher mean
temperature, indications were observed tending to show that the con
ductivity is a function of the temperature.         It is hoped to continue
the investigation as regards this point, and to extend it to other insu

    The orientation of the Cabeirion Temple, near Thebes, of which the
angle has been disputed (see p. 46 in my paper of 1897), was re-
measured with the theodolite in May, 1898, and the previous observa
tions confirmed.       An additional example is added from an archaic
Temple of Neptune in the Isle of Poros, introducing the employment
of the bright zodiacal star Regulus, which I had not before met with.
    In Sicily the re-examination of the temples at Girgenti, where, in
my former visit, I had relied for azimuth on the sun's shadow and the
time, has enabled me to give to the elements some amendments in
detail, the only point of consequence being, that the orientation date
of the temple named Juno Lacinia is brought within the period of
the Hellenic colonisation of that city.
    The most interesting point in the paper seems to be, that in the
case of two Athenian temples, namely the Theseum and the later
Erechtheum — i.e., the temple now partially standing — it is shown that
the days of those months on which the sunrise, heralded by the star,
illuminated the sanctuary, coincided exactly, on certain years of the
 Metonic cycle, with the days of the Athenian lunar months on which
three important festivals known to be connected with at least one of
those temples were held.        The years so determined agree remarkably
well with the probable dates of the dedication of those temples ; and
in the case of the first mentioned, the festival, which was named The
Thesea, seems to leave little doubt that the traditional name of the
 temple, which has recently been much disputed, is the correct one.

   The experiments described in this paper were undertaken with the
object of throwing some light upon what appeared to be fundamental
questions in connection with the electrical effects of precipitation.           It
was hoped in this way to make some advance towards an understand
ing of the relation between rain and atmospheric electricity.
   It was pointed out by Professor J. J. Thomson* that if positive and
negative ions differed in their power of condensing water around them,
drops might be formed upon one set of ions only, and separation of
positive and negative electricity would then take place by the falling
of the drops, the work required for the production of the electric field
being due to gravity.
    To make this process worthy of consideration as a possible source of
atmospheric electricity, it would be necessary to show reason for
believing (1) that atmospheric air in the regions in which rain is
formed is likely to contain free ions, (2) that positively and negatively
 charged ions differ in their efficiency as condensation nuclei.
    It is mainly with the second of these questions that this paper deals.
 The result of this part of the investigation was to prove that water
 condenses much more readily on negative than on positive ions.               The
 experiments     consisted   in   measurements     of  the  expansion required to
 cause condensation in the form of drops in air initially saturated and
 containing ions, alternately nearly all positive and nearly all negative.
 The ratio of the final to the initial volume being indicated by v-^e\,
 then, to cause water to condense on negatively charged ions, the super-
 saturation must reach the limit corresponding to the expansion t'j/Di =
 1'25 (approximately a fourfold supersaturation).             To make water con
 dense on positively charged          ions, the supersaturation must reach the
 much higher limit, corresponding to the expansion v^/vi = 1-31 (the
 supersaturation being then nearly sixfold).
    We    see, then,   that  if   ions ever act as condensation      nuclei in the
 atmosphere, it must be mainly or solely the negative ones which do so,
 and thus a preponderance of negative electricity will be carried down
 by precipitation to the earth's surface.
    Incidentally it was proved that the difference between the effects as
 condensation nuclei of the positively and negatively charged ions is
 not to be explained by supposing that the charge carried by the nega-

live ions          is,
             say, twice as great as that carried by the positive ions, for
equal   numbers of positive and negative ions are produced by the
ionisation of the neutral gas.
   Attempts were now made to find an answer to the first question
suggested above — Is there any evidence that ions are likely to be
present under normal conditions in the atmosphere          ?
   Former experiments furnished a certain amount of evidence in
favour of an affirmative answer.
   When moist dust-free air       allowed to expand suddenly rain-like
                                      is                                 a

                                  ;          in fact so exact as to furnish
                                               is
what      at first sight almost convincing evidence that ordinary moist

         is                                           The number of these
nuclei      too small to make the absence of sensible electrical con
              is
ductivity   in  air under ordinary conditions inconsistent with the view
that they are ions.
   All attempts, however, to remove these nuclei, by applying strong         a
electric field such as would have removed ordinary ions almost as fast
asthey were produced, have failed, even when  differential apparatus
                                                       a
was used, such as would have made manifest even    slight diminution

in the number of the nuclei by the action of the field. The same                      is
true of the similar nuclei produced by the action of weak ultra-violet
light on moist air.
   Such nuclei, therefore, in spite of their identity as condensation
nuclei with the ions, cannot be regarded as free ions, unless we suppose
the ionisation to be developed by the process of producing the super-
saturation. This question requires further investigation.

inherited character.      So far as we are aware, however, neither the
above-mentioned      naturalists nor any other investigators have published
researches bearing on the problem of whether duration of life is or is
not inherited. We are accustomed to hear of a particular man that
" he comes of a
                   long-lived family," but the quantitative measure of the
inheritance of life's duration does not yet seem to have been deter
mined.     This absence of investigation appears the more remarkable
as a knowledge of the magnitude of inheritance in this respect would,
we should conceive, be of primary commercial importance in the con
sideration of life insurance and of annuities. The biological interest of
the problem, as we have already noticed, is very great.
   2. It will be well in the first place to point out that the problem is
by no means an easy or a straightforward one. The ages at death of
even close relatives must be found from records of some kind, or else
collected ub initio. Now if we take records like the Peerage, Baronetage,
Landed Gentry, family histories, and private pedigrees, we find various
serious omissions.     In the first place the ages of the women are rarely
given, pages of the Peerage or Landed Gentry may be examined before
a single record is found of the ages of two sisters at death, or even of a
mother and a daughter. Further, the census and other returns show how
liable we are to find women's ages given erroneously. Family histories
and pedigrees suffer in the same way, the pedigrees are mostly taken
through the male line, and the women's ages can only be found in rare
cases.    An exception must be made in the case of the Quaker family
histories, such as those of the Backhouse, Whitney, and other families.
Here the data are as full for the women as for the men, but naturally
the history of a single, even much-branched family, does not provide
anything like the material that the Peerage and Landed Gentry do in
the case of men.      For this reason our first study is confined to inherit
ance of longevity in the male line.          We hope eventually to collect
enough data for inheritance in the female line, but it will take a longer
time to amass, and we fear will scarcely be as homogeneous.
   In the second place, the sources to which we have referred omit
more or less completely all record of the ages at death of infants and
children. The Quaker records give better results than the Peerage,
but even here the great bulk of child deaths appears to remain un
recorded.    Out of 1000 males born in this country more than 300 die
before they are 20 years of age.          But when 1000 cases of ages of
father and son were taken out of the Landed Gentry, only 31 cases
showed    the death of a son before 20 years of age.      Of 2000 brothers
from the Peerage in 1000 pairs, only 21 individuals died before 20
years of age. In the Quaker histories we found about 16 per cent, of
deaths   before  20 years    of age. Clearly such early deaths are not
represented in anything like their proper proportions.            They will
have to be found from other sources ; possibly by direct inquiry, and

the issue of data cards.      We were thus compelled to limit this first
study to the    ease when    both relatives die at a greater age than 20.
In the case of fathers, when we are dealing with the correlation
between father's and son's ages at death, this is practically no limita
tion at all, as no father dying under 20 years of age was met with.
In the case of the offspring, however, the limitation cuts off the dis
tribution somewhat abruptly with a finite ordinate at 20 — 25, five
years being our unit of grouping.
    3. Now duration of life is a very different character to eye-colour, or
to some extent to the size of organs in adult life. Eye-colour is fairly
well determined, it may change with old age slightly, but it cannot
transform itself from light blue to brown. Again, nourishment and use
undoubtedly affect the size of organs, but they are likely to influence
father and son, or, at any rate, brother and brother, in much the same
 way, for they are members of the same family and the same class. On
 the other hand, death depends not only on inherited constitution but
on innumerable      chance elements of environment and circumstance.
 The environment both of home and period is much more alike for two
brothers than for a father and son; food, sanitation, habits of life,
change considerably in a generation, and two brothers have more equal
 chances of life than a father and son.            But even with two brothers,
 one may live on the family estates and the other ruin his health in
 Africa or India. Hence, while the non-differential death-rate will not
 materially alter the correlations between most characters in relatives,
 it must seriously affect the correlation between the durations of life in
father and son, and to a lesser extent between brother and brother.
 A good stock may be better protected against death than a weak one,
 but no stock at all can resist certain attacks.         Hence if we look upon
 death as a marksman, p per       cent,   of his shots are, we may say, sure to
 be effective whatever they hit, this is the non-differential death-rate,
 the remaining 100-^ per cent, of his attacks will only be successful
 on the weaker stocks.      Now the effect of this conception of death's
 action is that the correlation table for ages at death of any pair of
 relatives must be looked upon as a mixture of uncorrelated material —
 deaths due to the non-differential death-rate, and correlated material —
 deaths due to the differential or selective death-rate.           At different
 periods of life also one of these death-rates may give more material to
 the table than at another.      In the case of fathers and sons we should
 expect the non-differential death-rate to be more numerous in its con
 tributions than in the case of brother and brother.
    Now it has been shown by one of us that when correlated material
 is mixed with uncorrelated material, the result is approximately to
 reduce the coefficient of correlation in the ratio of the amount of corre
 lated to the total amount of material.* Hence, if we assume that the

                  Data for the Problem of Evolution in Man.                       293
actual correlation between constitutional strengths to resist death
would be given, at any rate approximately, by the values determined
for other characters in a memoir on the Law of Ancestral Heredity,*
we have clearly a method of to some extent ascertaining the proportion
of the selective and non-selective death-rates in man.                  In the sequel
it will be shown that from the age of 20 to the end of life our tallies give
a correlation between the duration of life of father and son of about
0'12 to 0-14, and between brother and brother of about 0'26.                   Accord
ing to the     Law    of Ancestral Heredity we should expect these quantities
to be about 0'3 and 0'4. Hence we conclude that the amounts of
correlated material in the two cases are 40 to 50 per cent, and 65 per
cent.      But if ^N be the number of cases in which the death-rate is
selective for N individuals, p-~& will be the number of cases for which
it is selective when we take pairs of individuals. In other words the
selective death-rate in the first caset is about 63 to 70 per cent, and in
the second about 80 per cent, of the total death-rate.                Without laying
great    stress  on   the actual    numbers   just   stated,   we think  that they are
 sufficiently close to demonstrate that a substantial selective death-
 rate actually exists at work on mankind, and that with like environ
 ment it may amount to as much as four times the non-selective death-
 rate. \    In other words, having demonstrated that duration of life is
 really   inherited,    we have thereby demonstrated that natural selection
 is very sensibly effective among mankind.                The natural selection we
 are here dealing       with  is not  in the first place, of course, a result of any
 struggle of individual with individual, but of individual with environ
 ment and with the defects of personal physique.
     4. In order to show the biological importance of investigating the
 inheritance of duration of life, we have cited the results obtained for
 correlation between the ages at death of father and son and brother
 and brother. But the method by which these results were obtained
 requires further discussion.          We have already seen the need to exclude
 deaths under 20 years, but even then we have not got in the case
  of father and son two like groups of material.                The father has been
  more severely selected        than  the son.    He   has  lived to become a father,
  and he is strong enough to be the father of a son who lives to be
     * '
         Roy. Soc. Proc.,' vol. 62, pp. 397 and 400.
     t This  selective death-rate from the data for father and eon must be interpreted
  in the sense indicated above. The drop from 80 to 65, say, per cent, is in itself a
 measure of the change of environment of the two generations.
     i The correlation on which this determination is based might be illusory, if
  families were reared under very individual environments ; the correlation in
  duration of life of brothers, for example, might then be a result of their individual
  family environment.       But the environment when we take comparatively homo
  geneous classes like the Peerage or Lauded Gentry must bo very similar, and we
  think this source of error, suggested to us by Professor Weldon, while very real
  has been sufficiently provided against.

 20 years of age.          Evidence of this selection is to be found in the
 facts that (1) fathers have a mean age 5 to 7 years greater than
 that of their sons ; (2) the variability of their age at death is very
 sensibly less than the variability of their sons' age, i.e., as 2'9 to 3-5,
 or (3) by noticing for example that in our first table 82 sons as
 against 20 fathers die before 32'5 years of age, and that in our second
 table some 100 sons as against 20 fathers die before 35 years of age.
 Clearly the group
                            " son " is a much weaker type than the group
 " father." As will be shown in a memoir on the effect of selection on
 correlation, this want of likeness in fathers and sons itself tends to
 modify the correlation between them.*
    While this selection occurs only in the case of fathers and sons and
 not in the case of brethren, still the general character of the correla
 tion surface is alike in both.         It is known that the curve of frequency
 of death at different agest is by no means normal.                  It is probably
 compound, and only approximates                 to normality round three score
years    and   ten.    It  would    hardly,   however,  fulfil a useful purpose to
 deal only with the correlation of ages of death of relatives both dying
under the old age mortality group, even if on the sunny side of 70 we
could distinguish old age from middle age mortality.                 But in dealing
with correlation and regression in such cases as this, we must throw
entirely on one side any notion of normal surface and curves of error,
and go simply to the kernel of the affair.
    What we want is the law connecting the mean age at death of one
relative when another relative has died at a given age. When the
given age of the latter and the mean age of the former are plotted to
form a curve, this curve is the regression curve whatever be the form
of the frequency surface.             The line of closest fit to this curve is the
regression line, and Yule's theorem! tells us that the slope of this line
is found in exactly the same way as if the frequency surface were a
normal distribution.          The slope of this line has nothing whatever to
do with the particular form of surface, and may be found even if we
cut oif a portion of the surface parallel to one axis, e.g., if we take the
regression line for fathers or sons we get the best fitting lines in pre
cisely the same manner whether we take all sons dying from infancy
to old age, or only those from 20 years onwards.                 If, of course, the
regression curve      is  sensibly  linear,  then   the regression line is the true
curve of regression.         Everything proved in the memoir,
                                                                      " On the Law

only to look at our regression diagrams, in particular at that for
brethren, to assure himself that no curve will serve for practical pur
poses substantially better than a straight line.          Now, if 'rx be the
standard deviation of the relative whose mean age at death is taken,
and 'r,j of the relative of a given age at death, and r be the correlation
defined by
                     r   =  S{z(x-mx)(y-my)}/(K'rjry),
where    2  is the frequency of deviations x~mx and y-mv from the
means mx and my in the total observations N, then the line of closest
fit, the regression    line, passes through m^ and my, and has ra-x/a-y for
its slope. All this is independent of any theory of frequency distribu
tion, and the vanishing of r with the correlation simply flows from the
fundamental problem that the chance of a combined event is the
product of two independent probabilities. Our conclusions in this paper
are deduced from the above value of r and from the slope of the regres
sion line, and they involve no further assumption than the approximate
linearity of the regression curves.         Our appeal to the memoir, " On
                                     "
the Law of Ancestral Heredity          makes also no greater demands.
    5. We    now  turn   to the   material itself.   Our data consist of three
series, from which all deaths recorded as accidents, an exceedingly small
proportion of the whole, were excluded.             In excluding these we of
course slightly, but very slightly, reduced the non-selective death-rate.
 In the first series, 1000 cases of the ages of fathers and sons at death,
the latter being over 22'5 years of age, were taken from 'Foster's
Peerage'; in the second series a 1000 pairs of fathers and sons, the
latter dying beyond the age of 20, were taken from ' Burke's Landed
 Gentry'; and in the third series the ages at death of 1000 pairs of
brothers dying beyond the age of 20 were taken from the Peerage.
    The first series was obtained by grouping all fathers dying between
22'5 and 27'5, 27-5 and 32'5, &c.            We started at 22-5 because this
was the earliest recorded death of a father among those extracted from
 the Peerage, and to have sons dying in the same range they were also
started at 22'5 years.          In extracting the ages at death, they were
taken to     the  nearest   whole  year, and consequently in the subsequent
grouping we were spared decimals.            In the second and third series we
originally took all deaths from birth onwards also to the nearest
 whole year, and then grouped in five-year periods ; thus fractions were
introduced when a death fell on a five-year division. Subsequently we
eliminated the few deaths occurring before 20 years of age.
    The aggregate material for the three series is given in Tables I, II,
and HI ; and the means of the arrays of fathers' ages at death for sons
dying at a given age, i.e., the regression polygons of fathers' on sons'
age at death in figs. 1 and 2 ; the regression polygon for brethren is
 given in fig. 3.

which was nearly symmetrical, absolutely symmetrical, by entering
into the table each pair of brothers twice, an individual first appearing
as a first brother and then as a second brother.          Thus the mean age at
death and variability of age at death of both sets of brothers appears
the same, and we have a nominal 2000 instead of a 1000 entries.               Of
course in calculating the probable errors of the constants, 1000 has
been taken as the number of observations.               We shall now consider
these diagrams and tables a little at length.

    6.  First  Series.  — The means of the arrays of fathers for a given age
at death      of the son, are shown           by the broken line ubrdefg in tig. 1.
The point 't for the group of sons dying between 17'5 and 22'5 years
was put in from a few observations                   not afterwards included in the
table.     Beyond the group 82'5 to 87-5 years, there were not sufficient
observations to form a reliable mean at all : yy gives the mean age of
all the 1000 fathers observed, and represents                  65-835 years, M gives
the mean age of the              1000 sons, and represents 58-775 years.            The
former may be taken               as  the mean age at death of all fathers, the
latter was only the mean age at the death of sons who live more than
22-5 years.       The regression curve is a somewhat broken polygon, but
one or two points may be deduced at once from it.
    (n) It is entirely to the left of yy above M and entirely to the right
of //l/ below -fx. Thus there is certainly correlation between the ages
at death of father and son. A son dying below the mean age will
have on the average a father dying below the mean age, and a son
dying above the mean age will have on the average a father dying
above the mean age.              Graphically we see that correlation must exist.
The straight       line   which    best fits the regression polygon is given on the
diagram by /«'. The Law of Ancestral Heredity would give lm with a
slope of 0-3.         It is clear that with a quite sensible regression there is
a quite sensible divergence from the law of inheritance, in other words,
the death-rate is only in part selective.
     Quite similar results are to be observed in fig. 2 ; there is again a
 very sensible correlation, but it is sensibly less than that required by
the Law of Ancestral Heredity.                   The lines are lettered the same.

times the magnitudes of their probable errors, and they agree within the
probable error of their differences.    The only significant difference
is the mean age of deaths of sons in the Landed Gentry, which is some
two years higher than in the Peerage.   This is the more noteworthy
in that we have begun our peerage record at- 25 and not 20. Clearly
the sons of the Landed Gentry are longer lived. We have undoubtedly
correlation, say somewhere about 0-12, sensible and definite in
amount, but clearly considerably below the 0-3 required by the law of
inheritance.
      (6)   A
         second point may be noticed by looking at the diagrams (1)
and (2), namely, that from about the age of 32-5 to 52-5 the regres
sion line is sensibly vertical, or when the son dies in middle life, the
mean age of death of the father is sensibly uncorrected with it. In
other words, we have the remarkable result that the mortality which
in a paper on skew variation by one of us,* has been termed that of
middle life is largely uninherited. It is during this period of life that
the non-selective death-rate is chiefly predominant.     After this period
the regression curve becomes sensibly steeper, although not fully up
to the steepness of the line given by Galton's Law.         This is more
properly the inheritance of longevity.      The inheritance of duration of
life may not be continuous.
    If we seek the best fitting straight line for the regression polygon
from 50 years onward we find : —

  Results such  as these are as close as we could expect, and they mark
an increase in the steepness of the regression line from about 0"1 1 to
0-17, an undoubtedly substantial increase of the selective death-rate a»
we approach old age.  The regression line for this old age mortality
is marked as jk in diagrams (1) and (2), and we see the advance

 nately our records       do not give enough data to determine         its form in a
reliable manner.
    Fig. 1  seems to indicate a great approach to the Galtonian value
towards youth, and we should not be surprised to find the selective
death-rate in youth and infancy even more predominant than in old age.
This would be the inheritance of the reverse of longevity, of " brachy-
bioty."    The regression curve for this portion of life cannot be deter
mined from our present statistics, but we hope to return to it in a second
study when more data have been collected.* So far as we are able to
judge at present the inheritance of the duration of life breaks up into
two parts, an inheritance telling its tale in youth and another after
middle life. It is the former part which seems to us to have most
bearing on the fertility and survival of stocks, most individuals having
reproduced themselves by 50 years of age.               It is the latter part only,
the true inheritance of longevity, to which it would appear that
Weismann and Wallace's arguments apply : — t
    " For it is evident than when one or more individuals have pro
vided a sufficient number of successors, they themselves, as consumers
of nourishment in a constantly increasing degree, are an injury to
those successors.       Natural selection therefore weeds them out, and in
many cases favours such races as die almost immediately after they
have left successors."
   7. We now turn to the third series, giving the correlation between
the ages of death of brothers.            The data give the following numerical
results :—
                               MB     = 60-971 years.
                                 o-B   = 16-8354   „
                                rBB    = 0-2602 ±0-0 199.
                              RBB = 0-2602 ±0-0216.
   The results here are in good agreement with those for sons in the
Landed Gentry, i.e., in the second series. The mean age of one of
a pur of brothers is slightly greater and the variability of one who has
a brother slightly less than in the case of sons. But this is exactly what
we might expect, considering that
                                                " brothers " are a selection from
"sons," and a brother is likely to have greater vitality than a son. The
group sons covers sons of fathers who did not live to have more than one
son, and who therefore came of any early dying stock, while brothers
denotes at least two sons, and therefore on the average some years
more life than is necessary for one son.
   The values of the coefficients of correlation and regression are some
13 times their probable errors, and we have a substantial correlation,

of the non-selective death-rate in middle life, so marked in the latter
case, no longer appears in the case of brothers.     This would suggest
that the environments of father and son differ most in middle life and
are then much more unlike than those of brothers.
   8. We conclude this 'first study by putting on record formulae for
estimating the age at death of a man, using the theory of multiple
correlation as developed in a memoir* by one of the present writers,
and taking as basis the second and third series, which seem to us to
present the best results.

that is allowed rather indefinite weight at present in the actuarial and
medical professions.      Based on a wider mass of data and a larger series
of relationships we cannot but believe they would be of much help to
variability of grandfathers, which must    be less than that of fathers, or their mean
age at death, which   must be greater than that of fathers, in order to determine the
probable age at death of a man from that, say, of his grandfather and father, which
would be of much interest.     We only wish to draw attention to what we believe to
be a new  and  important Held  of enquiry, and to indicate tho nature of its problems.

the physician and actuary.          If their importance were once recognised
by the insurance offices, we believe that the necessary data would be
readily forthcoming. As illustrations take the following :—
   (i) A man's father dies at 40, and his brother at             25.       What is the
probable reduction in his own life 1 Answer: 12 years.
   (ii) A man has two brothers, who die young at 25 and 29. How
much will this shorten his probable duration of life 1 Answer : 14 years.
   (iii) A man's father died at 40, and his brother, his senior by one
year, died at 50, twenty-two years ago. A life estate now accrues to
the man, whose whereabouts are unknown. What is the probability
that he is still alive, and should he return and claim the estate, how
long is he likely to enjoy it. Answer : The man belongs to an array of
men of mean age 54-99 years at death, and standard deviation 16-41
years. Hence the odds against his living beyond 71 years are 835 to
 165, and, accordingly, the odds against the possibility of his return are
alxmt 21 to 4. Should he be alive and return, he is as likely as not
to hold it for 6-8 years, and 8-7 years is his expectancy of life, so that
the contingency of his being alive and enjoying the estate is worth only
about 1-4 years' income of the estate.
   Clearly such problems can be extended in a great variety of ways,
which might be serviceable in actuarial practice.

                                     (Abstract.)
    During the last forty years, there have been examined at Kew
 Observatory upwards of 100 collimator magnets used in observing the
 horizontal force and declination.
    The " constants
                       "
                          of these magnets — temperature           and induction
 coefficients, and moment of inertia        —  have been determined at the
 Observatory, and the tables based on these determinations have
 served to reduce magnetic observations             at a large number of the
 leading magnetic observatories.
    The present paper deals with the data recorded in the Observatory
 books for the constants specified above, and with other quantities—
                             "
 such as the "  permanent      magnetic moment — which are deducible from
the records.     It determines    the mean values of the several quantities
 for the instruments of the leading English makers, and investigates
 whether relations do or do not exist between them.               It then deduces
 from the records the probable errors in the values of the several
 quantities, proceeding on the hypothesis that the methods of deter
 mining them are correct.          It next examines, from a mathematical
 standpoint,   the  accuracy   of  the formulae employed in reducing hori
 zontal force observations, and, from a physical standpoint, the possibility
 of differences between the quantities determined at the Observatory
 and the quantities actually concerned in horizontal force observations.
    The various sources of uncertainty are dealt with, and an attempt
 is made to ascertain to what extent they may affect the values found
for the horizontal force. •
    The results of the paper are of too technical a character to admit
 of their being summarized briefly in an intelligible way.

determinations for all the three directions ; the mean, however, can be
regarded with the fullest confidence as expressing the true coefficient
at 0°.   The agreement of the values for the constant b is really
remarkable,  considering the extreme smallness of the constant, and is
to be attributed to the perfection of the polished surfaces of the nickel
block ; the mean undoubtedly expresses the true semi-increment per
degree of temperature.

    The agreement of the individual values is not quite so good as in the
 case of nickel, owing to the impossibility of obtaining such absolute
 perfection of the surfaces of the cobalt block as was obtained in the
 case of the nickel    block.   In the  case of    the constant  n  the differences
 only amount to 3 per cent., and the whole amount of It is so minute that
 one is fortunate in finding the agreement so good.            These differences,
 however, from the nature of their cause, are bound to be on both sides
 of the truth, and the mean of so large a number as nine is sure to be
 very near the true value.
    It will now be interesting to compare these results with those of
Fizeau. The latter were published in very brief form in the ' Comptes
Rendus,' for 1869* and also in ' Poggendorff's Annalen,' for the same
year.t In neither of these publications are any further details given
beyond the values of the coefficient of expansion for 40° and the incre
ment per degree, Aa/A0 (= 24), which occur in a table of similar
 quantities for various metals ; together with the information that the
specimens of nickel and cobalt employed had been reduced by hydrogen
and compressed, and that the range of temperature of the observations
was from 10° to 80°.       The values in question are —
                                               a 40°.           Aa/Afl.

               Cobalt                    0-00001236             0-80
    It will  be observed    that the values of the coefficient for 40° now
presented are higher than those of Fizeau ; in the case of nickel the
difference is 1307   -  1279 = 0028, and in the case of cobalt 1259          - 1236
 = 0023.      The author's increments are likewise higher, 148 and 128
against 7 1 and 80 respectively.       The fact that the author's increment
for nickel is twice as great as Fizeau's might suggest the possibility of
H mistake between b and 2//.       The author has certainly not made any
such mistake, for the mode of calculation employed yields b directly,
and the values afforded were 74 and 64 respectively.               The increment
Aa/A0 (Fizeau's 6 being the author's /) is equally certainly 2b. More
over, the author's value of the increment for aluminium, 2-12, calcu
lated in precisely the same manner, agrees fairly with the value given
by Fizeau, 2-29, in the same table in which the values for nickel and
cobalt are published.       It may be that Fizeau inadvertently gave the
value of  l> instead of 26 in the particular cases of nickel and cobalt, but
it is much more likely that the numbers are correctly given, and that his
results were not very concordant with those now given. For Fizeau could
certainly not have possessed specimens of nickel and cobalt of the same
degree of purity as those supplied to the author by Professor Tilden. The
recent discovery of nickel carbonyl has afforded an incomparable means

 of separating the two metals, and also of isolating nickel from other
 metallic impurities.       Further, the discrepancy between the increment
 values of the author and of Fizeau for these metals is only of the same
 order as that between the concordant             values of the author and of
  Benoit, 0'46, on the one hand, and of Fizeau, 0'76, on the other, for
  the 10 per cent, alloy of platinum-iridium, the value for which Fizeau
 gives in the same table referred to.
     Taking, therefore, the values published by Fizeau for the increments
 of nickel and cobalt as correctly representing the results of his experi
 ments, his values of the coefficients at 0°, the constants     :t, calculated by
 use of the increment,     are as  under : —
       Nickel            n = 0-000 012 51

     At  100° the coefficients  would become—
       ££::::::: :
     The values thus calculated for the expansion at 0J from Fizeau's
 data are almost identical with the author's values.         But the consider
 able difference between the values and the order of the increments now
 given and those of Fizeau introduces a different order of progression
 with rise of temperature.        According to Fizeau the difference between
 the coefficients of the two metals is a diminishing one, the percentage
 difference having fallen from 3'8 at 0° to 2'9 at 100°; whereas the
author's determinations       indicate that the difference is an accelerating
one, rising from 3'2 per     cent,  at 0° to 4'3 at 100°.
" On the Waters of the Salt Lake of Urmi." By 11. T. GUNTHBK,
       M.A., and J. J. MANLEY, Daubeny Curator, Magdalen College.
       Communicated by Sir JOHN MURRAY, F.E.S.                  lleceived June
       8,— Head June 15, 1899.
    In June, 1897, a portion of the Government Grant was allotted to
one of the authors by the Committee of the .Royal Society, for the
investigation of the fauna and flora of the great salt lake of Umii, iri
Persia, as well as of the relations of that fauna and flora to its environ
ment.      The present research was undertaken with the view of placing
on record some of the conditions prevailing in the lake at the present
day.
    The extraordinary changes which the level of the waters of the lake
has undergone, and is still undergoing, enhance the importance of
periodical examinations of the nature of the waters.          The advisability
of the preservation    of such records was urged upon the Royal Society

                On the Waters of the Salt Lake                    of Urmi.           313
 by its Secretary, 184 years ago. Edmund Halley, in his "Short
 Account of the Cause of the Saltness of the Ocean, and of the several
 Lakes that emit no Rivers," expressed himself as follows : — " I recom
mend it therefore to the Society, as opportunity shall offer, to procure
 the Experiments to be made of the present degree of Saltness of the
 Ocean, and of as many of these Lakes as can be come at, that they may
 stand upon Record for the benefit of future Ages."* At the present
 day there are additional reasons for recording the properties and com
 position of such salt lakes as are known to be inhabited by life, because
Schmankewitscht and many others of the modern school of Entvnckel-
ungsmechanik (Morgan, Loeb, Vernon, &c.) have proved that every
change in the salinity of the waters is accompanied by definite, rapid,
and corresponding changes in the anatomical structure of certain of
their halophilous fauna, and especially of the species of Artemia, one/
of which occurs in Lake Urmi.J
    The superficial area covered by Lake Urmi is about 1750 square
miles, or about four times that of the Dead Sea. For so large an expanse
of water its depth is inconsiderable ; the greatest soundings do not
exceed 40 feet, and since much of the lake is extremely shallow, its
average depth is probably under 20 feet.            When viewed from the
commanding heights      of one of its islands, its waters show that brilliant
deep blue colour which is so characteristic of salt lakes, but as seen
from a boat, the light which is reflected from the light grey mud at the
bottom is green.
   The temperature of so small a volume of water, which is at the same
time so extended as Lake Urmi, must necessarily vary considerably with
the seasonal changes of temperature. During the months of July and
August the temperature of the surface waters varied from 27'8° C. to
25-8° C., and the temperature of the bottom water at a depth of about
25 feet was 25° C. The specific gravity of the water, as measured on
the spot by an ordinary hydrometer, was I'1l, whether the water was
drawn from near the bottom or from the surface of the lake ; it may
therefore be assumed that the waters of the lake remote from the
mouths of the fresh water tributaries were of a fairly uniform density,
a result which was probably due to the thorough mixing of the waters
produced by the strong south-easterly breezes prevalent at the time.
   The total quantity of water available for the more detailed examina
tion was brought home in two glass wine bottles, holding about f litre
a-piece.  The samples A and B were collected on September 16, 1898,
near the base of the Bezau Daghi, on the western shore of the lake,
where there is comparatively deep and clear water close in shore.   The
bottles were carefully corked, and it             is,

     It is believed   that similar optical measurements will be found to be

                           Determination of Boiling Point.
     It has long been customary to record the boiling points of strongly
  saline natural waters, but in only too many cases, owing to the lack of
  description of the conditions of the experiment, the records have only
  a small value.     Many trials have convinced us that the boiling points
  of brines properly determined under similar conditions yield as reliable,
  although less minute, information concerning the degree of salinity
  as specific gravity determinations.
     The salt water was boiled in a platinum bottle, to which an inverted
  condenser containing ice-cold water was attached, in order to prevent

loss of water vapour and consequent concentration.              The temperature
was measured by a form of platinum resistance thermometer, which
reads   to 0-01° C.        Three readings were always taken.          Firstly, the
temperature      of the steam from ordinary boiling water in a steam jacket
and under atmospheric pressure ; secondly, the temperature of the
boiling salt water ; and finally, the temperature of steam once more.
If the first and last readings were identical, it was considered that the
conditions of the experiment had remained constant.              As a matter of
practice it was found that when once the boiling point of the salt
water had been reached, the water continued to boil at that tempera
ture for any length of time, so long as the pressure remained constant.

    It will thus be seen that the three results of the physical examina
tion of the two samples A and B are all mutually confirmatory, in so
far that they indicate that sample B had become a little more concen
trated than A during its journey from Persia to Oxford.

Report onjthe Composition of Ocean Water.*
    For the estimation of the lime and magnesia, 20 c.c. of the water,
weighing approximately 22-2 grams, were measured off, and the quan
tities used in the determination of the potash and total salts were half
that amount.

recommends, because when the latter reagent was used the magnesia was
found to come down very slowly and to adhere inconveniently to the
sides of the vessel.

converted into normal sulphates, and the weight of the mixed sul
phates is diminished by the subtraction of the weights of the potas

This may     be  interpreted     as a train of waves of amplitude     R, period
2-ir/u, and phase   f , travelling with velocity V.     This train of waves is
without beginning or end. Most of the results of physical optics have
direct application to a disturbance of the above form.
    No radiation is found in nature which has the properties of the
above function.         The fact alone that all natural radiations have
beginning and end would suffice to render (1) an inadequate repre
sentation.
    It  is required to solve the problem how to represent any natural
radiation faithfully without losing the conveniences connected with
the form (1).      The problem recalls the familiar process of harmonic
analysis.     This process is applicable only to periodic functions,
whereas such a motion of the {ether as constitutes white light is
non-periodic.     In this connection it has been pointed out by Gouy

It is proved in the course of the present paper that this process is
always legitimate when f(t) is such a function of time as can occur in
a physical problem.
   The above theorem reduces f(f) to the limit of a sum of simple
circular function of time, the element being du(C cos ut + S sin ut). If
we write this du . R cos (ut + ^), a simple vibration of amplitude Rrfw,
period 2ir/u and phase ^ is suggested. To connect this analysis with
the physical analysis of light into a continuous spectrum is tempting.
The present essay is an attempt to prove that, in certain very general
cases, such a connection      exists.    The proof depends upon the two
principles        that we can have no cognizance of instants of time, but
                  (i)

rather with small ranges of wave-length.

" On Diselectrification produced by Magnetism.    Preliminary
    Note."   By C. E. S. PHILLIPS.    Communicated     by Sir
    WILLIAM CROOKES. F.R.S. Received June 13, — Read June 15,
      1899.
    The writer has found, that, under certain conditions, an electrified
body rapidly loses its charge when in the neighbourhood of a magnetic
field.   Nor does    so far, appear essential that there be any relative
                     it,
motion between the lines of magnetic force and the charged body
itself.
    Preliminary experiments have been made with apparatus consisting
of a glass tube six inches long and one inch in diameter, at the centre
of which there was cemented upon both the inner and outer surfaces,
a strip of tin-foil one inch wide.      Suitable connections were then
arranged for the purpose of charging either of these metallic layers
by means of an electrical machine.        The pole-pieces of a powerful
electro-magnet projected into each end of the glass tube, through an
air-tight flange, and in such   a manner as to ensure the production of
a  strong magnetic field at the central portion of the tube. A Sprengel
air-pump was used to rarefy the gas within the tube, and, in the first
instance, the inner coating of tin-foil was charged positively.
   This charge gave rise to the well known free positive and bound
                                                                 a
negative charge upon the outer tin-foil coating, the presence of the
former being indicated by the divergence of the leaves of an electro
scope connected to that coating.       While the pressure of the gas
within the glass tube was varied over    a   range of from atmospheric
pressure to that represented by 0'2 mm. of mercury, the charge upon
the inner coating being either positive or negative showed no appreci
able indication of being affected by the turning on or off of the
magnet.    But at pressures lower than 0'2 mm., and when the inner
coating  was positive, the sudden collapsing of the electroscope leaves
pointed to the removal of the charge through the action of starting
or stopping the magnetic flux. Although the effect was more power
ful at the moment of making or breaking the magnet circuit,      it  per
sisted in a modified degree as long as the magnetic field existed.     No
such effect was observed when the inner coating was negatively
charged, nor was there any action even in the first case when the
magnetic pole-pieces, projecting into the tube, were magnetised so as to
be either both north or both south.
   The leaves of the electroscope were then connected to one of the
internal pole-pieces, and  it  was seen that if  sufficient positive elec
tricity were supplied to the inner coating while the magnet was excited,
it became rapidly withdrawn, and ultimately resided upon the pole-
pieces themselves.

    For an accurate prediction of the return of the Great Leonid swarm
of meteors, it is of the highest importance to determine as accurately
as possible the      orbit in which each part of the swarm is moving.
    As has been pointed out by Drs. Stoney and Downing,* the denser
part of the stream, with which we are chiefly concerned, being now
drawn out to such a length that it takes more than two years to pass
any point of the orbit, it results that the perturbing effect of the
several planets will not be the same on different parts of the stream.
    Hence it follows that the orbit deduced from the observations made
during the great shower of 1866, however reliable they may have been,
must not be assumed to represent accurately the track of the meteors
which we shall meet when we pass through the node of the orbit next
November, even when allowance is made for the perturbations which
that part of the stream has suffered in the meanwhile.
   But although the determinations of the radiant point of the shower
made in 1866 are entitled to a high degree of confidence, owing to the
large number of meteors upon which they depend, yet the discrepancies
existing between the results of different observers, and the fact that
the varying effect of the earth's attraction upon the position of the
radiant at different zenith-distances was generally overlooked by the
observers at the time, introduce an element of uncertainty into the orbit.
    The extent of these discrepancies may be estimated from the " List
of Observed Places of the Radiant Point in 1866," as given by Professor
                                '

elements deduced by Adams and Schiaparelli, respectively, from English
observations of the radiant point on that occasion.                 These are —

322     Dr. A. A. Eambaut.              On the Orbit     of the Part of the
   The part of the stream through which the earth will pass this year
lies between the position of those meteors which the earth encountered
last year and that of the meteors of 1866. It               is,
                                                  therefore, of import
ance to investigate how far the orbit of the meteors observed in
November, 1898, agrees with that deduced from the observations of
1866.
    Unfortunately the observations obtained in 1898 are fewer than
could be desired.      Unfavourable weather prevailed almost universally
in England. On the Continent meteors were observed at a few stations,
but they appear to have been outlying members of the stream, and the
denser portion was not encountered until about 19 hrs. G.M.T., on the
morning of November 15 (civil time).        For observations at the time
that the earth was passing through the densest part of the stream, we
are wholly dependent upon the American observers. The time of maxi
mum display     is,owing to the paucity of meteors, somewhat indefinite,
and seems to have differed by several hours at different stations.     The
most reliable accounts, however, agree in placing        between 19 hrs.
                                                                  it
30 min. and 22 hrs. G.M.T. on the morning of the 15th, and from               a
discussion of all the separate determinations,    have been led to adopt
                                                        I
20 hrs. 45 min. as the most probable time of maximum.         This agrees
                                                         "
exactly with Professor Young's result, who writes, The maximum
was about   3   hrs. 45 min. (Eastern Standard Time) when for about
20 minutes the meteors averaged two or three       minute."*
                                                          a
                         —
    In Table are given the name of the observer, his observatory or
            I
station, its longitude and latitude, the Greenwich time, and the R.A.
and declination of the radiant point.
    In this connection    may remark that in order to contribute to an
                           I
accurate determination of the orbit, the G.M.T. corresponding to the
observation, and the approximate position of the observer are just as
essential as the co-ordinates of the radiant itself.     In several of the
accounts before us        have had to assume that the position of the
                          I
radiant corresponds to the time given as that of maximum display, or
 to the middle of the time over which the watch extended.
    The longitudes and latitudes of the observers' positions may also
 in some cases be in error to the extent of several minutes, but they are
 sufficiently exact to enable me to compute the
                                                 " zenith-attraction."
    In TableI,  I   have included only those observations which seem to
 relate to meteors belonging to the dense, or central, part of the stream.
 They are all contained in the interval between 18 hrs. 58 min. and
 23 hrs.2   min. G.M.T.
    Each of these separate results has to be corrected for the influence
 of the earth's attraction on the paths of the meteors during their
 approach, and for the influence of the earth's motion on the apparent
 position of the radiant.

                        "
elongation from the apex," or the point of the heavens towards which
the earth is moving at the time. It has always the effect of displacing
the radiant towards the observer's zenith, and hence has been called
                                        -
                       " zenith-attraction." The amount of this

                                        w+u
in which z is the apparent zenith-distance of the radiant, u is the velo
city of the meteors relatively to the earth before the influence of the
earth's attraction has become sensible, while w is the accelerated
velocity with which the meteor encounters the earth.
   This displacement, which has been too frequently overlooked by
meteor observers, may, as pointed out by Schiaparelli, amount in
extreme cases to as much as 25° 38'. In the case of the Leonids, how
ever, it happens that the elongation of the radiant from the " apex is
                                                                                "

so small (in the case before us not exceeding 1 1 at any time) that the
effect of the zenith-attraction never amounts to half a degree, its
greatest value being 29'.
   For computing the value of w we have the expression
r being the earth's radius, and        g the acceleration     of gravity at the
surface, or, expressing the velocities, as is convenient,        in terms of the
mean velocity of the earth in its orbit,
                              w2 = «2 + 0-141587.
   In computing      the value of Igr in the above expression the Sun's
parallax    has been taken to be 8"-80, and the ratio of the earth's mass to
that of the Sun equal to 1/331,100.
   We thus have for computing w
                   w =   M + [8-84999] x - - [7-39895]    x -g ,
the figures in brackets being the logarithms of the coefficients.
   For determining u we may with quite sufficient precision adopt
Adams's orbit of 1866. Also if U denotes the velocity of the earth at
any time expressed in terms of its mean velocity, and              R its distance
from the Sun, then,

 or, neglecting the second power of the eccentricity we may, without
 loss of accuracy, write U = 1/R.
    In Table    II  are given the values of the Sun's longitude (©), the
 longitude (/), the right ascension («) and the declination (</) of the
 apex, and the orbital velocity of the meteors (v), all of which can be

orbit of the meteors at the point where the earth intersects              and                                                  it,

    From the researches of the late Professor H. A. Newton, and the
results of the investigations of Drs. Stoney and Downing on the per
turbations of Adams's orbit, the most probable value of the period of
revolution would appear to be at present about 33-49 years, corre
sponding to mean distance of 10-39.
    Any admissible variation in the length of the period, however, makes
but a small change in the other elements of the orbit, as is evident
from Table V, in which the elements in each column have been com
puted with the value of the mean distance which is contained in it.

    In 1886, Professor Callendar       drew attention to the method of
 measuring temperature, based on the determination of the electrical
 resistance of a platinum wire.        He showed that the method was
capable of a very general application, and that the platinum resistance
 thermometer was an instrument giving consistent and accurate results
 over a very wide temperature range.
     Callendar pointed out that if R0 denote the resistance of the spiral
 of a particular platinum thermometer at 0°, and Et its resistance at
  100°, we may establish for the particular wire a temperature scale,

 323       A   Comparison    of Platinum and Gas       Thermometers.
 which we may call the s<ale of platinum temperatures, such that if R be
 the resistance at any temperature T°, this temperature on the platinum
                    T>
 scale  will  be =     ^- x 100   degrees.    For this     quantity  Callendar
                 KI —
                       KO
 employs    the symbol pt, its value depending     on the sample of platinum
 chosen.
    In order to reduce to the standard scale of temperature the indica
 tions of any platinum thermometer, it is necessary to know the law
 connecting T and pt. These are, of course, identical at 0° and 100°,
 but the determination of the curve expressing the relationship between
 them is a matter for experiment.
    The work of Callendar had established for a particular sample of
 platinum the relation
                       rf =  T-^     =  Srm2-^i      looj
                                          L\ioo/
 over the range 0° to 600°,    T being    measured on the constant     pressure
air scale.
    Later experiments by Callendar and Griffiths showed that this
 relation holds for platinum wires generally, provided they are not
very impure. They propose that the value of S, the constant em
ployed in the formula, should be determined by taking the resistance
of the thermometer in the vapour of sulphur. A new determination
of this point on the air scale made by them gave 444'53°, as the
boiling point under 760 mm. pressure.
    The present paper is the outcome of the co-operation of the Kew
Observatory Committee and the authorities of the International
Bureau of Weights and Measures at Sevres, for the purpose of
carrying out a comparison -of some platinum thermometers with the
recognised international standards.
    A new resistance-box, designed for this work, and special platinum
thermometers together with the other accessories needed were con
structed for the Kew Committee, and after their working had been
tested at Kew, were set up at the laboratory at Sevres in August,
 1897.   The comparisons executed between these instruments and the
standards of the Bureau may be divided into several groups.                The
first group of experiments covers the range        -  23° to 80°, and consists
of direct comparisons       between    each platinum thermometer and the
primary mercury standards of the Bureau. Above 80° the mercury
thermometers were replaced by a gas-thermometer,              constructed   for
measurements up to high temperatures.          The comparisons between 80°
and 200° were made in a vertical bath of stirred oil, heated by different
liquids boiling under varying pressures.        For work above 200° a bath
of mixed nitrates of potash and soda was substituted for the oil tank.
In this bath comparisons of the two principal platinum thermometers
with the gas-thermometer were made up to 460° ; and with a third

             Results  of Experiments   mi Permanent Grass-land.           329
thermometer,     which was provided with a porcelain tube, we were able
to go up to 590°.       Comparisons    of the platinum and gas-scales were
carried out at over 150 different points, each comparison consisting
of either ten or twenty readings of the different instruments.
    By the intermediary of the platinum thermometers a determination
of the boiling point of sulphur on the nitrogen scale was also made.
The mean of three very concordant sets of determinations with the
different thermometers gave 445°'27 as the boiling point on the scale
of the constant      volume  nitrogen thermometer, a value differing only
0°'7 from that found by Callendar and Griffiths for the same tem
perature expressed on the constant pressure air scale.
    If for the reduction of the platinum temperatures in our comparisons
we adopt the parabolic formula, and the value of S obtained by assum
ing our new number for the sulphur-point, we find that below 100° the
differences between the observed values on the nitrogen scale and those
deduced from the platinum thermometer are exceedingly small, and
that even at the highest temperatures the differences only amount
to a few tenths of a degree.
    Full details as to the instruments employed and the methods adopted
are given in the paper.

    The experiments were commenced in 1856, and are still in progress,
so that the present is the forty-fourth year of their continuance.      There

    It was found that the chemical composition of the mixed herbage
was very directly dependent, not only on the seasons and on the sup
plies within the soil, but very prominently also on the description of
plants   encouraged, and on the character of their development; so
that it  was essential to a proper interpretation of the variations in the
chemical composition, to bear in mind the differences in the botanical
composition.      Hence a summary table was given showing the character
istic differences in the botanical composition under the different con
ditions   as  to manuring, the influence of which on the chemical            com
position it  was sought to illustrate.
    As the investigation involved the consideration             of the chemical
composition of the mixed produce of about twenty plots over forty or
more seasons, including the discussion of the results of more than 200
complete analyses of the ashes of the separated or the mixed herbage,
attention was called to the state of existing knowledge as to the role or
function in vegetation of the individual constituents found in the
ashes of plants ; and this was seen to be very imperfect.                Further,
in calculating the percentage composition of the " pure ash," the plan
usually adopted was to exclude not only the sand and charcoal, but
also the carbonic acid.           The authors considered, however, that the
presence    and    the   amount    of carbonic acid associated with the fixed
constituents in plant-ashes was a point of considerable significance ;
and they entered into some detail as to the methods of determining
the carbonic acid in ashes, and as to the results obtained.
    In order to throw some light on the connection between the growth
of the crops and their mineral composition, results' relating to the
separated    gramineous,       the separated     leguminous,  and the separated
 " miscellaneous " herbage of the mixed produce, grown without manure
and by different manures, were first discussed.                 To obtain more
definite   evidence     illustrating   the   connection  between   character  and
stage of growth        and the composition of the products — especially the
ash-composition     —   results relating to the bean plant, taken at succes
sive periods of growth, and also to the first, second, and third crops of
 clover, were    next considered.        Lastly, in further illustration, results
as to the    nitrogen and the ash-composition of crops of three different
 natural orders — wheat representing the Gramineae, Swedish turnips the
 Crucifera, and beans and clover the Leguminoseae— were given.
    The general result was, that there were very characteristic differ
 ences in the composition of the ashes of different crops according to
 the amounts of nitrogen they assimilated.              Red clover, for example.
yields large     amounts     of  nitrogen   over  a given area, part of which is
due to fixation, but much is certainly taken up as nitrates from the
soil ; and the results show, that the greater the amount of nitrogen
assimilated    the more is the ash characterised        by containing fixed base
in combination       with carbonic      acid  ; presumably representing organic

           JKesults  of Experiments on Permanent Grass-land.             331
acid in the vegetable substance before incineration.         The conclusion
was that, independently of any specially physiological function of the
bases, such as that of potash in connection with the formation of
carbohydrates, for example, their office was prominently also that of
carriers of nitric acid, and that when the nitrogen had been assimilated,
the base was left as a residue in combination with organic acid — which
was represented by carbonic acid in the ash. Further existing knowledge
— as to the condition in which combined nitrogen is found in soil waters,
as to the action of nitrates used as manures, as to the presence of
nitrates in still-growing plants, and as to the connection between the
nitrogen assimilated and the composition of the ash as had been illus
trated — pointed to the conclusion that, at any rate a large amount of
the nitrogen of the chlorophyllous vegetation on the earth's surface was
derived from nitrates ; whilst, so far as this was the case, the raison
d'etre of much of the fixed base found in the ashes of plants would
seem to be clearly indicated.
   The various results and conclusions     above referred to were found to
afford material aid in the interpretation of the differences in the
chemical composition of the mixed herbage of the different plots which
was next considered, so far as the first crops over the first twenty
years were concerned.
   For the purposes of the illustrations the differently manured plots
were arranged in four groups as follows : — 1. Plots without manure or
with farmyard manure.          2. Plots with nitrogenous manures alone.
3.  Plots with mineral manures alone.        4. Plots with nitrogenous and
mineral manures together.          Average results for each plot, generally
for a period of eighteen years, 1856 — 1873, and including the per
centages of nitrogen, crude ash, and pure ash, in the dry substance of
the produce ; also the percentage composition of the pure ash were
brought together in a table, and are discussed in detail. The close
dependence of the chemical composition of the mixed herbage on its
botanical composition, and on the character of development of the
plants, was throughout illustrated.        It was further shown, that the
mineral composition of the mixed herbage was very directly dependent
on the supplies available to the plant within the soil.     Indeed, when it
was considered that the mixed herbage of permanent grass land
includes plants of very various root-range and root-habit, and that
some of them vegetate more or leas almost the year round, it was not
surprising to find that the composition of the produce was, upon the
whole, a somewhat close reflection of the available supplies within the
range of the roots.      It was, in fact, much more so than in the case of
individual crops grown separately.       Within certain limits, this was the
case even with the constituents of, so to speak, less functional im
portance than those which more obviously determined the description
of plants encouraged and the character of their development.        It was at

332        ResvMs   of Experiments    on Permanent Grass-land.
the   same time   obvious,   that when the more functionally important
constituents are available in relative abundance, those which are of leas
importance in this respect were taken up and retained in less amount
than they otherwise would be; the result being determined in great
measure by the character of growth induced.
   For example, if potash      be liberally available the produce is much
more stemmy, and the amount of soda, of lime, and to some extent of
magnesia also, will be less relatively to the potash.      In defect of suffi
cient potash, on the other hand, more of soda, or of lime, or of both,
will be taken up and retained ; but the herbage will at the same time
be more leafy and immature.        That is to say, the constituents are not
mutually replaceable in the processes of growth, but accordingly as the
one or the other predominates,         so will the product of growth be
different.
   There can be no doubt, that luxuriance or vegetative activity is
intimately associated with the amount of nitrogen available and taken
up.    Further, it may be stated that chlorophyll formation to a great
extent follows nitrogen assimilation. But. the results relating to the
increased amount of non- nitrogenous substance yielded in the mixed
herbage under the influence of the various manures clearly indicated that
the nitrogen being taken up, and the chlorophyll formed, the carbon
assimilation, and the carbohydrate formation, depended essentially on
the amounts of potash available.         It may be stated as a matter of
fact that, in practical agriculture, artificial nitrogenous manures are
chiefly used for crops containing a comparatively low percentage of
nitrogen in their dry substance, and yielding comparatively low
amounts of nitrogen per acre.        Indeed, they are mainly used for the
increased production of the non-nitrogenous bodies — the carbohydrates
— starch and cellulose in the cereals, starch in potatoes, and sugar in
the sugar-cane and in root crops, for example.       And now, in the case
of the mixed herbage of grass land, it was seen that, provided the
mineral constituents, and especially potash, were abundantly available,
a characteristic   effect  of nitrogenous    manures   was  to increase   the
production of the non-nitrogenous bodies.

       Orientation of the Pyramids and Temples          in   the S'Addn.     333
" On the Orientation of the Pyramids and Temples in the Sudan."
     By E. A. WALLIS BUDGE, M.A., LittD., D.Lit., F.S.A. Com
     municated by Professor Sir NORMAN LOCKYER, K.C.B., F.R.S.
     Received April 14, 1899.
   In the year 1897        I   was sent on a mission    to the Sudan by the
Trustees of the British Museum, and in 1898 I          was again sent to that
country to complete the work in the places which I could not reach the
year before on account of the unsettled state of that unhappy land.
By the favour of Viscount Cromer and Lord Kitchener, the Sirdar of
the Egyptian army, I was enabled to visit sites which had not been
visited by Europeans for a great many years, and, by the unusual
facilities which these gentlemen afforded me, to make notes on matters
of scientific interest which have, in recent years, been widely dis
cussed.    Besides the examination of the nuns of temples and the copy
ing  of  the inscriptions which the hand of time had spared, my wish
was to collect, so far as possible, accurate information concerning the
orientation of the pyramids in the Sfldan, and to obtain measurements
of them with special reference to the work which Professor Sir Norman
Lockyer and Mr. Penrose           have   done on the temples    of   Egypt and
Greece respectively.
   It will be remembered      that a few years ago Sir Norman Lockyer
 promulgated the theory that Egyptian temples and pyramids were
 oriented to certain stars, which were sacred to certain Egyptian
 divinities, and to the sun at certain points of his course. Having
 worked through all the available material which had been collected by
 himself and others, he came to the conclusion that his theory was
 correct, and that with accurate data in his hands concerning a given
 temple or pyramid, the astronomer would be able to supply the archaeo
logist with a tolerably correct idea of the date when the site was first
 covered by a religious or funeral edifice. In the Dawn of Astronomy
                                                   '                     '
-a number of test cases were discussed with results which convinced me
 of the truth of the theory ; and Mr. Penrose, working on the same
 lines, applied it to the temples of Greece with such remarkable results
 that my conviction was strengthened.      It must, however, be admitted
 that several difficulties still remain to be cleared away, but I think
 that these will disappear when the temples and pyramids of Egypt
have been measured and surveyed according to modern requirements.
For no one can fail to notice that the plans published, even those in
the great work of Lepsius, present inaccuracies of a serious kind,
especially when we consider that a variation of a few degrees will
wreck the most careful calculation. The object of the present paper
is to inquire   if,   and how far, the pyramids of the Sudan are oriented

according to any definite plan, and to put on record for the use of
those interested in the subject such notes and figures as I was able to
make.
   The pyramid fields of the Sudan may be enumerated as follows : —
(1) Kurru, (2) Zuma, (3) Tankassi, (4) Gebel Barkal, (5) Nurt or
Nawari, (6) Merawi, i.e., the Meroe of the Greeks.              The pyramids
which stood upon these sites of which any remains at all exist are in
number about two hundred, and it is quite certain that those which
have been destroyed may be reckoned at another two hundred at least.
But a pyramid field to be useful for working out the theory of orienta
tion according to a certain plan must possess certain characteristics,
such as the following : — (1) The pyramids upon it must be in a good
state of preservation at their bases, and all should not, if possible, be
oriented in the same direction.          (2) One or more temples should be
either on or  near  the  pyramid  field,  so that the direction of the orienta
tion of both kinds of buildings may be readily compared.           Now, every
pyramid which I have seen in the Sudan, with the exception of those
of Nuri, consists not of a solid mass of cut stones carefully built up

                                                         it   is
which    has worked  its ruin.   For  the  rain has run through the flat
layer of stones at the top in large quantities, and in passing between
the stones at the sides, which are built without mortar, has taken with
it the lime and sand from the inside    ; a hollow has thus been formed
round the core, and the stones, aided by the furious winds which rage
in the Sudan at certain times of the year, have by their own weight
fallen in upon it. Sometimes the casing has been built at too steep an
angle, and the upper parts of the sides have fallen in or fallen out, ao
the case may be.
   Yet another reason for the rain of the Sudan        pyramids must be
mentioned.     The stones of which  the sides are built, unlike the stones
which form the pyramids of Egypt, are relatively small, and the
natives have found them to be admirably adapted for certain purposes.
As   aresult they have been filched from their places, and used to make
the foundations of water-wheel supports and of houses, and also to line
the shallow trenches in which the Muhammadans           have buried their
dead for countless generations.    Thus the pyramids have, one by one,
been stripped of their stone coverings, and the wind and rain together
have beaten the cores so much out of shape that            sometimes diffi
                                                           it   is

distance from cultivated land,            are the best preserved, and this is only
what might be expected.                 When a native wanted stones for any pur
pose, he went for them to the pyramid which was nearest to him, and
the result is that the pyramids which stood near the villages or culti
vated land have in some districts quite disappeared.     Thus at Tan
kassi, about seven miles from Senem abu-D6m, where the Egyptian
troops were encamped about eighteen months ago, it is most difficult
to identify the cores of the pyramids which once stood there.      At
Gebel Barkal the pyramids which were nearest to the cultivated land
have disappeared, and the same may be said of dozens of the small
pyramids which stood at Nuri.  At Meroe the pyramids, which were
built near the temple that stood only about a mile from the river, and
were in consequence close to the main road which has been the high
way to Khartum and the south for countless generations, have also all
but disappeared.
   In this way the six pyramid fields of the Sudan become reduced to
three, for those of Kurru, Zuma, and Tankassi may well be left out of
consideration.       It  is,however, tolerably clear from the general dispo
sition of the pyramid remains at these places, that the system of
orientation employed by the builders of the pyramids there resembled
that found to have been in use at Gebel Barkal, Nuri, and Meroe.
With the view of showing the present condition of the pyramids of the
three principal fields in the Sudan,            I took about fifty photographs,
one of which   is   reproduced in this paper.        Some such record was abso
lutely necessary,       for     the

 the mountain lies the pyramid field, and the remains of the ancient
 city of Napata must be sought for some five or six miles further south.
 On the western bank of the Nile there must have stood a great city,
 with many temples, palaces. and other great buildings, for on several
 occasions when the Egyptian troops have had to build block houses
 and other military works, portions of large columns, pottery, :fec., have
 been found in digging out the foundations.       The site of this city is
 probably marked accurately by the modern village of Senem abu-Dom ;

 away back in the desert, at a distance of about two hours from the
 river, in a ran*e of low sandstone hills.

     Of the pyramids at Gebel Barkal some are in ruins and some are
  tolerably complete ; the former are useless for purposes of measure
  ment, because the broken sides and the dflris round the bases make it
  impossible to get accurate compass bearings.       I therefore made no

 masonry, they cannot be relied upon to nearer than 2'.                           The distances

plumb-lines for finding the nlignments, but a steel tape stretched horizontally

338           Dr. E. A. Wallis Budge.       On the Orientation
at 140°, one at 122°, one at 147°, and one at 139°.     Of all the temples
which have been built at the foot of Gebel Barkal only two have any
substantial remains, viz., those of Piankhi and Tirhakah ; the orienta
tion of the former is 127" from the true north, and that of the kitter
143°.    Now it seems to me that we may fairly assume that both these
kings, with their ancestors and successors, were buried near their
temples ; indeed from a common-sense point of view there was no
place more suitable for their tombs than the neighbouring hill or
mountain slope. I searched diligently, hoping that I might find some
trace upon some of the blocks of stone which had formed the shrines
or funeral chapels that had stood in front of their pyramids, but with
out success.    Every pyramid at Gebel Barkal must have had such a
shrine or chapel, but the size of the chapel depended upon the import
ance of the man whose tomb the pyramid was intended to cover.
Pyramids Nos. 6 and 7 on the plan must, judging by the ruins, have
had very large shrines enclosed by walls, and we may assume, from the
absence of similar buildings in the fronts of the other pyramids, that
they were royal tombs. The masonry, however, and the general appear-
anee of them somehow suggest that they were not the oldest of the
group, though, arguing from archaeological considerations, they should
be as old as B.C. 700.
   Passing to the most northerly end of the pyramid field of Gebel
Barkal, we find lying there the remains of a " step pyramid, and as it
                                                      "
has an entirely different orientation from that of the other pyramids
there, and the masonry is of a better class of work, and the whole
building is on a scale mi generis, it is clear that it belongs to a
different period.    It is a striking fact that archaeological considera
tions indicate that the pyramids which have different orientations
belong to different periods, and at the end of this paper it will be seen
that the results deduced from astronomical considerations point the
same way.
   The official instructions which  I received before I went to the Sudan
in  1897  allowed me to make a trial excavation of one pyramid.           I
therefore selected No. 5 of my plan, as on its shrine there were sculp
tured scenes in which funeral offerings were being made to the royal
personage who had the pyramid built, by priests, by Anubis the god
of the dead, and by a number of gods whom it is not easy to identify.
This royal personage was assumed to have identified himself with
Osiris, and the goddesses who usually attended the god were here seen
attending the king or prince.        That he was royal there is no doubt,
for one relief showed him in the act of grasping the hairy scalps of
representatives of a number of captive or subdued nations, and brand
ishing a Sudan! club over them, much in the same way as the kings of
the XVIIIth and XlXth dynasties of Egypt are depicted on the walls
of their tombs and palaces. To indicate the greatness and power of

the king his figure had been made very large, a custom common among
savage or semi-savage tribes ; the figures of the vanquished were small,
and were huddled together.
    Tt> make certain that the mummy chamber was not in the pyramid
 itself, the stones from one corner, about half way up, were removed,
and a boring was made to the length of several feet ; but it was soon
 evident that the core of the pyramid was not made of masonry, but of
stone, sand, lime, &c., roughly mixed together.            This being so, the
 hole was filled up, and the stones replaced in the casing work.
    As soon as this trial work was done, by the help of the British
officers, about forty men were collected, and, provided with a few tools
and a good number of baskets, we began to search for the pit which
 led to the mummy chamber, which seemed to be below the ground. A
 trench was dug round all four sides, and at length a large flat slab of
hard stone, 10 feet by 6 feet by 10 inches, set in lime, was found on
 the S.E. side of the pyramid'; this was broken through, and the layers
of lime and sand which came beneath showed that we had reached the
 mouth of the pit or shaft.       We toiled through 60 feet of rough con
 crete in about four weeks, and at length reached a rectangular chamber
about 9 feet cube, hewn, like the pit, out of the solid rock ; the roof of
 this chamber was supported upon square pillars. A narrow passage on
the S.E. side of the chamber led into another chamber which had
square pillars likewise ; both chambers were half filled with sand.        On
the sand at the foot of the shaft or pit we found some bleached
bones and a broken wine jar, upon which were inscribed the words
O1N02 POAIO2, ».«., "Rhodian wine." The bones were like the
bones of a small sheep, but they fell into dust when touched, and I
 could not therefore bring them home.        The broken wine jar is a most
interesting object, for it enables us to arrive at the date when it. was
 put into the tomb.       We know from several sources that Khodian
wine was used extensively during the latter half of the second
century B.C., and the shape of the letters on the jar-neck points to
that date. The jar, then, must have been taken up to Gebel Barkal
from Alexandria, probably by boat, between B.C. 150 and B.C. 50, and
broken in the chamber, which no doubt served as a funeral chapel, at
the last feast of offerings held there.     I do not think that this date is
the date of the building of the pyramid, for it is a well-known fact that
commemorative offerings were made in these chapels as long as funds
for the purpose were forthcoming. Tombs of royal personages and of
people of high rank were kept open by the priests for the express
purpose of inducing relatives and friends to contribute offerings,
chiefly in kind, at stated seasons of the year, and if a proof be wanted of
this statement it is sufficient to refer to Diodorus Siculus,* who says in
his history that he visited the halls and the chapels of the royal tombs
                          * He visited Egypt  B.C. 57.

 340          Dr. E. A. Wallis Budge.      On the Orientation
 in the Valley of the Kings at Thebes.      Now we know that several of
 these tombs were built 1,300 years before the time of this historian,
 and yet they were open to the inspection of visitors, even Greeks, at
 that late date. What the broken wine jar shows us is that the pyra
 mids of Gebel Barkal were not built by late native rulers who flourished
 under the rule of the Greeks and Romans between B.C. 300 and
 A.D. 350, but by native kings of the earlier dynasties who followed
 ancient funeral customs and rites that were known and practised as far
 back as the  Xllth  dynasty of Egypt, about   B.C. 2500.
    But to return to the excavation.     Having removed the sand from
 the chambers, it became evident that neither the pillars nor the walls
thereof    had ever been inscribed    or  sculptured.    A  diligent search
convinced    me that the mummy chamber must be situated somewhere
under the pyramid, and, judging from the analogy of several tombs
 which I excavated with General Sir Francis Grenfell, K.C.B., at
Aswan in 1886-87, it ought to be exactly under its apex, if such a
term may be applied to a truncated pyramid.           Therefore, returning
to the end of the chamber which had been hewn out of the rock
immediately beneath the place where the shrine had stood, we
searched for an entrance which would lead us in under the pyramid.
At length we found that the wall of the chamber at this end con
sisted of a slab of stone about 7 feet by 6 feet by 1 foot 2 inches,
embedded in lime, and when this was broken through we found a
sort of vault, but there was nothing in it. The only thing that
remained to do was to cut into the floor of the vault, and when we
had done this we found that we had arrived at the mouth of a
second pit or shaft, by which the mummy in its coffin must have
been    lowered   into the chamber wherein it was to rest finally.
We worked away at clearing out the pit by candle light under great
difficulties, and when we were about 100 feet below the base of the
pyramid, we began to come near to the short passage at right angles to
the pit, which should have led us into the mummy chamber.           At this
point, however, the sides of the pit became very damp, and everything
which we dug out was thoroughly wet ; a foot or two lower down the
men found themselves in standing water, and at length we had to stop
work. We had reached a depth which had brought us down to the
level of the Nile, and found that its waters had forced their way by
infiltration into the shaft, and presumably into the mummy chamber
also.    This discovery was most disappointing, and one which I think
could hardly have been foreseen.       We were, therefore, obliged to be
satisfied with having demonstrated the plan upon which the pyramid
tomb in the Sudan was built, and its analogy to the rock-hewn tombs
of Egypt of the first twelve dynasties.
   Now it is clear that, when the builders of the pyramids at Gebel
Barkal selected the site for their tombs on the edge of the sandstone

                 of tlw Pyramids and Temples in    the S&ddn.           341
  plateau to the south, it must have been well out of the reach of the
  infiltration of the Nile waters, for they knew from long experience
  that the presence of damp was fatal to the preservation of the mummied
  body.     And besides, it is impossible that they should have gone on
 building pyramid after pyramid at various places on the plateau and
  on the side which slopes down to the river without finding out that the
  water of the Nile was making their labour vain. How then can the
  presence of the water be accounted for 1 The true answer seems to be
  that the bed of the Nile has gradually risen since the time when the
  pyramids were built, and it may be that the river has also somewhat
 changed its course.      A small annual deposit in its bed would easily
 cause both the rise and the change, of course, and as a result certain
 sites which originally stood well above the level of the waters of the
 highest inundation would be flooded from time to time.          The cause
 way leading to the river and the foremost courtyard of the temple of
 Piankhi were flooded by the Nile when I was at Gebel Barkal in 1897,
 and that year the inundation was not by any means one of the highest.
  Had there been any risk of this happening in Piankhi's time he would
 never have built, or rebuilt, the temple, which must have been one of
 the glories of the city of Napata, near the site whereof its remains
 now lie. Thus we see that in the Sudan, as in Egypt, the same geolo
 gical changes have been at work.
    Passing now from Gebel Barkal, we have to consider the pyra
 mids of Nuri, or Belal, which stand on the west bank of the Nile, just
 opposite to the now famous village of Kassingar, and at about a distance
 of six miles as the crow flies from Gebel Barkal.        The value of the
 pyramid field of Nurl for a discussion on the orientation of pyramids
 is not so great as that of the field of Gebel Barkal ; but from other
 points of view it is of very considerable interest.     Its pyramids are
 not so well preserved, and there is not so much variety of orientation
as is usually found in groups of pyramids elsewhere in the Sud&n.
 The largest of the Nurt pyramids must, with the exception of the
 " step " pyramids, have been the
                                     largest in the Sudan, for when com
 plete they cannot have been less than 100 feet high.      Several of them
are built of hewn stones throughout, and the excellence of the mate
 rial and the handy sizes of the stones have tempted the natives to use
them freely for building tombs for their sheikhs and houses and graves
for themselves.      Speaking roughly, the group at Nuri consists of two
rows of pyramids, the older row being that in which stand the remains
of a large " (jj«p pyramid (see Plan II). The next oldest pyramids stand
                   "
in a somewhat irregular row about 200 yards to the S.E., and between
the two rows a number of pyramids were built at a later date, great care
being taken by their builders to place them in such positions that the
light from the celestial body to which they were oriented should not h>e
obstructed by the older buildings.       The first row of pyramids is in

the pyramids in the second row, six are sufficiently well preserved to
afford us a good idea of what they were like when compete.            They
must have stood upon a slightly elevated site, and they could not have
been much less than 100 feet in the side ; on the S.E. side each pyra
mid had a shrine or chapel, into the innermost part of which the light
from the celestial body to which it was oriented could enter.       At each
end of the pyramid field was a temple, the size of which it is impossible

               of the Pyramids and Temples in the Silddn.               343
to guess at without clearing away the tens of thousands of tons of sand
with which the whole site is covered.            That at the N.E. end of the
field is of considerable     interest, for it shows traces of a rebuilding,
during which the orientation angle was altered.           We have seen that
the pyramid field of Gebel Barkal represented the royal necropolis of
the city of Napata on the north ; to what city, then, did the pyramids
of Nuri belong ? In the absence of the definite knowledge which can
only be obtained by excavating, we shall probably be right in regard
ing the pyramid field of Nuri as the royal necropolis of the city the
remains of which now lie beneath the sand at 8enem-abu-D6m.             This
city was certainly older than Napata, and therefore the pyramids
which form the tombs of its royal rulers are older than those of Gebel
Barkal or of any of the other sites which lie further to the south.        A
remarkable fact is that all the pyramids at Nuri, of which tolerably
accurate compass bearings can be taken, are oriented 129° from the
                                                                   "
true north, and that is the angle of orientation of the " step pyramid
at Gebel Barkal.        From archaeological considerations the pyramids,
including   those   built with steps, which have this angle of orientation
should be older than those which have a different angle. The temples in
Nubia and other countries, including Egypt, which have this angle of
•orientation, are as old as the period which lies between the Xllth and
XVIIIth dynasties, and I therefore think that the pyramids of Nuri, at
least the oldest of them, are considerably older than all the pyramids
                                                         "
at Gebel Barkal, with the exception of the " step pyramid. There is
another point to mention : the pyramids at Nuri are on the left bank
of the Nile, like all the ancient pyramids of Egypt, and I think this
 is a strong proof of their great antiquity.     With the making of measure
 ments of the pyramids, and a careful             examination of  the ruined
shrines in the hope of finding inscriptions, my work at Nuri in 1897
came to an end.
    Towards the end of last year I left England for the Sud&n, and
before the end of December, thanks to the facilities afforded me by the
Sirdar, I arrived at the Atbara River.        In due course I was sent on to
a place called Begrawlyyeh, from where I was able to examine the
 remains of the temples and pyramids which mark the site of the
ancient city of Meroe, and of the home of the great queens who ruled
 there under the name of " Candace."           From the spot where I landed,
 the ruins of the great temple of Meroe are about one and a half miles
distant ; by the side of them, running nearly due north and south, is
 the old Khartum road, and in a line almost due east lie two groups of
pyramids, at a distance of about four and a half miles from the river
-as the crow flies.     The shtkh of the district, Muhammad Amin, who
 had been an officer of some rank under General Gordon, gave me
every assistance in his power, but the country had been so ravaged
and wasted by the Dervishes led by Mahmud under the Khalifa's

344            Dr. E. A. Wallis Budge.               On tlie Orientation
orders, thatit was with the greatest difficulty that a couple of donkeys
were found for us to ride upon.   The country is depopulated, and we
saw hundreds of well built houses falling into ruins.
   The first site visited was that of the temple of Meroe, of which
portions of several pillars in situ still remain.          Before any satisfactory
measurements of angles of orientation could be obtained as regards
both the temple and the pyramids, I saw that a good deal of excava
tion and clearing away of dfbvis would have to be done ; but as no
men could be found to do the work- — there being none in the country,
thanks to Dervish rul0 — I had to abandon that idea, and get the best
results I could from the examination of the ruins only.                 The temple
appears    to  have  been  surrounded     by  a  wall   which   was   built at some
considerable distance from       it,  and  avery large number of people could
have assembled in the space between the wall and the temple.                    The
temple was, like most of the Sudan temples, dedicated to the Sun-god
Amen-Ra, whose visible type upon earth was the ram, and clearly the
ram peculiar to that portion of the Sudan.                  Of the shrine nothing
remains, but a figure of     a   ram in hard, bluish-grey stone lay among the
ruins of the pillars. The pyramids, over              hundred in number, which,
                                                      a
are situated at no great distance to the north-east of the temple, are in
ruins, and the masonry which still remains                  of the same class and
                                                           is
style  as  that  of the  most     recent  portions   of  the  temple.     At two or
three places in the plain round about are remains of buildings of the
Roman period, and near one of these was found                    a small Greek in
scription, which brought home
                 I                     ;   it   now in the British Museum.
                                                is
   Passing from the riverside ruins we made our way due east towards
a chain of very low hills that lay in the distance, and after an hour's
ride we arrived at       a  crescent-shaped eminence which stood with its-
convex    side  towards   us.    The top of the eminence was about eighty
feet above the pebbly plain.          When  I  had walked round the pyramids
it was easy to see that they must be divided for purposes of examina
tion into three groups.        The first group stood on the crescent-shaped
eminence mentioned above, and          it  seems as        this site originally con
                                                          if
sisted of a   series of low   hills, from  which   the  tops had been cut off and
thrown into the hollows between to make              level base for the pyramids.
                                                      a
The first group consisted originally of about twenty-five pyramids.
The second group stood away to the south-east, and consisted origin
ally of about twenty-two pyramids.       The third group lay close to the
second, and the pj-ramids     which  belong to       are about twenty in.
                                                           it
                                  •
number.     Of the pyramids of the first group there are abundant
remains, and   it  easy to see that they reproduce all the characteristics
                    is
and all the angles of orientation with which we are familiar from the
pyramids of Gebel Barkal and Nurl, together with some others. Here,
as at Gebel Barkal and Nuri, and the pyramid field to the north-east
if the ruins of the temple of Meroe, we find
                                                  " step " pyramid larger,
                                                          a

               of the Pyramids and Tci/iplcs in   the Silddn.            345
better built, and better   planned   than the other pyramids which stand
                                "      "
near, and in each place this      step   pyramid has an orientation angle
of  129°.
   In Northern Egypt,    as is  well known, all the pyramids are oriented
east and west; and observations show that in Southern Egypt the
" step " pyramids are oriented not east and west, but in another
azimuth facing south-east, with such an amplitude that it could not
have been a question of the sunlight entering the shrine.            We are
therefore driven to star worship.           Now, the chief pyramids in
Northern Egypt date from B.C. 3800 to B.C. 2600; we may expect
therefore that, as the idea of pyramid building was introduced into the
                                                          "
south from the north, the building of the " step            pyramids must
have taken place at a very early date.        Looking  to  this  amplitude it
has already been shown that some of the chief temples of Southern
                                                      "        "
Egypt were oriented to a Centauri.        Taking the     step     pyramid at
{rebel Barkal with an azimuth of 129°, we have an amplitude of 39°
south of east, and, not taking into account refraction and the heights
of the hills on the horizon, which would tend to neutralise each other, we
find the declination of a star thus observed to be 35° 58' south, a posi
tion which the star occupied B.C. 2700. These " step " pyramids then
were probably built under the influence of the kings of the Xlth and
 Xllth dynasties, who were famous for their building operations. This
date will also suit admirably from both an astronomical              and an
archaeological aspect the temple of Piankhi, which has a nearly identi
 cal amplitude. We have to assume therefore that Piankhi, like many
 other kings, simply restored a Xllth dynasty temple.        With regard to
 azimuths from 143° to 150°, I find that the same star, a Centauri,
 might still have been observed, but in this case the building of both
 temple and pyramid must have taken place about the period which lies
 between B.C. 1200 and B.C. 700.          Here, in my opinion, the astro
 nomical determination agrees with the archaeological requirements.
    At Nuri, as at the other places mentioned above, we find numbers
of pyramids with the orientation angles of 122°, 140°, and 147°; and
 the characteristics of the pyramids having the same angle in one place
 are the same as those having the same angle elsewhere.          At Nuri and
 at Begrawlyyeh or Meroe, a considerable number of pyramids have
 exactly the same angle of orientation, viz., 129°, and the number is so
 great that it is clear that we are not dealing with a question of acci
 dent but of design.     The great Lepsius came to the conclusion that
 the pyramids of Nuri looked older, and were older, than the pyramids
 of Gebel Barkal, and my own observations made on the spot convince
 me that his view was right ; and he might have added also that the
 pyramids at Meroe having the same angle of orientation as those at
 NOrl are older than those which have a different angle.          It has been
 said above that of the shrines which originally stood before the

34<5              Dr. E. A. Wallis Budge.            On the Orientation
pyramids of Gebel Barkal and Nurl, few remains exist, but this is not
the case with the pyramids of Meroe, where we have the greater por
tion of many of their shrines still standing in situ.                     These remains
show     that   the  shrines   consisted    of  two, and  sometimes      three,  chambers
with narrow doorways which served, like the various sights and sections
of a telescope, to direct the rays of light from the celestial body to a-
given spot, that spot in the case of a pyramid being the centre of the
shrine where a figure of the deceased was placed.                    On the walls of the
shrines      are   cut   in  outline    figures   of  kings,   armed     with bows and
arrows, and swinging clubs over the heads of a mass of people who
belong to captive races, and in some few cases we have been fortunate
enough to find preserved the names of the kings who built them.                        Now
these names help us to assign a date to the pyramids on which they
are found, and it is thus possible to compare the results derived from
astronomical calculations based upon angles of orientation, and those
which are derived from arehaeological experience.
     For purposes of convenience the so-called kings of Ethiopia have
been divided into four groups : —
     1. The dynasty of Piankhi which ruled in the eighth century B.C.
     2. The dynasty of Tirhakah which ruled about a century later.
     3.  The earlier kings of Meroe who ruled from about B.C. 500 to the
            end of the Ptolemaic period.
     4.  The later kings of Meroe who ruled from the beginning to the
            middle of the Roman domination over Egypt.
     Of   each    of these groups of kings monuments, i.e., temples and
pyramids,       have   been found, and there can be no doubt whatever about
this, for a number of royal names belonging to each of these four
groups have been found inscribed upon them.                      We have already seen
that some of the temples and pyramids of Gebel Barkal belong to the
 period which lies between B.C. 800 and B.C. 600, and it is now clear
 that some of the pyramids of Meroe belong to the period which lies
 I>etween B.C. 500 and A.D. 200.                Here, again, the orientation theory
shows that any shrine built about that time would have been directed
 to the important south star Fomalhaut.                Now we may see from Dr. 0.
 Danckwortt's important inquiries concerning the processional change
 of place of forty-six fundamental stars from B.C. 2000 to A.D. 800,*
 that at zero time the declination of Fomalhaut was 39° south, and that
                                                                   °
 it was slowly changing.            So that a difference of 1 to 40° south would
give us B.C. 300, and to 38° would give us A.D. 200.                         After what I
have said as to the difficulties, almost impossibilities, of determining
exact azimuths, in my mind there now remains no doubt as to the
 time when these shrines were built.                 We have now to consider the

              of the Pyramids and      Temples    in   the   SUddn.            347
date of the pyramids of Nuri, on which no inscriptions have been
found, and the date of some of the pyramids of Meroe on which also
no inscriptions have been found   ;  but before we can arrive at any con
clusion on these points, we must briefly consider the question of the
ancient civilisation of the Sudan and its origin.
   In the first place we must put aside the name Ethiopian which is so
often applied to  it, because there    no evidence whatever to show that
                                      is
                                the term " Ethiopian
                                                       "
it   isof Ethiopian origin  ;                              has been loosely
applied to the ancient peoples of the Eastern Sudan and their works,
just as to any object the source of which was unknown the name
" Phoenician " or " Hittite " has been applied in our own day. The
ancient tribes who lived on the east bank of the Nile from Wadl Haifa
to Khartum were not negroes, and they had but little in common with
the tribes who lived south and west of Khartum            indeed they were
                                                             ;
not  a  black race   at all.  The colour of the  men's   skins was red, not
black, and that of their women, who did not expose themselves to the
sun's rays, was of      yellowish-red.
                        a              Between these peoples and the
ancient Egyptians    more or less friendly intercourse existed from the
                      a
earliest times; otherwise how could the Egyptian officials who were
sent to the Sudan, to the district of " big trees," to bring back huge
tree trunks to cut up for coffins and sarcophagi for their royal masters,
have succeeded in their enterprises   Men sent upon missions of this
                                           ?
kind must have followed the course of the river, for the shorter desert
routes were quite impossible, at any rate on the return journey for
men laden with baulks of timber.           Still more remarkable      is   the fact
that   ahigh official, called Ba-ur-Tattu, in the reign of Assa, about B.c.
3300, travelled as far south as the land of the pygmies, and brought
back one of these folk for the king; and eighty years later Heru-
Khuf, governor of Abu, or Elephantine, did the same thing.
          a                                                                   It   is
difficult to imagine that Egypt could have exercised any great power
over the country south of Wadi Haifa, but that there should have
been     relatively brisk intercourse between Egypt and the Sudan for
          a
trading purposes   is  only natural. Again,       the Egyptians made any
                                                 if
colonies in the south, the introduction of Egyptian civilisation and
religious ideas would inevitably follow, and intermarriages between
Egyptian strangers and natives would take place.             Moreover, the
natives who visited Egypt would bring back with them new ideas,
which in course of time they finally adopted, adding such modifications
as their opinions dictated.     The Egyptian viceroys and Sudan princes
would naturally build temples and tombs (i.e., pyramids) after the
manner of those they found in Egypt, but the orientation of these
would be altered in accordance with the religious views of those who
built them. But suitable sites for temples and pyramids are more rare
in the Sudan than in Egypt, and priests in both countries were unwil
ling to abandon   a   spot which had become associated with sacred beliefs

348           Dr. E. A. Wallis Budge.       On the Orientation
or religious worship.     For this reason they were driven to various
shifts in order to make an old temple suitable for modern require
ments ; and when no amount of modification would suffice they even
tually pulled it down, in whole or in part, and rebuilt it on the    same
site as the old one.
    Since constant intercourse existed between    Egypt and the Sudan in
very early times, and since the people of the one country were influ
enced greatly by those of the other, it is clear that there is no reason
why certain of the Sudan pyramids should not be as old almost as those
of Egypt.     On this point both astronomy and archaeology agree, and
I find, on comparing the tables in the ' Dawn of Astronomy ' and the
deductions which the author has made from them with my own obser
vations made from an archaeological standpoint, that our conclusions
are identical. I may therefore say finally that we seem to be in the
presence of three different sets of structures which were built at three
different  times.   The oldest dates from the       Xllth  dynasty, when
a Centauri was used as a warning star ; the second from B.c. 1200 to
B.c. 700, the same warning star being used ; and, finally, a third group
much later, when the star Fomalhaut could be observed on the horizon
with the identical amplitude first employed.       Tables have been pre
pared showing the various azimuth amplitudes and declinations, with
corrections for refraction and for hills on the horizon, which are esti
mated at 1° or 2° in height; but it is not necessary to give them in
this place because of the local difficulties in determining the azimuths,
to which I have already referred.
   I have very great pleasure in expressing my thanks to Viscount
Cromer, Lord Kitchener (Sirdar of the Egyptian Army), Colonel Sir
Francis Wingate, Colonel Sir Rudolf Slatin Pasha, Major-General Sir
Leslie Bundle, Colonel the Hon. M. G. Talbot, R.E., Colonel W. H.
Drage, D.S.O., and to many other British officers for assistance and
help in the course of my work.        Notwithstanding the incessant and
laborious duties which devolved upon them as officers of a frontier
field force, they readily and freely found time to forward my investi
gations, and but for their many acts of personal kindness I should
have found it impossible to have completed my mission.
    The following table of amplitudes, &c., I owe to the kindness of
Professor Sir Norman Lockyer, K.C.B., F.R.S.

   The Effect of Staleness of the Sexual Cells on the Development
        of Echinoids." By H. M. VERNON, M.A., M.D., Fellow of
        Magdalen College, Oxford.             Communicated       by W. F.      R
        WELDON, F.R.S.          Received  June   27, 1899.
    The effect of varying degrees of staleness of the ova and sperm of
an organism upon subsequent development appears to have been very
little studied, though such a condition must obviously be a factor of
frequent occurrence under natural conditions.            Thus in most of the
Coelentera, Echinoderms, and in some of the worms, it would seem to
be a matter of chance whether the ova and spermatozoa come into
contact when freshly shed, or only many hours after extrusion.                 In
some mammals also, especially in man, the relative degree of freshness
of ovum and spermatozoon at the time of fertilisation is entirely a
matter of chance.
    The chief connection in which the question of staleness has been
hitherto studied is that of polyspermy.             Thus 0. and R. Hertwig
found* that on crossing certain species of Echinoderms, as the ova of
SpJuerechinus gmnularis with the sperm of Strongylocentrotus              lividm,
more and more of the ova were fertilised up to a certain point if they
were kept for an increasing number of hours in sea water, but that
after this point they began to undergo polyspermy in an increasing
degree, and to develop abnormally.             To what precise extent is this
tendency present, however, and how is it affected by the staleness of
the ova on the one hand, and of the sperm on the other 1 Also, do
the normally       developing ova of stale sexual products continue to
•develop equally well with those from fresh products, or not 1               Such
are the questions it is attempted to answer in this paper.
    The method of experiment was very simple.             The ovaries and testes
of ripe specimens of the Echinoid Strong yloccntrotus liindus were shaken
in jars of water, and portions of the contents of these were mixed, either
immediately, or after a given number of hours.              The mixed solutions
 were allowed to stand for an hour, and were then poured into beakers
and diluted with about ten times their volume of water.              Twenty-four
 hours later, some of the stirred up contents were introduced into a
 small glass cell, and a drop of corrosive sublimate solution added to
 kill the blastulae and make them sink to the bottom.            The numbers of
 normally developing blastulae, and of abnormally developing and
 unsegmented       ova were then counted, 300 to 500 being usually
 enumerated,     in    order to get an accurate estimate.        In all cases the
 mixed ova from two or more ripe specimens were used, and were

get as average results as possible.                In the experiments to be sub
sequently described, however, in which the stale ova and spermatozoa
were mixed several different times at a few hours' interval with fresh
sperm and ova, as often as not only one fresh specimen was used in
each case.
    In the subjoined table are given the results obtained in one of the
most complete experiments.               In this case parallel series of determina
tions were made, in which the ova and sperm were kept in, and after
fertilisation diluted with, respectively tank water from the Aquarium,
and pure water collected several kilometres from the shore of the Bay

    It will    be seen that the ova survived better          in the tank water than
in the pure sea water, though            in two other similar series of experiments
the reverse relationship, which one would naturally expect, showed
itself. Of the ova fertilised immediately after shedding,. one may see
that respectively 98-5 and 96'9 per cent, developed to normal blast-nix.
On keeping, the ova in the tank water began at first to deteriorate
more rapidly than those in the pure sea water, but between the 24th
and 27th hours, those in pure sea water suddenly began to fall away,
and after 30£ hours, only 0'25 per cent of the ova remained to undergo
normal development.              The ova kept in tank water, on the other
hand, postponed their rapid degeneration till the 27th to the 35£th
hours, or more especially till the 33rd to the 35£th hours.                In order to
show more strikingly the suddenness of the on set. of this abnormal
development on keeping the ova, another column has been added to
each half of the table, giving the percentage diminution of normally
developing ova per hour.              For instance, after six hours development in
tank water, 3'2 per cent,            less of the ova developed    normally, or, on an

see then, that of the ova developed in tank water, from 0'5 to 1-8 per
cent, per hour underwent abnormal development up to the 27th hour, but
that then the percentage rapidly increased, till from the 33rd to the
35Jth hours, it reached to 13'5 per cent.                    In   the case of the ova kept
in pure sea water, the result was still                  more striking.       Thus till the

but from the 27th to 30£th hour, no less than 18-9 per cent.

    In this next table a similar series of observations is recorded, but in
addition a third series of determinations was made, in which ova and
sperm were kept in about twenty times as great a volume of water as
was used in the other experiments.                   Thus it was thought that perhaps
the keeping together of very large numbers of ova and of spermatozoa
in small volumes of water might tend to increase the rapidity of their
deterioration.           As far as this single result can show, however, just the
reverse is the case.            Thus when only 49,000 ova per litre were kept
 together,      the   maximum       rate of deterioration was reached between the
 9th and 20th hours, whilst when 1,000,000 per litre (about the usual
 state of dilution) were kept, the maximum rate was not reached till
 the 20th to 24th hours.
     In pure        sea   water,   with    a   dilution   of 680,000      ova per litre, the
 maximum rate was also between the 20th and 24th hours, but a fair
 number also degenerated between the 24th and 29th hours.                               In this

     In this next table the results of four series of observations are in
cluded. In the first 'two the relative effects of tank and of pure sea
 water, were again compared.                  In this case the pure water had a much
 better preservative effect, the ova undergoing their maximum deteriora
 tion some ten hours later than those kept in tank water.                                In the
 remaining two series of observations, the sexual products were kept in
 tank water, the maximum rate of deterioration being between the 24th
 and 33rd hours, and the 24th and 32nd hours respectively.                            This last
•experiment is          in  some ways the most striking one made, as 94'8 per
 cent, of the ova developed to blastulte until the 24th hour, whilst by
 the 32nd hour only 0'8 per cent, so developed.
     As a whole, therefore, these observations show a fair amount of con
 stancy-       The mean times of the period of maximum deterioration in
 the various series are respectively 34£, 28f, 22, 14J, 22, 18, 26£, 28£,
and 28 hours, or, on an average, 24|rd hours after the shedding of the
ova and sperm.                 The reason of this constancy may have been the
similarity       of   the   conditions    of experiment.          Thus all the observations
were made in the latter half of March and the first half of April, and
throughout the temperature of the water only varied between 13'5°
and 15-3°.
    The chief conclusion to be gathered from these experiments seems to
me to lie in the comparative suddenness of the onset of the increased
rate of deterioration of the sexual cells. Thus in all but two out of
the nine experiments, the rate of increase of abnormal development
remained at about 1 per cent, per hour till the 20th to the 27th hour, and
then became so rapid, that within about nine hours the capacity for
normal development had almost entirely disappeared.                                Thus rapid
increase is well shown by the graphic method in the accompanying
figure.       Here the four most striking results obtained are reproduced,
the values obtained in each of the different experiments being dis
tinguished by different signs.

   The probable reason of this increase readily suggests itself.       Thus
supposing  that  animals  developing  from  ova which  are very  nearly, but
not quite stale enough to avoid normal fertilisation and development,
are for that reason less strong and vigorous than those arising from
fresh sex cells, it follows that the period during which the sex cells
remain normal ought to be as long as possible, but that, once these have
begun to deteriorate, they ought to absolutely lose their functional
capacity as rapidly as possible, in order that the number of enfeebled
organisms which we have supposed to arise may be as small as
can be.

    In all the experiments thus far described, both ova and sperm were
 kept for similar periods before fertilisation.            In order to determine
 whether the onset of abnormal         development depended more especially
 on the staleness of the one element or of the other, experiments were
 also made in which either stale ova were           fertilised with fresh sperm,
 or fresh   ova    with stale sperm.          At the same time some of the
 stale ova were fertilised with the stale sperm, so that properly com
 parative results were obtained.          These are collected in the subjoined
 table.

    On comparing the three columns, one can see that there is no regu
 larity in the figures.      In two cases the maximum number of normal
blastulae was obtained from stale ova and stale sperm, in four cases
from stale ova and fresh sperm, and in five cases from fresh ova and
stale sperm.      In the last line of the table are given the mean percent
ages of all the observations made.            From these one may perhaps con
clude that whilst on an average just as many blastulae are obtained
with stale ova as with stale spermatozoa, yet that when both the sex
cells are stale, the proportion is slightly less.         Probably, however, one
is more justified in concluding that within certain limits it is a matter
of indifference     whether    one or other or both of the sex cells is stale.
Thus if the last three observations in the table, made between the 29th
and 34th hours, be omitted, the average percentages of blastulae
obtained in the remaining eight experiments are respectively                72-1,
73-5, and 77-0, i.e., nearly as great with both sexual cells stale as with
only one. These last three experiments would, however, seem dis
tinctly to indicate that when the sexual cells have reached their period
of rapid deterioration, it is a distinctly more favourable condition if
only one and not both of the cells be stale.

356           Dr. H. M. Vernon.          The Effect of Stateness of the
    The conclusion we have arrived at is not altogether an expected one,
as  far as one could form any expectation from indirect evidence. Thus,
as before mentioned, 0. and R. Hertwig found that the ova of certain
Echinoids, if kept ten to twenty hours, underwent fertilisation in very
much larger numbers than freshly shed ova.           The fresher and better
the condition of the sperm, however, the better the chance of cross
fertilisation.  Again, in a former paper,* I showed that hybrid larvae
from the ova of StrMgylocentrotus lividus and the sperm of Sphcerechinus
f/ranularis could only be obtained in any number during the months of
July and August, when the sexual products of StmiKji/locentrolm were
found to reach their minimum maturity.         Those of Spluzrechinus were,
on the other hand, in a mature condition.          One would therefore be
inclined to conclude that in the present experiments, stale ova ferti
lised by fresh sperm would yield a larger proportion of blastulre than
fresh ova fertilised by stale sperm.    It must be remembered, however,
that the conditions are essentially different.     Thus in direct fertilisa
tion, it is the natural property of every ovum, whether fresh or stale,
to undergo fertilisation by any spermatozoon which still preserves its
vitality ; whilst in cross fertilisation it     as   rule, the natural pro
                                                           is,     a
perty of every ovum to resist such impregnation, and this resistance
is only overcome when the vitality        diminished by keeping the ovum
                                               is
in water, or by other means.
   We have thus far examined only how far the staleness of the sexual
cells affects the number    of normally developing blastulae.   Does                          it
have any more permanent effect, and do the larvae developed from
stale products differ either in form or size from those developed from
fresh products    In the paper just mentioned,                           few experiments upon
                                                                   a a

be produced       :     they were not very numerous, no great stress was
                      but   as
laid upon them.      They have since been repeated, and sufficient con
firmation of them obtained.      The method of experiment was, as usual,
to mix portions of the liquids containing the stale or fresh ova and
sperm, and then, after an hour, pour them into jars containing about
2£  litres of sea water. These jars were kept in tank of running seu     a
water at      apractically constant temperature for eight days, and the
larvae were then killed by the addition of corrosive sublimate, and pre
served in 80 per cent, alcohol.     They were then mounted in glycerin,
and measured under the microscope in groups of fifty, by means of a
micrometer eye-piece.t      In    complete experiment, five series of mea

     In the first group of observations         given in the table these series of
measurements were repeated after keeping the sexual products respec
tively 9, 24, 33, and 45 hours.          When both the sexual cells were stale,
 it may    be seen     that the size of the larvae was only slightly, if at all,
affected, the average variation from the original normal larvae being
only 0-2 per cent. With fresh ova and stale sperm, on the other hand,
the larvae were considerably increased in size, even those obtained
 with sperm forty-five hours stale being slightly larger than the mean
normal. With stale ova and fresh sperm, there was in three out of
the four experiments a distinct diminution in the size of the larvae,
this amounting to no less than 15-9 per cent, in the case of the ova
kept forty-five hours. This experiment thus affords a most satisfactory
confirmation of the conclusion tentatively put forward in the above-
mentioned paper, i.e., it shows that whilst lame obtained from stale fmi
and stale sperm are of the same size as those obtained from fresh sexual
products, those from fresh ova and stale sperm are distinctly larger titan the
-normal, and tliose from stale ova and fresh sperm distin<tly smaller.

    The next experiment in the table is not so satisfactory, as in the one
instance in which stale ? stale $ larvae were obtained, there was
a distinct diminution in size ; whilst in one of the two sets of fresh $
stale $ larvae, there was also a diminution, instead of the expected
increase.       In the two experiments with stale ova and fresh sperm, the
diminution was in each case very considerable, so that the somewhat
abnormal results obtained in this series of experiments may perhaps be
put down to the fact that all the larvae, whatever the conditions under
which they were obtained, showed a tendency to undergo diminution in
size.
    In all the experiments             thus far described,       the fresh normal larvw
were measured as         well   as the    original    normal   larvae.    In another series
of observations, however, and in all the observations described in the
former paper, only the original normal larvae were measured ; hence,
though the values obtained for stale ? stale $ larvae are just as accu
rate as before, those for stale $ fresh $ and fresh ? stale $ larvae
are presumably         less    accurate,     as  they are also compared against the
original normal larvae, and not the mean of the original and fresh
larvae.     All these observations are collected in the subjoined table. In

fresh   £    larvae showed the         maximum decrease of           17-6 per cent.      Most
of the rest of the observations conform more or less to the rule above
laid down, but there is one very marked exception, the fresh $ stale
larvae being in one case 9-5 per cent. smaller than the normal, instead
                                                                                            J

    Taking means of all the observations in both series, we find that as
an uverage of eight observations,                    the stale ? stale J1 larvae were
diminished Cr7 per cent. in size ; as an average of eleven observations,
 the fresh ? stale       <$  larvae were increased 4 per cent., and as an average.

 per   cent.   These   values,  being means          of a   fairly large number of
 observations,   may be regarded as trustworthy within certain limits, and
 will, I think, be held sufficient to justify the rule above laid down.
    Confirmation of the conclusion that larvae derived from, stale ova and
 fresh sperm are smaller than the normal was obtained from quite another
 source.     Thus in one case, it was found that the hybrid larvse obtained
 on crossing the twenty-four hours stale ova of Spheerechinus granularis
 with fresh Strongi/loeentrotus sperm were 5'4 per cent, smaller than those
 from the cross of the fresh ova and sperm, whilst those from some of
 the same stock of ova after keeping an additional nine hours, and then
 crossing with fresh sperm, were 9'3 per cent, smaller.             Again, in another
 experiment, larvae from twenty-four hours stale SpJuerechinus ova crossed
 with fresh Strongylocentrotus sperm, were 3'8 per cent, smaller than those
 from the fresh ova and sperm.               None of the repeated attempts at
 obtaining crosses with stale ova and stale sperm succeeded, and in the
 only case in which fresh ova were crossed by stale sperm, the cross of
 fresh ova and fresh sperm         failed,    and so prevented       any comparison
being made.
    In a previous part of the paper it was shown that the proportion of
bias tula? obtained with both sexual          products stale was nearly as great
as that with only one of them stale, and a similar relationship was found
to extend to the proportion of larvae.               Thus, excluding the series of
observations made after forty-five hours, in which only 0'4 per cent,
or less of the ova arrived at the larval stage, and including only those
series in which all three of the          fertilisations were attempted, it was
found that on an average stale ova with stale sperm yielded 43'5 per
cent, of larvae, stale ova with fresh sperm 55'5 per cent., and fresh ova
with stale sperm 49'0 per cent. In this case, therefore, as in that of
the blastulae, the stale ova with stale sperm yielded the least propor
tion, and the stale ova with fresh sperm the greatest, but the extreme
limits of variation are only comparatively slight.
    It may perhaps be asked whether this somewhat curious result as to
the effect of staleness of one or other of the sexual products on the
size of the larvae is at all likely to be a factor of any importance
under natural conditions. To me it seems that in at least one respect
its value may be considerable, viz., it may be a very potent cause of
variation. As has been already stated, it seems probable that the
condition of relative staleness of the sexual products at the time of
fertilisation may very frequently occur in several phyla of the animal
kingdom, and hence it is by no means improbable that the average
variability of each generation may be increased considerably by this
means.     As has been shown elsewhere,* the mean probable error of
variation in the body length of these Strong ylocentrotus larvae is 6'1 per
                         • ' Phil.  Trans.,' B, 1895, p. 615.

  cent.    If, then, with a particular sea-urchin a third of the ova did not
 undergo fertilisation till some twenty hours stale, whilst another third
  underwent fertilisation by twenty hours stale spermatozoa, and only the
 remaining third underwent fertilisation at once by fresh spermatozoa,
  then the probable error of variation of all of the larvae so arising would
  roughly speaking be doubled.          Of course this is an extreme instance,
  which could never occur in the case of Echinoids, but might easily
-Toccur in the case of, for instance, man.           Whether the variations so
  produced     would   be  in any degree  transmissible   by inheritance, is quite
  another point, but supposing it to be only the size of the offspring
  which is thus influenced, it may be merely a question of varying
  degrees of nutrition, and so be directly transmissible.              In any case,
  whether inheritable or not, variation of itself may be in many cases
 .of value, as it may give a better chance to natural selection and other
  agencies of picking out those individuals more adapted to their en
  vironment, and rejecting those less adapted.        Thus, if all the individuals
  are nearly alike the evolutionary process must needs be exceedingly
  slow.
     Finally, these results are of interest in that they prove the inequality
  of the sex cells.      The diminution in the size of       larvae obtained     from
  stale   ova and     fresh sperm may perhaps be looked upon as one of
  diminished nutrition, the result of the staleness of the yolk, but it is
  difficult to imagine why the staleness of the spermatozoon used to
  fertilise an ovum should produce a larva larger than the normal, unless
  one holds that the part played by the sex cells differs in some essential
  particular.
                                      Summary.
     The following are the chief conclusions arrived at in this paper : —
     (1) If the ova and sperm of the Echinoid Strongylocentrotus lividns be
  kept for various times in sea water before fertilisation, then for about
  the first twenty to twenty-seven hours the number of normal blastiuV
  formed diminishes only about 1 per cent. per hour.                  After this ab
  normal development sets in rapidly, so that generally after a further
  nine hours or so, no blastulae at all are obtained.          The rate of falling
  off in the number of normal blastulae may increase to as much as 18-9
   per cent. per hour.
     (2) If ova not more than          twenty-seven     hours    stale  be  fertilised
   with equally stale sperm, practically as many blastulae are ol^ained
  as when     stale ova are fertilised by fresh sperm, or fresh ova by stale
  sperm.      After twenty-seven hours, however, the number              of blastuLe
  obtained with both products stale falls off more rapidly.
     (3) Larvae obtained from stale ova and stale sperm are of practically
  the same size as those from fresh sexual products, but those from fresh
  ova and stale sperm are distinctly larger than the normal, whilst those
  from stale ova and fresh sperm are distinctly smaller.

       Gardens, Kew.        Received      September 28, 1899.

    The    Comptes Rendus        for August 28 (p. 434) contains a communi
cation    from   Professor   Dewar to M. Henri Moissan, " relative              i la
solidification de Miydrogene." It concludes with the following sentence,
which may be easily overlooked :— " Des graines refroidies dans de
1'hydrogene liquide conservent toute la proprie'te' de germer."
    This is the first announcement of an interesting experiment in which
Professor Dewar did me the honour to ask me to assist him.                    He has
further suggested to me to put on record the facts, as far as they came
under my observation, and any physiological conclusions to which they
 seem to point.
    With this suggestion I have no alternative but to comply.              Botanists
 will naturally expect some more detailed account than is contained in
the brief announcement which I have quoted.                 But as my share in the
research has been of the smallest, I should have much preferred that
 Professor Dewar should have given the result of the whole investiga
 tion himself.
    When Professor Dewar first suggested the experiment to me, he
 pointed out that it would be a costly one, that it would only be possible
 to operate on very small quantities of seeds, and that the number of
 kinds must also be few.
    The dozen seeds experimented upon by Messrs. Brown and Escombe,
 which were submitted to the temperature of liquid air, were apparently
 selected as belonging to different natural families, and also in some
 degree as to their composition.*          My choice was much more restricted.
 I took two out of their list for the sake of comparison : Barley and
 vegetable marrow. I added wheat, which had more than once been made
 the subject of experiment.         This gave me two farinaceous seeds and one
 oily one. I then took shape and bulk into account. Wheat and
 barley are roughly ellipsoidal and medium in size. The vegetable
 marrow is relatively large but flattened.             I therefore added another
 oily seed, mustard, which is small and spherical.               I followed Messrs.
 Browne     and  Escombe   in   taking  a  pea, which    is also  spherical in shape
 but nitrogenous in composition.          Finally I sought a very minute seed,
 and pitched upon musk.
     The list then ultimately stood :—

   The next point seemed to be to eliminate the source of error which
might arise from defective germinative power.               I therefore communi
cated the list to Messrs. Sutton and Sons, of Reading, and asked their
Assistance.    With their invariable kindness in any scientific enquiry,
they willingly complied, and sent the samples required with the follow
ing report :—
   " We now have
                        pleasure in sending a packet of each of the seeds
you   name.     They   are  all of last year's growth, and of good germi

   I forwarded the samples (which were small) to Professor Dewar, and
suggested that they should be each divided into two portions, one for
a control experiment        under ordinary conditions, the other to be
returned    to  me   after  being subjected to cooling.           Owing to some
misunderstanding, this was not done ; but, as will be seen in the
result, the omission proved immaterial.            The seeds, it should be stated,
were simply air-dried : they were ordinary commercial samples, and
no attempt was made to further desiccate them.
   I pointed out to Professor Dewar the advisability of exposing the
seeds to extreme changes of temperature as gradually as possible, a
precaution which Messrs. Brown and Escombe carefully observed.*
He promised " to consider what can be done to avoid any disaster
from this cause."

                the, Temperature of      Liquid Hydrogen      on Seeds.         363
    On   July    21  he wrote to me: — "In spite of the weather I have
carried out my promise, and cooled some seeds in liquid hydrogen for
half an hour. I had to seal them up in a glass tube, cool first in
liquid air, and then transfer to the hydrogen.               They have, therefore,
been cooled to         - 250" C.,    or   - 252° C.,   while  being in a vacuum
{seeing the air left had no appreciable tension).              The seeds, in other
words, have been transferred to a condition resembling that of moving
through space.         Another set of the seeds have been cooled only in
liquid air for comparison."
    On July 22 he added, on returning the seeds : — " There can be no
doubt about the seeds being cooled, as they were in the hydrogen for
more than an hour.            In fact I used nearly 600 c.c. of liquid hydro-
£en."
    The seeds came to me in the small packets of tinfoil in which they
had been placed in the tube. On opening these it was observed that the
seeds were as fresh and bright as before being subjected to the treat
 ment.      There was not the slightest discoloration observable in the
green    tint of the    peas.    This practically disposed of the only anxiety
 which Professor Dewar felt          as  to the success    of the experiment,   and
expressed to me on         July  25  : —
     "
       My own impression is that unless the sudden vacuum caused by the
 liquid hydrogen cooling has produced physical rupture of the seeds,
 they will germinate as usual.            If they survive this awful strain, then
 I believe no increase of the time of cooling could produce any effect
 other than results from one hour's exposure to such severe cold."
     The seeds were sown in a cool greenhouse, without heat, on July 27.
 On August 1 they had all germinated.                In the case of the mustard,
  136 young plants were produced from 155 seeds; the remainder had,
  however, germinated, but the seedlings had damped off.                 One of the
  packets of     wheat,   for  some    reason,  germinated slightly     more slowly
 than the rest.
     On August 5, I received a further packet of the seeds (the musk
 excepted) indiscriminately mixed. Professor Dewar wrote the same
            "
  date :— I have sent you seeds to-day which, if the treatment with
  cold can kill, ought to be dead. They have been immersed in liquid
  hydrogen for upwards of six hours, and no attempt was made to
  graduate the cooling.         They were placed in the vacuum vessel into
  which the liquid hydrogen could drop from the apparatus, and had to
  take their chance.        The seeds have been soaked in liquid hydrogen,
 and   in  this  respect  differ  from the last that were cooled in a vacuum
  from being sealed in a glass tube."
     In this instance again the seeds did not show the smallest visible
  trace of the ordeal to which they had been subjected.                   They were
  sorted out and immediately sown, under the same conditions as before.
  By August 9 the seeds had all germinated without exception.                 I com

               "
August 15 : — The temperature Fahrenheit to which the seeds were
cooled was - 453° F. below melting ice."
   These are the details of the experiment.  As it is not likely to be
often repeated, I have thought it worth while to place them on record
as precisely as possible.
   The first question that suggests itself                       is,
                                               what evidence we have
for believing that the seeds have actually been brought to the almost
inconceivable temperature with which they were surrounded.       That
they were so brought, Professor Dewar himself has not       shadow of              a
doubt. That substances at widely extreme temperatures can remain
in juxtaposition at least for some time, and still maintain them,                             is
illustrated by a striking experiment shown by Professor Dewar at the
Royal Institution on April              1898. 1, Liquid air poured into      large      a
silver basin heated to redness, remained apparently as quiescent at
 this high temperature as in cooler vessels, and maintained spheroidal             a
condition. This          well understood. But the fact remains that liquid
                            is
air with       atemperature of about
                                                       -
                                              190° C. was contained in      vessel     a
 which   had      temperature
                   a               of  800°  C.,  the difference  in  temperature
between the two being 1000° C.
     Ifwe turn for       moment to the effect of heat on living structure,

because at that temperature its prqteids are coagulated.              Yet there               is
good evidence       for  the   fact,  that  seeds   have   been  exposed for pro
longed periods to          temperature
                               a            above 100° C., and yet have sub
sequently germinated. It may be taken as absolutely certain, that in
this case that temperature never reached the embryo, but must have
been intercepted by the imperfect conducting power of the seed-coats.
Cohn again has found that the spores of Bacillus subtilis survive pro
longed boiling,* and         similar observation applies.

          is
parency, and they are notoriously indifferent conductors.            Nevertheless
it    difficult to believe that in the case of such small bodies as seeds,
     is
their being brought to the temperature with which they are surrounded
can be more than         question of time.

The following remarks by Professor Dewar have an obvious bearing
on this point      :   —
     " Pictet, after an elaborate investigation, concluded that below a
certain temperature, all substances had practically the same thermal
transparency,  and that     non-conducting body became ineffective at

periments,  however, prove that such     not the case, the  transference

                 the Temperature    of Liquid Hydrogen          on Seeds.            365
of heat observed by Pictet appearing to be due, not so much to the
materials themselves,         as to the air contained           in their interstices.
Good exhaustion in the ordinary vacuum vessels used in low tempera
ture work, reduces the influx of heat to one-fifth of what is conveyed
when the annular space of such double-walled vessels is filled with
air."*
    It is to be noticed that in Professor Dewar's first experiment, the
seeds were practically in a vacuum.            It is obvious from what has been
quoted above, that this would help them to retain their heat.                       Any
hesitation in accepting the results of the experiment on this ground
is however swept away by the second experiment in which the seeds
with absolutely no protection at all, were actually soaked in liquid
hydrogen for six hours.         The extremity of caution can hardly resist
the conclusion that they must have been brought to the same tem
perature.
   Professor Dewar finds "that silica, charcoal, lampblack, and oxide
of bismuth, all increase the insulation to four, five and six times that
of the empty vacuum space."              It might possibly be worth while to
try how far a packing of small air-dry seeds would compare, say with
charcoal.       And this would in some degree be a measure of the thermal
transparency of seed structures.
   Professor Dewar suggested to me that I should supplement this
statement by some remarks on the physiological bearing of the ex
periment. This has already been discussed by Messrs. Brown and
Escombe, and there is perhaps little of moment to add to their con
clusions.
   The real interest of the whole investigation obviously lies in the
question how far it modifies our conceptions of the nature and pro
perties of living matter. Protoplasm, whatever its source, has physical
properties and an ultimate chemical composition which are practically
uniform.        This uniformity, however, overlies a potential diversity
which is not to be measured.           Such diversity cannot be accounted for
by any purely          physical   conceptions,      as   physical conceptions         are
understood.
    We not merely know the ultimate constitution of protoplasm, but
 we also know a good deal about its proximate constitution.                    Yet the
properties of living protoplasm are very far removed from the mere
 sum of those of its constituents,          and no light can be derived with
respect     to them in this direction.       And what we know about the con
stituent bodies themselves         is at present not a little obscure.             They
belong,      as  it were,  almost   to  the  fringe    of  possible    chemistry     and
almost elude the methods of chemical research.                 But they, complex as
they    .are, are   not themselves    protoplasm. Their cumbrous molecules
 are built up and broken down by ordinary chemical processes.                      They

are not in themselves, in any intelligible sense, living though essential
to the exhibition of vital phenomena.
   There our analysis of living matter by physical methods for the
present        stops.     But we are justified in pushing,
                                                        at any rate, semi-
physical conceptions                          We
                                     as far as we dare.
                                                   conceive, therefore, the
physical constituent molecules of protoplasm as aggregated into larger
molecules which, as they are unlike anything we know as purely
physical, we call physiological.*    Of the properties of such molecules
we have some faint conceptions.      The first is their instability.   They
are   kinetic ; " living  substance is  continually breaking     down   into
simpler bodies, with a setting free of energy ; on the other hand living
substance is continually building itself up, embodying energy into
itself, and so replenishing its store of energy." t This kinetic condi
tion is essentially life ; when it ceases, we have hitherto believed that
the constituents of protoplasm                    come under the sway of purely inorganic
conditions.
    If we pause for a moment to attempt a quasi-mechanical explana
 tion of the more developed phenomena of living organisms, such for
 example as are included under heredity, we are led to suppose that
 the physiological molecules may themselves be grouped into larger
 aggregates.    And each stage of aggregation introduces us into a new
 order of phenomena.        All that we can say                            is,
                                                         that beyond the first
 stage  the properties   which are  characteristic  of higher molecular aggre-
 grates, are ultra-physical, taking physical in its ordinary signification.
 That does not imply, however, that physical conditions are ever in
 abeyance.    Each stage of aggregation         conditioned by every one that
                                                              is
 precedes it.    In this sense life rests tin fmtd on physical basis.      a
    A continuous kinetic condition appears to be one distinctive pro
 perty of physiological molecules.       This not merely manifests itself in
 continuous chemical activity, but under appropriate conditions in actual
'visible motion.    And          to be remarked of the former, that though
                                    it     is
 chemical in kind,        undoubtedly ultra-chemical as chemistry
                          it   is                                       under                is

 molecule     that
               is      possesses the power of breaking up chemical combi

                                available
the pace at which he can proceed. There    the same kind of difference
                                                                   is
between the two methods as there      between arithmetic and the cal

   The question then                is,
                       how far the effects of Professor Dewar's experi
ments and of those who have preceded him in the same field, require
us to modify our conception of the physiological molecule.     Are we

                the Temperature        of Liquid Hydrogen         on Seeds.        367
  obliged to admit with Professor C. de Candolle and Messrs. Brown and
 Escombe that it may descend to a purely static condition ?
     This is really bound up with another question.                 The kinetic condi
 tion depends on the constant liberation of energy by chemical change.
 Of this the most important is that due to oxidation. But we now
 know that this is not the only source of energy in living matter, or in
 all cases the indispensable one. The late Dr. Romanes showed that
 neither a high vacuum nor subsequuent exposure for twelve months to
 absolutely indifferent gases, such as hydrogen or nitrogen, or even
 poisonous ones such as hydrogen sulphide, had any effect on the ger-
 minative power of seeds.          Professor Pfeffer has, however, informed me
 in conversation that an injurious effect is ultimately produced.
     Vital processes have their optimum point as regards temperature.
  Their superior limit for the reason already pointed out is tolerably
 sharp; but the inferior is by no means equally so. According to
 Boussingault the decomposition of carbon dioxide by green plants
 may take place nearly at 0° C.* Below the optimum there is then some
 evidence of a "slowing down."                 While some processes reach their
 limit, can we assume that all do ''
    The question would be peremptorily answered for us by those
 who assert that all chemical action is in abeyance at such temperatures
as I am discussing.          Photographic action still takes place at the
temperature of liquid air, though this may be due to phosphorescence.
But a jet of hydrogen will burn in it.
    Mess'rs. Brown and Escombe sum up the two methods of explaining
                                                     "
 what has been called " dormant vitality with sufficient accuracy in
their paper. According to the one view, metabolic and its resultant
                                            "
kinetic activity is " slowed down indefinitely.                 In such a case as now
described,   it  might be  said      that   this takes  place along an asymptotic
curve, continually approaching but never becoming equal to zero.
    According to the other, protoplasm passes absolutely from the
kinetic to the static condition. Its locked-up energy becomes purely
potential, and Professor C. de Candolle has not hesitated under these
circumstances     to compare     it to an explosive.
    It has been pointed out that such a conclusion is absolutely in con
flict with Mr. Herbert Spencer's well-known definition of life. But it
appears to me that that definition was only intended to apply to
higher stages of the aggregation of living matter than that of the
physiological molecule on which I have endeavoured to fix the discus
sion.    The question seems to me to be simply whether it is admissible
to regard that as capable of being brought to an absolutely static
condition.
    Conceive two such molecules, one known to be living, but static,
and the other dead, and both to be maintained in a condition in which

they are not immediately susceptible to chemical change.          What is the

 I have propounded does not admit of any positive answer in the present
 state of our knowledge.

" Effects of Thyroid Feeding on Monkeys." By WALTER EDMUNDS.
       Communicated         by Professor J. ROSE BRADF0RD,            F.R.S.
       Received September 28, 1899.
                  (From the Laboratory of the Brown Institution.)
    The experiments were made altogether On nine monkeys ; from
them, however, it would be safer to exclude three : two because patho
logical conditions were found in their lungs after death, and one
because the animal died in so short a time (seven days) after the com
mencement of the treatment.
    There remain then six experiments for consideration.
    The thyroid preparations administered were either a powder made
according to the directions of Mr. Edmund White, or thyrocolloid
prepared by the method of Dr. Hutchison.
    The doses given were large and corresponded to from one-half to
three sheep's thyroids (both lobes) to a monkey daily.
    Marked effects were produced by this treatment : the eyes became
abnormally prominent ; the monkeys lost flesh, became weak, and
eventually died.
    The symptoms produced may be tabulated as follows : (1) Proptosis,
(2) dilatation of pupils, (3) widening of palpebral fissures, (4) erection
of hairs on head, (5) hair falling out in patches from various parts of
the body, (6) paralysis of one or more limbs, (7) emaciation and mus
cular weakness, (8) death from asthenia.
    With respect to these symptoms, proptosis, dilatation of pupil,
widening of the palpebral fissure and erection of the hairs on the head
are effects which are produced by the stimulation of the cervical sym
pathetic.
    As the chief object      of these experiments was to determine as to
exophthalmos,      sketches  were made of the monkeys before commencing
treatment and also after ; eye changes occurred in all the six monkeys,
and of four of them sketches         exist showing these changes ; in two it
was not practicable to obtain the second sketches, but there was no
doubt about the eye changes in these also.

                              Effects     o/ Thyroid Feeding on Monkeys.                          369
  Exophthalmos, after the administration of thyroid preparations, has
been observed before. Be'clere, in a case of myxcedema in man in which
excessive doses of thyroid were given by mistake, noticed amongst
other symptoms a certain degree of exophthalmos.        Ballet and
Enriquet, in one of six dogs which were fed on thyroids, found dis
tinct  exophthalmos.                      Cunningham           also   obtained     this symptom    in
rabbits and monkeys.
   As the eye changes can be produced by stimulation of the cervical
sympathetic, it seems reasonable to infer that thyroid extract acts in
the same manner, and also that the increased secretion of the enlarged
and altered thyroid of Graves's disease is in part at least the cause of
the exophthalmos  that occurs in that affection.
  The falling out of the hair in patches and its loosening generally
were common symptoms, and were seen in all the monkeys.
  As to paralysis, in two of the experiments the hind limbs became
paralysed ; in one of these cases the treatment was stopped to see if
any improvement followed, but it did not, and the animal died in a few
days.      In another experiment both arms became paralysed; this
passed  off  in two days without the treatment being stopped.
   These paralyses have also been noticed before. Be'clere, in the patient
referred to above, found one day hemiplegia with aphasia and hemi-
anaesthesia,   all of which disappeared in a few hours.    In thyroidless
monkeys, Horsley has twice seen a complete hemiplegia, following an
attack of clonic spasms, and passing off in a day or so.  In one of my
thyroidless monkeys a temporary paresis of one arm occurred.
   The symptoms of loss of flesh and muscular weakness occurred in
all the experiments, and in all too the animal died, at periods varying
from forty to 116 days from the commencement of the treatment.
   In two cases the feeding was stopped, but only when the symptoms
were well marked ; there was no improvement, and the animals died.
   The main conclusion arrived at                        is,
                                       that in monkeys thyroid feeding,
if   large doses are given, produces exophthalmos.

                                The Cabeiron       near Thebes.
  My observations         taken in 1892 were confirmed, and                              consequently
the doubt which a correspondent at Athens had                                thrown            upon                the
orientation of that temple* may be dismissed.
                                              Girgenti.
  For the orientations of the temples at Girgenti, t                             I       had relied on
some observations taken in 1885 by means of the sun's shadow and a
plumb line, checked by data, given by various authorities. This year,
in the   case of three    of the temples,           I   was able to remeasure                  them by
solar observation       with           and also to obtain correctly the
                              a theodolite,
altitude of the eastern horizon, as seen from each of the temples, with
the following results, viz.       :   —
   The orientation angle of the Temple of Juno should be 262° 36'
instead of 264°, and the sun's altitude when surmounting the eastern
horizon should be 1° 45' instead of 0° 35'. The elements as recomputed
are as follows, viz. : —

                   On the Onetdatwn         of Greek       Temples.                      371
of the city's prosperity. If the sun's depression had been taken at
 11°, the date would have been about 440 B.C. and if at 12° about 540.
The depression at 11° 30' seems to accord best with the practice used
in temples of comparatively late foundation.*
                           The Temple of Hercules.
   I found that the orientation angle of this temple agreed very closely
with that previously given, but that the eastern horizon wa,s higher,
namely, 2° instead of 0° 35' ; but if the solar depression be changed
from 11° to 11° 54', the result of the calculation will be the same, and
the stellar elements and the date will remain unaltered.
                                 The Olympieium.
   I  found that the orientation angle of the temple of Jupiter should
be increased from 257° 35' to 258° 44', whilst the altitude of the
eastern horizon has to be increased from 0° 35' to 1° 55'.                      This will
neutralize the effect of the alteration of the amplitude, and the stellar
elements and the date (430 B.C.) will remain unaltered.
   I obtained one additional example from an ancient site in Greece,
namely, the Temple of Neptune at Calauria in the Isle of Poros ; the
scene of the last days of Demosthenes,               who had chosen it for his
place of exile on account of its commanding a view of his much loved
Athens from the lofty ridge on which the temple was built. The
elements of the orientation are as below.

In this   case the orientation   follows the star, but with so considerable an increase of

 which the years of their foundation are at least approximately known
historically, and which were shown to be conformable to the general
rule, but required a deeper depression of the sun, than was sufficient
for the distinct vision of the heliacal star.  Of five of these examples
I had not given the elements, viz. :— The Theseum, the later Erechtheum,
the later Temples of Bacchus and Jupiter at Athens, and the great
temple at Ephesus, as rebuilt after the fire.   As the cases of some of
these are very interesting in an archaeological point of view, I here
supply the elements in the same form as before.
   With respect to the temple of Theseus at Athens, it appears to bo
possible, proceeding from the approximate date given by the orienta
tion work, to arrive at a much closer determination of the probable
exact year of the foundation (or perhaps dedication) of the temple,
and at the same time to confirm the traditional name of the temple,
which has been much disputed.        What I have called the traditional
view    is,
         that the temple was built under the influence of Cimon, who
during his supremacy at Athens, in the year 469 or 468 B.C., brought
from the Isle of Scyros the supposed relics of Theseus.      The bones of
the hero were then interred at Athens with great solemnity, and                                         a
temple or heroum was built over the grave and an annual celebration
was appointed, under the name Thesea; which lasted two or three
days and commenced on the seventh day of the month named Pyane-
psion, month which on the whole agrees with our October, but (owing
        a
to the practice at Athens of commencing the year with the new moon
which occurred on or next after the summer solstice), when we com
pare the two calendars, and reckon the days of the month together,
we find that they only agree together at intervals of 19 years — the

Metonic cycle.     It is therefore necessary to consult lunar tables to
see in what year or years 7 Pyanepsion would agree with October 6,
and the nearer to 470 B.C. this can be, the better it would also agree
with the orientation date.
   The first Attic month was Hecatombaion          having thirty days, in
        general agreement with July.
   Then Metageitnion having twenty-nine days, in general agreement
        with August.
    Then Boedromion having thirty days, in general agreement with
        September.
   After which Pyanepsion.
   The first three months      with seven days of Pyanepsion numbers
ninety-six days.    Twenty-nine days of July with August, September
and six of October also give ninety-six days.     It follows that when the
first of Hecatombaion     agrees with the third of July, the seventh of
Pyanepsion will represent the sixth of October.
   This would have happened in 466 B.C. and not again until 447.
The year 466, about three years subsequent to the recovery of the
Theseian relics, would have given time for the building of the Naos
of the temple, if not for its final completion ; so that it may well have
been the year of its dedication.     On that year the astronomical com
bination  would  have  been  exact (not but that on any year of the cycle
the rising sun would have nearly answered             the purpose of the
Thesea celebration, though not quite so perfectly).       Of the two years
above named which would have satisfied this condition, the earlier
seems preferable, firstly on architectural grounds (derived chiefly from
the greater spread of the capital of the column, compared with that of
the Parthenon, which was commenced about the later of the two
dates), and secondly, there is no record of Pericles, who was at that
time the guiding spirit in Athens, having built a great temple in the
lower city. If the earlier date be correct, the conclusion appears in
evitable both from its combination with the Thesian relics in 469, and
from its connection with the Thesea year after year, that the temple
has been rightly named by tradition.
   The orientation of the new Erechtheum corresponds with two of the
principal Attic festivals, and also offers a suggestion of the exact year
of its foundation or dedication.    This is not drawn from the vernal
sunrise, of which I have given elements in combination with a star ;
but from the autumnal return of the sun to the same declination,
heralded by a Pegasi, which took place, touching the northern edge of
the eastern incolumnium on September 2, and parallel with the axis
on September 7.      In the year 447, when the 2nd of September would
have agreed with the 2nd of Boedromion, and the 7th September
with the 7th of the same month; the former date would have

           Determination of the Eartli's Horizontal Magnetic Force.                      375
  been that of the great feast of the Niceteria in honour of Minerva's
  contest with Neptune for the protectorate                   of Athens, and the other,
  the annual celebration          of the Marathon victory.
      As respects the year 447, which is one year earlier than the supposed
  commencement of the Parthenon, it seems appropriate because at that
  time Pericles would have been supreme, and it is likely that a temple
  of such sanctity as the Erechtheum would have called for his earliest
  attention. It is true that the temple remained long unfinished, but
  of the causes of this delay we are ignorant. The connection however
  of the orientation with the feasts above mentioned would have been
  exactly the same if the date had been 428.
      The apparent discrepance between the orientation date (as respect
  the day of the month) in the case of the Temples of Jupiter Olympius,
  and that which is supposed by Mommsen to have been the day of
  the celebration           of the great feast to the supreme god (namely
   Munychion 19, the tenth month of the year, which in a general way
   corresponded with April), whereas the orientation dates give for the
   earlier temple March 30-31, and for the later March 27, is explained
   by the possibilities of the Metonic cycle, for when the Attic year
   began as it would in its course on July 11, the 19th Munychion
  would agree with March 30, or if July 8 with the 27th of March.

   § 1. The present paper deals with magnets employed in measuring
declination and horizontal force.       More than 100 collimator magnets
of English make have been examined at Kew Observatory, and the
record of the results forms probably a unique mine of information. So                               |
far as I know, the only use hitherto made of this has been in the com-                              ^

   The values found for these " constants      are utilised in the construc

moment, m, of the collimator magnet, and also the value of a " constant,"

for the couple exerted by the collimator magnet on an auxiliary magnet,
moment m", at distance r.    The investigations described in the present
paper have been prosecuted at intervals during the last five years, as
the pressure of other work allowed.    Their object has been twofold, 1°
to find out whether any relationships exist between the several con
stants, and 2° to ascertain    where our present knowledge wants
amplification, and where the present tests are least satisfactory.
 I  shall first explain the real significance       the "constants," and
                                                                    of
describe briefly the method of determining them.

         Determination      of the Earth's Horizontal Magnetic       Force.  37V
 be taken for granted, q and q' can be determined by observing m' at any
 three convenient temperatures.          These temperatures, as the experiment
 is conducted at Kew Observatory, lie usually within a degree or two of
 0°, 18°, and 36° C.        Magnets, however, destined for Arctic work are
 exposed to a temperature below 0° C., while magnets destined for
 tropical regions are exposed to a temperature over 40° 0.
    The changes of temperature are made rapidly by introducing hotter
or colder water into a wooden box containing the collimator magnet.
Changes in the moment of this magnet, accompanying observed changes
in the temperature of the water, are deduced from the variations in
azimuth of an auxiliary magnet, freely suspended at a fixed distance
from the deflecting magnet.             In a single experiment, the cycle of
                "         "         "      "
 temperature      hot," mean,"        cold   is repeated three times, and the
mean of the three observations at each temperature is used in the final
calculation.     It is customary to have two completely independent ex
periments    on    different days, and to take the arithmetic mean of the
values deduced for q and q' on the two occasions.           The exact times are
noted    at which the several readings are taken, and suitable corrections
are applied from the readings of the magnetic curves for variations in
the horizontal force and declination.
    § 3. Induction Coefficient.
                                 — This is denoted by />, and really means
the temporary change in the magnetic moment of the collimator magnet
due to unit change in the field (parallel to the magnet's length), it
being assumed that the relation between temporary moment and
strength of field is linear.
    The experiment* consists in observing the angles through which an
auxiliary magnet is deflected out of the magnetic meridian by the
collimator magnet, the latter being vertical, with its north pole alter
nately up and down.            The vertical plane through the centres of the
deflecting and deflected magnets is perpendicular to the latter's axis,
but the centres of the magnets are not in the same horizontal plane.
    The change in the inducing field being double the intensity of the
vertical force at Kew is nearly 0-9 C.G.S. unit. As a rule, only one
complete experiment is made, but this involves inverting and reinvert-
ing the magnet several times. Originally p was measured in British
units, so that conversion into C.G.S. units was necessary in many cases.
    § 4. Moment of Inertia. — This means the moment of inertia of the
magnet and all its appendages, when at a temperature of 0° C., about
the suspending fibre. A collimator magnet is a hollow steel cylinder,
about 9^- cm. long and 1 cm. in external diameter, with screws cut on
its inner surface at both ends. The appendages consist of two small
cells, one holding a lens the other a glass scale, screwed into the

ends of the magnet, and of a brass stirrup arrangement which carries
the magnet and affords the means of supporting, parallel to       an                         it,
auxiliary solid brass cylinder. This brass cylinder            a regular geo     is
metrical object, whose moment of inertia can be calculated from its
weight, length, and diameter.        The actual inertia experiment consists
in observing the      times   of vibration  of the magnet, under the earth'*
horizontal force, when the auxiliary bar          in the stirrup, and when
                                                                  is                               it
is  removed.      To reduce the possible effects of variation in force or
temperature,     four   complete series of vibrations are made, the first and
fourth without, the second and third with the auxiliary cylinder.
 Allowance       made for the departure of the mean temperature from 0° C.
                     is
It   iscustomary to make two independent determinations of the moment
of inertia, usually on different days, and in the event of serious dis-
crepuicy       third experiment

conversion from British to C.G.S. units was necessary.
     §   Coefficient P.
         5.              — The meaning of this has been already explained
generally.        need only add that in the deflection experiment the axes
                     I
 of the two magnets are perpendicular, and the centre of the deflected
                         " mirror "
 or, as       itcalled,
                    is              magnet lies on the axis produced of the
 collimator magnet.        The general expression for the couple exerted in
such      a    symmetrical position, the centres of the magnets being at distance
r,
is
where          ...... are constants, whose values depend on both the
                P,       Q,
deflecting and  deflected magnets.     As increases, the terms involving
                                                             r
the higher negative powers of        tend to vanish relative to the first

term      and in the present case
          ;                                          is  assumed that the term involving           P
is   the last that need be retained.                     When this   true we can determine
                                                                       is
P by comparing the couples answering to any two different values of
r. The distances originally adopted at Kew Observatory when British
units were employed were      foot and 1-3 feet; the distances now in

use       arj    30 cm. and 40 cm.            For several reasons,           I   have recorded     the
value not of    but of P/r2 at 30 cm., allowing in cases where British
                          P
units had been used for the small difference between 30 cm. and  foot.                       1

and        the       differences   between         the     patterns    are   mostly small.       Still

   The specific gravities found for two of the magnets were approxi
mately equal, the mean being 7-67.
   From this we conclude that in both groups of magnets the wall
thickness is less at the extreme ends, where an internal screw is cut,
than elsewhere; the mean internal diameter deduced from the data
being 0'70 cm. for the magnets of group C, and 0'77 cm. for those of
group E. The actual volumes of steel in the two cases were respec
tively 3-72 and 3'34 c.c.
   There has been but little variability in the length or external
diameter of the magnets of any one group ; the volume however, if we
may judge by Table III, is somewhat more variable.             We should have
more exact information on the point if K meant the moment of the
magnet alone, but as matters stand, our conclusions are exposed to some
uncertainty. The appendages, as we see from Table III, weigh about
as much as the magnets themselves, their main mass lies however
nearer to the axis of rotation.     In fact, according to the measurements

        Determination     of the Earth's Horizontal Magnetic Force.       381
made on the special magnets the appendages         contribute only from    25
to 30 per cent, of the value of K.
   Again, the size of the appendages is determined mainly by that of
the auxiliary brass bar, which according to the Observatory records is
nearly constant for magnets of the same make. It is thus improbable
that variations in the appendages exercise a large influence on the
values of ir2K in the several groups.
   § 8. Taking all the data into consideration, I conclude from Table I,
that the magnets of group A are on the whole distinctly the largest,
and those of group F very distinctly the smallest ; that the other four
groups are very fairly similar in this respect, though the average
magnet of group E is almost certainly a trifle smaller than that of
groups B and C. The variability in size was really one of my princi
pal reasons for grouping the magnets.        The values of m and /> should
increase, ceteris paribus, with the size of the magnets, and an analysis
which overlooked the difference between groups A and F might well
prove misleading.       So far as individual groups are concerned, I do
not think that the neglect of possible variations in the size of the
magnets is likely to prove serious.        My reasons for this opinion are
partly based on phenomena discussed later in §§ 15 and 16.
    § 9. Before proceeding further, a second source of uncertainty must
be noticed.     The moment of the residual magnetism in a magnet is
not determined solely by the magnetic quality of the steel, it depends
 on the conditions under which magnetisation        took place, on the time
elapsed since that event, and on the usage to which the magnet has
 been exposed.
    In the present case   I have strong reasons to think that the very large
 majority at least of the magnets were magnetised under a nearly uni
 form set of conditions.        Until quite lately it was the invariable
 practice to magnetise all the magnets at the Observatory itself, and the
 same coil with similar battery power has been in use for the -last forty
 years.   The magnet is not placed inside the coil, but is stroked in a
 unif orm way on the end of a very massive slightly projecting iron core.
 The capacity of this core to hold out a heavy pole piece has been re
 garded   as  a criterion of the battery being in proper order ; and as
             " saturation " is reached in ah ordinary collimator
 apparent                                                             magnet
 with the battery below standard condition, the test, though a rough
 one, appears fairly satisfactory.
     There is a variety of indirect evidence as to the uniformity of the
 conditions. For instance, the dates of magnetisation of the ten magnets
 of largest m in group C, arranged in descending order of magnitude,
 were as  follows:— 1884, '66, '79, 73, '95, '84, '83, '94, 75, '89, '68.
    As regards possible loss of magnetic moment, the magnets, with one
 or two probable exceptions, had all been magnetised but        a short time
 before m and the various
                               " constants " were determined.

       Magnetic Moment. — Taking into account the variability in size
  Jj 10.
which we have decided to exist, it would appear from Table I that the
capacity for assuming permanent magnetism has been nearly the same
in the four groups A, C, D, and E ; but the magnets of group B have
been distinctly less receptive than the others.    It is difficult to say
exactly  how the  magnets   of group F  stand.  They are clearly much
below the average size, and their mean m is at least as large compared
to the means in the other groups as one would expect from a compaii-
son of the mean moments of inertia.
   Table    II
            shows the variability of m to have been much greater in
each group than that of K.
   The great variability in m is noteworthy, because when m is small,
corrections for torsion, temporary induction, &c., increase in relative
importance.
  It has been     the practice of late years to reject magnets showing
exceptionally   small  magnetic moment, but the data from such rejected
magnets are not included in Tallies I and II.
   § 11. Temperature Coefficients.
                                   — Out of the whole 130 magnets the'e
was not a single case in which the arithmetic mean of the values found
experimentally for q' was negative.        Thus within the experimental
limits, say 0° to 36 'C., the rate of change of magnetic moment with
temperature invariably increased with the temperature.
   The mean value for q in groups C, E, and F, is practically identical,
and is very distinctly larger than the mean values for groups B and D.
Group B is specially remarkable for the smallness of the temperature
coefficients ; in fact, the largest value of q found in a magnet of this
group is very little greater than the mean value in groups A, C, E,
and    F.
    The mean value of q is fairly similar for the different groups, but
groups A and B have somewhat smaller values than the others.
    The variability of both q and q'      as we see from Table II, very con
                                         is,
siderable in all the groups except         E,where    varies but little.
                                                         q                 The
term q'P    isin general small compared to the term                qt,
                                                             and consequently
the probable error in the determination of          q'   is
                                                      large.   The variability
of q    may for this reason be somewhat exaggerated in Table II.

feel, however, some doubts respecting this and       second large value,       a

for which these values are recorded were tested in 1864 and one of                           ;

excluded these two magnets, we should find for group      mean                           D   a          p     much

   It is only natural to expect a sensible departure between the means
of any single property in a sub-group of ten magnets and in a whole
group of eighty-two magnets, supposing the sub-group selected by pure
chance.    Bearing this in mind, we must, I think, conclude that no clear
relationship exists between the value of m and that of K, q,             or />.                      q',
The absence of apparent connection between m and           ;r2K seems strong
evidence of the comparatively small variability in the actual size of the
magnets.    The fact that        nearly, ju.  not quite, independent of m is
                                               is               if
important,  because          it   is
                           expedient  ceteris paribus that m//> should be as
large as possible.  If        or  q,had shown an appreciable tendency to
                                        q',         p
vary with m we should have been led to suspect, as priori probable, a                A
 tendency to alteration in these constants as the magnet grew weaker
 with age.   The absence of any apparent connection of the kind           not,                         is
 however, proof positive that no such tendency exists (see       37 later).                  §

   There is here no trace of a connection between p and K, which sup
ports the conclusion drawn from the absence of apparent connection
between m and K.              There is probably a slight tendency when /* is very
decidedly      below   the    mean for m to be slightly low ; but the tendency
in m/p to increase as /x diminishes is conspicuous.
   The large value for P, when negative, when /* lies between 5 and 4
has no real significance, the mean being based on only two magnets.
The one clear and important relationship brought out by Table V is
between l- and q.            Large values of these two constants unquestionably
have a tendency to occur together in the magnets of group C.                                 Out of
the twenty-six magnets whose /x exceeded 6, no less than eighteen had
a q above the mean          ;  while of the thirteen magnets whose /* fell short
of 5, only two had a q above the mean.                       As the result seems important,
I submit the following analysis, showing the distribution of the different
values of p in group C :—
                                             Table     VI.

   The table is to      be read thus         : Of the eighty-two magnets, four had a
value of l09^ between 150 and 200, and of these, two had a /* lying
between 6 and 5'5, while two had a p lying between 5-5 and 5.
   Table    VI   certainly supports the conclusion drawn from Table V.
  As a further check on this conclusion, I arranged the eighty-two
magnets in two sub-groups, according as q was above or below the
mean, with the following result                : —

   Table    VII,   like the two previous tables, points to some connection
between large values of p and q.                   Out of the first twenty magnets, the
arrangement being in descending order of q, only two had a value of fi
below the mean for group C.
   The association of large values of p and q in group C is not, how
ever, without some conspicuous exceptions ; for instance, the magnet
coming eighteenth in the list just referred to had a p of only 4'71.
   § 17. There are several other interesting features in Table VII; e.g.,
only about two-fifths of the magnets had a q above the mean.                               Again
the fact, partly accidental of course, that the two sub-groups should
have precisely the same mean m is strong evidence that in the magnets
of group C the size of the principal temperature coefficient is inde
pendent of the capacity of the steel to retain a large magnetic moment.
   The mean q' of the first sub-group of Table VII is distinctly larger
than that of the second sub-group, but the evidence of a tendency in
large values of q and q' to go together is not wholly conclusive.                           Thus
out of the thirty-three magnets whose q exceeded the mean, fourteen
had a q' below the mean ; and two of these fourteen had the largest q's
of the group.          The force of such notable exceptions is weakened, how
ever, by the consideration that an experiment which makes q slightly
too big is more likely than not to make q' considerably too small.
   § 18. Grdlips B and E are the only ones beside C which are suffi
ciently numerous and homogeneous to merit analysis.                            In the two fol
lowing tables I give the results obtained by subdividing each of these
groups into two numerically equal sub-groups, according to the size,
first of m, second of p.

    From (5) we see noteworthy differences in the consequences of
errors in the different " constants."
    In the case of K it is not the absolute size of the error that counts,
but the ratio it bears to the size of K ; while in the case of P, p, and
the temperature coefficients it is the absolute size of the error that
counts.      In all cases SX increases with X, so that the absolute effect of
a given error in any one of the " constants

zontal force is large than where it is small.
    § 20. In estimating the probable errors in the several constants,                    I
have confined my attention to the cases in which the accepted results
were based on two, and only two, experiments.
    If 2Sy be the difference between the values given by two experi
ments for a certain quantity, the probable error in the arithmetic mean,
y, of the   two determinations is

    In many instances the value of a " constant was based on only one
experiment.       In  such cases we may reasonably assume that the single
experiment was, on the average, neither better nor worse than the

This would give for the probable error in the value of       a "constant1"

the cases where two experiments were made.
   In the few cases where constants were based on three independent
experiments, one could, of course, have calculated the probable errors
Sy'", and found their mean.      The number of such cases appeared, how-
ever, too small to give a satisfactory mean value.
   § 21. Taking first the moment of inertia, I examined seventy-one
cases in which two independent             determinations had been made.
Employing    2SK  to represent the difference between the two observed
values, whose arithmetic mean is       K, I found
                          Mean    SK/K     = 0-00041.
   The corresponding    mean probable error is given by

                              SX    = 0-0001  38X.
   Ascribing to X the value 0'18 C.G.S. unit — which is not far from
 the present mean value in Great Britain — we should have
                          SX   = 0-000025,     appro*.
    Taking the same value 0'18 for X, I also determined the law of inci
 dence of the probable error in the seventy-one cases examined.
    The results were as  follows  : —

    As measurements of horizontal force are usually taken to 1 x 10"5

 expected to affect the last significant figure, in these latitudes, in fifty-
 three cases out of seventy-one, or practically in two cases out of three.
 In one-ninth of the total number of cases the probable error in X shown
 by Table X reached or exceeded five units in the last significant figure.

Also it must               that in equatorial regions X may be double

This     is   troublesome to deal with                 ;    because cosec u depends both on                             X
and on the magnetic                     moment.            As   first approximation we have
                                                                a                                                      in

To get an idea of the probable error arising from error in                                           />,   suppose
X    = 0'18, as at            Kew, and m = 840, as in the average                               new collimator
magnet.         This gives
                                    cosec u =          3,   approx.
                                           SX     = 0-000004,            approx.
Thus when there are two observations of       the probable error will    p                                             in
the average case fail to affect the last significant figure, supposing                                                 X
measured as usual to    x 10"5 C.G.S.

   Of course in good many individual cases the probable error in /*,

from single experiment, and in the majority of such cases we should
         a
conclude that the probable error was large enough to affect the last
significant figure in X, measured at Kew.  Owing to the occurrence
of       term

determination     thus depends more on the observer than on the in
strument.
   P has never been regarded at Kew as a constant to be determined
once for all, but observers are recommended to determine it for them
selves, employing, when possible, a series of observations made about
the same time and in one neighbourhood.             In other words, P is treated
as a   quantity which probably alters slowly with the time, and which
may vary with X.         In the Kew unifilar itself the mean value of P
calculated from a year's observations varies slightly but somewhat
irregularly from year to 3-ear.

Each one of these results is based on a large number of observations,
but I should hesitate to say that observational error plays no part in
the apparent fluctuations.         There are of course frequently minor
magnetic disturlmnces during horizontal force observations, and two
or three outstanding values of P sensibly affect a mean though derived
from forty observations.         Though the annual mean has invariably
made P negative, positive       values  from individual observations are by
no means uncommon.
   If  we consider that the data in the above table are based each on
numerous experiments, taken at a fixed station under the best conditions,
we must, I think allow that uncertainty in the P correction is a very
probable source of trouble in survey work.

  Thus we have XX' in (9) as against X2 in (4) ; but this only means
that the X appearing in (4) is in reality a mean between the values
possessed by the horizontal force during the vibration and deflection
                                                                                      '
experiments.
     In actually comparing   the result of an absolute horizontal force
observation  with the magnetogram one measures the curve ordinates
at the mean times of the two experiments — times separated usually by
thirty or forty minutes — and takes the mean of the two ordinates as
corresponding to the X deduced from (4).
   Again, the K appearing in (4) is really taken from a table which
allows for variations of temperature, and the same is true of r.
   § 27. The first difference of real significance is that (9) contains
1 +Pr~2, while (4), on the other hand, has
                                              (1 -Pr"2)"1.  Supposing X
measured as usual to five significant figures, this becomes objectionable
when the value of X is affected by so much as 5 x 10~6 C.G.S. unit.
   The limiting value of Pr~2 for which the substitution is justifiable is
given by
                            X(1-PV4)«                 =   X- 5xl0-6,
or, approximately,                     Pr-2 = 10-8(10/X)».
     This gives —
                       For X   = 0-18,          P/-2      = 0-0074,   approx.,
                           X   = 0-36,          Pi-l      = 0-0053           „   .
   The mean value found for Pr~2, when P is positive, in Table I is just
in excess of 0'0074, and values in excess of 0-0053 are very common.
Thus the employment of (1 Pr~-)~l in (4)       - to say the least of   is,                           it,
frequently unjustifiable.

      The   case  of the temperature terms is less satisfactory.             Taking, for
 example,     the  mean values of Table I, viz.,
                         q =    335 x 10-",          q' = 14 x l0~7,

      Following    exactly the same procedure as in the case of Pr~2, we
  thence conclude that the treatment applied to the temperature terms
  will on the average begin to introduce error, supposing X = 0'18,
  when f reaches 20° C.
      When a magnet with large temperature coefficients is used in hot
  weather at a place where X is large, the error due to the treatment of
  the temperature terms becomes very sensible.                 Suppose, for instance,
                         q = 6 x 10-4,               q'  = 22 x l0~",
  values exceeded in one actual case, then we have
                                     for   f  = 35°,
                                 qf  + q'f* = 0-0237.
  This gives      an    error of        approximately      0'000l   C.G.S.    unit  when
  X    = 0-36.
                           Criticism from Physical Standpoint*
     § 29. Under this heading            I  shall discuss certain grounds of uncer
 tainty    which   may    affect   the    accuracy of the calculated values of the
 horizontal force. The considerations are mainly, but not exclusively,
 physical.
     An objection to both the fundamental formulae (7) and (8) is that they
 represent all the quantities involved as constant, whereas in general
 magnetic force and declination, temperature, and moment of magnet,
 are constantly altering.
     In reality,  however, the t appearing in (7) is the mean of two read
ings    of  a  thermometer        adjacent to the collimator magnet, taken, the
 one immediately before, the other immediately after, the vibration
 experiment ; while the t' appearing in (8) is the mean of eight thermo
 meter readings taken nearly simultaneously with the individual obser
vations of the deflection angles.               There is thus very fair provision for
changes     of  temperature       so  long   as  the temperature changes slowly and
continuously in one direction, provided the thermometers really record
the temperature of the magnet.                    In a fixed observatory these condi
tions are probably as a rule fairly secured if the magnet and thermo
meter be freely exposed to the air for five or ten minutes before the
experiment commences.

     § 30. Variations of horizontal force and declination
                                                                 — which likewise
affects both vibration and deflection readings — are more serious.              If
small and gradual, they are of course likely to be largely eliminated,
especially in the deflection experiment, where the order of the operations
is specially devised with a view to this end.              If, however, they are
large     and sudden, probably the only really satisfactory course is to
reject the observation.
     It might be supposed that at a fixed observatory corrections could
always be applied by referring to the magnetograph curves.                   This,
however, is not very feasible in practice.           The time scale of the curves
is so contracted that the time to which ;i particular ordinate refers is
usually uncertain to the extent of at least half a minute.             Again, the
position at any instant of a magnet during rapid changes of field
depends to an extent difficult to determine on the inertia of the
 magnet; and the magnets used in magnetographs and in absolute
 instruments differ greatly from one another both in inertia and in
 method of suspension.            The vibration of a magnet under sudden
 irregular variations of horizontal force and declination is in all prob
 ability a very complicated problem.
     § 31. The possibility of obtaining satisfactory             horizontal force
 measurements depends largely on avoiding times of serious magnetic
 disturbance.
      The shorter the time occupied by the observations, the better the
 chance of accomplishing this.          Supposing a uniform procedure adopted,
 the time occupied by a vibration experiment is independent of the
 observer     ; it is shorter the stronger the magnet and the greater the
 horizontal force.         It is thus of especial importance that collimator
  magnets intended for work in arctic regions, where the force is low
 and     disturbances     large   and   numerous,   should   be of high magnetic
 moment.
      In the deflection experiment a great deal depends on the skill of the
  observer, and      on the make       of the unifilar ; one observer  may do in
  twenty minutes        what occupies another for fifty.        Extreme conscien
  tiousness     may   be a positive demerit, owing to the excessive time spent
  in adjustments and readings.
      A variety    of other criticisms   will be considered   which apply to some
  one physical quantity, and are classified accordingly.
      § 32. Moment of inertia. — In default of any simple means of directly
  measuring the variation with temperature of the moment of inertia,
  this   variation is calculated by assuming for the coefficients of linear
  expansion     : —

                         12 x 10~6   „   „ collimator magnet.
      There is of course the uncertainty that the assumed mean values may

        Determination  of the Earth'* Horizontal   Mmjuwtic    Force.   .397
not apply very exactly to the particular samples of brass and steel em
ployed in any individual case ; and there is the further criticism that the
coefficient 12 x 10"° is applied to a composite moment of inertia K,
of which 25 to 30 per cent, is contributed by the magnet's appendages,
which are mainly brass. The expansion coefficients are employed first
in deducing the value of K at 0° C. from the value found at some
higher temperature, and then in calculating from the value at 0° C.,
thus found, a table giving K at all temperatures likely to occur in
actual use.    Any error that may arise in this way will be larger the
more remote the temperature from that existing during the special
inertia experiments.      Its probable magnitude cannot, however, he
directly arrived at in the absence of measurements] of the expansion of
specimen magnets, their appendages and auxiliary bars.
   A second source of uncertainty is the fact that one is obliged to
assume uniform density in the auxiliary bar.
   § 33. Torsion of suspending thread. — This is required (1) in reducing
the declination experiment, (2) in the vibration experiment determining
the horizontal force.
   For a considerable time prior to a declination experiment at Kew, the
suspending silk fibre is stretched by hanging from it a non-magnetic
plummet similar in weight to the magnet and its appendages.           As the
magnetic meridian is very approximately known, it is easy to arrange
that when the plummet is replaced by the declination magnet there
shall be very little twisting of the silk ; we may thus, with at least
reasonable probability, regard the thread at the beginning of the experi
ment as practically free from torsion.     After the experiment is con
cluded, the magnet is again replaced by the plummet, and after some
hours its position is noted.   In this way we can tell approximately the
angle ff through which the lower end of the thread has turned since the
last declination reading was taken. It is assumed that ff represents the
amount of torsion in the silk when the experiment ended, and that
this torsion was introduced gradually in the course of the experiment.
As the magnet has to    be  variously manipulated, there is no antecedent
 mprobability in the hypothesis ; but it will, I think, be recognised that
the taking 6'/2 as the mean torsion angle during the experiment is an
emendation whose success is likely to be variable.
   To allow for ff/2 of torsion, one introduces a given twist into the
thread and notes the consequent change of azimuth in the suspended
magnet.     The procedure adopted at Kew, is to turn the suspension
head carrying the thread through 180° first in one direction then in
another, noting the corresponding equilibrium jwsitions of the magnet.
   § 34. The occasion for a torsional correction in the vibration experi
ment is the existence of the couple ®6 in (6), and consequently of the
term 0'/«X in (7). The value of © m\ is deduced from the observed
changes in the azimuth of the collimator magnet when the suspension

398              Dr. C. Chrec.      Collimator Magnets and the
head is turned through ± 180°.           There are several possible criticisms.
In the actual vibration experiment, the thread is twisted at most only
a degree or two, and it is open to doubt whether a value found for ®
from twists through ± 180° is strictly applicable, even supposing the
conditions otherwise identical.
    There is usually more than one silk fibre in the suspension, and this
increases the probability that the value found statically for 0 may not
apply exactly to a vibration experiment.
    Another criticism is that experiment really gives ®/m'X', where m'
and   X' are the values of the magnetic moment and of the force during
the torsion     experiment, instead of ©/mX, where m is the moment at
0° C. and X the force during the vibration experiment.
    To judge of the effect of this, we require the relation between the
error in ®/mX        and   the consequent     error in X.     For this we have
from (5)
                               8X  =
                                      -XJS(0/»iX).
In order that SX should        equal  ± 5 x 10~G at    Kew we would require to
have
                        S(®/mX)     =  ±5 x l0-5, approx.
   When one uses a suspension sufficient for the collimator magnet
alone, without the auxiliary har, one can with an average magnet get
®/fliX as low as 4 x 10~4 at Kew.               Now an error of 10 per cent,
in ®/«X through neglecting the variation of m with temperature or
the fluctuations of X at a fixed station is quite out of the question.
    On the other hand, suspensions such as are frequently used to carry
the auxiliary bar as well as the magnet, and are intended to stand a
good     deal   of rough handling, may make ®//«X at Kew as large as
25 x   10~4.     In such a case error may occasionally arise through not
discriminating between        m and m.
    In  practice the most probable sources of error are inaccuracy in the
 torsion experiment and variation in ©, owing to variation of moisture,
 between the vibration and torsion experiments.

                                      — -In the method      of determining tem
 perature coefficients in vogue at Kew the collimator magnet is fixed
inside a wooden box, rigidly attached to the pillar which carries the
 tmifilar.    The calculation assumes the mirror magnet— which is sus
 pended as     in the deflection experiment — to b>e exactly perpendicular to
 the collimator ; but, owing to the position of the latter being fixed, this
 is in general only approximately true.           Suppose the deflected magnet

it would be very desirable to make the changes of temperature slow,
but in practice this     troublesome, owing to the disturbing influence of
                                       is
changes in declination and horizontal force.      A change of 18° C. in the

It clear that unless such permanent loss small, satisfactory values of

     In one   case   only one cycle was token.
     One cannot measure m accurately to one part in 100,000, much less
 to one part in a million, so that a high degree of accuracy can hardly
 be claimed for the above figures.               It seems, however, perfectly clear
 that normally there is a loss of magnetic moment, but that at the same
 time the average loss is very small.
     These conclusions were supported             by  a large number of      other   cases
 which I examined, though less carefully.
     On the average, according to Table               XII,    a complete temperature
 experiment causes a loss of about 0'04 per               cent, in the value of m, and
 of this loss much the greater part occurs during the first temperature
 cycle.*     The true reversible temperature variation of m during a cycle
 averages very sensibly over 1 per cent. ; thus the shock effect can cause
 but little error in the values of q and q' in the average magnet.
     Cases occur, however, in which the loss of magnetic moment is very
 considerable, and the values of           J  and q' may have suffered in conse
 quence.      The property seems to depend on the tempering, not on the
 chemical character of the steel ; for various magnets which have h>een
 rejected for defective retentiveness have behaved normally after further
 treatment by the maker.
     In some of the experiments summarized in Table XII there was a

slight apparent increase of moment at one or more of the stages. In
fact, in an old magnet not recently remagnetised, and in a new magnet
which had been put through a previous temperature experiment only
three days before, the moment appeared greater on the third occurrence
of the " hot temperature than on the first.

   In investigating these permanent changes of magnetic moment I
received valuable assistance from Mr. R. S. Whipple, then assistant at
Kew Observatory.
  § 37. There are several other sources of uncertainty affecting tem
perature coefficients. For instance, a small fall of temperature may
not always have an effect exactly equal and opposite to that of an
equal rise.
   Again, it is conceivable that the values of q and q' may depend to
some extent on the age or strength of the magnet, and so may alter in
course of time.   On this point I have some interesting data.
   In 1894 three collimator magneto after long absence in India were
sent to Kew Observatory to be reported on.        The opportunity was
taken to redetermine their temperature coefficients — originally deter
mined in 1 865 — before sending them for repair to the maker.    After
their return they were remagnetised and tested as usual.

    On the other hand, the values found for q and q' in 1895 — values
based in each case on two consistent experiments — are unmistakably
higher than those found in 1865 and 1894.                  There is no apparent
reason for this except the fact that the magnets had been remagnetised.
The makers, in reply to inquiries, stated explicitly that " the magnets
.    .    .  were only cleaned."
    We seem driven to the conclusion that whilst a gradual loss of mag
netic moment may not appreciably influence the values of the tempera
ture coefficients, the remagnetisation of a magnet does influence these
coefficients, in at least some cases.
    § 38. Inductum Coefficient.— The method of determining p has been
already described in § 3. There are here also several uncertainties.
    The assumption that the relation between the temporary moment
and the field is strictly linear may not be sufficiently exact; 0-44 C.G.S.
unit is a considerably stronger field than Lord Rayleigh found to limit
the linear part of his induction curves, and recent German observers
seem disposed to narrow his limits.        The accuracy of the assumption is
doubtless less in some collimators than in others, but I have no data on
which to proceed.                                    t
    * Again, it is open to doubt whether a
                                                    magnet possessed of a large
permanent moment responds equally to the action of two small fields,
one tending to increase, the other tending to diminish, the total
moment.        This uncertainty enters into the application of /> as well as
into its original determination.       For in the vibration experiment the
temporary and permanent magnetisms are in the same sense, whereas
in the deflection experiment they are in opposite senses.
    If  the presence of a permanent magnetic moment influences the value
of p, then the value found at Kew, even if otherwise above criticism,
 will presumably become less exact HS the moment falls oft'.
    Another source of uncertainty is the probability that            f* varies with
 the temperature.

collimator magnet as being on the east or west side of the mirror magnet,
and as having its north pole east or vast. The directions are not strictly
east and west, but perpendicular to the mirror magnet, as deflected out
of the magnetic meridian.     As the sense intended, however,       quite                         is
clear,  I     shall employ the usual terminology.

404             Dr. C. Chree.      Collimator Magnets and the
   In the accompanying      figure, which is not drawn to scale, W and E
                          and " east
                 " west "              "
represent the                            ends of the graduated bar on which
                  W
                  W
slides the frame carrying the collimator magnet.        The graduations ran
in both directions from 0, the centre of the bar. The centre of the
mirror magnet should be on the vertical line through 0, and also on
the horizontal line which is the prolongation of the magnetic axis of the
collimator NS. The figure shows the collimator magnet in the four posi
tions which it occupies during the deflections made at one of the two
distances, say 30 cm.      Supposing a 30 cm. deflection to be the first of
the day, the four positions are assumed in the order 1, 2, 3, 4.        It is
the rule at Kew Observatory that if a 30 cm. observation takes pre
cedence on a given occasion, then a 40 cm. observation has precedence
on the next.      On the second occasion the four 30 cm. positions occur
in the order 2, 1,4, 3. The object is very probably to eliminate so far
as   possible the influence of changes of force or temperature on the
value of P, which is calculated from a large number of observations.
   § 40. If there were perfect symmetry one should have identical read
ings    in positions 1 and 4, and again in positions 2 and 3. But, in
reality, agreement in these readings is wholly exceptional.        To elimi
nate the disturbing influence of observational errors and changes in
force a number of deflection experiments are necessary.           Thus, the
only case in which I have had the data requisite for an exhaustive study
is that of the Kew unifilar itself.
    In this instance the phenomena seem adequately explained by the
hypothesis    of the existence of such asymmetry     as we should anticipate
h priori.
    It is doubtless the aim of the maker to fit the suspension tube so that
the centre of the mirror magnet and the centre, or zero, of the graduated
bar in the deflection experiment shall lie in a vertical plane perpendi
cular to the bar    ; but complete success is unlikely to attend his       at
tempts.     Accordingly, my first assumption is that the centre of        the
mirror magnet is really at a distance -, counted positive towards         the
" east," from the vertical
                              plane perpendicular to the bar through      the
centre O.
   The frame carrying the collimator magnet has a fiducial mark at the
centre of its edge, which is set during the deflection experiment at the

      Determination of the Earth's Horizontal Magnetic Force.                                                         405
division 30 or 40 cm. on the bur. From the centre of the upper edge
of the frame a pillar extends vertically upwards, so as to fit into the
hollow shank which forms part of the appendages of the collimator
magnet.     The vertical plane perpendicular    to the bar through the
fiducial mark should contain the centre of the vertical pillar and also
that of the magnet.    Supposing the frame to have fiducial marks on
both sides, and that these agree, one can test the existence of the first
possible cause of asymmetry by turning the frame end for end, keep
ing the direction of the magnet unchanged ; the azimuth of the mirror
magnet will serve as a criterion.  This kind of asymmetry has not been
detected in the Kew unifilar; and if existent its influence would l>e
nearly eliminated in a large number of observations in which either
position of the sliding frame occurred promiscuously.      The existence
of the second species of asymmetry is less easily tested, but is more
probable a priori.   Accordingly my second assumption is that during
the deflection experiments the centre of the magnet is at a distance y
from the vertical plane which passes through the fiducial mark, and is
perpendicular to the magnet's length.     Here y is counted positive
when the magnet's centre and north pole are on the same side of the
fiducial mark.
   § 41. On these two hypotheses it is obvious from fig. 1, that when
the apparent distance between the centres of the magnets is r, the true
distances are as follows : —
        Position.                                    1.                2.                    3.             4.
     True distance                         r + y-z               r-y-z                 r+y+z            r-y + z.
  Now suppose that it and u + Su are the deflection angles of the
mirror magnet answering to the true distances r and r + Sr. Then,
according to the first approximation formula,
                                                                   =

whence, neglecting squares and products of Sn and                                           6V,   we have

   Taking the data for the Kew unifilar in 1892, we find
                          Kn  = 23 x   IQ-o (or about 48").

    In the   case of the   Kew unifilar, we have approximately
                           X  = 0-183,        cotu  = 3-61,
whence                8X    =   - 0-0000075    C.G.S., approx.
    Thus the error is nearly one unit in the last significant figure.                As
 the error varies as     y2  +  22,Jit would   become    of  very  sensible    magni
 tude if y and z were twice or thrice as large as in the Kew unifilar. If
 J may judge from the figures recorded of unifilars under examination at
 the Observatory, such large values of y and z really exist.
    The source of error just considered alters the observed deflections
at 30 and 40 cm. in the same sense, and seems unlikely to exert an
appreciable influence on the value of P.
    § 43. Causes of Asymmetry.
                                     — A collimator magnet ought to be ad
 justed in its stirrup until it is exactly horizontal in the vibration
 experiment.       The magnetic forces acting on it tend, in this magnetic
 hemisphere,     to pull the [north pole down, and consequently the centre
of gravity of the composite body composed of magnet and appendages
 must be out of the vertical, which is the prolongation of the suspend
 ing fibre, and on the same side of it        as the south pole.     If   the stirrup
is symmetrical, and if the lens and scale of the magnet                are equal in
 weight and symmetrically situated, then the C.G. of the magnet itself
 must, in this hemisphere, lie on the same side of the suspending fibre
as the south pole.
    Now the suspending fibre in the vibration experiment, if produced,
 should cut the magnetic axis at the same point as it is cut in the
 deflection experiment] by the vertical plane which is perpendicular to
 the magnet, and contains the fiducial mark on the sliding frame.
    Thus in a perfectly symmetrical magnet the middle point of the
                                                                             " poles "
 magnet's length, and so the middle point of the line joining the
 (assuming magnetic symmetry) must lie on one side of the fiducial
 mark, and so of the graduation on the bar which coincides with it.
    Calling the error thus introduced in the distance r between the
 of Su, a quantity whose physical significar.ee is easily grasped.  But   a sufficiently
 ciacl  value of JX can be obtained more simply from the relation  (r + tr)3 (X + SXj1
  = r'XZ (see (4)).

magnets' centres y, measured as in § 40, we can find its value if we
know the circumstances of the case. Thus suppose the magnet to have
a moment 840 and to weigh, with lens and scale, 30 grams ; then at
a place where g (gravity) is 980, and the vertical magnetic force, is
0-44, we have
             -y   =
                      (840 x 0-44)

   The value thus found for y is not only much less numerically, but
even opposite in sign to the va'lue calculated for the Kew collimator
magnet in § 41.  There is nothing surprising in this, because the per
fect symmetry which our last calculation assumes in the magnet and its
appendages is a remote probability.                         For instance, the lens and scale
of the magnet, in the only case where                        I had them weighed, differed by
nearly half a gram.         If other things were symmetrical this alone
would remove the C.G. nearly 0'08 cm. from the symmetrical position.
   Mechanical asymmetry might arise in many other ways.                   The
magnet itself,   for instance, might be slightly conical.
   It is also at least conceivable that magnetic asymmetry may exist.
If a magnet were conical, or had one end tempered differently from
                                                    "
the other, I see no reason to expect its " poles      to be equidistant from
the middle point of its length.
   § 44. Whilst numerous causes may contribute to the asymmetrical
displacement     denoted by y, the first mentioned appears the most
interesting. Not merely is                  it,
                                       as we have seen, unavoidable, but                               it
varies  if either m or the vertical force alters.
   The vertical force on the earth's surface varies from about + 0'6 to
-  0'6 C.G.S. unit.     Thus      the typical magnet above considered were
                                 if
adjusted so as to be horizontal under the one limiting force,          would                 it
have to be shifted about 0'034 cm. in its stirrup to become horizontal
under the other.
   The shifting in the stirrup entailed by this variable cause of
asymmetry slightly affects the moment of inertia. For instance             the                    if
symmetrical magnet considered above, for which               = 0'0113 cm. at   y
Kew, were used in        atropical station where the vertical force vanished,
y  should be reduced to          and the consequent change in moment of
                                 0,
inertia would be
             SK   =    - 30 (0-01 3)2       =       - 0-005         C.G.S. unit, approx.
    The mean      K   in TableI   is    2711/jr2, or 274 approximately                   ;   and with
these values
                             SK/K      =        -   2   x   10"5,    approx.
    Supposing     no allowance        made for this, the consequent                      error in      X
would   be
                                 SX         =       -   X   x   10-5.

       Determination      of the. Earth's Horizontal Magnetic           Fmce.   409
    This would hardly be sensible supposing X measured              as usual to five
significant figures.    It might happen however that owing to asymmetry
in the stirrup the C.G. of the magnet — with scale and lens — had to lie,
in the absence of vertical force, at a distance        d, comparable with 1 mm.
on one side of the suspension fibre.             Under such circumstances the
change in the moment of inertia when the vertical force altered from
0'44 to  0  would exceed that calculated above in the ratio
                                    2d   : 0-013.
   As perfect mechanical symmetry must             be the exception, we see that
this source of uncertainty is likely to be considerably more serious
than might be supposed from our first example.
   The above considerations may suggest that shifting the collimator
magnet in its stirrup is a mistake.         If, however, this is not done when
required to keep the magnet          horizontal,    the magnet and appendages
must tilt over slightly.      This not only alters the moment of inertia,
but likewise prevents the magnetic couple in the vibration experiment
from having its proper value.
    The source of trouble we have just been considering is distinctly
exceptional in this respect, that it is most serious in magnets of large
magnetic moment.

of the axis of the collimator magnet, and that the axes of the two
magnets    are perpendicular to one another.           With the magnets in the

    § 46. Both collimator and mirror magnets are comparatively
i.e., their lengths are only about ten times their diameters.                      In such
magnets     we should      expect, according      to Coulomb,
                         2X = 21/3,                  2X' = 2f/3,
where / and    f  are the lengths of the magnets.              The formulae by Green,
Jamin, and others are more complicated.
    Perhaps all we are justified in saying, fi priori, is that X and X' cannot
exceed 1/2 and l'/2, and that the collimator and mirror magnets are
sufficiently similar in pattern to make it probable that the assumption
                                        X'/X = l'/l
is not far wrong.
    To throw some light on the question, I had measurements made of
 the magnets of the Kew unifilar and of a unifilar of class E.                   The Kew
 unifilar belongs to group B, and its P is negative but exceptionally
small.     The instruments of group E are, as we have already seen,
exceptionally uniform in character, and invariably have their P large
and positive.
    The results were as follows, lengths being in centimetres,

    These figures, taken in conjunction with our previous data, are on
the whole distinctly favourable to the hypothesis

    Accepting this hypothesis provisonally, I had the curiosity to see what
value we should obtain for n by ascribing to P the mean value found
for unifilars of group E, taking for I and I' the values quoted above for
a unifilar of that group.

    Equating to one another the two values of Tr~- at 30 cm., the one         as
 given above, the other as given in Table I, we have
                        0 57X2 x 30-2 = 655 x 10-5.
 Thus                   X = 3 2 1,  approx.,

    The practically exact agreement with Coulomb's relation
                                  2X = 2Z/3
 seems   to warrant the conclusion    that if we employ this relation in
calculating Q the result is likely to be of at least the right order of
 magnitude.
    On this hypothesis, taking the values 9-35 and 9-17 for        /, as fairly
representative of the two groups, we have with r = 30 cm.,
    Probable value of Qr~* in unifilar of group B    =   - 5 x 10~4,  approx.
                                                  E  =   - 3 x 10-"      „
   Assuming the value of    P to be correctly determined,     the error in   X
due to the omission of the Q term is given by
                             8X/X        iQ/30*.
    Taking   the numerical   values found above for Q, we should          have
when    X  = 0-18—
          For mean unifilar of group B, 8X   =   + 5 x 10~6,  approx.

   There is admittedly much uncertainty in these numerical estimates,
but they undoubtedly indicate that the neglect of Q requires justifi
cation.
   If  the Q term is not negligible then the ordinary method, which
assumes that the P term is the sole cause of the difference between the
two values of to/X, given by the first approximation formula with
r = 30 and r = 40, must lead to a wrong value for P.
   Now the P correction does not strike a mean between the results at
30 and 40 cm., but adds to or subtracts from both values of mjX.
Thus the indirect consequences of neglecting Q may be as important as
the direct.

taken by the two magnets in the deflection experiment is that termed
by Borgen "Erste Lamont'sche Hauptlage." According to Lamont's

             Q     must  vary according to the law of distribution  of free

ever, no experimental   data  bearing on either of these points.
     48. The present paper may seem premature, in view of the number
     §
of questions which      raises without finally answering.
                               it                            To wait, how
ever, until experiment had given a final answer to all the questions
would simply mean shelving the whole subject indefinitely. Many of
the questions could be satisfactorily dealt with only by elaborate experi
ments.    Such experiments are hardly likely to be carried out at any
public institution, within    reasonable time, until the necessity for them
                                    a
has been clearly demonstrated.
   The investigations embodied in this paper have extended over
several years, and the results obtained are likely,        think, to be of

  The unifilar magnetometer             not the only instrument capable of
                                          is
measuring    the  horizontal force.    Induction coil methods have of late
years been introduced and advocated by eminent authorities.            The
question  of  the  relative merits  of magnetometers and induction coils          is
very likely,    think, to come to the front in few years, and
                     I                                   a          hardly

the respective methods are clearly understood.
    Again, there has been an increasing tendency of late years, in
most lines of physical research, to add figure to figure, and to aim
•at   higher accuracy, or at least the appearance of higher accu
racy. If people were content with giving magnetic force to four
significant figures, the majority of the sources of uncertainty
specified in this paper need awaken little apprehension.              But now-a
days hardly any one is content with less than five significant figures,
and one occasionally sees six. I am not prepared to say that the reten
 tion of six figures is indefensible in the case of open range magneto-
graphs, when it is clearly understood that differences only are concerned,
•but I do think that with unifilars of the Kew pattern, as hitherto made,
the least probable error we can reasonably expect in an absolute
measurement is two or three units in the fifth significant figure.
    § 49. We have seen that there is every reason to expect that the values
 of the horizontal force given by a unifilar are in error to a different extent,
 according to the temperature and the magnitude of the force.                 This
 must introduce a source of uncertainty into the comparisons effected
 •between unifilars at distant observatories     through the intermediary of
•a travelling instrument.      To adequately forewarn those engaged in
 such comparisons may be to put them in a position to obtain more
 satisfactory results.
    § 50. For the opinions expressed in this paper, and for the accuracy
 of its conclusions, I am alone responsible ; but it is only proper that I
 should acknowledge the valuable assistance given me by Mr. T. W.
 Baker, Chief Assistant at the Kew Observatory. For many years
 Mr. Baker has taken the great majority of magnetic force observations
 at Kew, and his experience in determining the " constants
                                                                    "

 ready to place his great practical knowledge of the subject freely at my
 disposal, and I have also to thank him for carefully carrying out a
 variety of special experiments, made to elucidate doubtful points at
 various stages of the inquiry.
 "The Absorption        of  Eontgen's Rays by Aqueoun Solutions of
        Metallic Salts."     By the Right Honourable LORD BLYTHS-
        WOOD, LL.D., and E. W. MAHCIIANT, D.Sc.            Communicated by
        LORD KELVIN, F.R.S.        Received March 11, — Read June 15,
        1899.
    The absorption of    X rays by metallic salts is a subject that has not
 received very much       attention up to the present time, although it
 appears to be of considerable importance.      It seemed possible that if the

414              Lord Blythswood and Dr. E. W. Marchantx
absorption were atomic, that is if the absorption of the rays were not
 produced so much, by the nature of the molecule as by the constituents
 of the molecule, there ought to be some simple relation between the
absorbing powers of salts having the same acid radicle.                 This investi
 gation, however, was originally suggested with a view to finding out
 whether the very great difference in the transparency of individuals to
Rontgen rays might not be caused by an excess of some salt in the
composition of the blood or muscular tissue.*              Some results have been
obtained by different experimenters, the most exhaustive treatment of
the subject up to the present having been given by Dr. Gladstone 'and
Mr. Hibbert (B.A. Reports, Section B, 1896, 1897, 1898).t                       They
found that the physical condition of the absorbing substance (whether
solid or liquid) produced no very marked differences, also that the
absorption of a mixture of salts was the same as that of the double salt
in the same state of division, and that the change in atomicity of th«
absorbing substance produced no appreciable effect, also that the total
absorption produced by a solution was the sum of the absorptions of
the salt and its solvent.
    They also found that the absorptive power depended on the atomic
weight and not on the density or combining proportions ; using an
aluminium stepped scale they found that the absorption appeared to
increase logarithmically with the thickness of aluminium traversed.
The same experimenters have also examined the absorptive power of
various metals and metallic salts, and have compared that of different
acid radicles.          Before, however, their results were published             the
present   investigation      was taken   up, and   the  results obtained   appear to
be of considerable interest.           Similar results have been obtained by
several others, J     but   all are included in the more exhaustive work of
Dr. Gladstone and Mr. Hibbert.
    The great difficulty found in the investigation was the obtaining of
quantitative results, as, although it is a comparatively simple matter to
obtain approximate qualitative results, it is much more difficult to
obtain even approximately accurate quantitative values.                   The only
method which appeared to offer much prospect of success was a photo
graphic one, and all the values given below have been obtained photo
graphically.
    The first method adopted was to place two cells made of thin glass
in front of two holes cut in a thick lead sheet, one cell being filled with
water and the other with the solution to be tested ; the photographic

      A ground glass screen was placed behind the plate to obtain uniform
 illumination of the spots.           It was found with this arrangement that
 the relative intensities could be determined with considerable accuracy,
 but that the relative intensities depended to a certain extent on the
 time of development, as has also been noticed by Hurter and Driffield.
 Another disadvantage of this method was that the allowance that had
 to be made for the absorption of the glass was a comparatively large
 one with many solutions, and that the error incident on the determina
tion of this correction was such as to materially alter the relative
absorbing powers.           Thus if a be the percentage of absorption due to
the glass of the cells (which was within limits of expeiimental error
equal for the two cells employed), b that due to the water in one cell,
and b + c that due to the solution in the other cell, c being supposed to
be that part of the absorption due to the presence of the dissolved salt,
the ratio actually observed in this method by comparing the intensities
of the two spots is —
             a+  b+ < —    absorption  due to the cell and dissolved salt
              a+   b            absorption due to the cell and water
If     therefore  c  is small compared with b or a, the accuracy attainable is
very much         reduced.      For very absorbent substances, however, this
method gave fairly good results.
     A very important question in connection with this investigation was
the standard with which all these aqueous solutions were to be com

 <pared.    It  seemed most satisfactory, since all the solutions that were
 tested were aqueous, to choose water for the standard absorber, and all
 numbers given are relatively to water.
     Now, to determine the relative absorbing power of the salt in solu
 tion, compared with the absorbing power of water, we may consider
 the absorption of the solution to be split up into two parts, one due to
 the absorption of the water of which the solution is made up, and the
 other part due to the salt dissolved.
     Now, as above, let a = percentage absorption due to cell, b = per
 centage absorption due to the water, c = percentage absorption due to
 the salt.     Then first comparing the intensities of two spots, as above,
 one obtained through an empty cell and one through a cell filled with
-water, we have

     The assumption here made is that the intensity of the black spot on
  the negative is proportional to the intensity of the light falling on it.
     With the cells used Ki = 1-7.
     The second method used for the determination of the relative
  absorbing powers, was based on the fact that the amount of absorption
  of any substance varies with the thickness of the layer traversed by
  the ray.
     The arrangement     of the apparatus was as shown in fig. 2.
     EE is a wooden base supporting the two uprights HH, to which is
  attached a thick lead sheet (shaded diagonally in the figure).            In the
  uprights, HH, three grooves are cut, into which          fit  the bases   of the
  three cells, 1, 2, 3, which are thus supported one above the other on
   their wooden stand.        The cells 1 and 3 are wedge-shaped, being
   137 mm. long, and 20 mm. wide at the broadest part, sloping away to
   nothing at the thin end of the wedge.           The cells are about     25 mm.

about 1'6 mm. thick.        On the other side of the lead sheet the dark
slide containing the plate is placed, stops being arranged so that the
plate is always in the sam* position relatively to the wedges.

    Opposite the cells three oblong holes 115 mm. long by 20 mm. wide
are cut in the lead sheet, so as to allow the rays to fall on the photo
graphic plate   ; the focus tube used was placed 300 mm. distant from the
plate,  and   was   arranged so that the centre of the reflector or anti-
cathode was opposite the middle of the centre hole in the lead.
    In an experiment the two wedge-shaped cells 1 and 3 were filled
with the solutions that required testing, while the middle cell 2 was
filled with water.       It was found that the intensity of the radiation
from the tube was very nearly constant over the whole plane of the
plate, the variation in intensity of the strip obtained opposite the
middle slit varying very little from one side to the other.         Also, no
difference could be perceived when the cells 1 and 3 were filled with
the same liquid, thus showing that the variation in the vertical direc
tion was negligible.
    In all experiments the same focus tube was used, the intensity of the
X rays being adjusted by heating. To give an idea of the penetrative
power of the rays used, it may be stated that at a distance of 1 2 inches
from the tube, the bones of the hand were clearly visible on a fluorescent
screen, while the flesh still appeared dark.        By this very rough test
the tube was brought as nearly as possible to the same condition for
each experiment.        It was found, however, that the use of different
penetrative powers had very little effect on the relative absorbing
powers of the solutions, though the actual intensity of the rays was
greatly altered.      In all experiments the plates used were Edwards'
" Cathodal Plates "
                         (5 inches by 4 inches) ; they were developed by
hydrokinone     and   potassium carbonate in from ten to twelve minutes
during the warm weather, the time necessary being increased during the
colder months.

   Now to determine       the absorbing     powers by measurement of these
plates, a special form of photometer        was devised for the purpose, as
shown below, fig. 3.

eye  from  all light, except that which appears at the slits in G.
   A piece of ground glass or white paper was placed behind the slit
so as to form a uniformly illuminated background.
   The plate was shifted along its slide until the intensity of the illumi
nation of the slits 1 and 2 (say) was equal, the reading on the scale
opposite the edge of the plate was then noted, a series of values was
taken and the mean value calculated.           The scale was so placed that
the scale reading gave the distance from the end of the strip corre

  Now proceeding to a consideration of the results obtained, it is at
once clear that the absorption, in almost every case, in these normal
solutions, increases with the atomic weight, i.e., the higher the atomic

  weight of the elements of which a salt is oomposed the greater is the
  absorption. This effect is most noticeable in the case of bromides and
•
  iodides.*      In all cases these salts are absorbent, even- when the.
  bromine     and    iodine are combined with the transparent sodium
  and magnesium.          The iodides also are more absorbent than the .
  bromides.
      Now proceeding to the consideration of the absorption produced by
  salts with other acid radicles, the differences are not so marked, but in
  all cases the least absorbent salt is the nitrate, the next the chloride,
  the most absorbent being the sulphate ; this does not agree with the
  order of increase of the molecular densities, or of the atomic weights
  of the constituents.       It would therefore appear that the absorptive
  power is not entirely dependent on the atomic weight of the compo
   nents of the acid radicle, or on its molecular density ; the order in
   the first case being (1) nitrates (N = 14), (2) sulphates (S = 32), and
   (3) chlorides (CI
                       =
                           35-5) ; (2) and (3) being nearly equal.          While in
   the second place the order should be : (1) Chlorides (CI = 35-5), (2)
                       =                                = 62);      while the order
   sulphates    (S04      48) (3) nitrates (N08
   actually observed is (1)     nitrates, (2) chlorides, (3) sulphates.
      Acetates are slightly less absorbent           than chlorides, though the
   number of salts tried is small ; only four giving results to which
   weight can be attached, since aluminium and iron were simply powdors
   in suspension and partially precipitated.
      It now remains to be seen if there is any definite connection between
   the equivalent weight of the bases composing the different salts and
   their absorptive powers.          Their order may be written down as
   follows : —

       The metals bracketed together have very nearly the same absorp
   tive power.     The order given above does not agree very nearly with
   the order    of increase of equivalent weight ; it agrees more closely,
   however, with the order of increase of atomic weight.                  It is to be
    noticed particularly, that the salts of the        alkali metals are less absor
    bent than might have been expected from their equivalent weight, also

that in the calcium, strontium and barium group the amount of
absorption does not increase rapidly with the increase in atomic weight.
It may therefore be generally stated that the absorptive power of
•alts having different bases, but the same acid radicle, increases with
the atomic weight of the metal forming the base, though not accord
ing to any definite law.
    This agrees with the results obtained by Dr. Gladstone and Mr.
Hibbert.
                Effect of Rays of different Penetrative Powers.
   As stated above, the penetrative power of the X rays used did not
tave much effect on the apparent relative absorptive powers of the
different solutions, but as a still further check on the power of the rays
used, the time taken for the developer to bring the strip on the plate
photographed, through 20 mm. of water, to sufficient density (allow
ance being made for the temperature) was always observed, and if this
differed much from that necessary on a normal plate, the experiment
was repeated.     Measurements made on these rejected plates, however,
showed that within limits of experimental error, there was no differ
ence between absorptions thus obtained and those calculated from mea
surements made on      fully exposed negatives.      Measurements were also
made using rays of different penetrative power, and developing for the
same time; but the plates obtained admitted of only such rough
measurement     that here again no differences were detected, the strips
being either too dense, or the differences in intensity at the two ends
corresponding to the thick and thin ends of the wedges being too
slight, to admit of accurate photometry.          It may be stated generally
therefore that the rays of different penetrative powers do not appear
to have any effect on the relative absorptive powers of the different
solutions.
                         Effect of Strength of Solution.
    In order to determine the effect produced by using solutions of dif
ferent strengths, a number of measurements were made on various
salts : (1) Lead acetate, (2) potassium bromide, (3) iodine in potas
sium iodide, (4) nickel chloride, (5) sodium thiosulphate (strong solu
tion).
    Curves are plotted below showing the relation between the amount
of salt in solution and the thickness necessary to produce the same
amount of absorption as 20 mm. of water.             From these numbers it is
clear that the amount of absorption is not proportional to the number
of molecules of the salt traversed by the ray, and does not appear to
follow any simple law. The connection appears to be logarithmic from
the shape of the curves.

                     Effect of Thickness of Solution traversed.
   Various experiments have been made in order to verify the state
ment made by Messrs. Gladstone and Hibbert and others* that the
amount of absorption varies logarithmically with the thickness traversed
by the ray —
                                   r =   log (Xi  +  ii),
where    r = percentage      of the rays absorbed by the solution under con
sideration.      The results obtained appear to confirm their conclusion.
As a preliminary experiment, the intensities at different distances
along the strips on three of the plates above considered were carefully
compared with the intensity of the strip photographed through 20 mm.
of water.      Now proceeding to consider          these results   —
    Let A0   be the   original intensity of the X rays.
         Ai  the amount of the rays absorbed by the water.
         Ao the amount of the rays absorbed by a given thickness of the
                solution.
         X] be the coefficient    of absorption      for water.
         X2 be the coefficient of absorption         for the solution.
Then the intensity of the strip obtained by passing the rays through
 20 mm. of water is proportional to A                -  Ah and the intensity of the
photographic image at the distance along the strip corresponding to
                                                          -

intensities of the photographic images (K2), we have

   Below are given the results for the three plates used in the test
experiments.      The relative intensities were obtained by means of an
arrangement    similar  to that described for the determination of the
relative intensities of the spots on the photographic plate in method                                             I  ;
but arrangements were made to bring the illuminated images nearer to
each other to enable more accurate comparison to be made.
  The errors, when all precautions were taken, were not greater than
6 per cent, for the determination of the relative intensities, corre
sponding to   per cent, on the determination of the distances of the

   It will    be  seen, therefore,   that the value of X was not constant for
water, and hence not for solutions, if they obey the same laws.                  This is
confirmed by observations made on plates where the penetrative power
was not sufficiently great to give a dense photograph.                   The variation

 in the intensity of the photographic image, according to the thickness
 of the solution traversed, appearing to be much less than with rays of
 greater penetrative power, although, as stated above, the thickness of
 the solution necessary to produce the same amount of absorption as
 20 mm. of water was constant within limits of experimental error.*
 This agrees with the observation of M. Buguet (loc. cit.).                       The
 values of A for the different solutions have not therefore              been calcu
 lated.
    The value of p for the apparatus used would (from the comparatively
 close agreement with theory of the above numbers) seem to be
 negligible.
    The results given above show that the logarithmic law is at any rate
approximately true.
                                      Conclusions.
    1. 'The absorption produced by normal aqueous solutions of metallic
           salts having the same acid radicle, increases with increase of
           atomic weight of the base.
    2.  Metals belonging to the alkali group are not very absorbent,
           neither are those belonging to the calcium, strontium, and
           barium group, their atomic weight being taken into con
           sideration.
    3.  Bromides and iodides of the metals are all highly absorbent.
    4.  With the three common acids, the order of increasing absorptive
           power is nitrate, chloride, sulphate.
    5.  The absorption produced by a salt is dependent mainly on the
           atomic weight of its constituents.
   * Considering this statement in the light of the known facts with
                                                                         regard to the
photography of the bones of the hand, it will be seen that fact* are not in contra
diction to the conclusions drawn from these experiments.       With rays of low pene
trative power, the whole hand appears dark though the screen appears light
(assuming X large fijr the flesh and much larger for the bones), the reason being
that both the flesh and bones absorb nearly all the rays. Assume, for example, (hat
for this penetrative power the flesh allows only 1/100 of the light to pass and the
bones 1/1000. Now, using rays of greater penetrative power we may assume that
the flesh will allow l/10th of the light to pass while the bones will only allow
1/l0Oth to pass.    The bones will now be faintly visible.    Pushing the penetrative
power still further, assume that the flesh now allows half of the light to pass, the
bonos will allow only l/20th, and will be very sharply defined.     With still further
exhaustion of the tube the flesh may now be assumed to allow 9/l0ths of the light

bones themselves begin to appear transparent.
   At the same time it is Dot assumed that the ratio of the absorption for the
different salts does remain constant throughout this very wide range, but that the
fact that the ratio of the absorptions appears to remain constant through a limited
range while the actual absorption may differ appreciably through this range, is not
in contradiction to other observations.

•Clebsch    has used such elliptic co-ordinates to solve the torsion problem
for hollow cylinders bounded by confocal ellipses, and de Saint-Venant
has applied conjugate functions to the same problem for shafts whose
sections     are sectors of circles        ;  curvilinear co-ordinates have also been
employed by Mr. H. M. Macdonald,* but I am not aware that the
actual solution has yet been obtained for sections bounded by both
ellipses and hyperbolas.
     The work proceeds on lines analogous to those developed by Saint-
 Venant himself in his solution of the problem of torsion for the cylinder
 of rectangular cross-section.            The strains and stresses are expressible
in terms of infinite series involving circular and hyperbolic functions.
     The boundaries of the section are given by constant values of £ and
 tj.   The values of £ are taken to be ± a.
     The conditions from which the unknown quantity w (the shift par
 allel to the axis) is determined are
                                                          = 0

 430             Mr. L. N. G. Filon.     On the Resistance
 the differential equation  and the first boundary condition are identi
 cally satisfied.
   When this value is substituted in the second boundary condition, we
 get an equation expressing a given function of £ in a series of sines of odd
 multiples of >r£/2a, between the limits + a and     a. -
   But such an expression      can be definitely obtained by a method
 analogous to that for Fourier's     series. Comparing coefficients, we
 obtain relations which determine     completely    all the constants in the
 expression of w\.
   w is then known.    The shears and torsion moment are         then deduced
by differentiation and a double integration.
   The cross-sections which are dealt with in the present        paper, are of
very great generality, and they include as special cases         many of the
cross-sections which Saint- Venant has worked out, for           instance   the
rectangle and the sector of a circle.
   The first section of which   I treat is that bounded by an ellipse and
two confocal hyperbolas.   Although the analysis is worked out for the
case where the    two hyperbolic segments are not symmetrical, I have
 not given any numerical examples of this case, as the sections obtained
 by taking two hyperbolas curved the same way do not correspond to
 any interesting practical case : the section is too broad at the ends and
 too narrow at the bend, to be any fair representation of the angle
 iron.
    The section bounded by an ellipse and the two branches of a con-
 focal hyperbola  is, on the other hand, an approximate representation
 ofa   well-known section, much used in engineering practice, the rail
 section.   This sectionI     have worked out for various values of the
 eccentricity of the ellipse, and of the angle between the asymptotes of
 the hyperbola.     The four sections where this angle       120° give the
                                                            is
best representation of the rail section.
    The numerical results are tabulated so as to show the ratio of the
torsional rigidity of this section to that of the circular section of the
same area, and also the same ratio for the maximum stress.
    The ratio of these two ratios gives us kind of measure of the use

                         "
                           of the section.
    In the case of the latter class of sections,   I  have investigated at
length the position of the fail-points, or points of maximum strain and
stress, the maximum strain, in the case of torsion, being coincident
with the maximum stress. It     is  found that for the two smaller ellipses
the maximum stress occurs at the point             B,where the section      is
thinnest.    For the two larger ellipses, the maximum stress occurs at
             F,

and lying on     the  broad   sides of the section.  The critical section,
when these two cases pass into one another, can be calculated, and          is
shown in the paper.

   The changes in the stresses are shown by curves accompanying the
paper, in which the abscissa represents the quantity a, whose hyperbolic
cosine and sine are proportional to the major and minor axes of the ellipse
respectively, and in which the ordinates represent the stresses at A, B, F,
divided by the maximum stress of the circular section of equal area.
The curves are, in certain parts, only roughly drawn, but they suffice to
show the manner in which the stresses vary.             It is seen that the stress
at B separates from the maximum stress after the critical value a =
1 -225, and gradually diminishes, compared with stresses at A and F.
   This result might have been expected from the investigations of do
Saint-Venant upon certain sections bounded by curves of the fourth
degree.
   These investigations appear, however, not to have been sufficiently
noticed.     Thomson and Tait in their ' Natural Philosophy,' and
Boussinesq in his researches on Torsion,* both conclude that the fail-
points are at the points of the cross-section nearest to the centre, and
Boussinesq   even gives an apparently general proof of this proposition.
His proof, however, is subject to certain restrictions, which I point out,
and which prevent it from being applied to the sections I am dealing
with.
   The sections are sensibly less useful than the circular section, their
torsional rigidity being always diminished and the maximum stress
very often increased.         This remark, I may add, applies to all the
sections dealt with in this paper.
   This usefulness or efficiency decreases         as the    neck   of the section
becomes more narrow, as indeed might have been anticipated.
   Other sections worked out are those corresponding to angles between
the asymptotes        of 90°,  60°, and 0°  ; in the latter case the sections
degenerate into ordinary elliptic sections, with two straight slits or
indefinitely thin keyways, cut into them along the major axis, as far as
the foci. The stress at the foci, however, is then theoretically infinite.
   It is interesting to see how, as we make the bend round the foci
sharper, the values of a, for which the two fail-points break up into
 four, become larger and larger, until, when the angle between the
asymptotes of the hyperbolas is less than 73°, the greatest stress always
occurs at the neck of the section.
    The limiting case of such sections, when the angle between the
asymptotes is very small, and the eccentricity of the ellipse nearly unity,
the distance between the foci being very great, gives us the rectangle.
    I then pass on to the section bounded by one ellipse and one confocal
hyperbola. In the limiting case, when the foci coincide, we obtain the
sector of a circle.     Of this I have worked out numerically three cases,
in each case taking two ellipses.

    2.  The ellipse with a keyway cut into it of the shape of      a rectangular
confocal hyperbola.
    3.  The ellipse with a single slit cut into it.
    The most striking of the results is in reference to the reduction of
 the torsional rigidity of the ellipse in case (3).           This reduction of
rigidity decreases rapidly    as the depth of the notch decreases.
    The rigidity, which    is reduced by as much as 23 per cent, when the
depth of the keyway is as great as 0'6 (semi-major axis), falls to about
 1 per cent, when this depth is (H2 (semi-major
                                                        axis).
    Possibly this may throw some light on the fact that the effect of
cutting such slits into the material does not always give in practice
the reduction in the torsional     rigidity which should have been expected
 from Saint- Venant's results for the circle.       Clearly the depth of the
keyway is a factor of the very first importance, and keyways of mode
rate depth will produce a comparatively small effect on the torsional
 rigidity.
    It is also shown that the effect of cutting two equal and opposite
slits is practically equal, in the two cases which I have calculated
(namely a = 77/6 and a = ir/2), to twice the effect of a single slit.
    It seems, therefore, that the study of these sections brings to light
several interesting facts in the theory of elasticity, and will well repay
the trouble involved in dealing with the long and somewhat tedious
algebra and arithmetic which lead to these results.

                   EMrometer      Records   of ihe. Organ Shock.
    In the month of March of the present year, 1899, the Committee of
 the Corporation Museum, Liverpool, kindly placed at the disposal of
 one of us (F. G.) two living specimens of Malapternrus fleclricus.           They
were exhibited at a lecture delivered in London at the Royal                Institu
tion on March      17.   One of the fish died         from accidental injury, the
other was employed by us for the purpose of determining the electro
motive force of the organ shock, and for investigating such other points
of interest as were feasible.
   We decided to employ for the determinations the special capillary
electrometer    made by one of us (G. J. B.), which we had utilised in our
researches upon the electrical phenomena of nerve.*                 Our previous
work upon the organ of Malfipterurus rendered it certain that consider
able precautions would have to be adopted in connection with this
instrument, since it was a much more sensitive one than those we had
used in the researches described in our previous paper upon the sub
ject, t It was therefore first necessary to make a number of prelimin
ary experiments in order to reduce the extent of any excursion due to
the organ shock within such limits that it could be recorded.               Several
trials with different voltages resulted in our employing a non-inductive
shunt of three incandescent lamps ; these were placed in parallel be
tween the electrometer     connections     and had a combined        resistance   of
2G'G ohms.      We diminished the size of the record still further by re
placing the high objective of the projecting microscope                by a lower
power, Zeiss, B.
   Our previous experiments made in 1895 showed us that the organ
shock developed so rapidly that the records then obtained were all too
steep to admit of accurate analysis.          It seemed certain, therefore, that

modified   ; the rate of transit of the photographic plate upon which the
image of the mercurial meniscus was projected, was made much quicker,
whilst the whole organ of the fish was effectually cooled to a low tem
perature, 5°C.
   As we had only one fish, we made several attempts to catch a record
of the natural discharge of the organ upon the travelling plate.             It
was found, however, to be practically impossible to do this, since the
reflex responses obtained from the uninjured fish were not merely un
certain as to their time of commencement but also very variable as to
their intensity.
   We determined,       therefore, to kill the fish and utilise the nerve
organ   preparation   for  the purpose of obtaining the necessary data.
   A further consideration induced us to take this course. Determina
tions made upon an entire fish must be of little value for the calculation
of the E.M.F. of the change produced in each excited disc, owing to
the complicated physical conditions of an experiment made under these
circumstances.      On the other hand it appeared to be easy to cut an
organ strip and arrange it so that the distance between the contacts,
which connected it with the electrometer, should be perfectly definite ;
moreover, with such a strip the number of discs comprised in the actual
distance between the contacts could be enumerated after the experi
ment    by examining appropriate sections made through the whole of
this portion of the organ.
   The fish was therefore anaesthetised by immersion in ice-cold water
and then killed.      A strip of the organ was now detached and the nerve
carefully dissected out ; this nerve organ preparation was placed upon
a glass plate in a special moist chamber kept at a uniform temperature
of 5° C. The nerve was excited by a single break induced current of
such an intensity as our previous experience had shown to be neces
sary in order to evoke a maximal organ response (Kronecker coil with
core, one Daniell in primary, secondary at 10,000).          The break induc
tion shock was produced by the movement of the recording pendulum,
and was so timed as to occur when the photographic plate carried by
the pendulum reached the slit upon which the image of the meniscus
was projected.      The electrometer contacts were so placed as to lie 15
mm. apart upon the thickest portion of the organ.              Thirteen photo
graphs   were    taken,   of  which  two   (Nos. 3012,  3013) gave excellent
records suitable for accurate      analysis.   In the first of these (3012), a
facsimile reproduction of which is shown in fig. 1, the three-lamp
shunt was placed between the electrometer terminals.            In the second
record (3013) the two-lamp shunt was employed.
    The response in both these experiments was very marked, and,
 owing probably to the low temperature, was more delayed in its onset
and slower in its development than we had anticipated.

the nerve suddenly failed, and it is interesting to note that this failure
was attended by inability of the organ to respond when a stimulus was
applied either     to the nerve      or to the organ substance.              It has been

nerve has occurred,        no response can be obtained from the organ bv

             On the Electric Organ      in Malapterurus electricus.           437
   Since    the constants    of this particular electrometer had been accu
rately determined, it      might have appeared feasible, after measuring the
resistance of the preparation and the resistance of the shunt, to calcu
late the E.M.F. of the Malapterurus shock directly from the photo
graphic record.       Such a method would not, however, have been satis
factory, owing to the character of the experimental conditions obtaining
in the present research, and it was deemed preferable to obtain the
comparison curves given by an E.M.F. nearly comparable with that of
the organ response, for the following reasons.              The meniscus of the
electrometer indicates the E.M.F. acting upon it at any moment,
partly by its position above or below zero, and partly by the velocity
with which it is moving at that instant, the position being measured in
divisions of an arbitrary scale, and the velocity by the subnormal to
the curve, expressed in polar co-ordinates.           But the ratio between the
value of a division on the subnormal and a division on the scale varies
with the resistance in circuit, and is consequently affected by the use
of a shunt.       Obviously, therefore, the simpler method, and the one
least open    to  objection, was to photograph the normal excursion given
by an E.M.F. not many times smaller than that of the organ response
through a circuit as nearly as possible similar to the actual one, i.e.,
through an equivalent resistance and through the identical shunt.
The organ itself could not be employed for this purpose, because even
if it gave no response to such a stimulus, the possible effects of electro
lytic polarisation might impart to the record time-relations different
from those of a normal excursion.
   We therefore carefully measured the resistance of the preparation
with the leads in the position employed in obtaining the curves referred
to previously (No. 3012 and 3013); we then substituted for it an
equivalent non-polarisable, non-inductive resistance, and photographed
the excursions given on throwing in a constant E.M.F. of 9 volts
through this circuit with a shunt of three-lamps for comparison with the

the results detailed in the annexed table.                 It will be noted that

abscissae represent          time-intervals    after the moment when the nerve was
excited.
   Comparing these results with those quoted on p. 384 of our previous
paper, it will be seen that the initial delay (0-0170 sec. and 0-0180 sec.)
is longer than that obtained in our earlier experiments (0'0110 sec.),
and also that the duration of the organ response is longer (0'0390 sec.
instead of 0-021 sec.), although the temperature was nominally the
same, viz., 5° C., in both investigations.                 It    must, however,         be noted
that in the previous research the organ   was simply laid upon a glass
stage kept at 5" C. by water flowing beneath                     it,

case the preparation was completely enclosed in  large chamber cooleda
to 5° C.*    Undoubtedly the actual temperature of the whole organ
strip was higher than 5° C. in our earlier work, and we have ample
evidence that in the case of nerve the time-relations of the electrical
response are considerably affected by slight changes of temperature at
or about 5° C. It should be further noted that the curve now obtained
is on a much larger scale than any of those referred to in our previous
research, and in consequence the small beginnings of the rise of E.M.F.
can be detected at an earlier stage. The curve     that due to the first,

the object of the experiment             was to determine the development                 of the

  It might be objected that the gradual development and still more
gradual subsidence of the E.M.F. may have some purely physical
explanation apart from the physiological change in the nerve endings,
such, for instance, as polarization capacity due to the special structure
of the tissue. That this    not the case
                                   is       clearly proved by experiments
                                                       is
in which strong induction shock traversed the organ, which failed to
         a
excite it  but was itself recorded on the plate.          We have several
examples   of induction shocks   of different intensities, of condenser dis
charges, and of excursions due to transient currents through the same
circuit. In none of these     there any resemblance to the peculiar form
                                     is
of the curve given by the organ response.      We are therefore in posi                           a
tion to say that the time relations of the organ shock do not resemble
those of either induction currents, condenser discharges, or currents of
short duration from a source of constant E.M.F.
   (3) The duration of the period between the excitation of the nerve
and   the commencement        of the organ response (0-017 sec.) represents
the transmission      time of the excitatory state along 40 mm. of nerve
fibre when cooled to 5° C., this being                the distance            between the seat of

 excitation and the organ strip. It is probable that the greater part of
  this time is occupied by the slow transmission of the excitatory state
 along the finest sub-divisions of the nerve within the organ near the
 ultimate nerve endings, all of which were at 5° C.
     (4) The most interesting point in connection with the whole experi
 ment is the maximum E.M.F. attained by the response given by the
 small portion of organ (15 mm.) investigated ; this amounted to 25-10
 volts in the most favourable instance.
     The contacts were 15 mm. apart, and we convinced ourselves that
 localised excitatory changes in the piece of tissue situated between
 these contacts were responsible for the development of the electrometer
 movements when our apparatus was arranged as indicated in the
 opening description.     This piece of tissue was subsequently removed
 and appropriately fixed for microscopic examination.         Sections were
 then cut so as to display all the discs lying between the points of the
 electrode contacts.     The recent work of Ballowitz has shown that the
 nerves do not reach the expanded discs, but end in their caudal stalks.
 The discs themselves are contained in the lozenge-shaped compartments
 constituting the columns.       These are so situated that one columnar
 row of compartments is dove-tailed into those of all its neighbours.
 The result is that the number of discs and stalks in longitudinal series
 is twice as many as the number of lozenge-shaped compartments con
stituting any given column.       Enumeration of the successive compart
ments in a number of different columns throughout the portion of
organ between the contacts (15 mm. long) gave the following figures :
 260, 265, 262, &c.     It was therefore assumed that the electromotive
difference   of 25-10 volts was probably distributed uniformly over a
series of   at least 530 discs ; the maximum E.M.F. of the change in
any one disc, with its nerve endings, would thus be not more than
0-048 volt.     It is of intesest to note that in the sciatic nerve of the
frog   we have   obtained an excitatory effect amounting to 0-033 volt.
    (5) The whole organ of the fish measured 12 to 15 cm. The extreme
ends are thinned down, but it may be certainly inferred that 12 cm. of
this organ would be at least as functionally active as the portion we
investigated.     This would give a development of 200 volts for the
whole series of organ discs, and even this high value cannot be regarded
as a maximum for the living fish, since it was evident to us that the
organ preparation we employed had its functional activity lowered
both by the low temperature and by the operations involved in its
dissection.    It is worth noting that during the first stages of the dis
section carried out on • the entire fish cooled in ice-cold water to
anaesthesia, the division of a nerve branch with metal scissors whilst
the organ was grasped by metal forceps, caused a strong shock to pass
through the arms of the operator (F. G.), which was felt up to the
elbows.

     It   must      be     to anyone who makes the experiment that
                          self-evident
the phenomena resulting from the passage of the organ shock through
the human body are such as cannot be produced by interrupted battery
currents unless the potential is high. It is a matter of common know
ledge that the shock from a healthy fish will pass through a chain of
several people holding hands, and will be felt by each, not only in the
arms, but in the muscles of the chest and shoulders.       No battery
current of                    through such a circuit will do this, however
                    30 or 40 volts
interrupted, unless the circuit has considerable self-induction, in which
case the E.M.F. of the battery does not represent the E.M.F. of the
shock, which may greatly exceed it.
   It     is,
          therefore, surprising that D'Arsonval's investigations led him
to give 17 volts, and that Schonlein gives 31 volts as the maximum
E.M.F. of        Torpedo shock.
                   a              Such low numbers indicate, we think,
that the methods used by these observers were not applicable to
the measurement of the maximum E.M.F. of the shock of an
electrical organ.* This opinion was stated definitely in our paper,
and we here repeat the statement because the photographs now pub
lished show plainly that the development of the E.M.F. of an organ
shock       is,
          at low temperatures, comparatively slow, much less rapid                                                in
fact      than     that of         a     battery current thrown in by breaking a short
circuit.          So far, therefore, as suddenness                   of change          is   concerned,      the
electrical organ             is,
                              under these conditions, at a disadvantage as com
pared with         a    battery current yet   can produce muscular contractions

such as can only be caused by interrupted currents of high potential.
We are, therefore, constrained to believe that the maximum E.M.F.,
even in Torpedo, will be found to be nearer 200 than 30 volts.    At
any rate the analysis of the foregoing curves indicates that this
maximum, namely, 200 volts,    attained by the organ shock of Malap-

   Owing to the failure of the organ to respond to further excitation,
it   was impossible to carry out the other experiments which we had
contemplated.     We therefore decided to make such measurements                                                  of

instead of a battery, the potential being kept low until a balance is
nearly obtained.   Square blocks of the organ of various dimensions
were placed en a glass slip, and broad cables of lamp-wick pasted over
with kaolin and salt solution used to connect them with the ordinary
non-polarisable     electrodes.       After each measurement                       the cables were
joined together without the interposition of the organ strip, in order
to ascertain the resistance due to the leads. It was found that the
variation in      resistance    of    the    leads        between        one experiment and
another   was relatively inconsiderable, the greater part of the electrode
resistance being evidently due to the unexposed portions of the non-
polarisable electrodes, i.e., the' tubes containing saturated zinc sulphate.
The direction of the current was reversed from time to time, but such
reversal was not found to exercise any marked influence upon the results.
   The differences in the extensibility and elasticity of the superficial
and deep boundary walls of the organ offered a difficulty, since it was
found to be almost impossible to cut the organ into blocks which
should be of the same superficial area on these two aspects. Care
was, however, taken that in every case the dimension in the direction
of the length of the columns (i.e., head end to tail end) should be, if
anything, less than that in the direction across the length of the
columns (i.e., transverse).    These two dimensions will for brevity be
termed, the first, longitudinal, the second, transverse, the words indi
cating their relationship to the organ column.
   It must be remembered that the line of flow of a current directed
longitudinally is transverse to all the flattened discs which are placed
athwart the columns — whilst that of a current directed transversely
to the column is parallel with these thin discs.     On primA facie grounds
we should expect that the resistance in the former case would be far
larger than that in the second              if,
                                        as seemed certain, the thin disc sub-
tance has an electrical resistance which       far above that offered by the

         The resistance to the flow of a current in the longitudinal direction
     (i.e., directed across the disc surfaces) is thus from two to three times
    us great as that offered by the organ to the flow of a current in the
    transverse direction (i.e., directed parallel to the disc surfaces).    The
    discs themselves thus offer, when their physiological condition is unim
    paired, a high resistance as compared with the adjoining compartmentsl
    contents, and this result is corroborated by experiments made after the
    conditions had been modified either physically or physiologically.      The
    physical modification consisted in taking blocks, the longitudinal
    dimensions of which varied.         Thus a block 10 mm. in the transverse
    dimensions and 3 mm. in thickness, was cut so as to be 90 mm. in the
    longitudinal dimension.        Its resistance to the flow of a longitudinal
    current amounted to 27,600 ohms. On reducing its length to 40 mm.
   the resistance was 13,000;        on reducing it to 20 mm. it was 5700, and
   on reduction to 10 mm.       it  was 2700 ohms.      The heavy longitudinal
   resistance is seen to increase in proportion to the length of the columns,
   and the results thus indicate that our method was a fairly accurate
   one.
        The physiological modifications were produced both by destroying
   the living condition of the fresh tissue by a suitable rise of tempera
   ture and by keeping the tissue in physiological saline for a number of
  hours, so that the living condition should be more or less replaced by
  one due to commencing natural death.
       In the case of destruction through heat, the striking discrepancy
  between the large resistance offered to longitudinal currents, and the
  lower one offered to transverse ones, always disappeared completely.
  The resistance was now found to be the same whatever the direction
 of the current flow.
       In the case of kept preparations, the disparity between the two
 resistances became so much the less marked as the preparation lost
 its living characteristics ; thus a preparation which had been kept 24
 hours in saline still showed 1500 ohms longitudinal resistance, as
 compared with 500 ohms transverse ; whilst a second strip, kept for
 48 hours, showed only 1000 ohms longitudinal, as compared with 800
ohms transverse.
      There is thus little doubt that the greater resistance offered by the
columns of the fresh organ to longitudinal flow of currents is due to
the circumstance that these are directed through the protoplasmic
substance of the thin plates or discs, which, lying directly athwart
the columns, are all so interposed in the line of flow as to give a
maximum of protoplasm to be traversed by such a flow.            On the other
hand the small resistance offered to transversely directed currents is an
expression of the fact that the flattened protoplasmic discs now form
but an insignificant portion of the conducting medium, which is chiefly
composed of the compartment spaces.             The discs must therefore have

a  relatively high resistance as compared with that of the albuminous
fluid filling the remainder of the space. It has been sometimes sug
gested that alterations of resistance may play an important part in
the phenomena of organ activity.        The experiments just given appear
to indicate that the discs have a resistance which is of a different order
to that of the physiological saline in the surrounding media ; but even in
the case of these protoplasmic structures the results scarcely warrant the
belief that there is anything exceptional in their higher resistance since
it only places them in the same category with such other excitable tissues
as muscle and nerve, which have been shown to offer a greater electri
cal resistance in the transverse than in the longitudinal direction.

    The main object of this investigation was to ascertain whether at any
 period in the development of the animal selected, the number of
 branches composing the mrvus collector was greater than that found in
 the adult.     As a logical consequence of Gegenbaur's theory we should
 expect such to be the case, and the ontogenetic history of the nervux
 rollfctor recorded in this paper, its maximum development in young
 embryos, and its subsequent gradual decrease through the later stages
 of embryonic existence leading to its condition in the adult, must, if
 there is any truth in the recapitulation theory, all point to its primitive
 character.
     The history of the posterior collector, the very existence of which
 has not hitherto been described, throws important light upon the theory
 mentioned above.        Here we have a collector formed in the embryo,
 from which in later stages the component nerves separate and run
 singly into the fin. Such a fact points very strongly to the collector
 condition being more primitive than that condition in which the nerves
 reach it without previously effecting any junction with one another.
    It is further shown that the formation of this collector is due to
 migration of the whole fin rostrally, and not merely to a contraction of
 the fin area, and in support of this the following evidence is brought
 forward. The two species, M. tern and M. mhjaru, differ from one
 another chiefly in the more rostral position of the pelvic girdle in the
 former.     That it is highly improbable such a condition should bc due

   Hence migration being rendered very probable on other grounds, the
posterior collector must be supposed to be formed as     direct result of                  a
that migration, and its undoubted connection with the shifting of the
fin along the vertebral column    of great importance in explaining the

lessened.         The minimum potential itself, however, varied very little
with the distance between the plates.

of potential in air, as has been pointed out by Professor J. J. Thom
son.* The following explanation may be offered of the fact that there
is this minimum striking potential, and that it is approximately con
stant.
   The negative glow in any gas, as has been shown by Warburg, t re
quires   for its production a definite difference of potential (about 340
volts in the case of air) independent of the pressure and constant, so
long as the glow is not crushed into a smaller space than that which
it would naturally occupy. If the glow is crushed, the necessary poten
tial is greater.
    Let us now suppose that the discharge takes place between two
parallel plates.       A part of the space between these plates is occupied
by the negative glow, a part by the positive column.                 So long as any
of the positive column remains, it is clear that the negative glow is not
constricted, and consequently it only requires 340 volts to produce it.
The greater the length of the positive column, the greater the corre
sponding potential difference, so that the striking potential will be the
least possible when the pressure is low enough to make the negative
glow occupy the whole space between the plates, but not low enough
to make     it require more.
    My experiments         have  been undertaken        with a view to obtaining
further experimental evidence on these ideas. The sparks were taken
between large metal plates, £ mm. apart.               For details of the apparatus
and    method      of experimenting, the original paper must be consulted.
There also will be found curves showing the relation between spark
potential and pressure for the following gases : atmospheric air, hydro
gen, nitrogen, helium.

   It  was found impracticable       to get accurately consistent results in
the   case  of helium.     Some cause, the nature of which has not been
traced, made the results differ with different samples of the gas, although
in each case care had been taken with the purification. The helium
curve, however, shows very peculiar features, the spark potential being,
for a wide range of pressure in the neighbourhood of the minimum,
almost independent      of the pressure.

        1899.
     In 1895, during the course of an investigation of the spectra of
gases    distilled from the mineral Eliasite, a double line at XX4128-3 and
 4131*4 was found in one of the photographs,                which could not at the
 time be traced to any terrestrial substance.               It was thought that it
might belong        to some     new  gas, especially  as  there   was a well-marked
 double in the corresponding region of a Cygni.
     Some time later, shortly after the discovery by Professor Pickering
of a new series of probable hydrogen lines in the spectrum of f Puppis,
an attempt was made to produce this series of lines in the laboratory,
and the spectrum of hydrogen was examined under different electrical
conditions. During this research it was found that with the use of the
spark in vacuum tubes of very narrow bore, with large jars in circuit,
the same double line noted in the eliasite photograph made its appeal -
mice, and as in these experiments the glass on the inside of the capil
lary of the vacuum tube had become partially fused, silicium suggested
itself as being the origin of this so-called " unknown double.
                                                                     "          That
this was correct was proved directly afterwards by photographing the
spectrum of a spark over Si02 in a retort, the double in question being
the most prominent feature of the spectrum.*
     In addition to this double, a wider one at XX 3856'1 ami 3862'7 was
noticed, and as the two components also agreed very closely in position
with lines in the spectrum of a Cygni, it was concluded that silicium
•was   the true origin of the lines.t
    * A list of the
                      s])ark lines of silicium was published by Eder and Valenta in
 1893, and the identity of the strange double would probably have been established
before by a reference to that list, had it not been for a large error in the wave
length of one of the components of the double as recorded by them.
    t The probable explanation of the appearance of the silicium double in one of
the photographs of the spectrum of the eliasite gases is that one of the platinum

  Very few records of work on the silicium spectnim have been pub
lished by later spectroscopists, but Eder and Valenta* give lines agree
ing in wave-length with those mentioned, as shown in the accompanying
table.

   Later experiments on the spark spectrum of silicium with the aid of
the large Spottiswoode coil, and on the spectra of silicium compounds
in vacuum tubes, reveal other lines of that element no less interesting
from a stellar point of view than those previously mentioned.
   We learn from these recent observations that the lines of silicium
may be divided into three sets, no two of which behave alike under
varying electrical conditions. The wave-lengths of the lines composing
the different sets are : —

   There is a line at             which is associated in the spark spectrum
                               A 3905-8
of silicium with the lines in set     A, but while these are entirely absent
from the arc spectrum of silicium, 3905-8 is a strong line in the arc
spectrum.      This line differs from the others, therefore, in not being
enhanced in intensity in passing from the conditions of the arc to those
of the spark.     So far as is known, the lines in sets B and C have not
been recorded by any other observers of the silicium spectrum.
   The behaviour of the three sets of lines in terrestrial spectra is
shown in the following figure.
   It is found, on investigating the occurrence of these silicium lines in
stellar spectra, that the three sets of lines respectively attain a maximum
intensity at the three different levels of stellar temperature represented
by      -y, and
      /3,        Orionis.

poles of the "steeple" used in that particular case had broken off close to the
gltus, and the latter was fused by the heat from the spark. This the more likelyia
as the double line only appeared on one edge of the spectrum.

of the solar line than with the middle.
    Before this point can be definitely settled, still larger dispersion will
have to be employed.
    In the paper mentioned, it was shown that silicium made its appear

of f Tauri and y Orionis, until at the f Orionis stage it is bordering on
extinction.

and at the same time it was quoted as an " unknown

    It is interesting to note that this line is now traced to silicium, and
is the strongest line in set B.             It is apparently a short-lived line in
stellar spectra, as it only occurs between the stages of temperature
represented by y Orionis and f Orionis, being one of the weakest lines
in the spectrum of the former star, and one of the strongest in that of
the latter.
    Most of the photographs of the silieium spectrum under varying
conditions were taken by Mr. Butler.               The wave-lengths of the lines-
have been reduced by Mr. Baxandall, and he is also responsible for
establishing the identity of the terrestrial and the stellar lines.            My
 thanks are due to him also for help in the preparation of the present
communication.

                                      Introduction.
    In the year    1881    I  communicated       a paper* to the Eoyal Society in
which I described some experiments relating to the brightening of some
lines in the spectrum of iron on passing from the arc to the spark.
    It was found that in the case of iron, the two lines in the visible
spectrum at X 4924-1 and A5018'6, on Eowland's scale, were greatly
enhanced in brightness, and were very important in solar phenomena.
    The work was subsequently carried into the photographic region of
the spectrum with very interesting results, since it was found that
several other lines were enhanced at the highest temperature I could
then obtain.
    In a later papert I described the results obtained in further photo-

in the study of stellar spectra cannot be over-estimated, but a great
advance can only be made in this direction by a systematic examina
tion of the spectra of all the elements.      Such an undertaking as this
involves considerable time and labour.     I have been fortunate enough
to have the use of the large 42-inch Spottiswoode coil for a short space
of time, and employed it in this work, for which it is specially adapted,
as the brilliancy of its spark shortens the time of exposure.   Although
I have previously stated my indebtedness              to     Mr. Hugh Spottiswoode
and Mr. G. Matthey for their assistance,         I wish again to express my
best thanks to them, and       I   must    now add Professor Moissan and Sir
William Crookes, who have kindly supplied me with some specimens
of metals.
   The elements which have been dealt with in this investigation are
the following : — " Aluminium, bismuth, chromium, copper, iron, mag
nesium, manganese, titanium, and vanadium."
    For each of these elements the spark and arc spectra were photo
graphed and compared, and the wave-lengths of the enhanced lines,
that  is,
        those lines which are intensified in passing from the temperature
of the electric arc to that of the spark, were determined.
                              Method      of   Reduction.
    The method    of reduction was as follows           :   — The spark spectrum of
the element was first compared directly with the spark spectrum of air
between platinum poles, and the air lines were thus eliminated.   The
spark and arc spectra of the element being taken on different plates,
were then compared, and the lines present in the spark spectrum but
absent from the arc, or lines relatively more intense in the spark than
in the arc spectrum, were noted. The wave-lengths of these lines were
then determined by direct comparison with         solar spectrum taken
                                                            a
under the same instrumental conditions, and reference to Rowland's
list of lines in the normal solar spectrum.

          Preliminary Table of Wave-lengths of Enhanced Lines.          455
manner described by Rowland, the camera and grating being at oppo
site ends of an iron girder adjusted exactly to the radius of curvature
of the grating.    It has been found that by carefully making the adjust
ment the scale can be maintained constant within a very small limit,
and the conditions were such that it was possible to use plates 18 inches
long without bending.
     In some cases a Stcinheil prism spectroscope was used. The disper
sion arrangement of this instrument consists of four dense flint prisms,
three of 45° angle and one of 60'.         These are fed by a collimator of
 1
   £ inches aperture and 18J inches focal length.     The camera objective
is a single quartz lens of 2 inches aperture and about 54 inches focal
length (for A 4340), the non-achromatism      of which necessitates a con
siderable inclination of the photographic plate to the axis of the lens.
The total deviation for the blue region of the spectrum is about 150°.
The scale of the spectrum is as follows : —
                             D— F   =
                                       21 inches.
     The spark conditions were as follows : — The Spottiswoode coil is
capable of giving a spark 42 inches long in air.          For spectroscopic
purposes, however, a condenser is inserted in parallel with the second
ary circuit, the length of spark then obtainable depending on the
capacity of the particular condenser used.        These have varied from a
 single gallon jar to a battery of twelve jars of about 15 gallons each,
 and finally a plate condenser has been used, at the suggestion of Pro
 fessor Boys.
     This consists of thirty sheets of plate glass, 30 inches by 25 inches,
 with tinfoil, 24 inches by 12 inches, between each pair. The spark
under these conditions varies from about 25 to 2 mm. in length, and
this was again further controlled in intensity and duration by a
secondary spark gap in series with the one containing the metallic
 poles.
     The primary was fed from the street circuit at 100 volts, the usual
 current employed being about 25 amperes.          Interruption of the cur
 rent in the primary was by means of a mercury break actuated by
 hand.
     In the case of the arc, the exposures lasted generally for about
 fifteen minutes, while an hour and a quarter was the average time
 given for the spark.
     My thanks are due to Mr. C. P. Butler, who was employed in taking
 the photographs, to Mr. F. E. Baxandall, who is responsible for their
 discussion, and to Dr. Lockyer for assistance in the preparation of this
 note.    The enlargement of portions of the arc and spark spectra of
  titanium was made by Sapper J. P. Wilkie, R.E.

"The Colour-Physiology of HippoJytc iwiaus."          By Y. W. Keebi.k,
            Cains College, Cambridge, and F. W. Gamble, Owens College,

            F.R.S. Received October 25,— Read November 23, 1899.
         The following paper gives in
                                   a categorical  fashion the chief results
    of          on
         a researchthe changes  of  colour in the  prawn HifipuUfle varumx.
    The work was carried out hist year partly in the Zoological Labora
    tories of Owens College, Manchester, partly at the station furnished
    by the Lancashire Sea Fisheries Committee at Barrow ; and during the
    past summer in M. I'errier's Laboratory at St. Yaast, Normandy.         A
    fuller description of the experiments, together with figures, will appear
    /shortly.  The present abstract contains the following sections : —

                               I. Previous Knowledge.
    The facts previously known may be arranged in three groups.
The great variety of colour displayed by different specimens of Hippi-
lyle mrians ; the
                       " mimetic resemblances " between these colour-forms
and the Algae upon which they live; and the power which these
 colour-forms     possess of undergoing a change of tint under different
 conditions of illumination.       It is known that the so-called " chromato
          "
 phores     contain differently coloured pigments by which both the pre
 valent tint of the prawn and its colour-changes are determined.           The
arrangement of these colour-elements in the body and the pigmentary
conditions of the various colour-varieties have not been hitherto care
fully examined.        The factors which determine a change of colour, the
extent of these changes, and the mode in which they are effected, may
be said to be hitherto quite unknown.
                II.   Method of Obtaining Reliable. Colour-records.
    («) Records of colour must be made under constant conditions of
illumination, otherwise they are not strictly comparable, and fine
shades of colour escape notice.        They must be made rapidly, otherwise
the light used for recording induces a colour-change and becomes, in
stead of a guide, a source of error.        Finally, the light must be such as
to enable a speedy record to be made, and yet one which itself induces
a minimum change.
    Many devices have been tried, but no completely satisfactory method
has been obtained.        We use, as most convenient, bright diffuse sunlight
reflected from a white ground ; and for a comparison of day and night
colours, incandescent light.       There are, however, several objections to
these modes of illumination, the chief among them being that under
certain circumstances,       white light produces a very rapid change of
colour.

      (b) During microscopic examination, grave colour-changes often
'
   occur ; yet with practice, a very rapid examination may be made, and
  so the source of error considerably reduced.              The colours to be re
  corded are often several, the gross colour of the animal being seen
   under the microscope to be due to several pigments (see below Sect. III).
  These pigments are differently distributed in different colour-forms, so
   that the pigmentary records become rather complicated.               Any but the
   briefest microscopical examination throws the nervous system of the
   animal out of gear, produces after-effects, and too frequently renders
   the animal useless for further experiment.              Control-specimens    must
   be used before conclusions can be drawn from the simplest experiments,
  and experiments must be confirmed several times.                  Added to these
  difficulties is this, that colour-change in Hippolyte is no simple reflex
  affair taking place " with the certainty of a physical experiment," but
  is one subject to what, in times of difficulty, seems to amount to wilful
   perversity. What we believe to be the chief element in this seeming
   perversity is described under the head of Periodicity in Section VI.
                      III.  The Nature of the  " (Jhromdophare$."
                                          in the " chromatophores
                                                                        "
      The colours of the pigments                                          determine
  the tint of the prawn by their disposition and the depth of its colour
  by their abundance.          The "chromatophores" are by no means the
  simple,   stellate,   cellular, dermal structures which they are commonly
  supposed to be.         One series of them lies under the epidermis, another
  is interspersed between the muscle-fibres both of the great flexors and
   extensors of the tail and those of the appendages, while a third series
  — often forming great splashes of colour— invests the gut, nerve-cord,
  liver, and other internal organs.
      In simple colour varieties — brown for instance — the pigment of the
  skin forms a dense network obscuring the " muscle-chromatophores."
  In such cases the colour of the prawn is determined by the colour of
  the superficial network.         In other cases, when the prawns are banded
  or boldly barred,      the colour-elements  of the skin are absent or have no
                                "                   "
                                                       alone determine the colour
  pigment, and the deep           chromatophores
  of the pattern.        In many Hippolytc we have found that distribution
  of the pigment is the same in the skin-chromatophores                   and in the
  muscle-fibres which underlie them.           The two sets are co-ordinated.
  This correspondence applies          to other Crustacea, though it has not
  hitherto been recognised.
     The pigments present in the chromatophores are limited to red,
  red and yellow, or red, yellow, and blue.           These three may be present
  together in one and the same element.               During colour-changes they
  are distributed independently of one another in the sense that one
  pigment may become aggregated in the centre of the " chromatophore,"

whilst another runs out into its network of processes. Change of
 colour appears to be due to a fresh pigmentary deal of the shuffled
 colour-pack.
    Whether chemical changes play a part in converting one pigment
to another or no, we are not yet in a position to say. All the evi
dence we have is against the view that the colour-elements of Hippo-
 lytr are cells like the chromatophores of the frog. The
                                                                     " muscle-chro-

matophores        bear tubular processes limited by a distinct membrane.
The processes of the skin-chromatophores                 penetrate between the
epidermal cells and form networks. The movement of the pigment

                     IV.   TIui Habits of Hippolyte varians.
    Hippolyte  lives    in swarms amongst the weeds of the seashore. In
some places     it is most abundant upon the Hulidrys and other alga?
which flourish luxuriantly in the "laminarian" zone, and are only
exposed by very low spring-tides.             In other places the Zosferrt-beds
and the masses of Fucus form its chief resorts.             Each colour-variety is
a marvel of protective coloration.          Each is to be found among weeds
of a closely similar hue and adheres to its chosen habitat with the
greatest tenacity.        Though it has the power of making powerful leaps
and of swimming, only under the greatest provocation                 can Hippdyfr
be induced to take this exercise.        At night as well as during the day
these prawns are still to be found on their food-plants ; and, should the
receding tide lay the weeds bare, the Hippolyte may still be found by
shaking them into a net. Should the special food-plants of any given
colour-varieties     be   mixed with other weeds, the prawns will after a
time select, each after his kind, the weeds in which it naturally feeds
and with which it agrees in colour.             Generally speaking, Hippolyt'
prefers   shade    to  direct   sunlight or  to  artificial light. The emerald
green variety found on Zostera, whether at a comparatively high zone
                                          "
on the shore or in the " laminarian          zone, is exposed to a considerable

amount of light on account of the " blades                    of this grass being
separated from each other and not growing in the shade of deep rock
pools.    The brown and red varieties of Hippolylf are, on the other
hand, associated with dense masses of weed attached to rocks ; so that
the light-intensity in which they live, even at half-tide, is probably
lower than that of the beds of Zostrni.          The bearing of these facts on
the changes of colour are referred to in Section VIII.
    Hippolyte exhibits a certain sexual dimorphism both with regard to
size and to colour.         This may be expressed by saying that the males
are on the average much smaller          and less elaborately      patterned than

             TJic Colour-Physiology         of Hippolyte varians.                  465

their surroundings. From the point of view of " protection      this is
what might be expected owing to the greater sluggishness of the
female, which in turn is partly due to the large mass of eggs or
developing zoese, which she almost invariably carries.
                   V. The Nocturnfil Colour.          " Nwtu-rnes"
   Whatever the diurnal colour of flippolyte may be, it changes at or
soon after night-fall  to a wonderfully beautiful transparent blue or
greenish-blue colour.    Prawns in this condition we designate as
Nocturnes. The depth of the nocturnal tint is directly proportioned to
that of the diurnal colour ; dark brown prawns becoming deep blue
and light ones pale blue.      Under natural conditions the nocturnal
colour persists until daybreak.    At the first touch of dawn the colour
vanishes and that of the preceding day re-appears.     Specimens trawled
at night and in the early morning before daylight show that the
nocturnal colour is perfectly normal and is assumed by Hippoh/ff
vnrians while still on its food plant.     Other Crustacea too, show a
peculiar nocturnal colour.   Mysis, for example, of different species and
possibly even of distinct genera, show a transparent and blue colour-
phase at night, giving place during              the day to a deeply pigmented
condition.
   Nocturnes are remarkable chiefly but not solely for their peculiar
pigmentary condition. The red and yellow pigments are maximally
contracted, while the blue is present in a very diffuse homogeneous
condition forming a network which traverses the connective tissue of
all the chief organs, particularly the muscles.    The peculiar trans
parency which accompanies this nocturnal condition                   is,
                                                           however, not
entirely explicable by the retraction  of  the red and  yellow-coloured
pigment. It   is only one of    number of profound changes affecting
                                  a
the body as  a  whole.   Indeed we are prepared to say that the noc
turnal state opens np     anew chapter in biological investigation, and
that by a  study of this condition increased knowledge of the succes
sion of metabolic processes may be gained.
                       VI.   Periodicity   of   Colour-change.
   Under normal conditions Hiypolyte mrianx passes through           daily     a
colour-cycle.   Its diurnal colour gives place to a slight increase of
reddishness — a sunset-glow-»-just   before night-fall, and this ushers in
the nocturnal phase.    These changes are periodic in the strict sense
of the word. Though often modified by external agents they exhibit
a  certain independence of them.      In constant darkness a Nocturne
recovers its diurnal colour.     In constant light (of certain kinds at
                                                                       2   M   2

4C6               Messrs. F.   W. Keeble and F. W. Gamble.
least) a diurnal form passes over to the nightly phase.                 Though light
often induces and induces with marvellous rapidity a recovery from
the nocturnal phase, it is often powerless to overcome the habit cf the
animal.      The periodicity is only slowly worn down in the course of
two or three        days.   These changes express a nervous rhythm ; per
haps a profound and rhythmic course of metabolic events.                            The
reddish phase antecedent to the full nocturnal tint probably explains
the statement made by M. Malard,* that in darkness Hip|wlyte vmaiu
becomes red.                               *
   Periodicity     is manifested    in the colour-change of Hippoli/te which
have been deprived of both their eyes.                 The assumption of, and
recovery from, the nocturnal phase is still effected, but more slowly
and erratically than in normal specimens.
                           VII.  Jtange of Colour-change.
   Adult animals        when    placed    with   weed    of a new         colour (the
light-intensity being as far as possible unaltered) are, under the
conditions of the laboratory, only capable of very slow sympathetic
colour-changes.        Thus green Hippolyte placed on brown weed con
serve their greenness for a week or more, but in the end give way and
become brown.         Their subsequent recovery when placed with green
weed is more rapid. We have repeated such experiments in the open
time after time, and have found that the prawns were either quite
refractory or responded in this slow manner.                 Yet these same speci
mens undergo the changes preceding and culminating in the nocturnal
colour and the succeeding recovery to their diurnal tint, with the
utmost readiness.         The fact that prawns, refractory to sympathetic
colour-change       can and   do undergo a rapid change of tint when the
light-intensity or the quality of the light is altered, is shown by such
records as the following-       A specimen, one of a large catch, incidentally
observed      to  be the blackest      we have    ever   seen,    became in a few
minutes     transparent when put in a white porcelain dish. Further, a
ready and       almost infallible means of producing transparent green
Hippolyte and even a colour hard to distinguish from the nocturnal
tint, consists in placing freshly caught prawns in a white porcelain dish,
and covering the top with a piece of muslin.                 Under these circum
stances the change often takes place very rapidly (thirty seconds
to one minute).
   It  is'therefore necessary to distinguish at least three kinds of colour-
change in Hippolyte various.         First, the passage from the diurnal to the
nocturnal colour-phase followed by recovery to the colour of the pre
vious day.        In this case the phases form a rhythmic daily cycle.
Second, the colour-changes produced by artificially altering the light-

intensity to which the prawns are exposed, or by subjecting them to
light reflected from white, and especially porcelain surfaces.       Third,
the sympathetic colour-change brought about by change in the colour
of the surroundings.
    The first of these is habitual or periodic, and may be quickly pro
duced, towards evening, by a profound alteration of the light-intensity.
 Even the natural recovery from the nocturnal to the diurnal colour
 takes place rapidly with the dawn.      The second change, as inexplicable
in teleological terms as the first, is also rapid, often very rapid.
    The third change is extremely slow.         The prawn, in the acquire
 ment of its adult colour, is guided and guided solely, so far as
external circumstances are concerned, by light-intensity.   In response
to the conditions of light-intensity which prevail in its habitat, the
prawn metabolises and distributes its pigments.     But its pigmentary
forces do not admit of ready mobilisation for purposes of defence ; or
at least they do not quickly obey a command to move.           Hippoh/tf
by   its immobility  has gradually grown    into its surroundings and
though, as for example, at night, its pigments may be readily aggre
gated, and a special nocturnal colour produced, yet this mobilising
power is not utilised Jit all, or but very slowly, to redistribute the
pigments, when the colour of the habitat is changed.
                  VIII.    Tin' Causes of   Ghuinge   of Colour.
   (a) Hifpoh/tc grows into harmony with its surroundings.            So
developed  it hangs on to  wave-swept  weeds.   Should  it be dislodged
its hope of concealment lies rather in a rapid choice of a weed of its
own colour, than in a slow sympathetic colour-change on its own part,
for if we may trust our experimental results, a week would elapse
before the change could be complete.    Monochromatic light (obtained by
the use of Landolt's colour-filters), is singularly inefficacious in pro
ducing any sympathetic colour-change.      Red, yellow, green, and blue
light act in this respect like darkness.  Under natural conditions we
conclude, therefore, that the ultimate colour-change is effected by a
reaction to light-intensity.
   (/>) After much trouble and many experiments,    we find that there is
no evidence that rays of light, by virtue of their specific wave-lengths,
play any part in changing the colour of the prawns.         On the other
hand we find that in the diurnal phase, a low light-intensity favours
expansion of the red pigment and so brown effects, while increased
light-intensity produces a green tint. The appreciation of light-inten
sity appears to be very acute and to be the chief agent in producing
colour-change.
    (r)By ablation    of   the eyes,           stimuli, and heat, colour-
                                       electrical
 changes may be induced.       These agents have been employed in tracing

  the nervous    mechanism of the change, but the histological       examina
  tion of these experiments is not yet complete.
                IX.  The Hole of   the Eye and Nervous System.
     Removal   of one eye produces no effect on the body-colour.     Kemoval
  of both, either produces no effect or a rapid nocturning.       The animal
 is plunged in night.     Under such circumstances the periodic habit may
 re-assert itself and a recovery with subsequent fairly punctual nocturn
 ing take place. The chromatophores of detached limbs, and in the
 bodies of blinded specimens, exhibit alterations of their pigments —
 when subjected to different light-stimuli, quite similar to those which
 occur in the intact animal     under  the same conditions.     Therefore (1|
 an intrinsic rhythmic nervous change supervises the periodic change in
 the pigments ; (2) the eye is the most important auxiliary in modifying
 nervous control ; (3) local government plays a part.          In variegated
 colour-forms, which show, as in a mirror, the pattern of their weed, it
 can scarcely be doubted that both central and local government
 co-operate, and so produce a result of such consummate delicacy.
 Here there is expansion of one pigment, here of another, there com
 plete contraction.     The light acting through the eye on the central
 nervous system cannot be supposed to differentiate itself into such
 diverse stimuli as are required to produce the colour- variety.        Local
 control under a strong central organisation seems to l>e the only likely
force and the evidence favours this view.

                                             of larcul forms.
    We have succeeded in hatching 'out the zoeae of Hippolyte mriun» and
in following their development for a short time. Several of the colour-
elements acquire their pigment before the time of hatching.         There are
two pigments, one red and the other yellow by reflected and dull green
by transmitted light. A few chromatophores contain red only.          All the
colour-elements are distributed symmetrically.            They occur in the
neighbourhood of the eyes, the liver, and at the sides of the abdominal
segments.
    In the zoea the pigments react with astonishing rapidity to certain
changes of light-intensity.       A bright light brings about very rapid
contraction, while a dark background effects expansion of the yellow-
green and more slowly a similar change in the red.            A diffuse blue
substance was noticed frequently as though exuding from the dense red
body of some

should this be so, we may find in a study of the larval stage the
meaning of the blue colour of Nocturnes.

            Received        July   31,— Read November 16, 1899.
     The standards             of  light may        be   divided into two main divisions,
viz. :—
                                   1.    Flame standards.
                                   2. Incandescent        standards.
     The first class comprises such standards as depend for their constancy
on the rate at which chemical combination is going on.                                   Almost all
the standards in actual use come under this division.                                  The British
candle, the Methven standard,* the Harcourtt                                 pentane standard,
the Hefner-AlteneckJ                  amyl acetate lamp, the Carcel lamp, and the
acetyleneg burner are among the best known.
     Apart from the large number of independent investigators who
have carried out researches as to the relative merits of these sources
of light, reference may be made to the reports of several committees
which have been appointed in this and other countries to investigate the
subject.|!
     The general conclusions reached may be fairly summed up by saying
that the pentane gas standard and the amyl acetate lamp are the
lights which, from every point of view, have been found most satis
factory. Of the two, the Hefner-Alteneck lamp is the better known,
and has been the subject of the more complete experimental study ; it
may be taken as fairly representative of its class.                          The light emitted,
as    in the      case of     all the other flame standards, is seriously affected by
atmospheric             impurities. LiebenthalU has shown that, if x represent the

470                        Mr.   -T.   E. Petavel.            An    Experimental
quantity of water vapour in litres per cubic metre of air, the light                         L
sent out will vary according to the formula —
                                         L      =       1-049 -0-0055.-.
     This will        variation of about 4 per cent, from one season of
                     cause a
the year to another.    The variations due to this cause are stated to be
still more marked in the Harcourt and Carcel lamps.
   Again, if .rt represent the quantity of carbon dioxide present in the
atmosphere, measured in litres per cubic metre, the light will be given
by the formula—
                                        L    =      1-01 2   -0-0072*1.
     Variations in the height of the flame are of the greatest importance.
If   // is the height —
                                       L     =      1+0-025 (h      -40),
or                                     L     =      1   - 0-030   (40
                                                                        - //),
according          as h is above  or below 40 mm.* The mean variation                        is,
therefore, over         2i per cent, per mm.  Owing to the bright halo which
surrounds           the flame,        by no means easy to adjust the height
                                       it   is
correctly.
   Finally, although      was at first stated that the degree of purity of
                                 it
the amyl acetate had no very considerable influence on the light, this
has of late been denied, some authorities going so far as to state that
sufficiently pure amyl acetate cannot be obtained in France.t
   These facts will suffice to show that the variations are mainly due to
causes inherent in this class of standard.    Some of the difficulties can
be obviated by providing       chemically pure atmosphere, and researches
                                            a
are being carried out in America in this direction, but            obvious         it   is
that any such improvement will involve        considerable complication
                                                                   a                         of

     In the        case    of standards   of this class, the constancy of the light
depends essentially              on the constancy of the temperature at which the
radiating body   kept, and on the constancy of the emissivity of the
                           is
body at that temperature.
  The temperature may be fixed by some definite physical phenomena
as in the Blondel and Violle standards, or  may be determined in          it                 a
more or less arbitrary manner, as in the Lummer and Kurlbaum
standard.

                          Research on some Standards                         of Light.                471
   Any solid substance that would not disintegrate at                                    a temperature   of
about       1700° C. might, a priori, be chosen as a radiator. It has, how
ever, been      shown that most of the oxides when maintained at these
high temperatures                    undergo a change in their emissive properties, and
cannot,         therefore,       be used     for the purpose we have in view.* The
choice thus seems restricted in practice either to carbon or to one of the
metals of  the platinum group.
  Before passing on to the experimental part of the work, it may be
well to recapitulate the necessary qualifications of a standard of light.
The requirements may be briefly summed up under three heads : —
  1. The standard must remain constant.
  The slow periodic variations of the amyl acetate lamp which extend
over a period of several months are as much to l>e avoided as the
flickerings of the candle or the hourly changes of the Carcel lamp.
    2. The standard should be reproducible.
    This condition is satisfied when the standards reconstituted by inde
pendent investigators show no measurable variation between one another.
    3. The light emitted should be as nearly as possible of the same
spectral composition as that of the chief artificial lights now in common
use.t
                    On   the    Intrinsic Brilliancy of             the   Crater of thr Are.
  For many years it had been noticed that the area of the crater of
an electric arc when burning between carbon poles increased about in
proportion to the current ; also that the light emitted increased in the
same ratio as the area of the crater. {   These and other facts led to the
conclusion that the temperature of the crater remained constant.      The
hypothesis was  put forward  that  this temperature was the boiling point
of carbon, this theory being supported by the experiments made in
1892 by J. Violle.§   In the same year it was proposed simultaneously
by Swinburne, S. P. Thompson, and Blondel,|j that the crater of the
arc should be used as a standard of light, Blondel publishing a series
of experiments illustrating the way iti which the new standard might
be used.
   In 1894 A. Trotter^i proved that when the arc is not silent the crater

472                         Mr.   J.   E. Petavel.           An   Ex
is formed         by    a point or line of very high intrinsic brilliancy rotating
at   a speed of        from 50 to 450 revolutions per second.
   The existence of the above mentioned phenomenon forms a serious
objection to the use of the electric arc as a primary standard, but it
does not, per se, render its use impossible.*   Finally, the variation of the
intrinsic brilliancy of the crater is a question which in itself offers con
siderable interest.
     The points on which the present work bears are threefold —
     1.   What is the average intrinsic                       brilliancy   of   a    normal   (silent)
           arc    1
     2.   When the conditions are carefully specified, are the variations still
           too great to allow of the use of this source of light as a
           standard         1
     3.   What variations can be obtained by the use of excessive currents
           and current densities, and by surrounding the arc with an en
           closure maintained at a very high temperature 1
  To obtain consistent results the observations must be made on a very
small area selected from the central portion of the crater.
  The diaphragm used for this purpose is shown in fig. 3. The
opening,         1'47 sq. mm. in cross-section,
                 '/,   is                             The diaphragm        t                          is
shaped much like the tuyere of       blast furnace, and being kept cool

                                   it
the crater of the arc.
   The next question involved was the determination of the best relative
position of the carbons. In the usual arrangement of the arc the centre
of the crater    hidden by the negative carbon.
                       is                         A modification of this
arrangement, used by Blondel, which consists in slanting the carbons
and placing the positive slightly behind the negative, was found not
to be entirely satisfactory.  An attempt was made to take the observa
tions through a hole drilled out of the negative carbon (see fig. 1), but
when the arc was started this hole became filled with mist, and the
plan had to be given up.

 Unfortunately this disposition had to be abandoned, as it soon became
 evident that    it was impossible for one observer to adjust the currents
 in the three independent electrical circuits, to feed up the four carbons,
 and to make all the electrical and photometric                 readings.

   The disposition which was tinally adopted is shown in fig. 3. The
diaphragm d screws into a screen s.                  This screen is supported on a
system of pivots and levelling screws, so that it can be raised, lowered,
or turned round a vertical or horizontal axis.                       The opening d can
thus be directed to any portion of the crater.                    The positive carbon is
horizontal, and so placed that its axis coincides with the axis of the
photometer.
   Two distinct series of experiments were carried out : one with the
arc placed in a metallic enclosure kept at about 20° C. by a water
circulation, the other in the enclosure shown in fig. 3. The tempera
ture of this enclosure varied from the melting point of silver to near
the melting point of platinum, according to the amount of power
expended in the arc.          Referring to fig. 3, <: is a carbon crucible sur

       Apostle
 the positive carbon varied from 6 to 25 mm. in diameter.
    To obtain reliable results a sufficient current density must be used to
give a fairly large crater.           The arc must also be sufficiently stable for
the crater to remain some considerable                time without shifting its posi
 tion.    Finally, it is desirable        that the arc should be burning in a
 normal manner, and therefore neither hissing nor roaring.
    Given these conditions, it is impossible to vary either the current,
 the electromotive       force, or the length of arc, within very wide limits.
    In  the experiments recorded in Table I, the mean intrinsic brilliancy
 is 147 candle power per square               millimetre;     the variations from the
 mean amounted to 10 per cent.
    Table   II gives    experiments made under similar conditions, but with
 the enclosure in which the arc was burning at a temperature of over
 900° C.     The average intrinsic brilliancy calculated from this table is
  143, or about     3   per cent. lower than when the enclosure was at the
 ordinary temperature.            It would, however, be unwise to attach too
 much importance to this change.               The difficulty of obtaining consistent

experimental        error.
    The conclusions we have reached may be summed up as follows : —
    1. The intrinsic brilliancy of the crater of a silent arc is about 147
candle power per square millimetre.
   2. Even when the most favourable conditions are selected, and the
intensity of current and the length of the arc are maintained constant,
it is difficult to obtain consistent results, variations of over 5 per cent,
being by no means unfrequent.                 The crater of the arc does not, there
fore, possess the qualities required of a standard.

       3.  Variations in the size of the carbons, in the intensity and density
  of the current, in the length of the arc, and in the total power ex
  pended (as long as the arc is kept silent), will not cause the intrinsic
 brilliancy to vary more than 10 per cent, on either side of the mean.
      4. No sensible variation in the intrinsic brilliancy, and therefore in
 the temperature of the crater, is produced by placing the carbons in an
 enclosure maintained at over 900° C.
      With regard to the constancy of the temperature of the crater, these
 results are not without importance.
      Having this question in view,             it was necessary to determine              what
 were the effects of extreme variations of current density and power.

 when the arc was hissing.*

observations.
     It will   be   seen    that the current varied from 6 to 50 amperes, the
current density from 0-03 to 0-51 ampere per square millimetre, and
the power from 370 to 2800 watts.
    The lowest photometric readings gave 119, and the highest 160
candle power per square millimetre.
   * The word " hissing " is used here       as being the generally accepted term.          It is
only when the current density is small that it is actually descriptive of the sound
made ; as the current increases, the pitch rises, until with a very short arc and a
current density of about 1 ampere per square millimetre, the sound is between »
whistle and a scream.        The are then assumes a very peculiar aspect, a pointed blur
flame, like the flame of a blow-pipe, being sent out from the crater.          This effect was
most marked when the high temperature enclosure was used. With the above
current density the entire carbon becomes white hot and burns away with great
rapidity ; an increase in the intrinsic brilliancy seems also to take place.          Unfortu
nately, it was not found possible under these circumstances to obtain reliable photo
metric observations.

(t = temperature            in degrees centigrade, b = intrinsic brilliancy in
candle power per square centimetre), holds good for carbon at these
high temperatures, the above change in candle power corresponds to a
variation of temperature of from 3866° to 4018° C. The total altera
tion in absolute temperature thus works out at 4 per cent. Observa
tions made on silent arcs (Tables I and II), reduced in the same
manner, give the extreme limits of temperature as 3935° and 4018° C.,
or a change of 2 per cent, in the absolute temperature.
       These variations are somewhat greater than we should meet with in
the case of substances boiling at ordinary temperatures.                                 It must,
however, be borne in mind, that even in the case of a silent arc, the
 crater is the seat of several secondary phenomena, which under certain
 circumstances may affect the boiling point.t                        The term boiling point
 is in itself misleading, as it seems possible, if not probable, that at
 atmospheric pressure carbon does not become liquid, but like carbon
 dioxide, passes direct from the solid to the gaseous state. It has fre
 quently been stated that impurities cannot affect the temperature of
 the crater, as all known bodies become gaseous at a lower temperature.

 lime, alumina, magnesia, and other substances are solid at the tem-

perature   of melting platinum, and           it is difficult to predict at what tem
perature they volatilise.
  Taking everything into consideration,    it may therefore be said that
the present experiments confirm the theory that the crater of the arc
is at the temperature of volatilisation of carbon.
   The earliest determinations of the intrinsic brilliancy of the crater
were made in 1878 at       Chatham under the direction of the Royal
Engineers' Committee.* The results varied from 39 to 442 candle
power per square millimetre, the mean value being 110.       With regard
to more recent researches, Trotter gives the intrinsic brilliancy as 64,
Weber as 70, and Blondel as 158 candle power per square millimetre.
With the exception of those of Blondel all previous results are very
much lower than the values I have obtained.        The discrepancy may
be attributed to the fact that instead  of using a  diaphragm to select
the rays from the centre of the crater, the first named observers
estimated the total area of the crater, and compared it with the total
amount of light.
       On the iMinruer and KurUxmni Incandescent          Platinum Standard.
   In 1894 Drs. O. Lummer and F. Kurlbaum proposed a new standard
of light.t A strip of platinum foil 25 mm. wide, 0-015 mm. thick is
brought to incandescence by an electric current of about 80 amperes.
The temperature is increased until one-tenth of the total radiation is
transmitted through a water trough 2 cm. in width. This ratio is
determined by means of u bolometer.      The construction of the instru
ments require the greatest care, and three months had passed before I
was able to obtain the first observations.     The instruments used for
this work are shown in fig. 4.       The explanation appended to this
drawing is sufficient to render further description unnecessary.
   It would be useless to give details of the experiments which in the
main confirm the results already obtained by Lummer and Kurlbaum.
   With the same apparatus used in the same manner the light is prac
tically constant as long as the ratio of radiations is adjusted to 1/10
per cent
   The adjustment of the temperature of the platinum foil with the
required degree of precision        is,
                                  however, most tedious, and in fact all
but impossible, except   under  the  most favourable conditions.   This
consideration, together with the complicated nature of the apparatus,
render this light impracticable as   working standard.

480                  Mr.   J. E. Petavel.    An   Experimental
standard must be constant, reproducible, and must emit light of a suit
able colour.       We have just seen that the source of light under con
sideration may be regarded as fulfilling the first of these conditions :
with regard to the second and third, the conclusions are less favour
able.
   By definition, the ratio between the total radiation and that trans
mitted through the water trough must be as ten to one, 1 per cent,
error in the electrical measurements causing 3 per cent, change in the
light. To obtain the required degree of precision the galvanometer
deflections must be reduced to equality.             Three methods are avail
able   : —
    1.   The bolometer current may be reduced in the ratio of one to ten.
   2. A l/10th shunt can be introduced into the galvanometer circuit,
   3. The distance between the bolometer and the radiator may lw
           varied in the ratio of 1 to ,/10.
   None of these methods is entirely satisfactory. The reduction of the
current through the bolometer involves a considerable complication of
the apparatus, and interferes with the steady working of the instru
ment.       It is also by no means impossible that the resulting change in
the temperature of the bolometer films may change their coefficient of
absorption.        With   a shunted galvanometer, temperature      changes and
thermo-currents        are  a   frequent source   of error.   The most   reliable
method is to change the distance of the radiator ; but here again two
objections arise.        The enclosure containing the platinum foil is rarely
at a temperature so closely approaching that of the bolometer films
that shifting this large surface leaves the instrument unaffected.
The law of inverse squares cannot strictly be applied, as the rays of
light are refracted when passing through the water trough. In prac
tice, marked variations were obtained when the method of determining
 the ratio of the two radiations was altered.
    The use of another form of bolometer produced a considerable change
 in the light emitted.          The bolometer films are coated with platinum
 black by electrolysis.          The composition of the Iwth, the electromotive
 force, and the current have been specified ; but it was found that the
 temperature of the bath and the resistance of the film affected the
 nature of the deposit obtained.
    Finally, the spectral composition         of the light is unsatisfactory, the
 colour being much too red.
    We are thus driven to the conclusion that this light does not
 possess all the qualities required of a primary standard.                 Under
 certain circumstances        it may be of the greatest value as a standard of
 reference.      It  is used in the Rdchsanstalt to check the values of the
 Hefner lamps ; for purposes of this kind it is well suited, and might
 with advantage be more frequently used.

          Preliminary     Resear<h on the Molten     Platinum Standard of Liyhl.
    The use of molten platinum as a standard of light was first proposed
by J. Violle* at the Congres International des Electriciens on the 21st
of September, 1881.1                In 1884 Violle published an account of his
experiments         with   the new standard, which was adopted in the same
year by the Conference Internationale pour la Determination des
 Unites Electriques on the 2nd of May, 1884.J The adoption was con
firmed by the Congri-s International des Electriciens on the 21st of
 May, 1889, when it was specified that the practical unit should be the
bouyie d&inwlf, and by the International Congress in Chicago in 1893,
and the Congres International des Electriciens at Geneva in 189G,
when the use of the Hefner lamp as a practical standard was recom
mended.
    Since the adoption of this unit the aim of most of the experimental
work on the subject has been not so much to find a suitable method of
using the Violle standard as to obtain a substitute for it.                         These
efforts have resulted in the well-known instrument devised by W. Sic-
mens§ for fusing platinum foil, and in the proposal made by C. R.
Cross] to use as a practical standard the light emitted by a thin
platinum wire at its melting point.
    Physiological considerations render such a thing as an instantaneous
photometric reading an impossibility, and herein lies the principal
reason why the above proposals have had to be abandoned.                            Apart
from this fact, it is extremely doubtful if either in the case of fine wire
or thin foil the break occurs actually at the temperature of fusion of
the metal.51          Cross admits that there were considerable differences in
the quantity of light emitted per unit area when the diameter of the
wire was changed.              In connection with the present work a number of
experiments were tried, both with wire and foil, but the results were by
no means encouraging.

 482                      Mr.   J. E. Petavel.        An   Experimental
       As far     as  I  am aware only one research has been carried out with a
 view       of repeating the Violle standard on anything like the scale
 originally used.             This research was made at the Reichsanstalt* in
  Berlin.         The work proved unsuccessful, and a detailed account of the
  experiments has never been published.                     This renders it very difficult
  to suggest a reason why reliable results were not obtained.
       In the case of molten platinum, owing to the high rate at which heat
 is being dissipated, it is quite possible for one part of the mass to be
 liquid while another part only a few millimetres distant is considerably
  below the temperature of solidification.                 This source of error should be
 minimised by the choice of suitable experimental conditions, and by
 reducing the results by some method similar to the one given below.
 Again, all the magnesia or lime bricks I have been able to secure con
 tain a certain proportion of silica.                 This, as will be pointed out later,
 is sufficient to render them useless for the purpose in view.                         In the
 account of the Keichsanstalt experiments this difficulty is not men
 tioned.
      In common with all other pure substances, platinum has a constant
 freezing        point  ;  the length of time, however,           during which the con
stancy of temperature               will  be maintained,       depends mainly on three
factors.
     If    we take      D to represent the quantity of heat dissipated by the
platinum per unit time when at its temperature of solidification, H the
heat supplied to the metal per unit time, and L the total latent heat of
the mass, and supposing for the present that the thermal conductivity
is   very great, the time during which the temperature will remain con
stant will be —
                                     •     ,_      Ji
                                                  D-H
     For the object we have in view the time of constancy must be made
as great as possible.
 -
     One method of increasing the time t is to make H very nearly equal
to D, or, in other words, to supply heat to the molten metal at nearly
the same rate as the metal is losing it.                  We may supply the necessary
quantity         of   heat  H   by means     of  an  electric current ; or, using a large
surface of metal, we may keep the blow-pipe going on one part of the
surface while the observations are being made on some other portion.
     If   we abandon the idea of supplying heat during the time the obser
vations are being taken, the formula becomes —

                   Research on some Standards       of LigJit.             483
    In order to reduce the amount of heat dissipated         we must place the
platinum in an enclosure at nearly the same temperature as the metal
itself, take the observations through a relatively small opening, and
make the thermal insulation of the mass as perfect as possible.         In the
above formulae, L being a function of the volume and D a function of
 the surface, we may, for any given circumstances, increase the time t
 by increasing the total volume of the metal.
    But it now becomes necessary to take into account the thermal con
 ductivity of the metal.       Strictly speaking, any given portion of the
 surface can only be at the standard temperature ts for the very small
 fraction of a second during which the solid film is forming ; later on
 the surface is at some lower temperature (ts-n) where n is the
 temperature interval which is required to cause the heat to flow from
 the parts of the mass where the process of solidification is actually in
 progress to the surface at the same rate as it is there being dissipated.
 Thus by increasing the mass of the metal we cannot indefinitely in
 crease the time available for the photometric observations.            Unless
 the rate at which the     heat  is  being dissipated   at  the surface  under
 observation is made small, the temperature will not remain constant
 during the process of solidification, but will fall more and more rapidly
as a larger proportion of the mass becomes solid.
               On the Fusion of Platinum by an Electric Current.
    From the considerations that have just been enumerated, the ad
 vantages of an electric method of heating the metal are at once
apparent.
    In the   preliminary    experiments a number        of different forms of
electric furnace were tried.       In some cases the electric arc was used,
in others the crucible was surrounded with a layer of graphite through
which the heating current was passed. It is well known that at high
temperatures platinum combines with carbon forming a carbide, and
thus the use of graphite crucibles was out of the question.
    It is unnecessary to give further details as the experiments were
not successful.    No material could be found that would resist the
high temperature of the arc and the chemical action of the incandescent
carbon, and at the same time not affect the purity of the platinum.            .
    It was then decided to fuse the platinum by passing the current
directly through the metal itself. The apparatus shown in fig. 5 was
designed for this purpose.       Some forty large secondary cells were, by
aid of the mercury switch, connected in parallel on to two " 'bus-bars."
The current was carried by massive copper leads to the terminal T],
and from there by a one square inch bar to the clip C, passing through
the platinum bar A to the clip C.,.         E is a U-shaped mercury trough
serving   as a variable  resistance.    The  copper short-circuiting piece D

  length of the mercury.            The clips Ci und C-, were hollow and kept
  cool by a water circulation. A rapid flow of water was also maintained
  over the surface of the mercury. The electric circuit was completed
  through the mercury switch S and an amperemeter.

     With this       arrangement        currents up to 2000 amperes could lx;
  maintained      for several hours.          The platinum was supported by a
  trough, L, of some refractory material which was carefully cut to fit the
  metal bar.      From the first it was evident that the principal difficulty
  would be to find a suitable material for this support. The weight of
  the molten metal acting on the supporting, material gradually causes
  the shape of the trough to alter, and in a comparatively short time the
  cross-section of the metal becomes very irregular.               The platinum then
. superheats in the place where           the cross-sectional area has been most
  reduced, a spark occurs, and the molten metal thrown aside by the
  explosive force of the discharge, freezes before it has time to flow back
  into position. It is of course easy to re-weld the platinum, but the
  same difficulty will recur time after time and at more frequent inter
  vals as the shape of the trough becomes more and more distorted.
  Some twenty bars of different shapes and sizes were used with the
  same result.        Had it been possible to use larger bars, any small
  distortion of the trough would probably not have affected the

                  Research on some Standards   of Light.             485
experiments.     However, as already stated, 2000 amperes was the
maximum      current available, and with this current it was found
impossible   to  melt bars of much more than       70 sq. mm. in cross-
section.
   The length of the span between the edges of the clips was usually
70 mm., but in some cases this length was reduced to 40 mm.
   Lime, alumina and magnesia were the materials used for the
troughs.
   It became evident that small platinum bars could not be maintained
for any length of time in the molten state when supported on the
ordinary refractory materials, and it was decided to make use of metal
supports.
   The question of cost excluded the use of the metals of the platinum
group, and in default of a better material the trough was made of
nickel.    A number of nickel plates insulated from each other by mica
were bolted together so as to form a solid block.        In this block a
cylindrical groove was cut, its axis being perpendicular to the direction
of the laminations. The nickel plates were l-8 mm. in thickness,
every alternate plate projecting 5 mm. on the sides and 6 mm. below.
Through the channels thus formed a rapid circulation of water was
maintained.     The platinum bar was semi-circular in cross-section and
deeply grooved on the lower side where it came in contact with the
nickel. The shape was much the same as would be obtained by cut
ting an ordinary bolt in two along its axis, the edges of the V-shaped
thread bearing on the nickel.    In this manner the somewhat anomal
ous experiment of fusing platinum in a nickel crucible was successfully
carried out.    Needless to say that the anomaly is only apparent, the
molten platinum did not come in contact with the nickel, but was
supported in a shell of solid platinum.    The cooling was so efficacious
that the nickel crucible never once became red hot.      When the metal
is fused in this manner the quantity of heat lost is very considerable,
and the effective cross-section of the bars had to be greatly reduced.
The cross-sectional area, as measured from the bottom of the grooves,
did not exceed 30 sq. mm. At the surface of the bar the central
channel of molten metal was not more than 2 mm. in width.          If the
current were forced so as to melt a larger surface, the bottom of the
threads softened sufficiently to allow the fused platinum to run
through, thus causing the bar to break.
   Even when this occurred the platinum was found to freeze rapidly
enough to prevent it alloying with the nickel support.
   If  the above experiments were made on a larger scale some valuable
results would certainly be obtained.     By the use of a large welding
transformer there should be no difficulty in fusing bars of ten or
twenty times the cross-section of those used in the present instance.
As will be seen below, good results can be obtained when the ordinary

 486               Mr.  J. E. Petavel.    An  Experimental
 oxy-hydrogen flame is used to fuse the platinum, but, taking every
 thing into account, the electrical method, if carried out on a sufficient
 scale, would not only be more simple, but would afford a more ready
 means of varying the rate of cooling.
           On the Fusion of Platinum by   the Oxy-hydrogen Blow-pipf.
     The object of the following researches was to repeat the work done
 some years ago by Violle, and to determine what are the best
 experimental conditions.      It is a somewhat curious fact that, although
 Violle makes no mention of having encountered any special difficulties,
 his experiments have never been repeated with success.          Even under
 the best conditions (such as are obtainable, for instance, at the
 Eeichsanstalt) the results have not proved satisfactory. Under these
 circumstances, it seemed hardly advisable to attempt any further
 research in this direction.       But the theoretical advantages of the
 Violle standard appeal strongly to anyone who has studied the
standards of light now in practical use, and it was thought that,
 whatever the final result, the time spent in this study would not
 be lost.
     The preliminary experiments occupied some considerable time, and
 nearly six months passed before the conditions under which the fusion
 should take place were clearly established.       The platinum was fused
several hundred times, the conditions being varied in every conceivable
way. The shape of the furnace, the material of which it was made,
the form of the blow-pipe, the relative proportion of the gases, in fact,
everything that could have any bearing on the final result was in turn
studied, and the most favourable conditions determined.        The slightest
impurity on the surface of the platinum has a considerable effect on the
quantity of light emitted.        When cold the surface always appears
fairly bright and clean, but there is a temperature between a white and
red heat at which the smallest impurity is clearly visible. At this
temperature the platinum ingot, if it be quite pure, is very similar to
a pool of molten glass.      Any small impurity will cause a slight haze,
resembling     that produced on a mirror by a breath of moist air ; if the
impurities are present in a larger proportion the surface becomes very
similar to a sheet of ground glass.
    The necessary conditions to ensure a pure surface may be briefly
summed up as follows :—
    1. The platinum must be chemically pure.
    2. The crucible must be made of pure lime.
    Pure magnesia does not form a sufficiently coherent mass, and, alu
mina being light and flocculent, allows the metal to sink through it.
    The lime should be entirely free from silica, one-quarter per cent.
  iing sufficient to spoil the surface.

                     Research on some Standards       of Light.                487
     The best method of preparing the lime is to ignite calcium carbonate
  which has been precipitated from calcium nitrate by ammonium
  carbonate.*
     3. The hydrogen burned must contain no hydrocarbons.
     At these high temperatures platinum combines readily with carbon,
 and any carbon in the flame would rapidly tarnish the surface of the
 metal.
     4. The    gases  should   be   burnt in the ratio of four volumes           of
  hydrogen to three of oxygen.
     All the best results were obtained when using the gases in the above-
  mentioned proportion.       The temperature of the flame is then but
 little above the melting point of platinum, and the metal does not
 superheat    to any great extent.       When the platinum is considerably
 superheated it slowly distils, the drops condensing on the brick forming
 the cover of the furnace      ;  the metal then drips back into the crucible
 carrying with it    some of the silica which the brick contains, and thus
 contaminating the surface which is under observation.             An excess of
 oxygen in the flame is also favourable, inasmuch as it oxidises any
 impurity that the platinum may contain.
    Finally it is important that the blow-pipe should be so constructed as
 to ensure a thorough mixture of the two gases.
    The most favourable conditions being established by these prelimi
 nary experiments, the necessary apparatus had now to be designed. It
 may be thought that the instruments are unnecessarily complicated,
 but it must be borne in mind that a single experimenter had not only
 to make all the observations, but also to regulate the flow of the gases,
 the electromotive force on the terminals of the standard lamp, and the
 current of water passing through the diaphragms.           Most of the appa
 ratus had, therefore, to be made automatic in its action.
    The instruments serving to regulate the supply of gas are shown
in fig. 6. The gas supply is stored in large cylinders at a pressure
of from 100 to 200 atmospheres.               S is a device worked by an
electric current from a key placed under the photometer head.               When
the key is pressed the chopper C falls, compressing the india-rubber
tubes and cutting off' the gas from the blow-pipe.        (This device is shown
in elevation at the bottom of fig. 6, on the left-hand side.)                 The
hydrogen escapes through         a valve  to the burner  B  where   it is ignited,
the oxygen blows off through the water trap T.              When the chopper
C is up the gases, after passing through the meters provided with
scales reading to one-hundredth          of a cubic foot are burnt from the
blow-pipe P.
    On one of the circuits the gas is forced through         a diaphragm with
an opening of about      one-hundredth     of the normal   cross-section of the
   * This method was suggested by Dr. A. Scott, to whose kind advice the solution
of many of the chemical problems involved in the present work is due.

the two sides of this diaphragm.             By the aid of this gauge It the rate
of flow of the gas can be kept constant at any desired value.                The
gauge G serves to regulate the ratio of the two gases.                Two bells
float in mercury, the interior of one being placed in communication
with the oxygen inlet of the blow-pipe, the interior of the other with
the hydrogen inlet.         The apparatus is merely a balance, the two
quantities weighed being the pressures of the two gases. The point of
support is empirically adjusted so that the system is in equilibrium
when the gases are flowing in the desired ratio, viz., four volumes of
hydrogen to three of oxygen.
   The instrument is very easy to construct, and its accuracy is amply
sufficient for the purpose in view.

    The blow-pipe is of a somewhat peculiar shape and is shown in fig. 7.
About half the oxygen passes through the central nozzle N, which is
surrounded by a platinum nozzle P. The supply of hydrogen is led
in at C, and flows down between these two tubes. The entire arrange
ment is surrounded by a, gun-metal case, which is cooled by the water
circulation W. Half the oxygen flows down between the gun-metal
and platinum tubes, entirely surrounding the hydrogen where it issues
from the platinum nozzle, thus insuring its perfect combustion.

  These    bricks are eminently suitable to resist high temperatures.
Owing   to  the presence of silica they could not be used alone for the
purpose we have in view, but they are very valuable as an outer
crucible in which to place the pure lime on which the platinum rests.
In a brick 11x11x7 cm. a cylinder of                 7   cm. in diameter and 3 cm. in
depth is drilled out ; the hollow is filled up with chemically pure lime
in the form of powder, which is pressed tightly in. The platinum,
roughly hammered into shape, is forced into the bed thus prepared
until the lime is flush with the upper surface of the metal.                   Before the
temperature    has reached the melting point of platinum the lime has
formed itself into a sufficiently coherent mass to support the weight
of the metal.    Another brick 11x11x4 cm. forms the cover ; it is
held in a cast-iron frame by six }-inch screws equally spaced along
two adjacent sides of the square.        A hole l-6 cm. in diameter is
drilled through the centre of this cover.         It is through this hole
that the blow-pipe plays vertically on the surface of the metal.
The lower surface of the cover should be not more than 1 cm. above
the platinum.    Both blow-pipe and diaphragm are attached to the
same vertical axis A ; the electromagnet M, which controls the motion
of this axis, is placed in series with the magnet N, which cuts
off the supply of gas to the blow-pipe.            The instant the gas is
stopped the axis swings round, bringing the 1 square centimetre dia
phragm D above the hole in the cover of the furnace.           A number of
screens are provided so as to prevent any light from the furnace itself
reaching the photometer.     These screens have been removed in fig. 6
so as to give a better view of the furnace.
   The light from the platinum is reflected on to the photometer by a
mirror.    The secondary standard is not placed in the axis of the
photometer, but at right angles to          it,
                                        its light being also reflected by a
mirror.    Each mirror                   by a bar, which          held in a

socket provided with        V-shaped check, so that when one of the
mirrors    taken out of its supporting socket
          is                                        can always be replaced

                        ;                                           Thus by
interchanging the two mirrors any error due to their coefficient of
absorption can   be eliminated.
  A   metronome    ringing every ten seconds gives the intervals at
which the photometric observations are to be made. To save time
the readings are not taken, but the position of the index on the
photometer bar     is marked off.   The distances are read at leisure
later on.
   The method by which the observations are obtained       as follows —
                                                                     is              :
Let us suppose that the platinum     in position, the standard of refer
                                           is

calibrated, and that we are ready to start the blow-pipe.    We turn on

 gen is burning at the rate of 0'8 cubic foot per minute, we then regu
 late the supply of gas so as to keep the ratio gauge in balance. At the
 end of fifteen minutes we press the key which stops the gas and swings
 the diaphragm into position.            No photometric readings are taken at
 the end of this first fusion for two reasons               : 1.  The walls of the fur
 nace have not yet had time to heat up, and the platinum, though
 fused on the surface, is probably still solid underneath.                  2. Some par
 ticles of lime     dust    are pretty  sure  to   be floating on the surface if the
 ingot of metal has only just been put into a newly made crucible. We
 therefore merely use this fusion to adjust the position of the furnace
 and cover, so that the centre of the platinum surface and the centre of
 the aperture in the cover should be on a vertical line passing through
 the centre of the diaphragm.
    This done, we re-start the blow-pipe, and fifteen minutes later,                as the
 metronome        rings, we press the electric key, keeping an eye on the
 photometer. The photometer is kept in balance, and every ten seconds,
as the metronome rings, the position of the photometer head is marked
off.      By the time some ten or fifteen readings have been recorded the
 platinum has cooled below its melting point. The distances are then
read off at leisure, the blow-pipe is swung back into position, the
chopper re-set, the mirrors are interchanged, and everything is ready
for a fresh start.         Fifteen minutes later another series of readings can
be taken.
    A    Lummer and Brodhun photometer* and photometer bench were
used during these experiments, the distance between the lights being
331-4 cm.         The position of both the sources of light was fixed, the
photometer head alone being movable.                   To ensure the maximum sen
sitiveness it is well to keep one eye exclusively for the photometric
observations, covering it when the readings are not being taken with
a black screen.         In all the experiments incandescent lamps were used
as standards of       reference.     When the necessary precautions are taken
these form very reliable standards, remaining absolutely constant for
many hours.t          The pressure on the terminals of these lamps must be
adjusted      with    the    greatest care, as the light varies with the sixth
power of the electromotive force.             In the present case fifty-volt lamps
were used, a specially constructed divided resistance being placed
across the terminals of the lamp.                By means of a potentiometer the
electromotive force on 1 20th of this resistance was compared with
the electromotive force of a Clark's cell.              To avoid any rapid changes
   * The photometer head and part of the photometer bench are shown in fig. 4.
To avoid any stray light, the photometer was hung with black velvet curtains.

    Having in the manner indicated above obtained a set of photometric
readings at intervals of ten seconds from the time the blow-pipe was
stopped, let us consider what is the best manner of reducing these
observations.      The typical shape of the curve obtained is shown in
fig. 8 (see Table V) ; the abscissae represent time, the ordinates light.
The curve consists of three parts, the first falling rapidly represents
the decrease of light sent out from the liquid metal as its temperature
falls.    There is a sudden break in the curve when the platinum begins
to solidify, followed by a practically straight line. This second period
(forty to fifty seconds in the conditions under which these experiments
were made) marks the time during which the platinum ingot is freez
ing. For the sake of brevity we shall in future refer to this part of
the curve as the "constant" period, though strictly speaking, owing
to the imperfect conduction of the metal, the intensity of the light
decreases slightly as the time increases.         The third part of the curve
represents the cooling of the surface after the entire mass is solid. The
want of sharpness in the transition between the second and third parts

   The definition of the standard quantity of light is that emitted in a
normal direction by 1 square centimetre of surface of platinum at its
temperature of solidification.
     It   has already been pointed out :
     1.   That it is practically impossible               to   obtain   an   instantaneous
photometric observation.
   2. That each part of the surface        strictly speaking, only at the

   The most obvious method would be to take the mean of the readings
obtained during the " constant period," but in doing so we should
certainly be wrong, as these readings form     decreasing series, the first

varies with the mass of metal used, and the circumstances under which
it    allowed to cool
     is                  and were we to take the mean of the readings,
                             ;
the final determination would necessarily be dependent on these experi
mental conditions.     The first reading, though theoretically the most
correct,    practically the least reliable of the series. This reading
               is
immediately follows a sudden and considerable change in the illumina
tion of the photometer, and the eye has not yet had time to become
accustomed  to the change.   It therefore out of the question to base
                                            is

so-called " constant period" exceeds 0'03 per cent, per second.
   In the course of the present investigation, observations were taken
for some three hundred curves, but for obvious reasons only a few of
the most typical are recorded here.
   It must be clearly understood that the present experiments were not
undertaken with a view of obtaining any absolute determinations, but
purely     as a   preliminary investigation.               The objects in view were    :
   1.    To ascertain the most favourable experimental conditions.
   2.    To determine the degree of accuracy to be obtained under these
conditions.
   The results are expressed in terms of the quantity of light emitted
by 1 sq. cm. of platinum at its temperature of solidification, and under
the following conditions :—
   The total mass used was 345 grammes in the shape of a disc.       The
area of the upper surface of the disc was 17 sq. cm. The diameter     the              j>i
hole in the cover of the furnace was    cm. The observations were taken
                                                  1   '6
after the blow-pipe had been alight for fifteen minutes, burning 0'8 cubic
foot of hydrogen per minute, the two gases being mixed in the ratio of
four volumes of hydrogen to three of oxygen.        The above conditions
will, for the purpose of this investigation, be taken as the " normal

the mass of metal to 1000 or 2000 grammes, and this would entail a
change in the quantity of gas burnt.*

portion of the platinum will actually fuse. On the other hand, if we
make the superficial area too small, forming the metal into a long
cylinder, a limit will be reached when the fusion will cease to extend
to the lower layers.         In the present case 35 sq, cm. and 8 sq. cm. are

            The maximum temperature reached by the metal was not sufficient
        to cause tlfe sharp break in the curve of light, but notwithstanding
        this fact, the values obtained differ less than 1£ per cent. from the

         works out at 0'4 per cent.              It  is not possible to decrease the mass of

        502                 Mr.  J.   E. PetaveL        An Ei-perimental
       made,     it was decided to try the effect of using coal gas instead of
       hydrogen. After the blow-pipe had been supplied for twenty minutes
        with coal gas, the curve shown in fig. 16, curve I, was obtained ;
        fifteen minutes later a similar set of readings were recorded.                      The
Flo. J6. — Curve    I shows the effect of using coal gas to heat the platinum, the light is 36 per cent.
    above tho normal.      Curve   II  was taken an hour and a half later, the coal gas having bets
     replaced by pure hydrogen.        The error is already reduced to 2 per cent.

        entire surface of the metal was covered with              a white film.     The inten
       sity of the light was 36 per cent. above the normal.                      The coal gas
        was then stopped, and the hydrogen turned on, the surface gradually
       clearing     as the carbon     oxidised out.      In an hour and a half the curve
       fig. 16, curve II,     was obtained, the error having already been reduced
       to less than 2 per cent.
            From the above results          I believe    I  am justified in stating tluit the
       probable variation in the light emitted by molten platinum under the standard
       conditions is not above 1 per cent.
            With more perfect apparatus, and with the experimental conditions
       altered in the direction that has been suggested,                the accuracy of this
       standard would certainly be increased.
            Physiological considerations fix a limit to the accuracy of photo
       metric observations.           It is not impossible that the accuracy of the
        platinum standard may attain to or even surpass this limit.
            The present work has occupied nearly three years, and it was
       thought advisable before devoting more time to the subject to publish

                 Research on .tome Standards    of Light.            503
such results as had already been obtained.    It is hoped that those who
are interested in photometric work will, by their advice and criticism,
help to bring the research to a satisfactory close.
   In concluding, may I be allowed to express my gratitude to the
managers of the Royal Institution for placing the splendid resources
of the Davy-Faraday Laboratory at my disposal, as well as for generously
defraying the necessarily heavy expenses incurred by the present work.
   My thanks are also due to Messrs. Johnson, Matthey & Co., who
most kindly lent the platinum employed.
