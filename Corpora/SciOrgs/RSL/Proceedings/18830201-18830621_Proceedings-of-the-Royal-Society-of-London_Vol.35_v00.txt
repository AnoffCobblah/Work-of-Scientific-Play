     The following Papers were read : —
  I. " On     the Electrical   Resistance    of Carbon       Contacts."   By
        Shel4ord Bidwell, M.A., LL.B. Communicated by Pro
        fessor W. G. Adams, F.R.S. Received January 18, 1883.
                        1. Object of the Investigation.
     It is well known that the electrical resistance of carbon contacts
  diminishes with increased pressure, though, so far as I am aware, the
  phenomenon has never hitherto been systematically investigated.
  The experiments described in this paper were begun with the object
  of establishing a quantitative relation between pressure and resist
  ance ; but the subject grew considerably under treatment ; fresh facts
  from time to time claimed attention, and several interesting details,
  not, I believe, previously observed, were eventually brought to light.
     Loose contacts are proverbial for the uncertainty of their action,
  and it was to be expected that the investigation would prove trouble
  some and the results obtained by no means uniform.          By multiplying
  experiments, however, the element of uncertainty was to a great,
  extent removed, and in most cases it was found possible to indicate a
  general law with tolerable certainty.
                   2. Apparatus for Regulating     Pressure.
     The instrument used for regulating the pressure is shown in fig.     1.

 2                               Mr. S. Bidwell.                    [Feb. 1,
 The apparatus consists of a little balance.       HK is a light steel rod
 formed of a fine knitting needle balanced at C on a knife-edge, which
is fixed at right angles to it. To one end, K, is attached a split tub-
of thin copper for holding short rods of the different materials to be
tested, which are held so as to press at right angles upon another rod,
 It, supported in a spring clamp.       Midway between C and K is hung
the scale-pan S, and at H is a sliding counterpoise, which, at the
beginning of an experiment, is so adjusted that a weight of "01 grm.
in the scale-pan will just bring K and R into contact with each other.
Electrical connexion is made through the wires WL and W5, the
former of which is attached to the clamp holding R, and the latter
communicates with a mercury cup, into which dips a wire attached to
the rod HK at the point C.         It is evident that the pressure between
K and R will be equal to half the weight in the scale-pan S.
3. Relation beticeen the Pressure    of Carbon Contacts and their Resistance-
    Two short rods of electric light carbon, G millims. in diameter,
were placed in the instrument in the positions shown at K and R, and
the resistance with different pressures measured in the ordinary
manner with a Wheatstone's bridge.            The means of three series of
such measurements made under as nearly as possible the same con
ditions, are given in Table I.

   From the above results the curve fig.  2 has been constructed,   where
the abscissae represent the pressures at the points of contact and the
ordinates the resistance in ohms. The curve shows clearly that the
greatest variations occur when the pressure is small and the resistance
comparatively high.
         4. Change of Resistance partly due  to  Effect of Current,
   In making measurements of the kind above described, the details
of the arrangements were from time to time varied. Different pro
portional coils were used and different numbers of battery cells ; and
it soon became evident that the resistance of the carbon contact was
largely dependent on the strength of the current used to measure it.
In Table   II (giving the mean of two series of observations) is shown
the result of using one, two, three, and four cells successively.

   It  became interesting to ascertain                   what would be the effect of
making     still  further variations     in  the    strength  of the measuring current.
A box of resistance coils was therefore inserted between the battery
(two Leclanche cells) and the bridge arrangement ; and the weight
in the scale-pan remaining the same, various resistances were succes
sively uuplugged in the box. Table                   III  gives a few of the measure
ments with pressures of "5, 2'5, 7-5, and 25 grms.                    This table shows
that the resistance of the carbon contacts varies greatly with the
strength of the current when the pressure is small, and but very
slightly when the pressure is great.

    It is clear therefore that the diminution of resistance which occurs
when the pressure between carbon contacts is increased is not, under
ordinary circumstances, due solely to the direct effect of pressure.
For the diminished resistance which results from the increased
pressure causes an increase in the strength of the current, the effect
of which is a still further fall in the resistance.               Thus the total
diminution of resistance is due partly to increase of pressure, and
partly to increased strength of current.

    It will be seen that with small pressures the resistance is largely
dependent upon the strength of the current, but when the pressure is
considerable, the resistance with weak and strong currents is nearly
the same.

   ". The   Effect of Pressure on the Resistance of Carbon is Temporary.
   In order to ascertain whether the diminution of resistance under
pressure was entirely of a temporary nature, or whether it continued
in any degree after the pressure had been removed (the carbons of
course being undisturbed) a special arrangement was made by means
of which a 5 grm. weight could be placed in or taken out of the scale-
pan without causing any appreciable              oscillation. The weight was
attached by a thread to one end of a horizontal lever, the lever being
so supported that when the other end of it was depressed the weight
was raised about a centimetre above the pan ; this could be done
without in any material degree disturbing the carbon contacts.
   A weight of 1 grm. being in the scale-pan, the resistance of the
contact was measured           with the Wheatstone's bridge, and one
 Leclancbe cell ; the 5 grm. weight was then lowered into the pan, and
a measurement         made of the diminished resistance.            The 5 grm.
weight was again gently raised, and the resistance with a single
gramme once more measured.              In every case     it was found to have
returned almost exactly to its original value.              Table  VI   gives six
series of measurements thus made.

    It  will   be   noticed,   however,     that the final resistance is almost
invariably slightly higher           than    the original resistance ; but this
increased resistance gradually diminished, as may be seen by com
paring the last figure of one column with the first of the next, and
perhaps if time were given it would return to its original value.              This
is probably a thermo-electric effect.
                            8. Effects of Heating Contacts.
    Since, as is well known, the resistance of a continuous conductor of
carbon is diminished by heat, it would be reasonable to suppose that
 the diminution which the resistance of carbon contacts exhibits
 under the influence of increased currents is due merely to the heating
 effect of the current.       Experiments made with the view of testing this
 hypothesis failed, however, to support it. Carbon contacts of various
 forms were heated in an air-bath, and their resistance measured at
 different degrees of temperature.             The resistance was in every case
 found to vary irregularly (probably because, in consequence of the
 expansion due to heat, the relative positions of the points of contact
 were slightly altered) but, in general, rise of temperature was accom
 panied by a rise in the resistance.          Thus, in one case with a pressure
 of 1 grm., the resistance which at 1G° C. was 9 ohms, became at
 •r<0° 10" 7 ohms.      Upon another occasion the resistance increased from
 11*9 ohms at 15° to 1546 ohms at 3G\               And again with a pressure of
 45 grms., the resistance       increased from 447 ohms at 17° to 547 ohms
 at 50°.      In every case the resistance fluctuated considerably, rising
 and falling alternately as the temperaturo was raised, but the general
 tendency      seemed     to be    towards     increased   resistance.    This may
 possibly    be due to the formation         of a non-conducting film by air or
 gases expelled from the carbon by heat.

              9.   Permanent     Effect of Current upon Resistance.
   Under certain circumstances the current produces a permanent and
not merely     temporary effect upon the resistance ; that is to say, tbe-
resistance of the contacts (so long as they are undisturbed by vibra
tion or otherwise,) is found to be lower or higher after the current
has ceased, than it was at first.
   Thus, for example, with a pressure of -5 grm. at the point of
contact, the resistance measured with a current of one or two mil-
liamperes was found to be 1045 ohms.              A current of 415 ampere was
then passed through the carbons for 10 seconds ; and on again testing
with the weak current, the resistance was found to have fallen to 548
ohms.    With a pressure of 2-5 grms., the same current reduced the
resistance   from     646   to 4-3 ohms.     With  5 grms.,     the resistance was
permanently      reduced from 47          to  344 ohms ; and        with 25 grms.
from 2-4   to 2"0 ohms.        All these effects were produced by a current
of -15 ampere.           Stronger currents (up to a certain point) effect
greater reductions.

    But when the proportion of the current strength to the pressure-
 exceeds a certain limit, the effect of the current is apparently to pro
 duce a permanent increase in the resistance, and this increase is
 generally very considerable.          The carbon contacts, a tangent galvano
 meter, a   box   of   resistance coils, and a battery of ten Leclanche cells
 are connected in simple circuit, and the strength of the current
  gradually increased by plugging out resistance in the box.                 As the

current increases, the deflection of the galvanometer needle becomes
greater until a certain strength is attained, when the galvanometer
needle suddenly goes back, and comes to rest almost or exactly at
zero.    The lighter the pressure the smaller the current necessary to
produce this effect.     Table VIII   gives the currents with which the
rise occurred, the pressure at the points of contact varying from -05
grm. to 5 grms.
   Attempts were made to measure the high resistance with a Wheat-
stone's bridge and a small current, and this brought to light the
curious fact that the resistance in question is generally very much
lower for weak than for strong currents. Thus it may happen that
while the moment before measurement the resistance may be sensibly
infinite, the very act of measurement reduces it to a few hundred
ohms.
   This paradoxical effect is best shown      by the special arrangement
indicated in fig. 5.
   G is the tangent galvanometer, S the carbon balance in the scale-
pan of which is a weight of 1 grm.         When key 1 is depressed the
current from eight Leclanche cells passes through the galvanometer
and the carbons.     The immediate effect is a deflection of (in the case
of my galvanometer)        about 75°. Almost instantly, however, the
needle returns to    zero, and key 1 may now be raised and depressed
 without producing the slightest movement of the needle. If, how
ever, key 2 is depressed the current from a single cell will pass
through the galvanometer and the carbons, and this will generally
produce a small deflection of from 2° to 10°.        But if key 1 is once
 more depressed the needle again altogether fails to move.           The
resistance at S is therefore of a very peculiar nature, being more

easily overcome by a small electromotive force than by a high one.
Though the experiment as thus described is generally successful, it
occasionally happens that the single cell fails equally with the larger
battery to overcome the resistance.
   F.or  a systematic   investigation of the last-mentioned   group of
phenomena    the apparatus was arranged as shown in fig. 6.
   It is essentially  a Wheatstone's bridge arrangement, the propor
tional coils used being 1 and 1,000 ohms.          A tangent galvano
meter of 49 ohm resistance is inserted in the same arm as the carbon
balance, and a box of resistance coils R is placed between the batter}'
(which consists of eight or ten Leclanche cells) and the bridge. The
arrangement admits of the measurement of the resistance of the
carbon when traversed by strong currents, the strength of which can
be regulated by the resistance box R, and measured by the tangent
galvanometer G.        A given weight being in the scale-pan, known
currents of gradually increasing strength were passed through the
carbon.    The resistance was measured, 1st, while the known current
was passing ; 2nd, with a very small current obtained by uuplugging
 10,000 ohms in the resistance box.       As the currents increased in
strength, the resistance measured with the very small current gra
dually diminished until a point was reached — and the lighter the
weight the sooner this was the case — at which the resistance sud
denly became infinity.     The measurements are given in Table IX, the
currents varying from "01 to "7 ampere, and the pressures from
•05 grm. to 5 grms.

                    10. Experiments      with Metallic Contacts.
   For the sake of comparison             a few experiments         were made with
metals.     Metallic   loose contacts    were    found    to be  even more uncertain
in their action than those of carbon, and to obtain a really fair
average of results a very great number of measurements would be
required.      Under precisely the same conditions as nearly as they
could    be   reproduced,     the results obtained were frequently very
different.     Nevertheless it has been possible to bring out with suffi
cient distinctness some remarkable peculiarities in the behaviour of
metallic contacts.
   The metal principally used was bismuth, which was selected on
account of its high specific resistance ; but a few experiments were
also made with copper and platinum.                The cylinders of bismuth and
copper were nearly the same diameter as those of the carbon pre
viously used — 6 millims. The platinum was prepared by soldering
wires of that metal upon cylinders of brass. The balance already
described and shown at fig. 1 was used in the same manner as before.
             11. Permanent     Fall of Resistance       caused by Current.
   The first unexpected phenomenon which attracted notice in working
with bismuth was tho very great permanent fall in the resistance
which was produced by an ordinary current with light pressures.
Using a single Leclanche cell, the lightest contact — the pressure being
certainly less than -01 grm. — failed to give a higher resistance than

ance has been reduced by a strong current, the changes which occur
when feebler currents are used are comparatively small — unless, of
course, the points of contact are first separated.   Of the nature of
such changes     shallIsay more presently. The following table gives a
few measurements, using one Leclanche cell: (1) with a resistance of
300 ohms between the cell and the bridge ; (2) without the 300 ohms.
It will be understood that the bismuth cylinders were separated from
each other every time the weights were changed.     The effect in ques
tion is most marked with small pressures ; with comparatively high
pressures it quite disappears.

                          12. Adhesion     of Contacts      due to Current.
  This phenomenon is accompanied by another.        After the passage
of the current which has caused the resistance to be so remarkably
diminished, the bismuth cylinders are found to adhere to each other, a
quite   appreciable force being necessary to separate them. This effect-
 which is common to all metals, has been thoroughly investigated by
 Mr. Stroh, a description of whose experiments is given in the " Journal
of the Society of Telegraph Engineers," vol. xix, page 182.       I shall,

the scale-pan, let a weak current be caused to pass through the points
of contact; the resistance will be found to be high. Let a strong
current    be passed, and          the     resistance     will  be   greatly diminished.
Once more let the current be reduced to its original strength ; the
resistance will not rise to its original value ; it will not, in fact, rise at
all ; it will be still further diminished.                   The following table gives
examples of this experiment with pressures of '5, 1, and 5 grms.

  the surfaces in contact should be absolutely clean.                       Unless they are

  I   think these effects admit of a simple explanation. When the
surfaces of the bismuth are clean, contact takes place entirely through
the metal.    The current heats the metal at the points of contact to an
extent which depends upon the current strength ; and the resistance,
in accordance with the general law, increases with the temperature :
strong currents will, therefore, give higher resistance than weak ones.
When, on the other hand, the surface is not clean, a film of oxide or
some foreign substance is interposed, the resistance of which, like that
of carbon, is higher with a weak current than with a strong one.
   It is probable that similar effects occur with metals of lower specific
resistance than that of bismuth ; but their observation is very diffi
cult, and requires more delicate apparatus than that at my disposal.
 Thus, of forty measurements made with platinum contacts, nineteen
 results were favourable to the theory, ten adverse to         and eleven  it,
 neutral.   With copper the indications were even more uncertain.
  14.   Effects on Resistance of Varying Pressure with Constant Current.
  The resistance of bismuth contacts at various pressures was
measured with fixed currents of "l, "01, and "001 ampere, the method
used being the same as in the case of carbon.    The mean of several
series of such measurements    given  in

existence of a more or less definite law, though the results of the

            15. Permanent Reduction       of Resistance     due to Pressure.
    Repeating with bismuth the experiments already described in the
case of carbon, it was clear that the diminution of resistance effected
 by pressure is generally of a permanent                  nature, continuing to a
 great extent after the pressure has been removed (so long as the
 points of contact remain undisturbed), and thus reversing the case
of carbon.      With strong currents the variations of resistance were
so uncertain and irregular that accurate measurements were impossible;
 but with a resistance of 300 ohms between the battery and the bridge
the effect is very clearly marked.             The results of the experiments
thus made are tabulated below.

 1883.]      On the Electrical Resistance of Carbon Contacts.              17
   The points of contact were, of course, changed for each series of
observations, and it should be noted that in the case of the last three
(which were not made on the same day as the others)               I  was less
successful in arranging the lever so as to secure perfect freedom from
oscillation when the weight was changed.
                                16. Summary.
   The following    appear    to  be the   most    important results of the
investigation.
                           (1.) Carbon   Contacts.
    Changes of pressure produce proportionately greater changes             of
resistance when the initial pressure is small than when it is great.
    Changes of pressure produce proportionately greater changes of
resistance with weak currents than with strong currents.
    Changes of current produce proportionately greater changes of
resistance with small currents than with large currents ; and with
light pressures than with heavy pressures.
    When the resistance of a carbon contact has been reduced by an
increase of pressure, it will, on the removal of the added pressure, rise
to approximately its original value.
     The passage of a current whose strength does not exceed a certain
limit, depending upon the pressure, causes a permanent diminution
in the resistance, and the stronger the current the great-r will be
such diminution.
    When the strength of the current exceeds a certain limit the
resistance is greatly and permanently increased.            The greater the
pressure the higher will be such limit.
   Unless special means are adopted for preserving a constant current,
the fall in the resistance which attends increased pressure is greater
than that which is due to increased pressure alone ; being partly due
also to increased strength of current.
   It is not proved that the diminished resistance which follows an
 increase of current is an effect of temperature.
                          (2.) Metallic   Contacts.
   In the case of bismuth and probably of other metals —
   With a given pressure the weaker the current the higher will            be
the resistance.   This effect is most marked when the pressure is small.
   Increase in the strength of the current is accompanied by a fall in
the resistance, and if the current be again reduced to its original
strength, the resulting change in the resistance        will be small, and it
 will in no case return to its original value.
    Diminution   in the strength of the current is followed by         a small

fall in the resistance if the metal is clean, and by a small rise in the
resistance if the metal is not clean.
   Increased pressure produces a greater fall in the resistance with
small pressures than with great pressures, and with weak currents
than with strong currents.
   The resistance after having been reduced by increased pressure does
not return to its original value when the added pressure is removed.
17.       Reasons     for    the   Superiority of Carbon over Metal in   the Microphone.
   The above observations may, perhaps, throw some light on a matter                        .
which has never hitherto been fully explained.        Why does carbon
give  far  better results than any metal when  used  in the microphone ?
It seems to me that this question may be answered without much
difficulty. The mere fact that a current causes delicately adjusted
metal contacts to adhere to each other is sufficient to account for the
superior efficiency of carbon.   A metal microphone might, indeed, be
used to transmit the pitch of a sound, provided that its vibrations
were sufficiently powerful to cause actual separation of the points of
contact.    The fundamental tone might, in this way, be conveyed, but
it is clear that the minute superimposed vibrations, due to the upper
partials, upon which depends the distinctive character of a particular
sound, would be very imperfectly represented if not entirely lost.
   In addition to this phenomenon of adhesion, and probably connect-d
with      are the facts that metallic contacts, nnlike those of carbon,
           it,
do not even approximately recover their original resistance when once
it has been reduced by increased pressure or increased current, unl-ss,
indeed,  complete separation occurs  and even the initial effect
                                                     :                                 of
pressure upon    resistance  (except with very weak cnrrents),
                                          is                                           in
general, much more marked with carbon than with metals.
   Lastly,      to be noticed that in the case of carbon, pressure and
                 it   is
current act in consonance with each other: pressure diminishes the
resistance, and in so doing increases the strength of the current and             ;
the current thus strengthened effects a further diminution in the
resistance.   In the case of metals, on the other hand (or at least in
the case of clean bismuth) pressure and current tend to produce
opposite effects.   The resistance      diminished by pressure and the
                                                  is
current consequently strengthened, but by reason of the increased
strength of current, the resistance         higher than  is would have   it
been       the current had remained unchanged.
          if                                          The effect of this
antagonism      not very great,
                     is         but   seems to give
                                                it  a material advantage
to carbon.*

III. " Preliminary Note on a Theory of Magnetism based upon
      New Experimental Researches."                      By Professor D. E.
      Hughes, F.R.S. Received January 27, 1883.
   In the year 1879*      I communicated          to the Royal Society a paper
"On an Induction Currents Balance                 and Experimental Researches
made    therewith." I continued my researches into the molecular
construction    of metallic bodies, and communicated the results then
obtained in three separate papersf bearing upon molecular mag
netism.
   To investigate the molecular construction of magnets required again
special forms of apparatus, and I have since been engaged upon these,
and the researches which they have enabled me to follow.
   From numerous researches I have gradually formed a theory of
magnetism entirely based upon experimental results, and these have
led me to the following conclusions : —
   1. That each molecule of a piece of iron, steel, or other magnetic
metal is a separate and independent magnet, having its two poles and
distribution of magnetic polarity exactly the same as its total evident
magnetism     when noticed upon a steel bar-magnet.

 20     Prof. D. E. Hughes.       On a Hieory   of Magnetism.     [Feb. 1,
   2.  That each molecule, or its polarity, can be rotated in either
direction upon its axis by torsion, stress, or by physical forces such as
 magnetism and electricity.
   3. That the inherent polarity or magnetism of each molecule is a
constant quantity like gravity ; that it can neither be augmented nor
destroyed.
   4.  That when we have external neutrality, or no apparent mag
netism, the molecules, or their polarities' arrange themselves so as to
satisfy their mutual attraction by the shortest path, and thus form a
complete closed circuit of attraction.
   5. That when magnetism becomes evident, the molecules or their
polarities have all rotated symmetrically in a given direction, producing
a north pole if rotated in this direction as regards the piece of steel,
or a south pole if rotated in the opposite direction. Also, that in
evident magnetism, we have still a symmetrical arrangement, but one
whose circles of attraction are not completed except through an
external armature joining both poles.
   The experimental evidences of the        above  theory are extremely
numerous,    and  appear    so conclusive, that  I  have ventured upon
formulating the results in the above theory.
   I hope in a few weeks to bring before the Royal Society the experi
mental evidence which has led me to the conclusions I have named ;
conclusions which have not been arrived at hastily, but from a long
series of research upon the molecular construction of magnetism now
extending over several years.

                          Received February 5, 1883.
   On   Hind Head, a fine moorland plateau about three miles from
Haslemere, with an elevation of 900 feet above the sea, I have
recently erected a small iron hnt, which forms, not only a place of
rest, but an extremely suitable station for meteorological observations.
Here, since the beginning of last November, I have continued to record
from time to time the temperature of the earth's surface as compared
with that of the air above the surface.           My object was to apply, if pos
sible, the    results which my experiments had established regarding the
action of aqueous vapour upon radiant heat.
   Two stout poles about 6 feet high were firmly fixed in the earth
8 feet asunder.        From one pole to the other was stretched a string,
from the centre of which the air thermometer was suspended.                      Its
bulb was 4 feet above         the   earth.       The surface    thermometer    was
placed      upon a layer of cotton wool, on a spot cleared of heather,
which    thickly covered the rest of the ground. The outlook from the
thermometers was free and extensive ; with the exception of the iron
hnt just referred to, there was no house near, the hut being about
50 yards distant from the thermometers.
   On November 11th, at 5.45 p.m., these were placed in position, and
observed from time to time afterwards.             Here are the results : —

     During the first and last of these observations the sky was entirely
overcast, during the other two a few stars were dimly visible.
  On November 13th, 25th, and 26th, observations were also made,
but they presented nothing remarkable.
     It   was otherwise,                            On the morning of
                               however, on December 10th.
that day the temperature was very low, suow a foot deep covered the
heather, while there was a very light movement of the air from the
north-east.   Assuming aqueous vapour to play the part that I have
ascribed to        it,
               the conditions were exactly such as would entitle us on a
priori grounds to expect a considerable waste of the earth's heat. At
8.5 a.m. the thermometers were placed in position, having left the hut
at a common temperature of 35°.         The cotton wool on which the
surface thermometer was laid was   of  the same temperature.   A single
minute's exposure sufficed to establish a difference of 5° between the
two thermometers.     The following observations were then made —                      :
                 8.10    a.m             Air    29°                  "Wool 16°

   Thus, in ten minutes, a difference of no less than 17° had established
itself between the two thermometers.
   Up to this time the sun was invisible:       dense dark cloud, resting

   During the last two observations, the newly risen sun shone upon
the air thermometer.     As the day advanced the difference between air
and wool became gradually less. From 18° at 8.50 a.m.,         had sunk     it
at 9.25 to 15°, at 9.50 to 13°, while at 10.25, the sun being unclouded
at the time, the difference             was 11°      ;   the air at that hour being 31°
and the wool 20°.
     In    the    celebrated experiments of              Patrick Wilson,    the    greatest
difference        observed between a surface               of suow   and the     air   2feet
above                      while the greatest difference noticed by
            the suow, was 16°       ;
Wells           his long continued observations, fell short of this
            during
amount.    Had Wilson employed swandown or cotton wool, and had
he placed his thermometer   feet instead of feet above the surface, his

difference would probably have   surpassed mine, for his temperatures
were much lower than those observed by me.        There is, however,
considerable similarity in the conditions under which we operated.
Snow in both cases was on the gronnd, and with him, there was                              a
light movement of the air from the east, while with me the motion

 1883.]                 On Terrestrial Radiation.                      23
was from the north-east.      The great differences of temperature be
tween earth and air which both his observations and mine reveal, are
due to a common cause, namely, the withdrawal of the check to
terrestrial radiation which is imposed by the presence of aqueous
vapour.
   Let us now compare these results with others obtained at a time of
extreme atmospheric serenity, when the air was almost a dead calm,
and the sky without a cloud.          At 3.30 p.m., January 16th, the
thermometers were placed in position, and observed afterwards with
the following results : —

   These observations, and especially the last of them, merit our
attention. There was no visible impediment to terrestrial radiation.
The sky was extremely clear, the moon was shining, Orion, the
Pleiades, Charles' Wain, including the small companion star at the
bend of the shaft, the north star, and many others, were clearly
visible. On no previous occasion during these observations had           I
seen the firmament purer ; and still, under these favourable conditions,
the difference between air and wool at 6 p.m. was only 4°, or less than
one-fourth of that observed on the morning of the 10th of December.
                    I
   We have here, submit, a very striking illustration of the action of
that invisible constituent of the atmosphere, to the influence of which
I  drew attention more than twenty-two years ago. On the 10th of
December the wind was light from the north-east, with a low tem
perature. On the 16th of January it was very light from the south
west, with a higher temperature.       The one was a dry air, the other
was a humid air ; the latter, therefore, though of great optical trans
parency, proved competent to arrest the invisible heat of the earth.
   The variations in the temperatures of the wool recorded in the last
column of figures are, moreover, not without a cause.       The advance of
temperature from 28° at 5   p.m. to 32° at 6 p.m., is not to be accounted
for by any visible change in the atmosphere, or by any alteration in
the motion of the air.   The advance was due to the intrusion at 6 P.M'.
of an invisible screen between the earth and firmament.
   As the night advanced, the serenity of the air, became, if possible,
more perfect, and the observations were continued with the following
results : —

   After this last observation, my notes contain the remark, "Atmo
sphere exquisitely clear. From zenith to horizon cloudless all round."
   Here, again, the difference of 4° between the temperature of the
 wool  at 8.30 p.m., and its temperature at 10.30 p.m., is not to be
referred to any sensible change in the condition of the atmosphere.
   The observations were continued on January 17th, 23rd, 24th, 25th,
and 30th    ; but    I will confine myself to the results obtained on the
evening of the day last mentioned.              The thermometers were ex
posed at 6.45 p.m.,     and  by  aid  of  a  lamp read off from time to time
afterwards.

   During these observations the atmosphere was very serene. There
was   no moon, but the firmament was powdered with stars.                  The
serenity, however, had been preceded by heavy rain, which doubtless
had left the atmosphere charged with aqueous vapour. The movement
of the air was from the south-west and light. Here again, with an
atmosphere at least as clear as that on December 10th, the difference
between air and wool did not amount to one-fourth of that observed
on the latter occasion.
   The results obtained on February 3rd were corroborative.                The
thermometers were exposed at 6.15         p.m.

   Here again, the difference between air and wool is only 4 degrees,
although the sky was cloudless, and the stars were bright. The
movement of the air was from the south-west and light.
   On the forenoon of this day there had been a heavy and persistent
rain storm.      Heavy rain and high wind also occurred on the night
following. The serene interval during which the observations were
made lay, therefore, between the two storms.          Doubtless the gap was
well filled with pure aqueous vapour.
   Further observations were made in considerable numbers, but they

need not here be dwelt upon, my object being to illustrate a principle
rather than to add to the multitudinous records of meteorology. It will
be sufficient to say, that with atmospheric        conditions sensibly alike,
the waste of heat from the earth varies from day to day ; a result due
to the action of a body which escapes the sense of vision. It is hardly
necessary    for me to repeat here my references to the observations
of Leslie,    Hennessey, and others, which revealed variations in the
earth's emission for which the observers could not account.             A close
inspection of the observations of the late Principal Forbes on the
Faulhorn, proves,      I  think, that the action of aqueous vapour came
there into play, and his detection of this action, while unacquainted
with its cause, is in my opinion a cogent proof of the accuracy of his
work as a meteorologist.
                                   Postscript.
   In the " Philosophical Transactions " for      1882, Part I,  p. 348, 1 refer
to certain experiments executed by Professor Soret of Geneva.                My
friend has recently drawn my attention to a communication made by
him to the French        Association for the Advancement of Science, in
1872.    It gives me great pleasure to cite here the conclusions at which
he has   arrived.
    " The influence of humidity is shown
                                               by the whole of the observa
tions ; and it may be stated generally, that, other circumstances being
equal, the greater the tension of aqueous vapour, the less intense is
the radiation.
    " In winter, when the air is drier, the radiation is much more
intense than in summer, for the same height of the sun above the
horizon.
    " On several occasions a more intense radiation has been observed
in dry than in humid weather, although the atmosphere was incon-
testably purer and more transparent in the second case than in the
first,
    " The maximum intensity of radiation, particularly in the summer,
 corresponds habitually to days exceptionally cold and dry."
    Such are the results of experiments, executed by a most excellent
 observer, on the radiation of the sun.        They apply word for word to
terrestrial radiation. They are, moreover, in complete harmony with
the results, published by General Strachey in the
                                                               "

Magazine"      for  1866.    Meteorologists  will  not, I trust,   be offended
with me if      I  say that from such outsiders, fresh to the work and
equipped    with    the necessary physical knowledge, they may expect
efficient aid towards introducing order and cansality among their
valuable observations.

I. " Some Experiments on Metallic Reflection. No. III. On the
       Amount of Light Reflected by Metallic Surfaces."                 By
       Sir John Conroy, Bart., M.A. Communicated by Pro
       fessor Stokes, Sec. R.S. Received November 1, 1882.
              I
    As far as am aware the only experiments that have been made on
the amount of radiant energy reflected by metallic surfaces at different
angles are those of Potter (" Edinburgh Journal," vol. iii, 278) and
 Jamin (" Ann. de Chim. et de Phys." [3}, xix, 296) for light, and for
radiant heat, those of Forbes (" Phil. Mag.," [3], viii, 246) and of
MM. De la Provostaye and Desains (" Ann. de Chim. et de Phys."
 [3], xxx, 276.
    Potter used a Bouguer's photometer ; the transparent screen being
 made of white paper, behind which two lamps were placed, the light
from one of which always fell directly upon one half of the screen,
 whilst that from the other either fell directly upon the screen, or after
 reflection from the metallic plate.     The observations were made by
 measuring the distance at which the first lamp had to be placed in
 order that both halves of the screen should appear equally bright.
    Tbe two illuminated portions of the screen were not actually in
 contact, being separated by a dark shadow, an arrangement which, to
 a certain extent at least, must have interfered with the accuracy of
 the determinations.     The mirror having been placed close to the
 lamp, the light     incident  upon its surface must have been very
 divergent, and as, in addition, the angle at which it was placed could
 not, owing to the construction of the apparatus, have been very
 accurately determined, the values of the angles of incidence can only
 be considered as approximations.
    In M. Jamin's experiments the reflecting surface was half glass
 and half metal, the line of separation being vertical, and the incident
 light polarised in a plane 45° to this direction ; the reflected light was
 examined with a double image prism which was rotated until one of
  the images due to the light reflected by the metal, and one of those

1883.]       Some Experiments       on   Metallic Reflection.                21
dne to the   light reflected by the glass appeared equally bright, i.e.,
till the ordinary image of the light reflected by one-half of the mirror
was eqnal to the extraordinary image of the light reflected by the
other half.
   The refractive index of the glass being known, the amount of light
reflected by it at any angle could be calculated by Fresnel's formulae,
and thus the percentage of light reflected by the metal determined.
   The numbers obtained by M. Jamin agree well with those deduced
by calculation from Cauchy's theory, and also with those experi
mentally determined      by MM. De la Provostaye and Desains, by
means of the thermopile.      Unfortunately, however, the experiments
on this point made by these two eminent French physicists were not
very numerous,    and the method used by     M. Jamin has been described
    M. Verdet (" Lecons d'Optique                        ii,       " Un
by                                          Physique,"    546) as
procede indirect qui n'est pas susceptible d'une grande perfection."
   Under these circumstances I   trust that some experiments which           I
have recently made on the subject may be thought worthy of pub
lication, although, owing mainly to the difficulties inseparable from
all photometric determinations, the observations are not as concordant
as could be wished.
   The method used was essentially that of Potter, the experiments
being made by comparing photometrically the amount            of light
reflected by a polished metallic surface at different angles with that
which fell directly on the photometer     when the reflecting surface was
removed.
   This method is, of coarse, only applicable to the white metals, and
in order to obtain anything like accurate results the mean of a con
siderable number of observations must be taken.
   Two similar paraffine lamps, with flat wicks, were used, one
arranged to slide along  a horizontal board about two metres long, to
which a scale divided into millimetres was attached, and the other
sapported by  a  metal ring fastened to one of the arms of a Babinefs
goniometer.
  An endless cord, which passed round a pulley with    handle at one
                                                               a
end of the board, enabled the first-mentioned lamp to be moved and
placed at different distances from the photometer.
     It
     was originally intended to use a Bunsen's disk, but     was found
                                                                   it
that owing to the small size of the beam of reflected light,   was not  it
possible to make satisfactory measurements with it, and after various
arrangements had been tried,   a modification of Ritchie's photometer
was finally adopted.  Two pieces of white paper were so placed that
whilst both were visible to the observer, one being slightly in front
of the other and overlapping    to a small extent, each received light
                               it
from one only of the lamps, and when equally illuminated the edge of
the front paper vanished.   Two triangular blocks of wood      centims.

high, were screwed to a rectangular board about 15 centims. by
10 centims., in the position shown in the figure, and pieces of white
paper, 3 centims. by 3 centims., held against the hypotenuse           of
each of these triangular prisms by india-rubber bands.        The whole
arrangement was enclosed in a box with three apertures, which was
painted, both internally and externally, a dead black, and was placed
at the end of the horizontal board.
   The light from the sliding lamp entered by the left-hand aperture,
whilst that which fell directly on the paper, or after reflection from
the metallic surface, entered to the right-hand one ; the third aperture
allowed the papers to be seen by the observer, who was at about
C decims. from it.
                             -\ tli the actual size.
   The goniometer was fixed on the other side of the photometer, with
its vertical axis in the prolongation of the median line of the board,
and had a vertical stage, to which the reflecting plate could be readily
fastened.    The second lamp, which, as before mentioned, was carried
by a plate attached to one of the arms of the goniometer, was always
placed with its flame edgewise, i.e., radially, and the beam of light
limited by means of a diaphragm with an aperture 25 millims. high
and 5 millims. wide, placed at a distance of 23 centims. from the
centre of the flame and between it and the axis of the instrument.
The sliding lamp was placed with the flat side of the flame towards the
photometer.
   The experiments were made by first tarning the goniometer until
the light fell on the paper of the photometer; the position of the
sliding lamp was then altered until both papers appeared equally illu
minated, and the distance of the lamp from the central line of the
photometer observed.     Four such observations were made, in the first
and   third the sliding lamp being placed too near the photometer and
the distance increased, and in the second and fourth the lamp placed
too far off and the distance diminished until the illumination of the
two papers becomes equal.

    The metal mirror was then clamped to the stage, which had pre
viously been carefully adjusted, in order that the surface of the mirror
might be vertical and in the axis of the instrument, and the wholo
instrument rotated on its outer axis until the reflected beam fell on
the photometer.     Four readings were then made, as has already been
described, the mirror removed, and four more readings made of the
intensity of the light emitted by the lamp ; the mirror replaced, the
angle of incidence altered, and four more readings made, and so on.
    It was found necessary to make the observations in this way, as
although the two lamps were trimmed as nearly as possible alike,
considerable fluctuations in their relative intensity not unfrequently
occurred, and in order to diminish as far as possible this source of
 error, the mean of eight observations, four before and four after the
 measurement of the intensity of the reflected light, was taken as the
 true intensity of the light incident upon the mirror.
    The metal surfaces used measured about 8 centims. by 5 centims.,
 were accurately plane, and had all been polished with putty powder, it
 having been previously ascertained (" Proc. Roy. Soc," vol. 31,
 p. 486) that the optical constants for metallic surfaces depend to a
certain extent upon the nature of the substance with which they have
been polished.
   Jt  had been originally intended to use light polarised in and per-
pendicularly to the plane of incidence, and to determine the ratio of the
reflected to the incident light in either case, but it was found im
 possible to make any satisfactory measurements, owing to the great loss
of light. The intensity of the light could have been somewhat in
creased   by the use of a larger Nicol, but it seemed so very doubtful
whether sufficient light would be thus obtained, that it was thought best
to abandon the use of polarised light.   Ordinary light being equivalent
to two beams of light of equal intensity polarised at right angles to
each other, if the total amount reflected at any angle, and the ratio of
the intensities of the light polarised in and perpendicularly to the
plane of incidence when light polarised at an angle of 45° with that
plane is incident upon the surface of the plate at the same angle, are
known, the reflective power of the plate for light polarised in and
perpendicularly to the plane of incidence can of course be readily
calculated.
   The table gives a series of measurements made with a silver plate.
The numbers in the first column are the distances in centimetres of
the sliding lamp from the photometer when the light of the other
lamp fell direct on the paper, and those in the third when the light
was reflected by the mirror.      The means of these observations are
contained in the second and fourth columns, the angles of incidence in
the fifth column, and the ratios of the reflected to the incident light,
the latter being taken as 100, in the sixth column.     As the intensity

   The principal incidences and azimuths for the four mirrors were
determined in the manner described in the paper on metallic reflection
which has already been referred to (" Proc. Boy. Soc," vol. 31,
p. 486), a soda flame being used as the source of light. Four observa
tions were made in each position of the retarding plate, two with the
principal section of the polarising Nicol on the right, and two with it
on the left of the plane of incidence.        The means of several sets of
eight observations each   are given  in  Table  V.

    The tables show that the amount of                                   light reflected increases with
the  angle of incidence.     In the case of speculum metal, however,
after first increasing, the amount of light appears to diminish slightly,
and after passing through a minimum at about 65° to increase again.
    Theseresults are not in accordance with the experiments of Potter
or of M. Jamin.    Potter found that the amount of light reflected dimi
nished as the angle of incidence increased, being a maximum for
perpendicular incidence ; a result that was confirmed by the experi
ments of M. Jamin, who showed that at angles greater than any at
which Potter had made observations, the amount of reflected light
increased       again.
  The values of the principal incidences and azimuths given in Table V
were used for calculating the amount of light which, according to
Cauchy's theory, should have been reflected by the plates.

ease   with the other three mirrors.         All four mirrors had appeared
perfectly    untarnished   and  bright   when   the observations were made,
but as the silver, steel, and tin mirrors had been polished some months
before they were used, it was thought possible that slight films might
have formed on their surfaces, and that the difference in the calculated
and observed results was due to this cause.              The silver mirror was
therefore returned to the maker, Mr. Hilger, to be repolished with
putty power.
   The amount of light reflected by it was determined the same day
that  it was received back, and it was found that its reflective power
was   slightly diminished for light incident upon its surface at angles
of 20°, 40°,   and 60°, and somewhat increased for light incident at
80°,  the number being —
                            20°                  68 -54

   These results agreeing fairly well with the means of the numerous
observations which had previously been made, it was not thought
necessary to make any further determinations,           as it was clear that the
difference   between the observed and calculated values could not be due
to a film on the surface of the mirror.
   The surface of the silver mirror not being very good, it was again
returned to the maker to be polished with rouge, that being stated to
 be the best material for polishing silver;          the result was not very
 satisfactory, as  the surface  appeared less good than before — that this
 was really the case was confirmed           by the reflective power of the
 mirror being diminished.

    These    numbers     do    not  agree   any better   than those previously
obtained, and it therefore seems necessary to assume that Cauchy's
formula (at least in their simplified form) do not express the facts of
the case, except, perhaps, for speculum metal.
    The values for the intensity of the light calculated by the formulae
given by Professor James MacCullagh (" Collected Works," p. 133)
decrease slowly up to a large angle of incidence, and then increase
again just as is the case with the similar formulae of Cauchy.
    Professor Stokes suggested that very probably the discrepancy
between the observed and calculated results was due to imperfect
polish, as the differences were greater with the soft metals, silver
and tin, to which it is more difficult to give a good polish than
for the hard metals, steel and speculum metal, and also as the
 observed intensities fell short of the calculated ones at moderate
incidences, whilst sometimes even exceeding them at high incidences,
for which deficiencies of illumination due to defects of polish might
possibly be expected to disappear.
    Professor Stokes also suggested a method for examining the polish
of the mirrors.
    In accordance with his suggestion a cylindrical tinned iron canister,
closed at one end, about 9 centims. in diameter and 27 centims. deep,
 was blackened internally and supported on a table at an angle of
 about 30° with the horizon, and with the lower edge of the open end
 about 4 centims. above the surface of the table, which was covered
 with a black cloth.
    The table was placed out of doors, so that there might be plenty of
 light coming from all round, and the metal plates laid on the black
cloth in front of the canister, so that an observer standing in front
 could see, by reflection, into the perfect darkness.          If the polish were
 perfect, the surface of the metal plate would appear perfectly black ;
 and if such should not be the case, the illumination of the plate would
 afford an estimate of the defect of polish.
    The reflection in the plate was examined through a small hole in a

 1883.|          Some Experiments on Metallic Reflection.                  37
 black screen, in order to prevent any     light diffused from the observer'-
face being reflected by the plate    into the canister, and thus destroying
its perfect blackness.
    Two of the plates were placed side by side and examined together,.
 and   in this way it was ascertained that their order of polish was,
steel, speculum metal, silver, and     tin ; there being but little differenc-
between the polish of the steel and the specnlum metal, and a con
siderable difference between the speculum metal and the silver, and
again between the      silver and the tin.
    The experiment was originally made with the silver mirror polished
with putty powder, and was repeated after it had been polished with
rouge   ; the order remained     the same, but     it was thought that ^here-
was a greater difference between the speculum metal and the silver in
the latter case.
    Professor Stokes also suggested that the surface of perfectly clean
mercury would       furnish a standard.        Some mercury was, therefore,
cleaned by being well shaken with ponnded sugar, and then filtered
three or four times through a cone of writing paper, with a small
aperture at the apex. A small porcelain basin was blackened both
internally and externally, and nearly filled with the clean mercury,
and the reflection of the canister in it and in the plates compared.
The reflection in the steel appeared quite- as black as that in the
mercury, whilst that in the speculum metal appeared slightly less
black. In a preliminary experiment            the steel was thought to be
blacker than the mercury ; the difference, if any, was, however, very
slight, and was probably due to a thin film having formed on the
surface of the mercury which, in that case, had only been cleaned by
filtration through paper.      The experiment was therefore repeated witli
mercury which had been cleaned as has already been described, but it was
still found that, as compared with the mercury, the polish of the steel
was sensibly perfect.         The difference between the calculated and
observed results for the steel at least cannot, therefore, be due to
imperfect polish, and the discrepancy            is almost too great to be
accounted for by errors of observation, especially as the intensities
actually observed increase with the incidence, whilst theoretically they
ought to diminish, and then increase again.
    The    experiments    show (unless there is some error due to the
method of observation,         and therefore common to all the deter
minations),    that the amount of light reflected by silver, steel, and tin
gradually increases with the angle of incidence ; that with speculum
metal after first increasing it diminishes slightly, and then increases
 again ; that the results obtained by the method described in this paper
 are not in accordance with the experiments of Potter and M. Jamin, or
 with the values calculated by the formulae of Cauchy and MacCullagh ;

 that with the silver and the tin mirrors the difference between theory
 and observation may be due to imperfect polish, but that such
 can hardly be the case with the steel.
    Under these circumstances it appears desirable that a fresh series of
 observations    should be made by some independent method, which
 would either confirm or disprove the results contained in this paper,
 and this I hope to attempt.
                       Received December 18, 1882.
    All previous    determinations     of the reflective power of metals
 having   been  made  in air, it appeared desirable to make some observa
 tions with the steel and speculum metal mirrors in water, the polish
of these mirrors being satisfactory.
    A  glass trough about 74G centims. square and 37 centims. deep, was
filled with distilled water and placed on the stage of the goniometer in
such a position that the light from the lamp passed normally through
two of its opposite sides, and then fell on the photometer.           The
distance of the sliding lamp was then altered till both papers appeared
equally illuminated ; four such readings were made, and then the
mirror, which had been previously adjusted, placed in the trough and
clamped at an angle of 45° with the incident light.
    The trough was then so adjusted that the incident and emergent
light passed normally through two of its adjacent sides, the gonio
meter turned until the light fell on the photometer, and the readings
made in the usual way.           The mirror was then removed and the
intensity of the light which passed through the trough again deter
mined.
    The partial reflections from the glass sides of the trough, and the
length of the path of the light in the water (the reflecting surface
coinciding with the diagonal of the trough), being the same in both
cases, the difference in the intensity of the light could only be due to
the loss caused by reflection.
    The light not being parallel, but forming a slightly divergent beam,
the effect of introducing the trough of water between the source and
the photometer was equivalent, in an optical sense, to slightly re
ducing the distance between them ; it was therefore necessary that
the light when falling directly on the photometer, and when doing so
after reflection, should have traversed in both cases an equal thickness
of water.     This condition prevented observations being made at angles
other than 45°.
    The results of four observations with the speculum metal, and three
with the steel mirrors, show that, as might have been anticipated, the
percentage of light reflected was less than when the mirrors were in
air ; the numbers are —

   The differences between the results of theory and observation as to
the  intensity of reflected light are in several of the above experiments
so  considerable,     that we are led to ask whether there may not be some
thing   in the   experiments to which it may be referred.
   A slight inaccuracy in the calculated numbers is produced by the
neglect of the polarisation due to oblique reflection from the paper
employed. "With glazed paper this might be considerable ; but naturally
a paper would be selected with as dull a surface as possible, and the
author assures me that the polarisation was only just perceptible.                  It
could be easily allowed for by measuring the amount of polarisation
produced by the oblique reflection.             When light of given intensity
polarised    first in  and  then  perpendicularly to the plane of incidence is
incident obliquely on the paper, let the intensities of the reflected

 light be   as r to 1. Then it will be easily seen that the theoretical
 intensity for common light reflected first from the metal, and then
from the paper, as determined by the method of the paper, will be
 (rj2 + P)/(r + 1) instead of £ (J2 +I2). The former exceeds the latter
by-

                                  2(r+l)
which is positive, since r is a little greater than 1, and J2 is greater
than I3.    This excess is very small, but as far as it goes it tends rather
to increase, on the whole, the difference between theory and observa
tion, since the observed intensity nearly always falls short of the
calculated.
    The imperfection of the polish in the case of such soft metals as
silver and tin has, doubtless, much to do with it. But the polish of
the steel seems to have been practically perfect, and yet this metal
showed discrepancies, though not so great.
        I
    But think there are strong reasons for believing that the ordinarily
received formulae for metals can only give a more or less approximat-
result.
    MacCulIagh was the first to show that by substituting for the
 refractive index in Fresuel's formulae a complex imaginary, and then
interpreting the formulae as Fresuel has done in a somewhat analo
gous case, results were obtained agreeing, at any rate approximately,
with those deduced from observation.             Cauchy afterwards gave
 formulae substantially the same, as they differ only in algebraic
development, but made an important advance in the physical theory
by connecting the coefficient of •/ — 1 in the complex imaginary with
an intense absorbing action of the medium.
    But metals are not the only bodies to which the formulae of
 Fresuel do not apply. More 4than fifty years ago Sir George Airy
 showed that in the case of diamond a considerable quantity of light
 polarised perpendicularly to the plane of incidence was reflected at
 the angle which made the nearest approach to a polarising angle ; and
 that on increasing the angle of incidence through the angle of
 maximum polarisation there was a rapid retardation of phase.
 Similar phenomena were afterwards observed in other transparent
 substances of high refractive index, and more recently M. Jamin has
  observed them in transparent        substances in general with a few
 exceptions.
    The effect increases on the whole with the refractive index of th-
 substance, but not in such a manner as to allow us to suppose that it
 is a function of the refractive index.      Hence two independent con
 stants are required to define for a given kind of homogeneous light
 the optical character of a transparent substance.

   The adamantine property of a substance, as for the sake of a name
it may be called, increasing on the whole with the index, and conse
quently on the whole with the density, there can be little doubt that
if metals, retaining their actual density, were transparent like diamond,
they would exhibit this property in a greatly exalted degree.      On the
other hand, the metallic properties    connected with intense absorption
are   exhibited by many non-metallic substances, such for example as
the colouring matters derived from aniline.         Hence we have very
strong reason for believing that there are two distinct and ind-pendent
properties in a metal by virtue of either of which, if it stood alone,
there would be a change of phase and persistence of intensity for light
polarised perpendicularly to the plane of incidence as the angle of
incidence was increased.      The changes due to these two would not
follow the same laws as regards their dependence on the angle of
incidence.    The coefficients expressing these two properties, together
with what answers to the index of a transparent substance, make
three physical constants which are required to define a metal optically,.
even in relation to homogeneous light.
   If we confine our attention to an experimental determination of
the difference of phase and ratio of intensity for light polarised in and
perpendicularly to the plane of incidence, and   if, neglecting altogether
the adamantine      property, we determine the two constants in the
ordinary formulae for metallic reflection so as to make them agree
with observation in two cases, suppose by giving a difference of phase
of 90° for an observed angle, and an observed ratio of intensities at
that angle, i8 may be readily imagined that the ordinary formulae may
be to a certain extent formulae of interpolation, giving the differenc-
of  phases and ratio of intensities for other angles of incidence without
any very material error ;    and yet when we come to a totally different
kind of observation, such as that of determining the ratio of the
intensity of incident to that of reflected light, that the formulae may
 be found to be very distinctly in error.     Hence observations of this
 latter class seem deserving of more attention than have lately been
 bestowed upon them, lest from too great reliance on the accordance
 between theory and observation as regards the difference of phase and
 ratio of intensities when we compare light polarised in and per
 pendicularly to the plane of incidence, we should be led unduly to
 trust the formulae, for giving correctly the ratio of intensities for
 incident and reflected light. — G.G.S.

         vatory, Richmond, for the Examination of the Dark Glasses
         and Mirrors of Sextants." By G. M. Whipple, B.Sc,
         Superintendent. Communicated by Warren De La Rue,
         Esq., Vice-Chairman of the Kew Committee.              Received
         February G, 1883.
      In the " Proc. Roy. Soc," vol. 16, p, 2, Professor Balfour Stewart
described     an apparatus designed and constructed by Mr. T. Cooke
 for the determination of the errors of graduation of sextants.
 This instrument has from that date been constantly in use at the
 Kew Observatory, and since the introduction of certain unimportant
 improvements, has been found to work very well.
     No provision was made, however, for its employment in the deter
 mination of the errors of the dark shades used to screen the observer's
•eyes when the sextant is directed to the sun or moon, and it has been
 found that errors may exist in the shape of want of parallelism in
 these glasses, sufficiently large to seriously affect an observation,
 accurate in other respects.
     It has also been found that sextant makers are desirous of having
the shades examined before proceeding to fit them into their metal
mountings, and also to have the surfaces of the mirrors tested for
 distortion before making the instruments up. With a view to the
accomplishment of these ends, for some time past the Kew Com
mittee have undertaken to examine both dark glasses and mirrors-
and to mark them with a hall-mark, when they are found to answer
the requirements necessary for exactitude.
     For these purposes the apparatus now described has been devised by
the author, and brought into use at the Observatory.
     It is represented in the annexed cut.

that their axes may be in the same horizontal plane. The eye-piece
of the telescope, E, carries a parallel wire micrometer, F. Gr is the
dark glass to be examined, and H is another glass of the same tint.
    In order to adjust the instrument, the telescope, A, is directed to
the sun, a shade being fitted to the eye-piece, and then placed in its
Y's focussed for parallel rays. The collimators, B and C, are then
fixed on their table with their object-glasses opposed to that of the
telescope,     A, the eye-pieces and wires having first been removed,
and a metal plate with a sharply cat hole in its centre, fitted to their
diaphragms.
    Light is next reflected down the collimator by the mirror D, and
the aperture in the diaphragm, being viewed through the telescope A,
is carefully focussed by moving the object-glass of the collimator to
and fro, by means of it3 rack and pinion .
    The diaphragm aperture is next collimated by rotating the collimator
 in its bearings.
    Both collimators being thus adjusted they are placed side by side,
so that their illuminated sights can be viewed simulfcane ously in the
telescope, appearing as superimposed bright disks 12' in diameter.
 They are next separated so that the disks remain merely in contact at
the extremity of their horizontal diameters.
    The instrument is now ready for use, and the examination of the
shades is performed in the following manner.
     The glass to be tested is fixed in a holder, in front of the
object-glass of collimator B, a corresponding shade being placed
 between the heliostat and diaphragm of collimator C. The sun is
 directed on to the diaphragms.             The coloured       disks are viewed
through the telescope, when if the sides of the shade G are per
 fectly parallel the relative position of the disks is unchanged,        if, how
ever, the shade            not ground true, the disks will appear either

separated     or to  overlap.    In the first case, the amount of separation
is measured by the micrometer,                 F,and serves to indicate the
quality    of  the  glass.    In the  case of overlapping images the shade is
 rotated through 180°, and separation produced which can be measured.
 A second examination            then made the shade having been turned

III. "On         the Atomic       Weight of Manganese."                By James
       Dewar,      M.A., F.R.S., Jacksonian Professor, Cambridge,
       and Alexander Scott, M.A.                 Received February 9, 1883.
   Our attention has been directed for some time to a new determina
tion of the atomic weight of manganese.              This communication gives
a succinct account of the results of the preliminary stages of such
an inquiry, and although the further progress of the investigation
may reveal some errors, still we feel convinced the final numbers can
in no way differ materially from the present values, and therefore
further delay in publication is unnecessary.
    The atomic weight of manganese has been determined by many
chemists,* but the resulting values vary considerably according to the
special method selected.           The results of the different investigators
may     be   divided  into    two   classes — those giving approximately 55
as the number,         and those making it about 54.               To the former
class belong Turner, Berzelius, and Dumas, all of whom use the
same method, viz., the determination of the silver chloride yielded
by a weighed amount of chloride of manganese. Turner also made
determinations from the analysis of the carbonate, and from the con
version of the monoxide into sulphate. Von Hauer used the same
method as that employed by him in the determination of the atomic
weight of cadmium, viz., the reduction of manganous sulphate to
sulphide by ignition in a current of sulphuretted hydrogen. It is
probable that this method is not very trustworthy, as, according
to Schneider, the sulphide may be contaminated                   by oxysulphide.
 Schneider and Rawack belong to the second class of observers, the
 former employing the oxalate, and from its analysis calculating the
 atomic weight by deducting the weight of water and carbon dioxide
obtained.      Rawack, whose experiments were conducted in Schneider's
laboratory, weighed the water obtained by reducing manganoso-
 manganic oxide to manganous oxide.
     One objection to the analysis of the chloride is that          it may contain
 besides manganous         chloride varying      proportions of manganic       salt.

This must        be the case          if,
                               Forchammer maintains, pure manganous
                                            as
salts are colourless, the pink colour    of manganese salts being due to
 traces of     manganic compound.
                 a                     Forchammer has observed that on
 fusing manganese sulphate with potassium hydrogen sulphate, a white
 mass  is  obtained which gives a colourless solution. We have been
 unable to prepare any chloride or bromide without a pink or rose
colour giving       correspondingly coloured solution, and this was also
                          a
 the case with specimens fused in hydrogen and hydrochloric acid gas.
 The effect of a trace of manganic salt in the chloride would be to
lower the atomic weight. The chloride and bromide of manganese
are both not only very hygroscopic, but        fused in hydrochloric acid
                                                                       if
gas (or hydrobromic acid in the case of the bromide) are liable to
retain traces of the halogen acids, and this would consequently make
 the atomic weight too low.
    In order to ascertain the values of the atomic weight of manganese
which result from careful analysis of the halogen salts, determina
tions were made of the molecular weights of chloride and bromide on
specimens     prepared with great care.      The number found for the
bromide was 214-87, and for the chloride 125-825, yielding the
respective atomic weights of manganese of 54V97 and 54*91 . All
researches on the oxides of manganese have shown that they are all
difficult to obtain in anything like a definite form, with perhaps the
exception of the protoxide.
   It occurred to us that the analysis of silver permanganate might be
employed with advantage, as this salt       found in a very definite state,
                                                                  is
and can be easily freed from all the allied metals.      The selection of
this substance, moreover, involved only the      atomic weights of silver
and oxygen, and as         seemed feasible to deduce the atomic weight
                                 it
of the manganese directly from the percentage loss of oxygen on
heating, we expected to get very accurate results.      In this we were
disappointed, as we have not been able to obtain concordant results
by   this most direct method.

46                      Prof.  J. Dewar and A. Scott.              [Feb. 15,
    Table   I  gives the results of the direct determination of the
equivalent of the permanganate of silver by reduction in hydrogen.
    The silver permanganate was heated in a bulb of hard glass, first
in a current of pure air and then in hydrogen, at a red heat, until the
resulting mixture of silver and oxide of manganese had a constant
weight. The residue was allowed to cool in hydrogen, which was
finally displaced by nitrogen before weighing. The results obtained
by this method show great variation, the errors being probably
due to the occlusion of hydrogen and the suspension                  of some
oxide of manganese in the oxygen evolved.                The method finally
employed      was to  dissolve the  permanganate   of silver in dilute nitric
acid in presence of various reducing agents, such as sulphurous acid,
 sodium formate, and potassium nitrite.          The silver was then deter
 mined by adding very nearly an equivalent quantity of pure
 potassium bromide, and titrating the small amount of silver remain
 ing in solution, by means of very dilute potassium bromide, contain
 ing about 1*19 mgrms. of the pure salt per gramme of solution.
 The solutions were in all cases weighed, thus avoiding errors due to
 fluid expansion, fanlty graduation of burettes, &c. The titrations
 were performed in yellow light in an apparatus similar to that used
 by Stas, and with all the precautions insisted on by him as essential
 to the accuracy     of such determinations.
     The permanganate of silver crystallises readily from warm water,
 and is a very stable salt.       It is also quite anhydrous and not in the
 slightest degree hygroscopic. From its small solubility it is easily
 freed from adhering impurities by recrystallisation.          The purity of
 the salt was tested by reducing about 5 grms. by means of alcohol and
 filtering, when the total residue only weighed 1"9 mgrms.               This
 residue when tested with the spectroscope was found to consist almost
  entirely of calcium salts from an accidental impurity in the distilled
  water, only the faintest trace of potassium being detected. The sample
  which was tested in this way had only been recrystallised once after
  precipitation. The salt was usually prepared by the precipitation of
  silver nitrate by means of an equivalent quantity of potassium per
  manganate, the solutions being warm, and the silver permanganate thus
  obtained in fine needles, was easily drained, washed, and recrystallised.
  A quantity of the salt was also prepared from crystallised barium
  permanganate, which was made from barium chloride and silver per
  manganate, the barium salt being afterwards decomposed with pure
  silver sulphate.     This method of preparing the permanganate of silver
  ensures the absence of any trace of silver nitrate, which as Stas has
  shown adheres most persistently to many silver salts.
     Permanganate of silver has several veiy important advantages over
  the other bodies previously used for the determination of the atomic
  weight of manganese.         Its freedom from hygroscopic properties and

the improbability   of its containing excess of any of the elements of
 which it is composed beyond what is necessary for the formation of
 the normal compound,      recommend     it especially for this purpose.
Another point which rendered its selection important was to ascertain
if a body liable to partial decomposition under certain circumstances
could give concordant results in atomic weight determinations, thus
putting to a crucial test the amount of variation in the values which
may be attributed to secondary causes.
   Table             II
             gives the results of the titrations. The use of sulphurous
acid as the reducing agent was found unsatisfactory, as a slight
residue having the appearance of sulphide was almost always left
undissolved.     The production of sulphate was also more or less
troublesome from its insolubility.

   Experiments (6) and (7) were made with a sample obtained from
the barium salt, and these results are slightly higher owing to the
presence of a small trace of barium sulphate easily recognisable by
the slight turbidity of the reduced solution.        We had hoped by the
use of    larger quantity
              a             of material   to arrive  at results comparable
in  some degree at least with those of Stas         but we found the pre                        ;
paration  of considerable   quantities of  material  of absolute purity fre
quently involves sources of error not incurred in the production of
smaller quantities.   This we observed especially in the preparation of
onr pure potassium bromide, which contained traces of sulphates in
every sample.    This sulphate      due to the use of ordinary gas in the

ignition of the pure bitartrate of potash from which the bromide of
potassium was made.       In order to get a pure product gas must be
replaced by powerful name of alcohol, or all the operations conducted

    I. " The Effects of Temperature on the Electromotive Force
       and Resistance of Batteries."           By William Henry Preece.
       F.R.S., Received February 8, 1883.
    It is well known that heat influences the conditions of galvanic
.elements so as to vary the strength of the currents generated by them
 in those parts of the circuits connecting their poles.
    In 1840 De la Rive* found that the action of a galvanic pair was
 accelerated when it was put into hot fluid instead of cold fluid, and he
 attributed the result to increased chemical affinity.
    Faradayt repeated De la Rive's experiment, but he, on the other
 hand, attributed the result to improved conductivity in the liquid,
 and he showed that the effect was not due cither to motion, to
 chemical    action, or to thermo-electric action, or indeed to any
 increase in the electromotive force.
    Daniell,J also, found an increased current due to increased tempera
 ture.   According to him, one of his elements was nearly trebled in
 strength when raised to 212° F.            He attributed the effect to the
 increased energy of the affinity.        Said he, " Changes of temperature
 even have a marked influence upon the working of the voltaic battery,
and must not be neglected in nice comparative experiments."
    J. B. Cooke§ made careful observations on the chemical affinity in a

galvanic cell, and indicated the error due to changes of temperature,
but he remarked,
                       " These affinities do not appear to be affected by any
changes of temperature between ranges of 50° and 212° F."
   Crova investigated the effects of heat on the electromotive force
alone, and he showed (1) that the electromotive force of a Daniell's
element decreases       regularly with an increase of temperature ; (2) that
the electromotive       force of a Grove's element increases with tempera
ture ; (3) that the electromotive force of a single-fluid element of the
Smee type is independent of the variation of temperature.
   In 1862 Mr. James Dixon took advantage of the influence of heat
to take out a patent for hot batteries, and he suggested the employ
ment of these batteries for the production of the electric light.
   In the same year (1862) Lindig* indicated a variation with
changes of temperature.
   In 1870 Bleekrodef made some further experiments in the same
direction.
   In 1872    Mr. Latimer ClarkJ showed that the electromotive                 force
of his standard cell varied inversely with temperature                about -06 per
cent- for each degree Centigrade.
   In  1881    Herwig§ investigated the subject carefully, and showed
that   polarisation diminishes with temperature.                    He found that
resistance    decreased markedly with temperature, and that this was
more    evident with small electromotive forces than with powerful
electromotive forces.
   In  1878   the author|| in investigating the peculiar action of Byrne's
pneumatic battery, showed that its exceptional power was due to an
abnormal formation of heat in its interior, and that this acted,
principally, in reducing the internal resistance.
   As bearing indirectly also upon this question it should be noted that
Becquerel,      Paalzow, and Kohlrausch and Nippoldt examined the
influence of heat upon the resistance of electrolytes, and showed that
it invariably diminished as the temperature rose.                   This was deter
 mined by them for various solutions.
   Now it is to be observed that in all these enquiries no one has
quantitatively separated the influence of temperature upon electro
motive force from its influence upon internal resistance.                It is quite
evident, from an examination of Ohm's law, that the variation in the
strength of current can be the result either of a variation in the
electromotive force alone or in a variation of the resistance alone, or
in an unequal variation of both together.                   The numerous discre-

50          Mr. W. H. Preece.         Effects   of Temperature   on    [Feb. 22,
pancies that have appeared in the measurements of the behaviour of
the Daniell's cell, as well as the erratic performance of hatteries
used   for telegraphic purposes in various exposed positions, have long
attracted the attention of the author to the necessity of a more careful
enquiry into this matter than has been made hitherto. In fact, all the
 observations that have hitherto been made are positively useless, from
the simple fact that no record has been kept of the independent
variations of the internal resistance and the electromotive force in
any measurable or comparable manner.
   Special apparatus was made, and the following method of experi
 menting was decided upon.
   The cell to be experimented upon was placed inside a cylindrical
copper vessel about 10 inches high and abont 8 inches diameter;
 water was poured into the vessel to within an inch of the top of the
cell, and the lid of the vessel was put on.
   This lid had four holes, two (insulated from the rest of the vessel)
to receive the electrodes of the cell, and the other two to allow ther
mometers to be plunged into the liquid or liquids in the cell without
removing the cover or lid. The water in the vessel and the cell in
the water were then heated by means of a gas-burner placed under
neath the vessel, and the electromotive force and the resistance of the
cell were determined at various stages of the heating ; while the
temperature of the cell was observed at the time of each experiment,
the liquid or liquids in the cell were stirred up from time to time so
as to obtain, as far as possible, the true temperature of the cell.
   The cells experimented upon were the Daniell, bichromate, and
Leclanche ; those in general use, especially for telegraph purposes.
   The Daniell cell consists of a porous pot, containing a solution of
copper sulphate, and placed in a stoneware vessel, containing a
solution of zinc sulphate.       In the porous pot is immersed a copper
plate, bent  so as  to  form   a  hollow cylinder, to which is soldered a
copper wire, which constitutes one pole of the cell.           A zinc plate,
also bent into a cylindrical form, is placed iu the outer cell, and has a
copper wire soldered to    it,constituting the other pole of the cell. The
zinc    not amalgamated.

   Two forms of the bichromate cell were experimented on, the one
being that known as Fuller's bichromate cell, and the other that
known as single-fluid bichromate cell. The double-fluid cell (Fuller's)
consists of a stoneware jar of a quart size. Inside this             placed a
                                                                      is

well amalgamated     ; and the plate      issurmounted by     a terminal.    In
the outer jar   isplaced 3  ozs.  of  bichromate of potassium and       ozs. of
                                                                           4

  are then filled up to within 2 inches of the top with a weak acid
  solution (one part of sulphuric acid to nine parts of water).
     The single-fluid        bichromate     cell is no more than the cell jnst
 described, in which are placed nothing but a rod of amalgamated zinc
 and a plate of carbon, each forming a pole of the cell.
     The Leclanche cell is made thus : — Into a glass jar a solution of the
 ordinary commercial sal-ammoniac is poured.                  A zinc rod or plate
 into which a connecting              tinned iron wire has been cast, is then
 placed   in  the  solution,    and   a plate of carbon surrounded by a mixture
 of broken gas-carbon or coke and peroxide of manganese, is fixed
 in a small porous pot at the top of the jar.                To make an attach
 ment for the terminal, the top of the carbon plate is capped with lead,
 which makes good contact with the carbon and is not liable to bo
attacked by ammonia.              The carbon plate is then dipped in melted
 paraffin,  to  fill up   its  pores and to check the ascension of the liquid
 by capillary action.         Lastly, the wire, the top of the zinc rod, and the
 lead cap of the carbon plate are covered with pitch, ozokerit, marine
glue, or some other compound to protect them from local action.
    The results of the experiments are given in the tables below, in
which the electromotive             force (e) is given in terms of that of a
Daniell cell (a standard cell) in good order and at about 14° C, and
the resistanc- is given in B.A. units. The experiments were conducted
for me by Mr. R. Shida with great care and patience.                Of the Tables
I, II, and     III,  which contain the results of the experiments on the
Daniell cell, the first two tables refer to the case where the solution of
copper sulphate was saturated at all temperatures (that is to say, the
crystals of copper sulphate were always present in the solution) and
the solution of zinc sulphate was kept the same, or nearly the same, in
strength (that is, the solution was saturated at about 14° C.) ; Table           III
refers to the case where both copper sulphate and zinc sulphate solutions
were kept unaltered or nearly so in strength during the experiment
(that is to say, they were both saturated at about 10° C).                 Table IV
contains the      results   for the  double-fluid  bichromate  ; Table V   those for
the single-fluid bichromate ; and Table VI those for the Leclanche.
                          (I.) The Electromotive Force.
    (a.) The    Daniell Cell. — Tables I, II, and III show that,        as the cell
was heated up from a comparatively low temperature to a higher and
higher temperature, the electromotive force of the Daniell cell de
creased rather abruptly at first, but more gradually afterwards, until,
at a certain temperature         it began to increase and continued to do     so till
the temperature       attained     that of the boiling point of water    ;  but that
(which is rather singular) the electromotive force remained unaltered,
or nearly so, while the cell was being cooled down from 100° C. to a
lower and lower temperature.               These pecnliar results (together with
                                                                      E 2

52        Mr. W. H. Preece.       Effects of Temperature   on   [Feb.  22.
the fact that whereas the temperature of the zinc cell rose faster than
that of the copper cell while being heated up, the former cooled faster
than the latter while cooled down from a high temperature [say
100°   C.]), tend to indicate that the diminution in the electromotive
force of the cell at the beginning of the experiment was greatly, if not
chiefly, due to the thermo-electric action which must have been set up
in the circuit.
    (b.) The Bichromate* Cell. It will be seen from the Tables IV and
                               —
V that the electromotive force of the bichromate (both the double-
fluid and the single-fluid cell), diminished regularly when the tempe
rature was made higher and higher, and increased regularly when
the temperature was made lower and lower. The regular diminution
by rise and regular augmentation by fall of temperature of the electro
motive force (at least when the range of temperature was between
0° C. and 100° C), was very much greater in the case of the single-
fluid bichromate than in the case of the double-fluid bichromate. In
the case of the first,8the electromotive force at 100° C. was as much
as about 6 per cent- lower than that at about 14° C. ; whereas in the
case of the second, the electromotive force at 100° C. was only about
l46 per cent- lower than at 19° C.
    (c.) The Leclanche Cell. — The Table VI shows that the electro
motive force of the Leclanche varied, when the temperature was varied,
so slightly, if at all, that it was difficult to observe the variation by
the method used.
                     (II.) The Internal Resistance.
   The results obtained for the resistances of the various kinds of cells
are more striking and more interesting than those for the electro
motive force, as willj be quite evident from the tables.        They will,
however, be understood more readily from the graphical representa
tions of the results by means of curves (in the Diagrams I, II, and
III) in which the abscissa; 4are proportional to the resistances in B.A.
 units, and the ordinates to the temperatures in degrees Centigrade.
                           —
    (a.) The Baniell Cell. The curves in the Diagram       I represent the
results for the Daniell, the curve ABCDE corresponding to the case
 (Table II) in which the copper sulphate solution was kept saturated
 at all temperatures, while the zinc sulphate solution was kept constant
 in strength, and the curve abede corresponding to the case (Table III)
 in which both solutions were- kept unaltered in strength during the
 experiments.    The directions of the arrows indicate the order of the
 experiments.     For instance, in the curve ABCDE the portion AB
represents the result obtained while the cell was being heated up from
about 11° C. to nearly the boiling point of water, the portion BC that
obtained while the cell thus heated up was being cooled down
from 100° C. to about 12° C. ; and, lastly, the portion DE that

obtained in cooling the cell from 12° C. to nearly so low a tempera
ture as the freezing point of water.        A very similar explanation
applies to the curve abcde.
   The results thus laid down by means of the curves       ABCDE    and
abcde present many points of interest.     These curves clearly show : —
   1°. That when a Daniell cell is heated from a low temperature, say
0° C., up to a high temperature, say 100° C., the resistance of the
cell decreases rather abruptly at first, but more gradually afterwards,
falling from 2'12 to 0-66 ohm, or more than one-third.
   2°. That when the cell thus heated up is cooled down, the resistance

54        Mr. W. H. Preece.       Effects  of Temperature   on   [Feb. 22,
increases, but increases at a greater rate than it decreased while being
heated ; in other words, the resistance of a Daniell cell at any tempe
rature (at least between 0° C. and 100° C.) is smaller before it is
heated    up to a high temperature than afterwards, provided the
heating and cooling be done not very slowly.
   3°. That if the cell thus cooled down be left undisturbed at a certain
temperature, the resistance of the cell gets less and less, till, at last, at
the end of a certain period (which will be from about 40 to 50 hours),
it gets down to the value which it had before being heated up at all.
   4°. And, lastly, that the resistance of a Daniell cell is considerably
less when the solution of the copper sulphate is more concentrated
than when it is less concentrated, at any temperature,          and under
otherwise exactly similar circumstances.
   (b.) The Bichromate Cell.
                               — The results for the bichromate are not
quite so remarkable, nor are they so interesting as those for the
Daniell cell, as will be seen on comparing the curves in the Diagram I
with those' in the Diagram II, but the fall of resistance                  is
nevertheless very striking.     In the case of the double-fluid bichromate
the curve HK of resistance obtained while the cell was being
heated up, differs so slightly from the curve KL obtained while
it was being cooled down, that the one is hardly distinguishable from
the other.    The differences in fact may be attributed more to errors
of observation than to anything else. Yet, if there should be any
difference in the resistance in the two cases, it is one opposite in
character to that found in the case of the Daniell cell.
   The probability of the existence of this difference, as indicated by
the curve HKL, is supported by the results shown by means of the
curve hlk, for the single-fluid bichromate cell.      Every point of the
portion   hk of the curve   obtained  while  heating the  cell up, lies con
siderably higher than the corresponding point in the portion kl
obtained while cooling it down ; that is to say, the resistance of the
single-fluid bichromate cell at any temperature is greater before than
after it has been heated up.
                             —
    (c.) The Leclanche' Cell. Very little remains to be said of the
curve PQR in the Diagram III, which represents the results for
the Leclanche cell.    The general character of the curve PQR bears a
strong resemblance to the curve HKL ; in other words, the resistance
of the Leclanche diminishes with the rise and increases with the fall
of temperature at nearly the same rate as the resistance of the double-
fluid bichromate cell does.    And, moreover, it is a matter of difficulty
to say with certainty, in the case of the Leclanche as in the case of
the double-fluid bichromate, whether or not the curve of resistance
obtained while being heated up coincides with the curve of resistance
obtained while being cooled down, because the part RQ is so nearly
coincident with the part PQ of the curve PQR, that any slight errors

                         may have caused the     non- coincidence   between
in tho observations
the two parts.
   It follows from     these experiments that changes of temperature do
not practically     affect electromotive forces, but that they materially
affect the internal resistances, of cells.   Faraday's observation is fully
confirmed, while Daniell's mistake is easily understood      if he employed,
as he probably did, a galvanometer of low resistance.
   It  also follows that of the various forms of batteries in practical
use the Daniell is most seriously influenced by variations in tempera
ture, and that in all experiments with that battery, either the tempe
rature must be kept constant, or frequent measurements should be
taken of its internal resistance and allowance made for the variation.

                     Received February 20, 1883.
   Note. — The method adopted to measure the electromotive force and
the resistance of the different cells was very simple, and, as it is
believed   to be very accurate and free from any of the disturbing
influences due to polarisation, a description of it may be useful.
   The charge or discharge of a small condenser through a galvano
meter of comparatively low resistance      is an accurate  measure of the
electromotive force present, for the current is practically instantaneous,
-nd therefore the whole quantity present acts as a balista upon the
needle.
   In the figure C is a condenser of -3-microfarad capacity, G a sensi
tive reflecting galvanometer, b the cell to be measured, r a shunt of
small resistance, and Kj and K2 simple keys.
   The condenser is first charged with a standard Dauiell cell and the
charge deflection (D) noted. The standard cell is then replaced by the
cell b to be examined, and the charge deflection (d) produced by it
noted.    The key K2 is then depressed (Kj, which had been previously
depressed to charge the condenser, being still held down), and the
cell is thus shunted through r. The electromotive force affecting the
condenser is thus reduced and a discharge (d1) is noted — the deflection
being in the reverse direction.
   Now if b be the resistance of the cell under test, then
   This particular mode of measuring was devised by Mr. H. R.
Kempe and modified by Mr. Muuro.           Condensers are much used in
telegraphy for measuring electromotive           forces.   [Vide Kempe's

II. " Preliminary   Note on the Action of Calcium, Barium, and

       F.R.S., and Theodore Cash, M.D. Received February 13,

  It has   been shown by Ringer that calcium prolongs the contraction
of the frog's heart.   This prolongation is diminished by the subse
quent addition of potash.
   It occurred to us that calcium and potassium salts might exercise a
similar action on voluntary mnscle. On trying         it,
                                                      we found this to be
the case.   Calcium in dilute solution prolongs the duration of the
contraction in the gastrocnemius of the frog.     Potassium salts subse
quently applied  shorten  the contraction.   We  have  been led to try the
effect of barium on muscle by considerations regarding the relations of
groups of elements, according to Mendelejeff's classification, to their
physiological action.    These considerations we purpose to develop in
another paper. The effect of barium        very remarkable.
                                           is                 It produces
a curve very much like that caused by veratria, both in its form and
in the modifications produced in      itby repeated stimuli. We have
found that the veratria curve    is restored by potash to the normal in
the case of the gastrocnemius, just as Ringer found         itin the case
of the frog's heart. The peculiarity which barium produces in the
gastrocnemius   isalso abolished by potash.    We have tested    anumber
of other substances belonging to allied groups, and find that some of
them have a similar, though not identical, action with barium. The
 re-ults of these experiments, as well as the general considerations to
 which we have already alluded, we purpose to discuss in another
paper.
III.   " On the Formation of Uric Acid in the Animal Economy
       and its relation to Hippuric Acid." By Al4red Baring.
       Garrod, M.D., F.R.S. Received February 15, 1883.

  The results which have been arrived at, and discussed in this com
munication, may be summed up as follows —         :
  Introduction. — The solubility of uric acid and of some of its more
important salts at the temperature of the healthy human body has
been determined and arranged in a tabular form. These figures may
be useful for future reference.
  The action of urates of ammonium and sodium upon chlorides and
phosphates of the same bases, when mixed with each other in different
proportions, has been ascertained.

(54                           Dr. A. B. Gan-od.                   [Feb.  22.
   Part I. — The results of many fresh observations,       which have been
made on the composition of the urinary excretion           in several of the
lower animals, are given.
   The physical and microscopic characters of the semi-solid urines of
birds and reptiles and invertobrata have been investigated at length,
and it is shown that the urate is always in the form of spherule
aggregates, made up of a great number of smaller spherules ; that
each of these is united with or contained in a cell of colloid matter,
and that when treated with water and weak carbonated alkaline
solutions, this solid urine swells up to very many times its original
bulk.
    The results of an investigation into the chemical composition of
such urates are stated in a tabular form.
   An examination of the blood of man and many mammals and birds
and reptiles, especially in relation to uric acid, has been made, and the
results are given.
    Part  II. — The  different views as to the origin of uric acid in the
animal body are discussed, and an endeavour is made to explain the
various apparent difficulties of the subject.      The following points are
especially   dwelt  upon  : —
    (a.) The   very varying amounts of uric acid thrown out by different
animals in relation to their total nitrogenised elimination.
    (6.) The excessively large excretion of uric acid by a great number
of the lower animals, as birds, reptiles, and invertebrate animals,
compared with the weight of their bodies.            Under this head it is
shown that whereas man excretes, on an average, t jo'o0ttth part of
his weight of uric acid per diem, a bird often excretes as much as
x^oth part of its weight during the same period ; in other words, a
bird throws out from its kidneys during a given time a thousand
times more uric acid than a man.
    The effect of uric acid and its salts upon the urinary excretion, when
introduced into the animal economy, either with food or injected int-
the veins, is discussed, and it is shown that the kidneys do not possess
the power of filtering uric acid from the blood when it is present in
that fluid.
    The different conditions in which uric acid is found in the kidneys
and urinary excretions under varying circumstances, and also in th-
 blood and tissues of the body, are dwelt upon.
    The presence of uric acid in the urinary excretion of the young of
 the herbivorous mammal, and its usual absence in the case of the*
adult of the same Bpecies, are investigated ; it is also shown that,
 whereas in the kidneys ammonia is combined with the acid, in the-
blood it is found as urate of sodium, as also when deposited in the
 different tissues of the body.     This latter phenomenon is explained in
 fnll.

  1883. J      Formation   of Uric Acid in the Animal Economy.          65
     The normal presence of uric acid in the spleen, liver, and other
  organs, even of animals in which the urinary excretion is usually free
  from this principle, is fully discussed and explained.
     An investigation into the mutually destructive influence which uric
  and hippuric acid exert upon each other is next detailed, and it is
  found that such action affords a clue to the solution of many of the
  difficulties of the subject.
     The results of the whole investigation appear to show that uric acid
 is not, as is commonly supposed, formed in the animal body during
 the progress of the metabolism which is constantly going on in
 different organs and tissues, then thrown into the blood and afterwards
 filtered or strained off by the kidneys, and thus finally eliminated
 from the body; but that it is absolutely formed in the renal organs
 themselves by the action of peculiar cells ; that it probably exists in
 these cells as the urate of an organic base yielding ammonia, or as a
 complex organic principle, readily splitting up into uric acid and
 ammonia ; that, for the most part, it is excreted as such urate,
 which, however, may be changed into urate of sodium, or any other
 metallic urate, according as it subsequently meets with one or other
 salt ; that, probably, there is always a trace of uric acid absorb3i into
 the blood from the kidney-cells ; but that, under certain circumstances,
 e.g., when its forward progress is rendered difficult by tying the
cloaca or the ureters of animals, or when other obstructive causes
such as occur in disease, are at work, the absorption into the blood
bec-mes greatly increased, and it is then converted into urate of
sodium, on account of its then meeting with large amounts of the
chloride and phosphate of that metal ; and that it is at times
deposited, both in man and the lower animals, in different structures,
such as the cartilaginous and fibrous tissues, in the form of crystal
lised urate of sodium.
    The Appendix. contains the details of many experiments, especially
in relation to the destructive influence of hippurates and benzoates
upon uric acid ; and of others which show the want of such power in
 the case of glycine, glucose, glycerine, and other substances.

     1.  Chemical  Reactions. — The chemical   changes occurring during
 the charging and discharging of storage batteries have been the
 subject of considerable difference of opinion amongst chemists and
 physicists.    Some writers believe that much of the storage effect
 depends upon the occlusion of oxygen and hydrogen gases by the
 positive and negative plates or by the active material thereon, some
 contend that lead sulphate plays an important part, whilst others
 assert that no chemical change of this sulphate occurs either in the
 charging or discharging of the plates.
     To test the first of these opinions, I made two plates of strips of
 thin lead twisted into corkscrew form, and after filling the gutter of
 the screw with minium, so as to form a cylinder that could be after
 wards introduced into a piece of combustion-tubing, these plates were
 immersed in dilute sulphuric acid and charged by the dynamo-
 current in the usual manner. The charging was continued until the
 whole of the minium on the + and — plates respectively was con
 verted into lead peroxide and spongy lead, and until gas bubbles
 streamed from the pores of the two cylinders.
     After removal from the acid the plates were superficially dried by
 filter-paper, and immediately introduced into separate pieces of com
bustion-tubing previously drawn ont at one end, so as to form gas
 delivery tubes. The wide ends of these tubes were then sealed before
 the blowpipe, care being taken not to allow the heat to reach the
 enclosed cylinders.    The tube containing the cylinder of reduced lead
 was now gradually heated until the lead melted, the drawn-out end
of the tube meanwhile dipping into a pneumatic trough. The gas
expelled from the tube consisted almost exclusively of the expanded
air of the tube and contained mere traces of hydrogen.
    The tube containing the cylinder of lead peroxide was similarly
treated, except that the heat was not carried high enough to decom
pose the peroxide.       Mere traces, if any, of occluded oxygen were
evolved.
    These results justify the conclusion that occluded gases play, practi
cally, no part in the phenomena of the storage cell.
    With regard to the function of lead sulphate in storage batteries,

 68                              Dr.  E. Frankland.                            [Mar.  1,
 I  have observed that during the so-called " formation
                                                                        " of a
                                                                                storage
 cell, a very large amount of sulphuric acid disappears from the liquid
 contents of the cell : indeed sometimes the whole of it is withdrawn.
 The acid    so removed must be employed in the formation of insolnble
 lead sulphate upon the plates which, in fact- soon become coated with
 a white deposit of the salt, formed equally upon both positive and
 negative surfaces.        This visible deposit is, however, very superficial.
 and does not account for more than a very small fraction of the acid
 which actually disappears from solution.                The great bulk of the lead
 sulphate cannot be discovered by the eye, owing to its admixture with
 chocolate-coloured lead peroxide.
    Unless the coated plates have been previously immersed for several
 days in dilute sulphuric acid, this disappearance              of acid during their
 " formation " continues for ten or twelve                      At length, however,
                                                        days.
 as the charging goes on, the strength of the acid ceases to diminish
and soon afterwards begins to augment.                 The increase continues until
the maximum charge has been reached and abundance of oxygen and
hydrogen gases begin to be discharged from the plates ; that is to
say, until the current is occupied exclusively, or nearly so, in the
electrolysis of hexabasic sulphuric acid expressed by Burgoin in the
following equation :—
                                         Eliminated    on      Eliminated   on
                                              +                   —  plate.
                                                plate.

                   S06H6        =        SOs      +     30    +    3H2.
                Sulphuric acid.   Sulphuric anhydride.
    Of course the sulphuric anhydride immediately              combines     with water
and regenerates hexabasic sulphuric acid : —
                                SOg +  SOH^SOgHa.
    On discharging the cell, the specific gravity of the acid continually
decreases    until the discharge is finished, when it is found to have sank
to about the same point from which it began to increase during the
charging. Hence it is evident that, during the discharge, the lead
sulphate, which was continuously decomposed in charging, was con
tinuously reformed in discharging.
    The chief if not the only chemical changes occurring during the
charging of a storage battery, therefore, appear to be the follow
ing :—
    1st. The electrolysis of hexabasic sulphuric acid according to the
equation already given.
    2nd. The reconversion        of sulphuric anhydride into sulphuric acid.
   3rd. The chemical action on the coating of the + plate.

    4th. The chemical action on the coating of the negative plate : —
              SC^Pb       +    H3 + 20H3    =    Pb    +    SOgH,,.
           Lead sulphate.                           Hexabasic sulphuric acid.
    If I  have correctly described these changes, the initial action in the
 charging of a storage cell is the electrolysis of hexabasic sulphuric
 acid, each molecule of which throws upon the positive plate three
 atoms of oxygen, and upon the negative plate six atoms or three
 molecules of hydrogen.         Each atom of oxygen decomposes one mole
 cule of lead sulphate on the positive plate, producing one molecule of
 lead peroxide, and one of sulphuric anhydride, the latter instantly
 uniting with three molecules of water to form hexabasic sulphuric
 acid.
    The following are the chemical changes which          I conceive to occur
  during the discharge of a storage cell :   —
    1st. The electrolysis of hexabasic sulphuric acid as in charging.
    2nd. The reconversion of sulphuric anhydride into hexabasic sul
 phuric acid as already described.
    3rd. The chemical action upon the coating of what was before the
  positive plate or electrode, but which now becomes the negative plate
 of the cell, that is to say, the plate from which the positive current
 issues to the external circuit : —
                   Pb03       +   H2   =    PbO     +    OPL,.
               Lead psroxide.           Lead oxide.     Water.
    The lead oxide thus formed is immediately converted               into lead
 sulphate — :
                        PbO + S06H6 = S04Pb + 30H2.
    4th. The chemical action upon the coating of what has now become
 the positive plate of the cell : —
                      Pb + 0 + S06H8= SOJ?b + 30H2.
    Thus in discharging, as in charging,     a storage cell, the  initial action
 is the electrolysis of hexabasic sulphuric acid.          The oxygen elimi
 nated on the positive plate reconverts the reduced metal of that
plate into lead oxide, whilst the hydrogen transforms the lead per
oxide on the negative plate into the same oxide, which in both cases
is immediately converted into lead sulphate by the surrounding sul
phuric acid, thus restoring both plates to their original condition
before the charging began.
   The real " formation " of the cell consists,      I conceive, in the more
or less thorough decomposition of those portions of the lead sulphate
which are comparatively remote from the conducting metallic nucleus
of the plate. Lead sulphate itself has a very low conductivity, whilst
lead peroxide, and especially spongy lead, offer comparatively little

resistance to the current, which is thus enabled to bring the outlying
portions of the coating under its influence.      It may be objected that,
during the discharge, the work of formation would be undone ; but
probably, in the ordinary use of a storage battery, the discharge is
never completed.      Thus I have found that, in a small cell containing
two plates 6" 2", short circuiting with a thick copper wire for twelve
                x
hours was far from producing complete discharge, for on breaking
this short circuit, the cell instantly rang violently an electric bell with
which it was previously connected.           In ordinary discharges of
" formed " cells, therefore, the lead
                                       sulphate on the positive and nega
 tive plates still remains mixed with sufficient lead oxide and spongy
lead respectively to give it a higher conducting power than the sul
phate alone possesses.
    2. Chemical Estimation of the Charge in a Storage Cell. — No m-thod
has hitherto been known by which the charge in a storage cell could
be ascertained without discharging the cell ; but the results        -f  the
foregoing experiments indicate a very simple means of ascertaining
the amount of stored energy without any interference with the charge
itself.   The specific gravity and consequent strength of the dilute
                                " cell
sulphuric acid of a " formed           being known in its uncharged and
also in its fully charged condition, it is only necessary to tak- the
specific gravity of the acid at any time in order to ascertain th- pro
portion of its full charge which the cell contains at that moment ; and
if the duty of the cell is known, the amount of energy stored will also
be thereby indicated.      In the case of the cell with which       I  have
experimented, containing about seven quarts of dilute sulphuric acid,
each increase of -005 in the specific gravity of the dilute acid means a
storage of energy equal to 20 amperes of current for one hour,
obtainable on discharge.
    I hope shortly to be able to express, in terms of current from the
cell, the definite relation between the amount of energy stored and the
 weight of sulphuric acid liberated.

    The following Papers were read : —
I. " Notes     on the Absorption      of Ultra- Violet Rays by various
       Substances."      By  G.  D. Liveing,   M.A., F.R.S., Professor of
       Chemistry, and J. Dewar, M.A., F.R.S., Jacksonian Pro
       fessor, University of Cambridge.         Received March 1, 1883.
    The following notes contain some records of nltra-violet absorp
tions    in addition to those which have been examined by Soret,
Hartley, M. de Chardonnet, and other investigators. For these
 observations we have generally used the spark of an indnction coil,
with Leyden jar, between iron electrodes as the source of light.
 Occasionally we have used other electrodes, but the lines of iron are
 so multitudinous, and so closely set in a large part of the ultra
 violet region of the spectrum, that they form almost a continuous
 spectrum, at the same time there are amongst them a sufficient
 number of breaks and conspicuous lines to serve as points of
 reference. The spectroscope has a single prism of quartz, and the
 telescopes have quartz lenses.     The image of the spark was projected
 on to the slit of the spectroscope by a quartz lens, and the absorbent
 substances were interposed between the slit and the last-mentioned
 lens.    The gases were held in tubes fitted, some with quartz, others
  with  rock salt, plates on the ends ; liquids in cells with quartz sides.
  The spectra were all photographed.
    Chlorine in small quantity shows a single absorption band extend
 ing from about N (3580) to T (3020). As the quantity of chlorine
 is increased this band widens, expanding on both sides, but rather
 more rapidly on the less refrangible side. Different quantities of
 chlorine produced absorption from about H (3968) to wave-length
 2755, from wave-length 4415 to 2665, and from wave-length 4650 to
  2630.    With the greatest quantity of chlorine tried the absorption did
  not extend above wave-length 2550.
     Bromine vapour iu small quantity absorbs light up to about L
  (3820), and is quite transparent above that.       With larger quantity

  72                 Profs. G. D.   Liveing and      J.  Dewar.         [Mar. 8,
 the   absorption     increases,   gradually     extending    with increase of
 bromine vapour from L to         P (3360) ; and at the same time there is a
 gradually increasing general absorption at the most refrangible end
 of the spectrum beginning at about wave-length 2500 ; so that the
 denser bromine vapour is transparent for a band between wave
 length 2500 and 3350.
    Liquid bromine in very thin film between two quartz plates is
 transparent for a band between wave-length about 3650 and 3400,
 shading away on both sides, so that below M on one side and above P
on the other the absorption seems complete.             The transparency of the
liquid film ends on the more refrangible side just where that of the
 vapour begins.
    Iodine vapour tolerably dense cuts off all within the range of our
photographs below wave-length 4300, and its absorption gradually
diminishes from that point up to about wave-length 4080, from that
point it is transparent.* Denser vapour produces complete absorption
up to 4080 and partial absorption above that point.
    Iodine dissolved in carbon disulphide is transparent for a band
between G and H, cutting off all above and below. It is not possible to
tell how much of the light above M (3727) is absorbed by iodine in
such a solution, inasmuch as carbon disulphide is opaque for rays
 more refrangible than M.
    Iodine dissolved in carbon tetrachloride when the solution is
 weak, shows only the absorption due to the solvent, described below.
More iodine increases the absorption until it is complete above P
 (3360), with shading edge as far down as about wave-length 3400.
    Sulphurous acid gas produces an absorption band which is very
 marked between R (3179) and wave-length 2630, and a fainter
absorption extending on the less refrangible side to O (3440), and on
the other side to the end of the range photographed, wave-length
2300.
    Sulphuretted hydrogen produces complete absorption above wave
length 2580. Below that a partial general absorption.
    Vapour of carbon disulphide in very small quantity produces an
absorption band extending from P to T, ehading away at each -nd ;
no absorption in the higher region.          With more vapour the absorption
band widens, extending from about wave-length 3400 to 3000, and a
second absorption occurs beginning at about wave-length 2580, and
extending to the end of the range photographed.
    Carbon tetrachloride liquid produces an absorption band with a
maximum about R, extending, bat with decreasing intensity, up to
   * The principal absorption band of the haloids seems to Bliift towards the lew
refrangible side with increase of atomic weight, and so to agree with the general
rule which Lecoq de Boisbaudran has noticed in the shifting of corresponding lines
in the spectra of groups of similar metals. — March 16.

Q (3285) on one side, and to s (3045) on the other.                   In the higher
region there is a second absorption sensible about wave-length 2600,
and increasing in intensity up to about wave-length 2580, beyond
which point it is complete.
     Chlorine peroxide gives a succession of nine shaded bands, at nearly
equal intervals, between M and S, with faint indications of others
beyond. In the highest region this gas seems quite transparent.
     A slice of chrome-alum a quarter of an inch thick, is transparent
between wave-lengths 3270 and 2830, its absorption gradually
increases on both sides of those limits, but rather more rapidly on
the more refrangible side than on the other, and becomes complete
below about wave-length 3360 and above wave-length 2730.
     A very thin plate of mica shows absorption beginning about S
(3100), rapidly increasing above U (2947), and complete above wave
length 2840.
     A thin film of silver precipitated chemically on a plate of quartz
transmits well a band of light between wave-length about 3350 and
3070, but is quite opaque beyond those limits on both sides.*
     A thin film of gold similarly precipitated merely produces a slight
general absorption all along the spectrum.
     The difference between the limits of transparency of Iceland spar
for the ordinary and extraordinary rays, inferred from theory by
 Lommel, we find to be very small,. and hardly to be detected without
 using a considerable thickness, three inches or more, of the spar.
      We had expected to be able to apply the well-known photo
 metric method by means of polarised light to the comparison of
 intensities of ultra-violet rays.               Ordinary Nicol's prisms are not
 applicable to ultra-violet rays on account of the opacity of the Canada
 balsam, with which they are cemented, but through the kindness of
 the President of the Society, we obtained from him the loan of a pair
 of Foucault's prisms.            Upon taking photographs of the spectrum of
 the iron spark through this pair of prisms at various inclinations
 between the planes of polarisation of the two prisms, we found that for
 the whole range between the position of parallelism and the inclina
 tion of 80° there was no sensible difference of effect upon the photo
 graphic plate, though the length of exposure was in all cases the
 same.       For inclinations between 80° and 90° there was a sensible
 and increasing diminution in the photographic effect as the planes of
 polarisation of the polariser and analyser were more nearly at right
     • Cornu htu noticed
                              (" Spectre Normal du Soleil," p. 23, note) that such a
 film of silver is transparent for certain ultra-violet rays, but he places them about
 ware-length 270, which does not agree with our observations. Chardonnet (" Comp.
 rend.," February, 1883) says that the transparent band extends from O to S.
 W. A. Miller (" Phil. Trans.," 1863) noticed that for a certain distance in the
  ultra-violet a silver reflector did not reflect the incident rays.

angles to one another.        It seems to follow from this that the full
photographic effect on the dry gelatine plates used by us ensues when
the intensity of the light reaches a certain limit, but that for intensities
of light beyond that limit there is no sensible increase in the             effect
until the stage of solarisation is reached.
II.  " Note on the Reversal of
                                     Hydrogen Lines ; and on the Out
      burst of Hydrogen Lines when Water is dropped into the
      Arc."       By G. D. Liveing, M.A., F.R.S., Professor of
      Chemistry, and J. Dewar, M.A., F.R.S., Jacksonian Pro
      fessor, University of Cambridge.            Received March 1, 1883.
    The concentration of the radiation of hydrogen in a small number
of spectral lines would lead us to expect that the absorption of light
of the same refrangibility as those lines would, at the temperature of
incandescence,     be   correspondingly strong,      and   that therefore the
hydrogen      lines would be easily reversed.         The mass of hydrogen
which we can raise to a temperature high enough to show the lines
is, however, so small, that notwithstanding the great absorptive power
of hydrogen for the rays which it emits, the reversal of the lines has
not hitherto been noticed.       We find, in fact, that the lines are very
readily reversed, and the reversal may be easily observed.
    When a short induction spark is taken between electrodes of
aluminium or magnesium in hydrogen at atmospheric pressure, a
large Leyden jar being connected with the secondary wire of the coil,
the hydrogen lines show no reversal ; but if the pressure of the
hydrogen be increased by half an atmosphere or even less,* the lines
expand and a fine dark line may be seen in the middle of the F line.
As the pressure is increased this dark line becomes stronger, so that
at two atmospheres it is very decided.         As the F line expands with
increase of pressure the dark line expands too and becomes a band.
It is best seen when the pressure is between two and three atmo
spheres.      When the pressure is further increased the dark band
becomes diffuse, and at five atmospheres cannot be distinctly traced.
No definite reversal of the C line was observed under these circum
stances.     The dispersion used, however, was only that of one prism.
    By nsing a higher dispersion the reversal of both the C and F
lines may be observed at lower pressures.           For this purpose we have
used a Pliicker tube, filled with hydrogen and only exhausted until
the spark would pass readily when a large jar was used.
   * The pressures here mentioned are only measured by a metallic gauge attached
to the Cailletet pump employed, and must therefore be only taken as approximately
correct.

   In our communications on the reversal of the lines of metallic
vapours, we have several times noticed (" Proc. Roy. Soc," vol. 28,
pp. 357, 369, 473) the reversal of the lithium lines, and concluded
that the blue line is more easily reversed than the orange line. This,
however, does not appear to be really the case.       When much lithium
is introduced into the arc, a second blue line is developed close to bat
slightly more refrangible than the well-known bine line.       This second
blue line produces with the other the appearance of a reversal, which
deceived us until we became aware of the existence of the second line.
The blue line (wave-length 4604) is really reversed without difficulty
when sufficient lithium is present, but under these circumstances the
orange line is also reversed.     The latter line is also the one which
first (of  the  two) shows reversal,  and also the one which is more per
sistently reversed.    Hence we place the lines in order of reversibility as
follows : red, orange, blue, green, violet.

                                (Abstract.)
    The period comprised between the years 1855-68 was one of active
research into the magnetic character of the armour-plated and other
ships of the Royal Navy, and iron ships of the Mercantile Navy.
    Among other contributions to this subject, a paper by F. J. O . Evans,
 Esq., Staff Commander R.N., F.R.S., and Archibald Smith, Esq.,
 F.R.S., was read before the Royal Society in March, 1865, relating to
 the armour-plated ships of the Royal Navy, and containing the first
 published results of the system of observation and analysis of the
 deviations of the compass established four years previously.
    From lack of observations in widely different magnetic latitudes,
 the authors of that paper were unable to define the proportions of the
 semicircular deviation arising from vertical induction in soft iron, and
 that arising from the permanent or sub-permanent magnetism in hard
 iron.
    During the last fifteen years vessels of all classes — except turret
  ships — have visited places of high southern magnetic inclination or
 dip, and the analysis of the deviation of their standard compasses has
 been made, showing the constants for hard and soft iron producing
 semicircular deviation.

78                   Staff-Commander E. W. Creak.              [Mar.  15,
   The constants for soft iron provide a means of predicting probable
changes of deviation on change of magnetic latitude for certain
vessels of the following classes, and others of similar construction :—
   1.  Iron armour-plated.
   2.  Iron cased with wood.
    3.  Iron troop ships.
   4.   Steel and iron ships cased with wood.
    5. Composite-built vessels.
    6. Wooden ships with iron beams and vertical bulkheads.
    These vessels were all in a state of magnetic stability previous to
the observations which have been discussed, and their compasses have
had the semicircular deviation reduced to small values, or corrected in
England by permanent bar magnets.
    This correction may be considered as the introduction of a permanent
magnetic force acting independently, and in opposition to the magnetic
forces of the ship proceeding from hard iron.
    It is now proposed to consider the effects of a change of magnetic
latitude on the component parts of the deviation.
                           Semicircular Deviation.
    On semicircular deviation from fore and aft forces time has but
little effect, and the greater part of it is due to permanent magnetism
in hard iron, which may be reduced to zero for all latitudes by a
permanent magnet.
    A second but small part of the semicircular deviation proceeds from
sub-permanent magnetism in hard iron. It is subject to alterations
slowly by time, from concussion, and from the ship remaining in a
constant position with respect to the magnetic meridian for several
days, and is more intensely affected by a combination of the two
latter causes.
    Deviations from sub-permanent magnetism which have been tem
porarily altered in value as described, return slowly to their original
value on removal of the inducing cause.
    The principal cause of change iu the semicircular deviation on
 change of magnetic latitude in corrected compasses, arises from
vertical induction in soft iron which changes directly as the tangent
of the dip.
    In standard compasses judiciously placed with regard to surround
ing iron, this element of change is small, and similar in value for
similar classes of ships.
    With very few exceptions nearly the whole of the semicircular
deviation from transverse forces is due to permanent magnetism in
hard iron subject to the same laws as that proceeding from fore and aft
forces.
    In   the exceptional  cases alluded to, there is a small part due  to

1883.]            On Deviations    of the Standard    Compass.             79
-vertical induction in soft iron, changing directly     as the tangent of the
dip.
                             Quadrantal   Deviation.
    This deviation, caused by induction in horizontal soft iron sym
metrically placed, does not change with a change of magnetic latitude.
Time alone appears to produce a gradual change in its value during
the first two or three years after the ship is launched, when it becomes
nearly permanent.
    The diminution of the mean directive force of the needle, which is
common to all modern vessels of war, improves slowly at first by lapse
of time, and finally assumes     a permanent   value.
                Relative Proportions   of Hard and Soft Iron.
    It has been found that the relative proportions of the hard and soft
iron affecting the standard compasses of twenty-five vessels examined
differ considerably, even in ships of similar construction.
    This difference may be accounted for by the compasses not being
placed in the same relative position in the ships considered as magnets
of    various forms,   and containing numerous       iron bodies introduced
during equipment.
                             General Conclusions.
    The following general conclusions have special reference to the
 standard compass of the six classes of vessels previously men
 tioned : —
    1. A large proportion of the semicircular deviation is due to
 permanent magnetism in hard iron.
    2. A large proportion of the semicircular deviation may bo reduced
 to zero, or corrected for all magnetic latitudes, by fixing a hard steel
 bar magnet or magnets in the compass pillar in opposition to and of
 equal force to the forces producing that deviation.
    3. A very small proportion of the semicircular deviation is due to
 sub-permanent magnetism, which diminishes slowly by lapse of time.
    4. The sub-permanent magnetism produces deviation in the same
 direction as the permanent magnetism in hard iron, except when
 temporarily disturbed, (1) by the ship remaining in a constant
 position with respect to the magnetic meridian for several days, (2)
 by concussion, (3) or by both combined, when the disturbance is
 intensified.
    5. To ascertain the full value of changes in the sub-permanent
 magnetism, observations    should   be taken  immediately on the removal
 of the inducing cause.
    6. In  the usual place of the standard compass the deviation caused

by transient vertical induction in soft- iron is small, and of the same
value (nearly) for ships of similar construction.
    7. The preceding conclusions       point to the conditions which should
govern     the  selection  of a suitable position for the standard compass
with regard to surrounding iron iu the ship.

         Atmospheric Absorption in the Infra-Red of the Solar
        Spectrum." By Captain Abney, R.E., F.R.S., and Lieut.-
        Colonel Festing, R.E. Received March 5, 1883.
    Any investigations on the subject of atmospheric absorption are of
such importance in the study of meteorology, that we have deemed it
advisable to present a preliminary notice of certain results obtained
by us, without waiting to present a more detailed account which will
be communicated at a future date.           From 1874, when one of us com
menced photographing the spectrum in the above region, till more
than a year ago, the extremely various manners in which the absorp
tions took place caused considerable perplexity as to their origin, and
it was only after we had completed our paper on the absorption of
certain liquids,* that a clue to the phenomena was apparently found.
 Since that time we have carefully watched the spectrum in relation to
atmospheric moisture, and we think that more than a year's observa
tions in London, when taken in connexion with a month's work, at
an altitude of 8,500 feet on the Riffel, justify the conclusions we now
 lay before the Society.
    A study of the map of the infra-red region of the solar spectrum, t
 and more especially a new and much more complete one, which is
 being prepared for presentation to the Royal Society by one of us,
 shows that the spectrum in this part is traversed by absorption lines
 of varying intensity. Besides these linear absorptions, photographs
taken on days of different atmospheric                conditions, show banded
 absorptions superposed over them.             These latter are step by step
 absorptions increasing in intensity as they approach the limit of the
spectrum at the least refrangible end.              In the annexed diagram, J
 fig. 4 shows the general appearance of this region up to X 10,000 on
 a fairly dry day : the banded absorption is small, taking place princi
 pally between     \  9420 and X 9800 : a trace of absorption is also visible
 between X 8330 and X 9420.          On a cold day, with a north-easterly

wind blowing, and also at a high altitude on a dry day, these absorp
tions nearly if not quite disappear.          If we examine photographs
taken when the air is nearly saturated with moisture (in some form
or another) we have a spectrum like fig. 1. Except with very pro
longed exposure no trace of a spectrum below             \ 8330 can be pho
tographed.      Fig. 2 shows the absorption bands, where there is a dif
ference of about 3° between the wet and dry bulb, the latter standing
at about 50°.         It will be noticed that the spectrum extends to
the limit of about        \   9420, when total absorption steps in and
blocks out the rest of the spectrum.            Fig. 3 shows the spectrum
where the difference between the wet and the dry bulb is about 6°.
Figs. 5 and 6 show the absorption of thicknesses of 1 foot and
3 inches of water respectively, where the source of light gives a
continuous spectrum ; £ inch water merely shows the absorption
bands below 9420           It will be seen that there is an accurate co
 incidence between these " water bands
                                               " and the
                                                            absorption bands
 seen in the solar spectrum, and hence we cannot but assume that
 there is a connexion one with the other.          In fact, on a dry day it is
 only necessary    to  place varying thicknesses   of water before the slit of
 the spectroscope and to photograph the solar spectrum through them,
 in order to reproduce the phenomena observed on days in which there
 is more or less moisture present in the atmosphere.           It is quite easy
 to deduce the moisture present in atmosphere at certain temperatures
 by a study of the photographs.        There does appear a difference, how
 ever, in the intensity of the banded absorptions in hot weather and
 in cold about up to 50°. In the former they are less marked when
 the degree of saturation and the length of atmosphere traversed are
 the same as in the latter.
     The accepted view, we believe, of absorption of vapours is that
 they give linear absorptions in certain thicknesses, and as the thick
  ness increases or the density becomes greater, the lines blacken, new
  lines appear, and gradually total absorption sets in in the region where
  the lines are most numerous and close. It is in the range of possibility
   that the presence of a small quantity of vapour might show itself as
  a haze over some region of the spectrum ;        if, however, the quantity
 was gradually increased the haze wo.uld give place to the lines, and the
 phenomena just described would be repeated.            Suppose several
 localities of absorption to exist, the absorptive power of the vapour
 increasing the further the locality was situated down in the infra-red,
it   might happen that whilst one locality showed only            haze o-
                                                                   a
 absorption,   one further  down   might  show   total absorption,   some
 locality between these two should show linear absorption.
    In the case of the absorptions in the solar spectrum we find a very
 different state of things existing. A comparison of the photographs

befor- the slit of the spectroscope : another point is that the Fraun-
hofer lines in certain regions (say X 9420 to X 9800) are so irregularly
distributed as to preclude the idea that they all belong to the absorp
tion of aqueous vapour, yet all are equally darkened by the band,
and they do not spread out as the darkness of the band increases.
This is against the view of the bands being formed by aqueous vapour.
as we know it.
    The qu-stion then arises as to what these " water bands " can be
due — if not due to vapour. This we consider an open question, and
one   which should      be discussed.      All  we can state is that the absorp
tions shown       are similar to those of water (liquid) and they do not
seem    to point to the watery stuff existing as vapour,* if we take the
visible sp-ctrum as a guide. An intense blue sky at sea-level is often in
dicative of moisture in the atmosphere, and it also seems to be indicative
of finely -uspended matter of some kind. If this be the case, can this
suspend-d matter be suspended water stuff ? for if it be not, there is
 no reason why the sky should be bluer on a moist day than on a dry
day.      We would remark that the deep bine sky at sea-level is of a
 differen8 colour to the black-blue of high altitudes where, if they exist,
 the fin© suspended particles would be largely diminished in number,
 and the coarser particles which cause white haze would also be fewer.
 The gr-at difference of the intensities of the light from the blue sky
 in England and at 10,000 feet was determined by one of us and
communicated to the British Association at Southampton, and the
enorm-us disparity between the two has some bearing on the question
we have been discussing.

    In  8he above paper we have described the absorption due to " water
stuff " in    the atmosphere to X 9800, as it is only to that wave-length
to which the normal spectrum has been as yet published.                     We wish,
howev-r, to add that there are bands commencing at X 9800, X 12200,
and X 15200,t giving step by step absorption from the one wave-length
to the next, as in the diagram, which also correspond with cold water
bands. The absorption in the locality from 12200 downwards is
usually total, and it is only on dry cold days or at high altitudes that
we have noticed that rays of sufficient amplitude can penetrate to
cause photographic impression to be made. —March 24, 1883.

        Determine whether the Motion of Water shall be Direct or
        Sinuous, and of the Law of Resistance in Parallel Chan

                                  (Abstract.)
     1.  Objects and Results   of the Investigation.
                                                      — The results of  this
  investigation have both a   practical and a philosophical aspect.
     In their practical aspect they relate to the laws of resistance to the
  motion of water in pipes, which appears in a new form, the law for
 all velocities and all diameters being represented by an equation of
 two terms.
     In their philosophical aspect these results relate to the fundamental
 principles of fluid motion ; inasmuch as they afford for the case of
  pipes a definite verification of two principles, which are that (he
 general character of the motion of fluids in contact with solid surfaces
 d-pends on the relation (1) between the dimensions of the space occupied
 by the fluid and a linear physical constant of the fluid; (2) between tlte
 velocity and a physical velocity constant of the fluid.
    The results as viewed in their philosophical aspect were the priniary
 object of the investigation.
    As regards the practical aspect of the results, it is not necessary   to
 say anything by way of introduction ; but in order to render the
 philosophical scope and purpose of the investigation intelligible, it is
 necessary to describe shortly the line of reasoning which det-rmined
 the order of investigation.
    2. The Leading       Features   of the   Motion of Actual Fluids. —
 Although in most ways the exact manner in which water moves is
difficult to perceive, and still more difficult to define, as are also the
 forces attending such motion, certain general features both of the
forces and motions stand prominently forth as if to invite or defy
theoretical treatment.
    The relations between the resistance encountered by, and the
velocity of a solid body moving steadily through a fluid in which it is
completely immersed, or of water moving through a tube, present
themselves mostly in one or other of two simple forms. The resistance
is generally proportional to the square of the velocity, and when this is
not the case it takes a simpler form, and is proportional to the velocity.
    Again, the internal motion of water assumes one or other of two
broadly distinguishable forms — either the elements of the fluid follow
one another along lines of motion which lead in the most direct
manner to their destination, or they eddy about iD sinuous paths, the
most indirect possible.

 1883.]                   On the Motion   of Water,                      85
    The transparency or uniform opacity of most fluids renders            it
impossible to see the internal motion, so that, broadly distinct as are
 the two classes (direct and sinuous) of motion, their existence would
 not have been perceived, were it not that the surface of water, where
 otherwise undisturbed, indicates the nature of the motion beneath.
 A clean surface of moving water has two appearances, the one like
 that of plate glass in which objects are reflected without distortion ;
 the other like that of sheet glass, in which the reflected objects appear
 crumpled up and grimacing.       These two characters of surface corre
 spond to the two characters of motion. This may be shown by
adding a few streaks of highly coloured water to the clear moving
 water. Then, althongh the coloured streaks may at first be irregular
 they will, if there are no eddies, soon be drawn out into even colour
 bands ; whereas if there are eddies, they will be curled and whirled
 about in the manner so familiar with smoke.
    3. Connexion between the Leading Features of Fluid Motion. —
 These leading features of fluid motion are well known, and are
 supposed to be more or less connected, but it does not appear that
 hitherto any very determined efforts have been made to trace a
 definite connexion between them, or to trace the characteristics of the
 cironmstances under which they are UBually presented.
    Certain circumstances    have been definitely associated with the
particular  laws  of force.  Resistance as the square of the velocity is
associated with motion in tubes of more than capillary dimensions, and
with the motion of the bodies through the water at more than
insensibly small velocities, while resistance as the velocity is associated
with capillary tubes and small velocities.
    The equations of hydrodynamics, althongh they are applicable to
direct motion, i.e., without eddies, and show that then the resistance is
as the velocity, have hitherto thrown no light on the circnmstances on
which such motion depends. And although of late years these equation*
have been applied to the theory of the eddy, they have not been in the
least applied to the motion of water, which is a mass of eddies, i.e., in
sinuaus motion, nor have they yielded a clue to the cause of resistance
varying as the square of the velocity. Thus, while as applied to waves
and the motion of water in capillary tubes the theoretical results
agree with the experimental, the theory of hydrodynamics has so far
failed to afford the slightest hint why it should explain these pheno
mena, and signally failed to explain the law of resistance encountered
by large bodies moving at sensibly high velocities through water, o?
that of water in sensibly large pipes.
    This accidental fitness of the theory to explain certain of the
phenomena, while entirely failing to explain others, affords strong
presumption that there are some fundamental principles of fluid
motion of which due account has not been taken in the theory ; and
                                                                             f

 86                            Mr. 0. Reynolds.                       [Mar. 15,
 several years ago it seemed to me that a careful examination as to the
 connexion between these four leading features, together with the
 circumstances     on which they severally depend, was the most likely
 means of finding the clue to the principles overlooked.
     4. Space and Velocity. — The definite association of resistance as the
 square of the velocity with sensibly large tubes and high velocities,
 and of resistance as the velocity with capillary tubes and slow veloci
 ties,  seemed to     be evidenco     of   the   very general    and important
influence   of some properties of fluids not recognised in the theory of
hydrodynamics.
    As there is no such thing as absolute space or absolute time
recognised in mechanical philosophy, to suppose that the character of
motion of fluids in any way depended on absolute size or absolute
velocity would be to suppose such motion outside the pale of tbe laws
of motion. If, then, fluids, in their motions, are subject to these laws,
what appears to be the dependence of the character of the motion on
the absolute size of the tube and on the absolute velocity of the im
mersed body must in reality be a dependence on the size of the tube
as compared with the size of some other object, and on the velocity of
the body as compared with some other velocity.           What is the standard
object and what the standard velocity which come into comparison
with the size of the tube and the velocity of an immersed body, are
questions to which the answers were not obvious.             Answers, however,
were found      in the discovery of a circumstance           on which   sinuous
motion depends.
    5. Tlae Effect  of Viscosity on the Character of Fluid Motion. — The
small evidence which clear water shows as to the existence of internal
eddies, not less than the difficulty of estimating the viscous nature of
the fluid, appears to have hitherto obscured the very important
circumstance that the more viscous a fluid is the less prone is it to
eddying or sinuous motion.         To express this definitely, if ft is the
viscosity and     p the  density of      the   fluid, for water   ^  diminishes
                                                                  P
rapidly as the temperature      rises ;  thus at  5° C. - is  double what it is
                                                        P
at 45° C.     What   I observed was that the tendency of water to eddy
becomes much greater as the temperature rises.
    Ilence, connecting the change in the law of resistance with the birth
and development of eddies, this discovery limited further search for
the standard    distance and standard velocity to the physical prop-rties
of the fluid.
    To follow the line of this search would be to enter upon a moleOular
theory of liquids, and this is beyond my present purpose.            It is suffi
cient here to notice the well known fact that        —
                                         P

 1883.]                     On  the Motion  of Water.                     87
is a quantity of the nature of the product of a distance and a velocity ;
and to point out that the establishment of a dependence of the character
of fluid motion on a relation between the linear size of the space, the
velocity of the fluid, and     -,   would be equivalent to establishing the
                               P
existence of two      physical constants, one a distance and the other a
velocity    or a  time, as amongst the properties of fluids. Using the
term dimension as implying measures of time as well as space, these
constants may -well be called dimensional properties or fluids. Similar
constants are already recognised ; thus the velocity of sound is such a
velocity constant, and the mean paths of gaseous molecules, or the
mean range, are such linear constants.
    It is always difficult to trace the dependence of one idea on another;
but it may b- noticed that no idea of dimensional             properties, as
indicated by the dependence of the character of motion on the size of
the tube and the velocity of the fluid, occurred to me until after the
completion of my investigation on the transpiration of gases, in which
was established the dependence of the law of transpiration on the
relation between the size of the channel and the mean range of the
 gaseous molecules.
    6. Evidence
                  of Dimensional Properties in the Equations of Motion. —
The equations of motion had been subjected to such close scrutiny,
particularly by Professor Stokes, that there was small chance of dis
covering anything new or faulty in them.         It seemed to me possible,
however, that they might contain evidence which had been overlooked,
of the dependence of the character of motion on a relation between
the dimensional     properties and the external circumstances of motion.
 Sach evidence, not only of a connexion, but of a definite connexion,
was found, and this without integration.
    If the motion be supposed to depend on a single velocity parameter
U — say the mean velocity along a tube — and on a single linear
parameter c, say the radius of the tube ; then, having in the usual
manner eliminated the pressure from the equations, there remain two
 types of terms in one of which —
                                      TP
                                       <?
is a  factor, and in the other —
                                      pV
                                      pc*
 is a factor.  So that the relative values of these terms8vary respectively
 as  U and —
                                      Cp8
     This is a definite relation of the exact kind for which      I was in

88                            Mr. 0. Reynolds.                   [Mar. 15,
search.    Of course, without integration the equations only gave the
relation, without showing at all in what way the motion might depend
upon it. It seemed, however, to be certain, if the eddies were owing
to one particular cause, that integration would show the birch of eddies
to depend upon some definite value of —
                                     cpU
    7. The Cause   of Eddies. — There appeared to be two possible causes
for the change of direct motion into sinuous.          These are best dis
cussed in the language of hydrodynamics ; but as the results of this
investigation relate to both these causes, which, although the distinc
 tion is subtile, are fundamentally distinct and lead to distinct results,
it is necessary that they should be indicated.
    The general cause of the change from steady to eddying motion
 was, in 1843, pointed out by Professor Stokes as being that, under
certain circumstances, the steady motion becomes unstable, so that an
indefinitely small disturbance may lead to a change to sinuous motion.
 Both the causes above referred to are of this kind, and yet they are
distinct ; the distinction lying in the part taken in the instability by
viscosity. If we imagine a fluid free from viscosity and absolutely
free to glide over solid surfaces, then comparing such a fluid with
a viscous fluid in exactly the same motion — ¦
    (1.) The frictionless fluid might be unstable and the viscous
stable.    Under these circumstances the cause of eddies is the insta
bility as a perfect fluid, the effect of viscosity being in the direction
of stability.
    (2.) The frictionless fluid might be stable and the viscous fluid
unstable ; under which circumstances the cause of instability would
 be the viscosity.
    It  was  clear to me that the     conclusion   I had drawn from the
 equations of motion immediately related only to the first cause.      Nor
 could I then perceive any possible way        in  which instability Oould
 result from viscosity. All the same         I  felt a certain amount of
 uncertainty in assuming the first cause of instability to be general.
 This uncertainty was the result of various considerations, but
 particularly from my having observed that eddies apparently come on
 in very different ways, according to a very definite circumstance of
 motion, which may be illustrated.
    When in a channel the water is all moving in the same direction,
 the velocity being greatest in the middle and diminishing to zero at
 the sides, as indicated by the curve in fig. 1, eddies showed themselves
 reluctantly and irregularly ; whereas when the water on one side
 of the channel was moving in the opposite direction to that on

1883.]
the other,  as shown by the carve in fig.     2, eddies appeared   in the
middle regularly and readily.
                                  Fig. 2.
   8.  Methods                   —
                of Investigation. There appeared to be      two  ways  of
proceeding, the one theoretical, the other practical.
   The theoretical method involved the integration         of equations
for unsteady motion in a way that had not then been        accomplished,
and which, considering the general intractability of the  equations, was
not promising.
   The practical method was to test the relation between U, -, and      c;
                                                                P
this, owing to the simple and definite form of the law, seemed to
offer, at all events in the first place, a far more promising field of
research.
   The law of motion in a straight smooth tube offered the simplest
possible circumstances and the most crucial test.
   The existing experimental knowledge of the resistance of water in
tubes, although very extensive, was in one important respect incom
plete. The previous experiments might be divided into two classes —
(1) those made under circumstances in which the law of resistance
was as the square of the velocity, and (2) those made under circum
stances in which the resistance varied as the velocity.       There had
not apparently been any attempt made to determine the exact circum
stances under which the change of law took place.
   Again, although it had been definitely pointed out that eddies
would explain the resistance as the square of the velocity, it did not
appear that any definite experimental     evidence of the existence of
eddies in parallel tubes had been obtained, and much less was there

90                          Mr. 0. Reynolds.                    [Mar.  15r
any evidence as to whether the birth of eddies was simultaneous with
the change in the law of resistance.
   These open points may be best expressed in the form of queries to
which the answers anticipated were in the affirmative.
   (1.) What was the exact relation between the diameters of the pipes
and the velocities of the water at which the law of resistance
changed ; was it at a certain value of
                                    cUP
   (2.) Did this change depend on the temperature, i.e., the viscosity   of
water ; was it at a certain value of
                                    £?
   (3.) Were there eddies in parallel tubes ?
   (4.) Did steady motion hold up to a critical value and then     eddies
come in ?
   (5.) Did the eddies come in at a certain value of
                                   peU
                                       p
                                   ~T
   (6.) Did the eddies first make their appearance as small, and then
increase gradually with the velocity, or did they come in suddenly?
   The bearing of the last query may not be obvious; but, as will
appear in the sequel, its importance was such that in spite of satis
factory answers to all the other queries, a negative answer to this in
respect of one particular class of motions led to the reconsideration
of the supposed cause of instability and eventually to the discovery of
instability caused by fluid friction.
   The queries as they are put suggest two methods of experi
menting :—
   (1.) Measuring the resistances and velocities for different diameters,
and with different temperatures of water.
   (2.) Visual observation as to the appearance of eddies during the
flow of water along tubes or open channels.
   Both these methods have been adopted, but as the question relating
to eddies had been the least studied the second method was the first
adopted.
   9. Experiments    by Visual Observations. — The most important of
these experiments related to water moving in ono direction along
glass tubes.    Besides these, however, experiments on fluids flowing in
opposite directions in the same tube were made ; also a third class of
experiments which related to motion in a flat channel of indefinite
breadth.
   These   last-mentioned experiments resulted from an incidental
observation during some experiments made in 1876 as to the effect

 1883.]                   On the Motion     of Water.                    91
 of oil to prevent wind waves.      As the result of this observation had
 no small influence in directing the course of this investigation, it may
 be well to describe it first.
    10. Eddies caused by the Wind beneath the Oiled Surface of Water. —
A few drops of oil on the windward side of a pond during a stiff
breeze   having spread over the pond and completely calmed the
surface as  regards waves, the sheet of oil, if it may be so called, was
observed to drift before the wind, and it was then particularly
noticed that close to, and at a considerable      distance from, the wind
ward edge, the surface presented          the appearance of plate glass;
further from the edge the surface presented that wavering appear
ance which has already been likened to that of sheet glass, which
appearance was at the time noted as showing the existence of eddies
beneath the surface.
   Subsequent observation confirmed this first view.        At a sufficient
distance from the windward edge of an oil-calmed surface there are-
always eddies beneath the surface even when the wind is light.          But
the distance from the edge increases rapidly as the force of the wind
diminishes, so that at a limited distance (10 or 20 feet) the eddie-
will come and go with the wind.
                I
   Without oil was unable to perceive any indication of eddies. At
first I thought that the waves might prevent their appearance even if
they were there, but by careful observation       I convinced myself that
they were not there.      It is not necessary to discuss these results here,
although,  as will appear, they have a very important bearing on the
cause of instability.
   11. Experiments    by Means of Colour Bands in Glass Tubes. — Thes-
were undertaken early in 1880 ; the final experiments        were made on
three tubes, Nos. 1, 2, and 3.
   The diameters of these were nearly 1-inch, £-inch, and £-inch.
They were all about 4 feet 6 inches long, and fitted with trumpet
mouthpieces, so that water might enter without disturbance.
   The water was drawn through the tubes out of a large glass
tank in which the tubes were immersed, arrangements being made so
that a streak or streaks of highly coloured water entered the tubes
with the clear water.
   The general results were as follows : —
    (1.) When the velocities were sufficiently low, the streak of colour
extended in a beautiful straight line through the tube, fig. 3.
                                     Fig. 3.

92                          Mr. 0. Reynolds.                   [Mar.    15,
   (2.) If the water in the tank had not quite settled to rest, at suffi
ciently low velocities the streak would shift about the tube, bnt 8here
was no appearance of sinuosity.
   (3.) As the velocity was increased by small stages at some point in
the tube always at a considerable distance from the trumpet or intake,
the colour band would all at once mix up with the surrounding water,
and fill the rest of the tube with a mass of coloured water, as in fig". 4.
                                  Fig. 4.
   Any increase in the velocity caused the point of breakdown           to
approach    the trumpet, but with no velocities   that were tried did it
reach this.
   On viewing the tube by the light of an electric spark, the mass of
colours resolved itself into a mass of more or less distinct curls
showing eddies, as in fig. 5.
                                  Fio. 5.
   The experiments thus seemed to settle questions 3 and 4 in the
affirmative — the existence of eddies and a critical velocity.
   They also settled in the negative, question 6 as to the eddies
coming in gradually after the critical velocity was reached.
   In order to obtain an answer to question 5 as to the law of the
critical velocity, the diameters of the tubes were carefully measured,
also the temperature of the water and the rate of discharge.
   (4.) It was then found that with water at a constant temperature
and the tank as still as could by any means be brought about, the
critical velocities at which the eddies showed themselves were exactly
in the inverse ratios of the diameters of the tubes.
   (5.) That in all the tubes the critical velocity diminished as the
temperature increased, the range being from 5° C. to 22° C. and the
law of this diminution, so far as could be determined, was in accor
dance with Poiseuille's experiment.

 1883.]                    On  the  Motion   of Water.                      93
Taking      a  metre as the unit, TJ, the critical velocity, and D the
diameter      of the tube, the law of the critical point is completely
expressed by the formula
                                         B,D
where                              B,=437
This is a complete answer to question 5.
    During the experiments many things were noticed which cannot be
mentioned here, but two circumstances             should be mentioned as
emphasizing       the negative answer to question 6. In the first place,
the critical velocity was much higher than had been expected in pipes
of Buch magnitude, resistance varying as the square of the velocity
had been found at very much smaller velocities than those at which
the eddies appeared when the water in the tank was steady.             And in
the second place it was observed that the critical velocity was very
sensitive to disturbance in the water before entering the tabes, and it
 was only by the greatest care as to the uniformity of the temperature
 of the tank and the stillness of the water that consistent results were
 obtained.     This showed that the steady motion was unstable for
 large  disturbances   long before the critical velocity was reached, a fact
  which agreed      with the full blown manner in which the eddies
appeared.
    12.   Experiments with two Streams in Opposite Directions in the same
 Tube. — A    glass tube 5 feet long and 1*2 inch in diameter, having its
  ends  slightly bent up as shown in fig 6, was half filled with bisulphide
                                     Fio. C.
 a
 of carbon, and then filled up     with water and both ends corked.        The
  bisulphide was chosen as being     a limpid liquid,  but little heavier than
  water and completely insoluble, the surface between the two liquids
 being clearly distinguishable.         When the tube was placed in a
  horizontal direction, the weight of the bisulphide caused it to spread
  along the lower half of the tube, and the surface of separation of the
  two liquids extended along the axis of the tube.
     On one end of the tube being slightly raised the water would flow
  to the upper end, and the bisulphide fall to the lower, causing opposite
  currents along the upper and lower halves of the tube, while in the
  middle of the tube the level of the surface of separation remained
  unaltered.

94                           Mr. O. Reynolds.                     [Mar. 15,
   The particular purpose of this investigation was to ascertain whether
there was a critical velocity at which waves or sinuosities would show
themselves in the surface of separation.          It proved a very pretty
experiment and completely answered its purpose.
   When one end was raised quickly by a definite amount, the opposite
velocities of the two liquids, which were greatest in the middle of the
tube, attained a certain maximum value depending on the inclination
given to the tube. When this was small no signs of eddies or
sinuosities showed themselves, but at a certain definite inclination
waves (nearly stationary) showed           themselves, presenting all the
appearance of wind waves.
   These waves first made their appearance as very small waves of
¦equal lengths, the length being comparable to the diameter of the tube.
                                    Fie.  7.
   When by increasing the rise, the velocities of flow were increased,
the waves kept the same length, but became higher, and when the rise
was sufficient, the waves would curl and break, the one fluid winding
itself into the other in regular eddies.
   Whatever might be the cause, a skin formed slowly between the
bisulphide and the water, and this skin produced similar effects to
that of oil on water, the results mentioned are those which were
obtained before the skin showed itself.        When the skin first came on
regular waves ceased    to form,  and  in  their place the surface was dis
turbed as if by irregular eddies above and below, just as in the case of
the oiled surface of water.
    The experiment was not adapted to afford a definite measure of the
velocities at which the various phenomena occurred, but it was obvious
that the critical velocity at which the waves first appeared, was many
times smaller than the critical velocity in a tube of the same size when
 the motion was in one direction only.          It was also clear that the
¦critical velocity was nearly  if  not quite independent of any existing
 disturbance in the liquids. So that this experiment shows —
    (1.) That there is a critical velocity in the case of opposite flow, at
which direct motion becomes unstable.
    (2.) That the instability came on gradually and did not depend on
the magnitude of the disturbances, or in other words, that for this
class of motion question 6 must be answered in the affirmative.
    It thus appeared that there was some difference in the cause of
instability in the two motions.

     13.  Further Study of the Equations of Motion. —Having now definite
                       I
data to guide me, was anxious to obtain a fuller explanation of these
results from the equation of motion.          I still saw only one way open
to account for the instability, namely, by assuming the instability of a
frictionless fluid to be general.
    Having found a method of integrating the equations as far as to
show whether any particular form of steady motion is stable for a
small disturbance, 1 applied this method to the case of parallel flow
in a frictionless fluid.      The results which    I  obtained at once were,
that flow in one direction was stable, flow in opposite directions
unstable.       This was not what     I was looking for, and T spent much
time in trying to find a way out of it, but whatever objections my
method of integration may be open to,            I could make nothing less
of it.
    It was not until the end of 1 882 that    I abandomed further attempts
with a    frictionless fluid and attempted by the same method the integra
 tion of a viscous fluid.       This change was in consequence of a dis
 covery    that   in previously considering the effect of viscosity    I  had
 omitted to take fully into account the boundary conditions which
 resulted from the friction between the fluid and the solid bonndary.
     On taking 8hese boundary conditions into account, it appeared that
 although the tendency of viscosity through the fluid is to render
 direct or steady motion stable, yet owing to the boundary condition
 resulting from the friction at the solid surface, the motion of the fluid
 irrespective of viscosity would be unstable.          Of course this cannot
 be rendered intelligible without going into mathematics.         But what   I
 want to point out is that this instability, as shown by the integration
 of the equations of motion, depends on exactly the same relation
 as   that previously found.
     This explained all the practical anomalies, and particularly the
  absence of eddies below a pure surface of water exposed to the wind ;
  for in this case, the surface being free, the boundary condition was
  absent, whereas     the film of oil by its tangential stiffness introduced
  this   condition. This circumstance alone seemed a sufficient verifica
  tion of the theoretical conclusion.
     But there was also the sudden way in which eddies came into
  existence in the experiments with the colour band, and the effect of
  disturbances to lower the critical velocity.     These were also explained,
   for as long as the motion was steady the instability depended upon the
   boundary action alone, but once eddies introduced the stability would
   be  broken down.
      It thus  appeared that the meaning of the experimental      results had

 9(5                           Mr. 0. Reynolds.                   [Mar. 15,
 been ascertained,   and the relation between the four leading features
 and the circumstances      on which they depend traced, for the case of
 water in parallel flow.     But as it appeared that the critical velocity
 in the case of motion    in  one direction did not depend on the cause of
 instability with a view to which it was investigated, it followed that
 there must be another critical velocity which would be the velocity at
 which previously existing eddies would die out, and the motion become
 steady as the water proceeded along the tube.        This conclusion has
 been verified.
     14. Results                                                     —
                 of Experiments on the Law of Resistance in Tubes. The
 existence of the critical velocity described in the previous article
 could only be tested by allowing water in a high state of disturbance
 to enter a tube, and after flowing a sufficient distance for the eddies
 to die out, if they were going to die out, to test the motion.       As it
 seemed impossible to apply the method of colour bands, the test
 applied was that of the law of resistance as indicated in questions (1)
 and (2) in § 8.    The result was very happy.     Two straight lead pipes,
 No. 4 and No. 5, each 16 feet long, and having diameters of a quarter
 and half inch respectively, were used.
    The water was allowed to flow through rather more than 10 feet
 before coming to the first gauge-hole, the second gauge-hole being
 H feet further along the pipe.
    The results were very definite, and are partly shown in fig. 8.
                                    Fig. 8.
    (1.) At the lower velocities the pressure was proportional to the
velocity, and the velocities at which a deviation from this law first
occurred were in the exact inverse ratio of the diameters of the
pipes.
   (2.) Up to these critical velocities the discharges from the pipes
agreed exactly    with those given by Poiseuille's formula for capillary
tubes.
   (3.) For some little distance after passing the critical velocity no
very simple relations appeared to hold between the pressures and
velocities ; but by the time the velocity reached 1"3 (critical velocity)
the relation became again simple.        The pressure did not vary as the
square of the velocity, but as T722 power of the velocity; this law

 held in   both tubes,   and   through velocities ranging from       1 to 50,
 where it showed no signs of breaking down.
     (4.) The most striking result was that not only at the critical velocity,
 but throughout    the entire motion the laws of resistance exactly corre
 sponded for velocities in the ratio of

 This last result   was   brought out in the most striking manner on
 reducing   the results by the graphic method of logarithmic homologues
 as described in my paper on Thermal Transpiration.
    Calling the resistance per unit of length as measured in the weight
 of cubic units of water i, and the velocity v, log i is taken for abscissa,
 and log v for ordinate, and the curve plotted.
    In this way the experimental results for each tube are represented
 as a curve ; these curves, which are shown as far as the small scale
 will admit in fig. 9, present exactly the same shape, and only differ in
 position.

Darcy on pipes ranging from 0-014 to 045 metre. Taking no notice
of the empirical laws by which Darcy had endeavoured to represent
his results,  Ihad the logarithmic homologues plotted from his pub
lished experiments.    If my law was general then these log curves,
together with mine, should all shift into coincidence     each were          if

  In calculating these shifts there were some doubtful points. Darcy's
pipes were not uniform between the gauge points, the sections varying
as much as 20 per cent., and the temperature was only casually given.
These      matters   rendered    a close agreement unlikely    was rather

question of seeing     if    there was any systematic disagreement.  When
the curves came to be shifted the agreement was remarkable in only                ;

Darcy's they varied according to the nature        of   the  material,  from
the lead pipes, which were the same as mine, to 1*92 to            with the       1
cast iron. This seems to     show  that  the nature  of  the surface   of the
pipe has an effect on the law of resistance above the critical velocity.

 that this value is much less than the critical velocity at which steady

 two straight branches, the lower branch inclined at 45°, and the upper
 one at n horizontal to 1 vertical, except for the small distance beyond
 the critical velocity these branches constitute the curves.        These two
 branches meet in a point o on the curve at a definite distance below
the critical pressure, so that, ignoring the small portion of the curve
above the point before it again coincides         with the upper branch, the
logarithmic homologues give for the law of resistance for all pipes and
all velocities—

and then takes the value       of the slope  - to 1 for the particular surface

critical  velocity, gives the law of resistance in Poiseuille's tubes, those
of the    present investigation, and Darcy's, the range of diameters
being

    This algebraical formula shows that the experiments entirely accord
with the    theoretical conclusions.     The empirical constants are A, B, P,
and b ; the first three relate solely to the dimensional properties of the
fluid which     enter into the viscosity, and it seems probable that the last
relates to the properties of the surface of the pipe.
   Much of the success of the experiments is due to the care and skill
of Mr. Foster of Owens College, who has constructed the apparatus
and assisted me in making the experiments.

    The histological and chemical constitution of the coloured blood-
 corpuscles of man and other animals has formed a fertile source of
 investigation for a large number of observers, and it might seem that
further investigations on this subject were unnecessary.                   We have,
however, devoted considerable              time to a systematic study of the
effects of certain reagents upon the blood of the newt and frog which
have yielded results, some of them of not a little interest and
importance.
    The literature of the subject, chiefly of the German papers, is given
somewhat      fully in Rollett's article, " Blood," in Strieker's " Histology,"
and a careful resume of most of the more recent and some of the older
observations will be found in a short paper by G. F. Dowdeswell, in
                                                             "

ence will be made to the literature of each reagent under its appro
priate heading.
    The method of conducting the investigation was as follows:— A
newt was pithed ; its heart exposed ; the auricle suipped through and
the blood collected. t A drop of this blood was then placed on a slide,
and covered with a cover-glass, a hair having first been placed between
the cover-glass and the slide to admit of the corpuscles rolling freely
over and over so as to be seen on edge as well as on the flat, and also
to allow the corpuscles to expand freely under the influence of re
agents.     The blood was then irrigated with a solution of the reagent
to be investigated and examined with a magnifying power of 3W
diameters, or a higher magnifying power when this was deemed
desirable.      Similar experiments were made with frog's blood, bnt
newt's blood was preferred on account of the corpuscles being larger.

      Action  of certain Reagents upon Coloured Blood- Corpuscles.              115
                     —
pyrogallic acid which had become yellow through having been kept
a day or two after it was made — the following                   appearances weic
observed :   —  The biconvex oval red corpuscles soon became globular,
and in a very      short time were observed to recoil or give       a sudden   jerk,
a small    portion of the contents being at the same time extruded in a
direction opposite to that in which the recoil took place.             In fact, the
recoil seemed to be due to the sudden extrusion of a small portion of
the contents       of the corpuscle at one place, or in rare cases at two
places, at the margin of the corpuscle.            These small extrusions resem
ble, but are not identical with the
                                                " pullulations " described by Dr.
Roberts as the effect of the action of a solution of tannic acid.*
    It is very interesting to watch the sudden effect. The globular
corpuscle suddenly jerks in one direction, and simultaneously                   with
this, one observes a small mass of the contents of the corpuscle pouring
out   of a very fine aperture or crack at one side of the corpuscle. (PI. 1,
fig. 1, b, c,  d.)     The motion or jerk seems to be caused by the sudden
ejection of   material, and    so the corpuscle moves in an opposite direction.
 The    opening   is  very  small,  and the extruded mass remains adherent to
 thecorpuscle.      It is much less than a twentieth the bulk of the corpuscle,
 and it is rarely larger than one-third the diameter of the corpuscle.
 It  is slightly coloured     and slightly granular, remains adherent to the
 corpuscle, and does not show any           of the " hooded " character described
 by Dr.    Roberts as the effect of tannic acid. The rent or crack in the
 envelope   or at least in the now thickened rind of the corpuscle, through
 which the little mass is forced or ejected can often be clearly seen.
 If such a preparation be sealed up, such buds or projections may be
 kept for a considerable          time.    If a sufficient amount of the acid be
 added other effects follow.          The corpuscles begin to assume a coarsely
 granular appearance, and the nucleus, until now unaffected, begins to
 assume a granular appearance, but still remains pale as at first.          Owing
 to the granular condition of the hull
                                                  (Dowdeswell) of the corpuscle,
 the nucleus cannot be seen until the centre of the corpuscle is focusscd.
 Some of the corpuscles appeared to become granular without any
 extrusion of a part of their contents.            In those corpuscles which had
 given way at one side the granular contents soon began to pass out
 through the rent, and often the nucleus            also was extruded.    In  many
 of the    corpuscles     the nucleus     was observed      to be half within and
 half   without the body of the corpuscle.            A distinct, highly refractive
 envelope     was    traceable around the body of the corpuscle as far as
 the break in its side, when it suddenly              ceased.   This envelope was
  often traceable on one or both sides of the protruded part of
 the corpuscle for some            distance, but never completely around it.
  The protruded         mass generally remained attached to the side of

the corpuscle, even when the whole of its granular contents had
passed out.  The nucleus generally remained within the envelope, and
became tinged of a yellow colour.   The intranuclear plexus of fibrils
was also revealed.      (PI. 1, fig 1, jr.) The envelope of a corpuscle devoid
 of its granular contents was observed to be tinged of a yellow colour,
 and to show a double contour.             A similar appearance was observed
 around the nuclei.       The remaining corpuscles ultimately became com
 pletely disintegrated, and the field of the microscope became covered
 with free nuclei, grannlar colouring matter, and fragments of
 envelopes sometimes containing nuclei. (PI. 1, fig. 1,           Sometimesan    i.)
 envelope was seen entire but with             rent in its side extending half
                                                       a

               and through which its contents had escaped.           (Fig.                    1,   h.)
 Sometimes a mass of granules was observed with              dark line partially
                                                                          a

now distinctly shown — perhaps produced — by the action of the pyro-
gallic acid.
    It an interesting question to determine why and how this sudden
         is
protrusion of a portion of the coloured corpuscles             produced at one is
part of the circumference.         That process of endosmosis goes on
                                                   a                                               is
shown by the corpuscles assuming a globular form, but that of itself
is not enough to account for the sudden protrusion already referred
to, for water and many other fluids also produce endosmosis, but give
rise to no such ejection of the contents of the corpuscles.                 The
pyrogallic acid obviously has some chemical effect on the corpuscular
contents, and        itjust probable that the envelope of the corpuscle
                          is                                                                       is
not perfectly uniform in its resistance all round.          We are inclined to
view the above described phenomenon in connexion with the spots or
thickenings described by Dr. Roberts as occurring in the wall of blood-
corpuscles under the action of magenta. solution, and also with the
curious spots observed by us in the corpuscular wall after the action of
gallic acid. It         to be noted that no contraction or diminution of
                          is

                                    is
the mass, which, however,           relatively so small that
                                         is                     would scarcely  it
visibly  affect the diameter     of the corpuscle.     The various effects are
shown in PI.      fig.
                     1,        1.
  Seeing that tannic acid has already yielded such remarkable results
in the hands of Dr. Roberts, and that pyrogallic acid gave rise to
equally peculiar phenomena,    occurred to us to ascertain the effect of
                                          it
a substance closely related to both, viz., gallic acid.   [Wedel* also
recognised that pyrogallic acid causes a separation of the haemoglobin
from the stroma.]

spherical        and      the   nucleus        to become    more   distinct and               tinged
yellow.  Then a sudden recoil or jerk is observed, the corpuscle
at the same time elongating and swelling up.   No rupture of the
envelope was seen. The contents of the corpuscle appeared gradu
ally to pass out, or to be dissolved out, and the field of the
microscope became covered with granular debris.    The nucleus was
left of a bright yellow colour and quite smooth and homogeneous in
appearance.            As all the haemoglobin is dissolved out of the corpuscle,
the deeply stained  homogeneous nucleus is seen in the interior of the
globular corpuscle, which is surrounded by a highly refractive enve
lope, in which one, two, three, or more slight thickenings,  or highly
refractive elongated bodies, are to be seen. (PI. 1, fig. 2, 6, c.) Whether
these bodies are at all comparable to the thickenings, or "macules,"
already described by Roberts, it would be difficult to say.         Perhaps
they are  merely  the debris of the intracellular stroma.    Slight  remains
of     this stroma may sometimes be seen in the perinuclear portion of
the     corpuscle, as after a time it becomes slightly tinged yellow and
is stained by f uchsin or magenta.     Within the nucleus one, two, or
more  highly refractive dots are always to be seen.   When single the
dot presents   the appearance of a nucleolus, but it occupies very
variable positions and is larger than the nucleolus revealed by thi<
action of dilute alcohol, already described by Ranvier and one of us.*
These dots are perhaps       the remains   of the intranuclear plexus.

shrink away from its surroundings, becoming at the same time tinged
of ayellow colour, and showing an intranuclear plexus of fibrils. In
some of the corpuscles the nucleus had taken up an excentric situa
tion, being placed at one endof the corpuscle or nearer one end than
another, showing how plastic the perinuclear portion of the corpuscle
 is.(Fig.    b.)  Its long axis was sometimes found to lie across

of the corpuscle into the nucleus, and        so  affecting the latter as to cause
it to shrivel up and thus to retreat from the mass of haemoglobin in
which it lies embedded.
    In its passage through the body of the corpuscle the fluid had
dissolved out a portion of the colouring matter of the corpuscl- and
carried it into the nucleus, so that the latter had become tinged
with it.     The nucleus generally retained its original position in the
corpuscle with its long axis parallel with that of the corpu-cle.
Although apparently free in the haemoglobin, the nucleus was not
observed to change its position within its cavity.                 This may be
accounted for on the supposition that some of the intranuclear 6brils
pass through the envelope of the nucleus, and are in direct continuity
with somo of the fibrils which form the stroma of the hull of the
corpuscle, and that these fibrils support the nucleus in the fluid by
which it is surrounded.         The size and coloration of the corpuscles
were slightly diminished.
   To appreciate the full effect of the acid it is necessary to have two
views of the corpuscles, one on the flat and the other on edge. When
viewed on the flat the shrunken nucleus can be seen lying within the
corpuscle, with a clear wide space, probably filled with fluid, lying
between it and the haemoglobin-charged                stroma.   On causing the
corpuscles to roll over, however, one observes that there is not only a
shrinking of the nucleus, but also a simultaneous expansion of that
portion of the corpuscle which lies immediately outside the nucleus, so
that on edge the corpuscles, instead of presenting the usual graceful
biconvex curves, suddenly bulge out in the centre, as represented in
fig-  3,/.
   A somewhat similar effect is described by Rollett* : — " The nucleus
appears to be not very sharply defined, but frequently shrivelled and
surrounded by an empty space, as though lying in a cavity of the
substance of the blood-corpuscle           (chromic acid, hydrochloric acid,
nitric    acid,  picric acid, tannic acid, and concentrated tincture of
iodine)."      No  figures are given, but we find most certainly that these
acids yield more characteristic results than is conveyed in the above
description.      Corpuscles exhibiting this peculiar change can be kept
for a considerable time.       In some cases, just when the acid begins to
act, a slight shrinking of the hwmoglobin from the envelope of the
corpuscle can be seen.
    It is curious to note the very different effects produced by solutions
of the same acid — a 1 per cent, solution producing a general expansion
of the whole corpuscle, whilst the stronger solution causes only a
partial swelling up of one portion of the corpuscle, and           a simultaneous
shrinking of the nucleus.

                                   Benzoic Acid.
    This    acid is soluble to the extent of     1 in 200 parts of water.     A
saturated solution causes the nuclei to become distinct and many of
the corpuscles        to become spherical.      The contents of the stroma
of    the corpuscle      gradually pass  out through the membrane and the
field of    the microscope becomes covered with granular debris, which is
in  greatest abundance close to the corpuscles.           The latter at length
b-Oome quite clear, except for a few granules here and there in the
stroma. The nuclei are distinct and of a bright yellow colour and are
generally oval and more or less irregular in outline, but sometimes
spherical. A double contour-line can nearly always be made out both
ar-und the nucleus and body of the corpuscle. Some of the nuclei
show an intranuclear plexus, others are smooth and homogeneous.
                                   Salicylic Acid.
    A    saturated watery solution of salicylic acid caused the corpuscles
 to swell up rapidly and become globular, the nuclei at the same time
 beOoming tinged yellow.
     In a very short time the corpuscles begin to elongate one after
 another, with a sudden jerk. No visible break could be observed in
 the side of the corpnscle, although the nucleus at the moment of
 r-coil was often observed to pass out through the side of the cor
 pnscle.       The field of the microscope quickly became covered with
 yellowish debris — the contents of the stroma of the corpuscles — while
 the perinuclear part of the corpuscles became decolorised.             Some of
 the    nuclei   were   smooth  in  appearance,  and  bright yellow  in  colour ;
 others showed beautifully the intranuclear plexus of fibrils, with
 narrow meshes ; and still others had become swollen up to about twice
 their normal dimensions, and exhibited a wide-meshed plexus in their
 interior, due no doubt to the separation of the fibrils by the swelling
  up of the interfibrillar substance.         Those nuclei which showed a
  plexus    in  their  interior  were  observed  to be bounded by a double
  contour-line, tinged of a yellow colour. A similar line indicated the
  position of the envelope of the corpuscle.           Many free nuclei were
  observed, and some with the collapsed envelope and stroma of the
  corpuscle still clinging to them.
      Other nuclei were noticed half within and half without the cor
  puscle. When the effect of the reagent had been more gradual, the
  perinuclear part of the corpuscle was granular and darkened in
  colour. The nucleus was pale — slightly tinged yellow — and showed
  an intranuclear plexus.
      With this acid, as with many others, we frequently observed indi
   cations in the nuclei as if they were dividing, and we recall the
   observation of Preyer, that in the breeding season, he observed that

120                     Dr. W. Stilling and A. Rannie.
partially divided nuclei were frequently to                    be seen   in the coloured
blood-corpuscles of the frog.
                                     Tartaric Acid.
   On irrigation with a 12 per cent. solution of this acid, the first
effect observed was an unequal shrinking of the corpuscles, so as to
produce a very peculiar effect. Each corpuscle appeared with a series
of bars across   it,                       of alternate dark and light
                       so as to present a series
coloured areas.   These areas not unfrequently resemble a series of
folds or creases in the corpuscles.      Sometimes these areas were
arranged with considerable regularity across the corpuscle, whilst at
other times they were irregular, and sometimes radiated outwards.
The lighter areas seemed to be produced by the corpuscle becoming
thinner at these parts, as     were the result of osmosis taking place
                                if   it
unequally and irregularly.   This effect, however, soon gives place to
another, wherein the corpuscles suddenly swell up and burst.        Co
incident with this swelling up, there         great commotion
                                                      is   a     in the
material elements of the corpuscles, the nucleus       not unfrequently
                                                                   is
liberated, and can be seen to pass out of the disintegrated hull of
the corpuscle, becoming at the same time completely decolorised.
Immediately before bursting, the barred arrangement of the haemo
globin just described disappears, and the nucleus, which until then
had been pale and indistinct, becomes more distinct, yellowish in
colour, and more granular in appearance.         The swelling and de
coloration   could     often   be observed   to commence at one end               of   the
corpuscle and pass towards the other end.     After the corpuscles had
burst, the nuclei were left stained of a deep yellow colour, and show
ing beautiful intranuclear plexus of fibrils. Many nuclei were seen
    a
with the collapsed envelope and stroma of the corpuscle still adherent
to them.    After a time the collapsed envelope and stroma ofteu
became slightly stained of  yellow colour.

                                      Citric Acid.
   The action of a 12 per cent. solution of citric acid was in every
respect the same as that of tartaric acid.

acid, the nuclei became distinct, and many of the corpuscles very
soon became globular, gave way at one side, and became decolorised.
The giving way was accompanied               by
                                         recoil or jerk. The nucleus
                                                  a
sometimes escaped, but was generally surrounded by vestiges of the
collapsed envelope, and of the stroma of the corpuscle.    These effects
were only seen in those corpuscles which first came under the influence
of the reagent.   In those corpuscles which were least exposed to the

      Action of certain Reagents upon Coloured Blood-Corpuscles.        121
 reagent,    the effect was more gradual, and somewhat different.       The
 nucleus     became brighter as with the other corpuscles, but after a
 short time the corpuscle         suddenly expanded to several times its
 former size.     No bursting was observed, nor did the corpuscle become
 globular before expansion.         The nuclei became bright yellow and
granular after the expansion of the corpuscle.         The outline of the
expanded hnll, though faint, could be distinctly       seen,  as also could
 indications   of a fibrillar stroma in the hull.
                                   Lactic Acid.
   A solution of lactic acid (24 per cent.) was found to cause at first
an    irregular crenation of the haemoglobin within its envelope, so
that the latter could be seen as a glass-clear structure, separated from
its contents at different parts.       The nucleus gradually became more
                 "
distinct and       granular." The corpuscle soon expanded suddenly to
several times its original size, the nucleus being well defined, and
showing beautifully the fibrillar plexus in its interior.         Some of
the corpuscles doubtless burst, as free nuclei are found in many parts
of the field.     Nuclei are also seen with the remains of the hull and
envelope of the corpuscle attached to one side.
                                   Oxalic Acid.
   A    2  per cent, solution of oxalic acid caused the corpuscles and
their nuclei to swell up and become globular.          The nuclei became
tinged    yellow.     Very soon the corpuscles gave a sudden recoil
or jerk, and at the same time elongated.           The nucleus was often
extruded at the moment of recoil, but in the case of other corpuscles
it simply shifted its situation within the corpuscle.    Not unfrequently
we could watch the nucleus being extruded, and when it was half out
and half in the corpuscle it was constricted,       but still no envelope
was visible in the corpuscle.       No actual break was visible on the side
of the corpuscle, but the contents of the latter was scattered over the
field of the microscope in small yellowish granules.        The corpuscles
gradually lost their colouring matter, but the nuclei became stained
of a bright yellow colour, and showed beautiful plexuses of fibrils in      •
their interior.      In many of the corpuscles also many fine fibrils,
stained yellow, were observed in the perinuclear part of the cor
puscles, mostly passing in a radial manner from the nucleus to the
envelope.     (Fig.  4, e, h.)
     These fibrils and      the  nnclens are well stained    by fuchsin  or
magenta.
    If  the action of the acid is gradual both nucleus and corpuscle may
 be  completely decolorised.

                                      Carbolic Acid.
      The changes induced in the corpuscles by a saturated (1 in 20)
  watery solution of carbolic acid were peculiar, and somewhat difficult
  to describe on account of the rapidity with which the final stage was
  reached.      The appearances seen were as follows : — On irrigating the
  blood with the solution of the reagent it was found that the corpuscles
  first affected had lost a great part — or the whole — of their haemoglobin,
  while the nucleus had become much swollen and of a globular form.
  (Fig. 5, a.) The nucleus in this condition often showed well the plexus
  in its interior, but at other times it was seen to contain a number of
  dark yellow globules — derived no doubt from the perinuclear part of
  the corpuscle — but did not show the plexus.               The corpuscle itself con
  sisted of the swollen nucleus with only a narrow rim of the perinuclear
  part around it. In some corpuscles haemoglobin was collect-d into a
  semi-globular mass attached to one side of the nucleus.                  (Fig. 5, e,f.)
      In   other   corpuscles the nucleus had a crescent-shaped                  mass of
  haemoglobin      on  either side of   it.    The   haemoglobin    still  in connexion
   with the nucleus, either in its interior or attached to its sides, was
   smooth in appearance and darkened in colour ; over the part of the
   slide first invaded by the reagent many long dark streaks of granular
   colouring matter were seen. It appeared as if the corpuscles attacked
   by the acid had had their envelope dissolved or had burst at one side,
   allowing of the escape of the colouring matter.
       On selecting some unaltered corpuscles in the centre of the slide,
   and watching the gradual action of the acid upon them as it passed
   under the cover-glass, the following appearances were observed : —The
   corpuscles seen on the flat first showed the barred arrangement of the
   perinuclear part already described as occurring under the action of
   several other reagents, and which is due to the varying thickness of
   the corpuscles at different parts.           (This variation was seen in a cor
   puscle on edge, which has then a crenated appearance.)                      Very soon
   the corpuscles became granular in appearance, the haemoglobin becom
   ing at the same time much darkened.                    The nucleus became more
   distinct, was pale in colour, and had a granular appearance.                  Many of
   the corpuscles were observed to have given way                at one   side, and their
-  contents to have been partly extruded. The nucleus soon became
   much swollen, and often exhibited                 an intranuclear plexus.           The
   contents of the corpuscles were scattered about the field of the
   microscope in the form of small dark granules.                 Many of the darkly
   granular corpuscles above mentioned appear to become gradually
   decolorised, while in others the granules appeared to melt down into
   dark yellow homogeneous semi-fluid particles, which were seen adher
   ing to the greatly distended nucleus.*
       * The liberation of the haemoglobin  is  of importance in connexion with  poisoning

       Action       of certain       Reagents upon Coloured Blood-Corpuscles.                     123
                                        Ammonium         Hydrate.
  On irrigation of a drop of blood with a 12 per cent- solution
of ammonium hydrate the corpuscles became spherical, and at the
same time darkened in colour. The nuclei could not be seen dis
tinctly, but appeared to have undergone the same change of shape as
the corpuscles.   Very soon the corpuscles suddenly collapsed, and they
and  their nuclei disappeared from view entirely. Sometimes, instead
of collapsing, the corpuscles                    suddenly     expanded,     appearing      to burst,
and then melted away.    The expansion was accompanied with a slight
recoil or jerk.  The solntion of the corpuscles was sometimes more
gradual, this depending, however, on the strength of the solution used.
A 2 per cent- solution causes a moro gradual solution of the cor
puscles.
     The effects        of ammonium hydrate and the alkalies generally have
been   investigated very frequently, and solutions much weaker than
we have    employed have been used.        Dr. William Addison* describes
and figures what he called the acid and alkaline forms of human blood,
while Kneuttingerf has shown that " alkalies as a general rule, when
in a state of moderate concentration,      exert a solvent action on all the
constituents of the blood-corpuscles, including the nuclei." A solntion
of 1 grm. in 100 cub. centims. is quite sufficient         for this purpose.
There      therefore, nothing remarkable in
            is,                                     much stronger solution
                                                                   a
rapidly producing the same effect, but what we have found               that                 is
some time after complete solution of the corpuscles has occurred,
small microscopic crystals are to be found scattered over the field of
view.    If such a preparation be sealed up the crystals gradually grow
and assume a considerable, although still microscopic, size.        In some
cases these crystals are coloured of a slightly yellowish tint.     Some are
prismatic, whilst others are like two triangles placed with their
obtuse angles towards each other.           They resemble very closely in
shape some of the forms of triple phosphate which are found in urine
after decomposition      of the urea has set in.        At present we are
unacquainted     with  their exact nature.
  A   very careful description of the action of the vapour of ammonia
is given by Professor Lankester in his paper already cited, and                                   it   is
curious to note that Professor Lankester saw particles separate from
•he h-moglobin      of frog's corpuscles, and "in these       was quite easy   it

the fluid after the solution of the corpuscles under the action                   of
ammonium          hydrate.
                       Sulplw-Cyanide of Ammonium.
   The action of this reagent on the coloured blood-corpuscle                     is.
perhaps, one of the most interesting which we have examined — not
only as regards its immediate action, but also as regards the ultimate
effect  itproduces upon the nucleus in which             reveals an intranuclear
                                                             it
plexus of fibrils with the greatest distinctness.          (Fig.  8, a, b.)
   On irrigating   blood   with   a  10   per   cent. solution   of this salt, the
corpuscles first became somewhat larger, and clear bands appeared                 in
the perinuclear part.      (Fig.    6,
                                     a.)    The direction of these bands was
generally across the long axis of the corpuscles.                  The corpuscle
looked as     ifthere  were     series
                                a        of  folds or  creases in  it. The effect
was thus similar to the early effect produced by citric and tartaric
acids upon the corpuscles, except that the clear bands were more
numerous in the case of the salt.           The nucleus at the same time was
brought out more distinctly, though still remaining pale, and the oat-
line of its intranuclear plexus was faintly seen.
   On selecting a corpuscle and observing the effect of the reagent
closely,      was seen after
             it                     a minute or two to lose its barred
appearance, and then small, highly refractive, coloured globules began
to form near the edge of the corpuscle.             These small globules were
soon seen on the outside of the corpuscle, to which they remained
attached for a few seconds by       a tailed process of their own substance.
The droplets began to exhibit active molecular or Brownian move
ments.     The processes connecting the globules to the outside of the
corpuscle soon gave way, and then the spherical masses of coloured
protoplasm began to dance about over the field of the microscope,                  in
active molecular movement.           (Fig.    6,   c,   /.) The margin of the
                                                        d,   e,
corpuscle was left crenated, or rather dentated, and from the denta
tions other small globules began to come off and dance about like their
predecessors.     After some of these small globules were cast off, or at
least after the threads which fixed them to the corpuscle were severed,
which one can see taking place in the field of the microscope, the
corpuscle often assumes a variety of shapes, giving out                alobose pro
cess, which may also change its shape and dimensions. (Fig.                 n, p, q.)
                                                                           6,
It most interesting to watch the liberation of the droplets, and the
   is
variety of shapes assumed by the corpuscle.               The detached droplets
gradually become      decolorised.     The   corpuscle begins to shrink visibly
in size as the droplets extrude from it, and at the same time becomes
darker in colour. The dentations disappear with the shrinking of the
corpuscles, which commenced about five or six seconds after the first

      Action  of certain  Reagents upon Coloured Blood- Corpuscles.             125
globules were seen on the surface of the corpuscle.               The outline of the
corpuscle while shrinking        was  more   or less   irregular, and the droplets
continued to form on the margins of the corpuscles.                   The corpuscles
were obviously     in a very plastic condition, if one may judge from the
ease with which they changed their shape.                Ultimately the corpuscle
— or rather what remained of it — became condensed into a small
globular mass of a dark yellow colour, usually with the pale nucleus in
its centre.    In a short time the nucleus which had hitherto been but
slightly affected, suddenly expanded to a considerable extent, some
times breaking up in the process.
    A beautiful intranuclear plexus of fibrils was then seen to exist in
the   interior of the nucleus.       (Fig.  8, a, b.)     With the swelling up of
the nucleus,    the rest of the corpuscles underwent complete decolori-
sation.     Traces of a stroma were detectable in the colourless hull
of the corpuscle.
    Ultimately the microscopic field contained a large mumber of nuclei,
bow considerably enlarged, and each one containing a beautiful view
 of its  intranuclear plexus of fibrils. It was obvious that the nucleus
 had become enlarged through the swelling up of the material — what
 ever its nature — which      lies within the meshes of the plexus.              The
 fibrils themselves are also enlarged, and they bound meshes which in
 some cases are polygonal, in others hexagonal in shape.                This reagent
 shows the intranuclear plexus quite as distinctly as ammonium chro-
 mate.     On subsequently staining the distended nuclei with magenta
 or fuchsin, the plexus becomes stained, and they present a singularly
 fine demonstration      of the arrangement of the fibrils. They may be
 kept for a considerable time.
     One cannot fail to notice how closely the phenomena above de
 scribed agree with the action of certain other reagents upon the blood-
 corpuscles — notably a 5 per cent- solution of ammonium chromate
  which shows the separation of particles of the haemoglobin in the form
 of droplets of the most bizarre forms, and the changes of shape with
  the utmost distinctness.      A strong solution of urea exerts an almost
 similar action upon the coloured corpuscles — and so does heat, as was
  described   by Max Schulze.
     Somewhat similar phenomena were observed by G\ F. Dowdeswell,*
  in the blood of man and the dog when acted upon by septic matter,
  Buchas an aqueous extract of putrid muscle.             These phenomena closely
  resemble the results obtained on human blood by Dr. ffm. Addison,t
  F.R.S., with pale sherry, either alone or in combination with various
  substances.
     Coloured corpuscles of amphibian blood have been observed                     by
   Rindfleisch and Beale to undergo remarkable changes in shape.

    Rindfleisch is inclined to believe that small portions of the "hav
matin-containing contents must pass through pores in the cell
membrane, or through holes produced in some other way in the
same."      But Preyer remarks* that such forms of coloured corpuscle
have no membrane.           Bealef found similar forms with long thread-like
processes which became separated from the parent corpuscle when a
drop of blood was warmed.
    Sometimes another series of phenomena is obtained.            Large glo
bular or flask-shaped processes are given off from the margins of
the corpuscles.       (Fig. 6, p, q.) It may be at one side or on both.
 Some of them become detached, and coalesce to form globular or semi-
globular large masses, which float off into the surrounding fluid, and
are ultimately dissolved.        Ultimately the nucleus undergoes the same
changes as have already been described.
                         Sulpho-Cyanide    of Potassium.
    A   10 per cent- solution of this salt, gave exactly the same results
as the corresponding       salt of ammonium.
                               Ammonium    Chromate.
   When      a drop  of frog's blood was mixed in the cold with a drop of a
5 per cent. solution of this salt, the corpuscles were first observed to
take on the barred appearance of the perinuclear part, described as part
of the effect of citric, tartaric, and other acids, &c. The nucleus was
more distinctly seen and was pale and slightly granular. Small coloured
droplets were soon observed to form at the margin or periphery
of the corpuscles.       The corpuscles then usually became more or less
regularly crenated, and the small yellow coloured droplets began to
assume a beaded appearance on the surface or edges of the corpuscles.
They then began to exhibit active Brownian movements.               The cor
puscles had by this time again become homogeneous in appearance.
and appeared to be very mobile or plastic, as they changed their shape
with great facility. The corpuscles diminished in size as the coloured
droplets passed out, while at the same time the crenation disappeared,
and the outline of the corpuscles became more or less uneven.            The
coloured part of the corpuscles often became aggregated into          two  or
three or more rounded masses, causing a projection at those points.
The corpuscle thus often had a dumb-bell, triradiate, or stellate
form with rounded angles.           Very often one or more of these knobs
would     become pedunculated, and at length break off from the cor
puscle.     Sometimes a corpuscle would be seen floating about with
several of these coloured globular masses attached to it by long pro
cesses,   while but a very small amount of colouring matter remained

around the nuclei.        The processes attaching the masses of coloured
matter to the nucleus often appeared to be membranous in character.
Many of the corpuscles ultimately became perfectly spherical, the
nucleus being indistinctly seen in the centre or at one side.              These
spherical corpuscles were often seen to contain several globular masses
grouped usually around the nucleus.            Very often the ultimate effect
was to leave the nucleus with a dark yellow rounded knob of the
coloured part of the corpuscle at either end of it.               Sometimes the
whole of the coloured part of the corpuscle had disappeared, leaving
the nucleus pale and swollen, and with indications of a plexus in its
interior.     (These peculiar forms which the corpuscles assume may be
preserved    some time by sealing up the preparation.)
   From some of the corpuscles long delicate processes were observed
to pass.       Some of these processes appeared to be made up of
minute     globules of coloured material which had coalesced to form
a   continuous bead-like string.           They resembled very much the
processes seen passing from the blood-corpuscles               of the frog after
treatment with a 20 per cent, solution of urea.                  Other processes
appeared to be of a membranous character, and were tipped at their
free extremities     by a minute coloured globule.
    All these processes were remarkable for their length, which was
 sometimes several times that of the corpuscle itself.           They were more
easily   induced in the corpuscles       by gently heating      the slide over a
 spirit-lamp.
    If some of the blood of a newt be kept for forty-eight hours in a
 5 per cent,     solution of ammonium chromate, it will be found on
 examining     it that in most of the corpuscles the perinuclear part has
 entirely disappeared, leaving the nucleus much swollen aud of a
 globular form.      An intranuclear plexus with wide meshes is seen.
 The nucleus stains readily — though not very deeply — with picro-
 carmine, the    interior of the nucleus becoming reddish in colour and
 the  envelope yellowish. (Various forms assumed by the corpuscles are
 shown in Fig. 7.)
    The action of this substance on the coloured blood-corpuscles of the
 frog is accurately described by Mr. Dowdeswell as far as regards the
 extension, retraction, and detaching of the protuberances,               and he
 remarks that no rupture of a membrane, or anything of the kind, was
 to be seen, even with a power of 1,000 diameters.                Dr. Klein* has
 also shown the immense importance of this substance for a variety
 of purposes, but especially for revealing the fibrillar plexuses within
 cells and nuclei, e.g., in non-striped muscle, &c.

  crenated      and theu   to assume a globular form. This change to a
  globular form occurred for the most part suddenly with a recoil or
  jerk. At the same time processes were usually thrown out from the
  corpuscles,      sometimes to a considerable       distance.     Usually     the cor.
 puscle itself underwent considerable           changes in shape. The nucleus
  could not be seen.        Small coloured      droplets became extruded from
 the corpuscle and danced over the field of the microscope with active
  molecular movements.           Sometimes the action of the reagent was less
 vigorous — due to less being present — and then the corpuscles gra
 dually became globular,        the sudden recoil not being observed. The
 crenation       was observed    as before, and then the corpuscle began to
 diminish in size, owing to the formation and detaching of its plastic
 coloured      substance.    All the corpuscles ultimately become spherical
 and very much lessened in bulk, and then gradually become de-
 colorised.       From some of those which had been of a globular form for
 some time long delicate beaded processes were observed to pass.
    Kolliker* found that solutions of urea of 15 per cent- and upwards
                                                           " The coloured blood-
 produced similar changes in frog's blood.
 corpuscles became gradually more jagged, and some became trans
 formed into the most beautiful stellate cells with at most three to six
tolerably long and more flask-like processes. The latter began as it
 were to dissolve and disappear, partly by their margins being dissolved,
 and partly by small coloured particles being detached from their surface.
 These particles at once became pale and gradually disappeared. At
last there remained only the nucleus-containing                portion of the cell.
as a    small,   round, dark  red, refractive  globule,  which   eventually became
pale, and which, even to the nucleus,            disappeared without         leaving    a
trace behind."
    Prcyer agrees that the above description is accurate, with the
exception of the part which refers to their becoming pale, which
Preyer ascribes to the action of water.                Indeed, Preyerf obtained
similar results by allowing drop   a       of solution   of urea to evaporate on a
slide and then placing a drop of blood upon the thin crystalline layer
of uiea thus formed.           The results he obtained are carefully figured,
and they agree exactly with the results we have obtained.
    The interest which attaches to the solvent action of urea is consider
able, but the remarkable           variety of shapes and the detaching of
droplets from the corpuscles are also interesting, more especially                     as
urea is only one of a number of reagents which cause a similar                        re
action.
    We propose to continue our observations upon the effects of the
foregoing and other reagents upon human blood or mammalian blood
generally, which will form Part II.

          On a hitherto unobserved Resemblance between Carbonic
           Acid and Bisulphide of Carbon."                    By JOHN TYNDALL,
           F.R.S. Received March 15, 1883.
      Chemists are ever on the alert to notice analogies and resemblances
  in the atomic structure of different bodies. They long ago indicated
  points of resemblance between bisulphide of carbon and carbonic
  acid. In the case of the latter we have one atom of carbon united
  to two of oxygen, in the case of the former one atom of carbon united
  to two of sulphur. Attempts have been made to push the analogy
   still further by the discovery of a compound of carbon and sulphur
  analogous to carbonic oxide, but hitherto, I believe, without success.
   I  have now to note a resemblance of some interest to the physicist,
  and of a more subtle character than any hitherto observed.
      When, by means of an electric current, a metal is volatilized and
   subjected to spectrum analysis, the " reversal
                                                              " of the bright band of
   the incandescent vapour is commonly observed. This is known to be
   due to the absorption of the rays emitted by the hot vapour in the
   partially cooled envelope of its own substance which surrounds it.
    The effect is the same in kind as the absorption by cold carbonic acid
    of the heat emitted by a carbonic oxide flame. For most sources of

 radiation carbonic acid is one of the most transparent of gases ; for
 the radiation from the hot carbonic acid produced in the carbonic
 oxide flame, it is the most opaque of all.
    Again, for all ordinary sources of radiant heat, bisulphide of carbon,
 both in the liquid and vaporous form, is one of the most diathermanous
 bodies known.        I thought it worth while to try whether a body re
 puted   to be  analogous to carbonic acid, and, like it, so pervious to most
 kinds of heat, would show any change of deportment when presented
 to the radiation from hot carbonic acid.                Does the analogy between
 the two substances extend to the vibrating periods of their atoms ?
 If it does, then the bisulphide, like the carbonic acid, will abandon its
 usually transparent       character, and play the part of an opaque hotly,
 when presented to the radiation from the carbonic oxide flame.                    This
 proves to be the case.        Of the radiation from hydrogen, a thin layer
 of bisulphide transmits 90 per cent., absorbing only 10.                     For the
radiation from carbonic acid, the same layer of bisulphide transmits
only 25 per cent., 75 per cent, being absorbed.                     For this source of
rays, indeed, the bisulphide transcends, as an absorbent, many sub
stances which, for all other sources, far transcend it.*

    This paper treats of the motions                of electricity    produced in a
spherical condnctor by any electric or magnetic operations outside it.
The investigation was undertaken some time ago in illustration of
Maxwell's theory of electricity. This theory is so remarkable, more
especially in the part which it assigns to dielectric media in the
 propagation of electro-magnetic effects, that it seemed worth while to
attack some problem in which all the details of the electrical pro
cesses could be submitted to calculation,                 although it was evident
   * Nearly twenty   years ago  I  observed, among other changes of diathermic position,
the reversal of bisulphide of carbon and chloroform, when the pale blue flame of a
Bunsen burner was the source of heat. "When, for example, the rays issued from a
luminous jet of gas, the absorptions of the bisulphide and of chloroform were found to
be 9 8 and 12 per cent, respectively ; whereas when the Bunsen flame was employed,
the absorptions of the same two substances were       ll'l  and 6'2 per cent. The cause
of this reversal doubtless is that in the Bunsen flame hot carbonic acid is the prin
cipal radiant.   (" Phil. Trans.,"   1864, p. 352.)— April 6.

beforehand from the researches of Helmholtz* and others that tha
results (so far as they are peculiar to the theory) would be of far too
subtle a character         to admit of comparison with experiment.               In
studying the mathematical character of the problems above stated                   I
was led to a certain system of formulae, which            I have since utilised in
two communications to the London Mathematical Society,! and which
seem    likely to be of use in a great variety of physical questions.
    The first section consists mainly of a recital of the fundamental
equations and of the conditions to be satisfied at the surface of a
conductor. It is assumed, in the first instance, that the magnetic
susceptibility of the conductor is zero.
    In § 2 is introduced the assumption that all our functions vary as
i*1, where t is the time, and X a constant.          It is pointed out that this
assumption is sufficiently general.           The fundamental equations are
then put into a mathematically convenient form.                  Before, however,
proceeding to apply these equations as they stand, I examine the effect
of assuming that the velocity (») of propagation of electro-magnetic
effects in the medium surrounding the conductor is practically infinite.
This assumption, which has been made by all writers (including
 Maxwell himself) who have applied Maxwell's theory to ordinary
electro-magnetic phenomena, greatly simplifies the calculations with
out sensibly impairing the practical value of the results.              If L stand
 for a linear dimension of the conductor and p for its specific resist
 ance, it will appear in the sequel that when, as in all practical cases,
 X is small as compared with r/L, the error introduced by the assump
 tion in question is of the order \pjvi.            For any ordinary metallic
 condnctor, and for any value of X which can be appreciated experi
 mentally, this fraction is excessively minute.
    In § 3 the solutions of our equations (on the assumption above
 indicated)       are given in the form appropriate              to our present
 problem.       These solutions are of two distinct types.            Those of the
 first type, which are much the more important from an experimental
 point of view, have (I find) been discussed, though by a different
 method, by Professor C. Niven, in a paper recently published.               J    As
 the points to which attention has been directed are for the most part
 sufficiently distinct in the two investigations, I have allowed the
 corresponding portions of my paper to stand.
     In § 4 I discuss the case of electric currents started anyhow in the
 sphere, and left to themselves.         The equation which gives the moduli
 of the natural modes of decay of the first type agrees with the result
 obtained by Professor Niven.

   In  § 5 is studied the case of induced currents.     Since any disturb
ance in the field (however arbitrary) can be expressed, as regards the
time, by a series of simple harmonic terms, it is sufficient to consider
the case when the variations in the inducing system follow the simple
harmonic law. This case has, moreover, acquired a special interest
since the invention of the telephone.      The two extreme cases, where
the period of the variation in the field is very large or very small in
comparison with the time of decay of free currents in the sphere, are
discussed in some detail.
   In § 6 the case of a thin spherical shell is briefly examined.
   I next proceed to investigate what modifications must be introduced
into the methods and the results of the preceding sections when the
substance of the sphere is susceptible of magnetisation.     This occupies
§§7,8,9,10.
   In the remaining sections of the paper    I investigate the solution of
our fundamental equations, taking account of the finite value of r.
The corrections to our former results are of most interest in the
solutions of the second type.     Although the preceding theory, based
on the assumption v=x> , is sufficient for all purposes of compa
rison with experiment, there are certain processes of (at all events)
theoretical interest of which it fails altogether to give an account,
viz., all those cases in which any change in the superficial electrifica
tion of the sphere takes place. For the expression of these the
solutions of the second type are appropriate.     There is no difficulty in
working out the requisite formulae, but in the application to the case
of free motion a difficulty of interpretation arises, which is noticed in
the proper place.

   In  this paper the result of a systematic examination of the bile ami
various extracts of the livers of Mollusca and Arthropoda, and of the
pyloric or radial Caeca and other appendages of the digestive system
of Echinodermata is described.        The universal distribution of one
 colouring-matter, which by appropriate experiments is shown to be a
chlorophyll pigment, is proved. It occurs in the above organs and can
 be detected in the bile of specimens of Helix after a six months' fast ;

 1883.]           of the so-called Bile of Invertebrates,    fyc.          133
 for this colouring-matter, since it is found in the appendages of the
 enteron, the name enterochlorophyll is proposed. The slight differences
observable    in different    cases are shown to be due to the probable
greater   or  less amount     of  the usual chlorophyll constituents, — -blue
chlorophyll, yellow chlorophyll, and chlorof ucine, — and the presence of
xanthophyll, lutein or tetronerythrin.           Enterochlorophyll is shown
to be   much more abundant in the livers of Mollusca and in Echinoder-
mata than     in Crustacea, as the livers of the last generally contain
more lutein, or sometimes tetronerythrin.
   The presence of reduced hernatin is also demonstrated in the bile
of the crayfish and     in several pulmonate Mollusca, and its respiratory
and   other uses discussed.
   The conclusions which           these observations   and others  led to are
summed     up as follows : —
   (1.) The existence       of enterochlorophyll in the so-called liver, or
other appendages of the enteron in Invertebrates is definitely esta
blished.
   (2.) This pigment occurs in greatest            abundance    in Mollusca, it
 occurs less frequently in Arthropoda, and       its presence in Vermes is not
 proved.
   (3.)  The pyloric     caeca  of starfishes contain it in great abundance,
also  the intestinal    appendages of Echinus, which fact shows that the
former function like the so-called liver of other Invertebrates.
   (4.) The bile of the crayfish and that of pulmonate Mollusca contains
hffimochromogen ; in the latter it is generally accompanied by entero
chlorophyll, and appears to be concerned more in aerial than aquatic
respiration.
   (5.) The so-called liver of Invertebrates is a pigment-producing and
storing organ, as well as being concerned in the preparation of a
digestive   ferment.
   (6.) The presence of hsemochromogen in the bile of Invertebrates
is apparently     determined by their mode of living ; and it does not
appear to be distributed according to purely morphological con
siderations.
   The remainder of the paper deals with vertebrate bile pigments, and
contains    some observations on abuormal urinary colouring-matters
mainly with regard to their spectroscopy.           The various bile pigments
of Stadeler are first dealt with, and some remarks on the bile spectra of
animals   follow ; here it is shown that urobilin can be extracted from
the   liver of Salamandra tnaculata by means of alcohol, that it is
absent from reptilian bile during hibernation, and that the liver of
fishes may contain        tetronerythrin which can be extracted from it
by suitable solvents.       The latter fact suggests an analogous function
 to that of the liver of Invertebrata.

and since in that case its origin could be traced to blood pigment,
the origin of biliverdin from blood pigment is demonstrated.
   The identity of stercobilin and hydrobilirubin got by the action of
nascent hydrogen on bilirubin is proved, and a difference between
them and febrile urobilin shown to exist.
   The statement that the absorption bands of sheep bile are the same as
those which occur in Gmelin's reaction is shown to be erroneous, and
a brief description of the method of isolating the colouring-matter of
sheep bile and the wave-lengths of its different solutions given.    Chlo
rophyll is shown to be absent.
   Under the head of urinary pigments, it is shown that the feeble
bands described by me in a former paper in the spectrum of febrile
 urobilin are not due to impurities, but are as much part of the
spectrum as thm band at F.        Urohaematin, and its difference from
hsematoporphyrin     and its pathological significance are discussed.    A
simple method for the detection of indican in urine, some remarks on
uroerythrin, on a peculiar red colouring-matter in pale urine, some
what like urrhodin, follow. The deductions from this part of the
paper cannot be very well given in the form of conclusions, and
are therefore scattered throughout the paper.

 most important absorption spectra described, accompany the paper.

     The errors        in the Lunar Theory have    beeD traced to the effects            of
changes        in the unit of time, which have, apparently unconsciously,
been       introduced from time to time into astronomy, with changes in
theadopted data.
  The argument is clearly seen by a consideration of the different
expressions for the longitudes of, what may be called, the mean sun,
which have been adopted          for the determination of the sidereal times
at mean        noon.
     If B, H, and V     denote the longitudes of the mean sun, according

  In all these expressions the unit of time has been supposed to be a
Julian year of 365-25 mean solar days.
   The constant differences 7"408 and 7"439 in B— Hand B—V are
not unimportant, for they introduce abrupt changes in the record of
time but the differences in the coefficients of

force an agreement between his theory and observations reduced with
Bessel's unit 1 ; and his tables, therefore, represented the observations
well for many years whilst 1 was adopted as the unit of time ; but
directly the unit of time was changed by the adoption either of H or
V, then the effects of the erroneous determination of the moon's meau
motion by Hansen became apparent.                    The change of error in longi
tude of Hansen's Lunar Tables between 1864, when Le Verrier's
 Solar Tables were adopted in the Nautical Almanac, and 18-0
 amounts to more than 10".
     The effect of tho change of unit is also shown in the comparison of
 Le Verrier's Solar Tables with observation, but, of course, only to
 about the thirteenth part of the amount shown by the Lunar Tables.
     The necessity of adopting some definite unit of time, by fixing the
 constants in the expression lor the longitude of the mean sun, is
 insisted upon.
     If L0 + >i0t + s0t3 is the expression adopted for the longitude of the
 mean sun, the quantities L0, w0, «0 must never be changed.                           The
 correction £L, which from time to time may appear necessary to
 obtain the mean longitude of the sun from the longitude of the mean
 sun, must not be allowed to change the adopted values of Lq, «0, and
 »0.
        The true longitude of the sun will then

   In this paper the author shows that no conclusions with respect to
the  atomic weight of glucinum can be drawn from analogy of its com
pounds with those of other metals, and that this long-disputed ques
tion can only be decided by the specific heat of the metal or by the
vapour-density of some of its volatile compounds.          Two determina
tions of the specific heat have been made by Professor E. Reynolds
 and by M. Nilson, the former of whom obtained a result of about 0-6,
and the latter only about 04.      The probable inaccuracies in Professor
Reynolds' apparatus are pointed out, and it is shown that his metal
was probably impure.
   The author has prepared metallic glucinum from the chloride, the
vapour of which was passed over sodium contained in iron boats in a
glass tube.     A metal was thus obtained which had the composition : —

   The specific    heat was determined     by a modification of Regnault's

found to be 0'4231, and with the following results : —

and with a mean error of 0'8 per cent. Making a correction for the
impurities contained in the metal, its true specific heat would be
0-4453, whence      if the atomic weight is 13'65, the atomic heat becomes
6"08.     This must, therefore, be the true atomic weight, and not two-
thirds of this, or 9*1.
    The number found by Nilson was somewhat lower than this (0-4079),
and the above results may be slightly too high, firstly from hygroscopic
moisture, and secondly from heat produced when the liquid was absorbed
by the porous metal.          About 0'66 gramme of the metal was used for
the determinations, and it was compressed to a compact disk in a steel
mortar.

    Among the collections of the late Sir Wyville Thomson, a small
 Comatula has recently been discovered which was dredged by the
 "Challenger" at a depth of 1,800 fathoms in the Southern Sea.
 Although it is unusually small, the diameter of the calyx being only
 2 millims., the characters presented by this form are such as to render
it by far the most remarkable among all the types of recent Crinoids,
 whether stalked or free. The name proposed for it is Thaumatocrinus
re8ovatus.
    It   has only five arms, and in this respect resembles Eudioerinu*.
 But   the basals, instead of becoming transformed into a rosette as in
 that genus, persist on the exterior of the calyx and form a closed ring
 of relatively large plates, which rest upon the centrodorsal.           They
 support    a ring   of   ten  plates, five of  which,  alternating  with the
 basals, bear the arms and are therefore the radials. These radials.
 however, do not meet one another laterally ; for they alternate with
 five plates slightly smaller than themselves, which rest upon the

 1883.J            Oil a New     Crinoid from    the  Southern Sea.             139
basals, and,     with one exception, terminate in a free edge at the margin
of the disk.       The exception is the interradial of the anal side, which
bears a short and tapering armlike appendage of five or six joints.                It
has no special relation to the anal tube, the lower part of which, like
the peripheral portion of the disk, bears a pavement of anambnlacral
plates. But the centre of the disk is occupied by a relatively large
and substantial oral pyramid, so that the disk in its general aspect
resembles that of Hyocrinus.
     Thaumatocrinus is thus distinguished by four striking peculi
arities :— 4
     (1.) The presence      of  a closed  ring of basals upon the exterior of
the calyx.
     (2.) The persistence      of the oral plates of the larva,    as in Hyocrinus
and     RMzocrinus.
     (3.) The separation      of the primary radials by interradials which rest
on the basals.
     (4.) The presence      of an arm-like appendage on the interradial plate
of the     anal side.
     Taking these in order —
     (1.) No adult Comatula,          except the recent Atelecrinus and some
 little   known    fossils, has a closed ring of basals ; and even in Atele-
tr4mu     they are quite small and insignificant.
     (2.) In all recent Comatulce, in the Pentacrinidee and in Bathycrinu*,
the oral plates of the larva become resorbed                   as maturity is ap
proached.        In Thaumatocrivus, however, they are retained, as in
Hyocrinus,      Rhizocrinns,    and Holopus, representatives of three different
families of Neocrinoids.
     (3.) There is no Neocrinoid, either stalked or free, in which the
primary radials remain permanently separated as they are in Thauma-
twiuiM, and for a short time after their first appearance in the larva
of ordinary Crinoids.           The only Palaeocriuoids presenting this feature
are certain of the Rhodocrinidce (as understood               by Wachsmuth and
Springer), e.g., Reteocrinus, Rfiodocrinus, Thylacocrinus, &c.               In the
two     latter, and in the other genera which have been grouped together
with them into the section Rhodocriniles               (W. and S.), there is a
single     interradial intervening between every two radials, and resting
on a basal just as in Thaumatocrinus.                But in the Lower Silurian
Reteocrinus (of Billings; emend W. and S.) the interradial areas
contain a large number of minute pieces of irregular form and
arrangement.
     (4.)   It is only, however, in Reteocrinus, and in the allied genus
Xenocrinus,      Miller, which is also of Lower Silurian age,* that an anal
appendage       similar to that of Thaumatocrinut is to be met with.
    * Reteocrinus
                    occurs in the Trenton Limestone of Ottawa and in the Hudson
River Group of     Indiana and Ohio.    Xenocrinus has as yet been found in the latter

       Flower, F.R.S. Received March 30, 1883.
                                    (Abstract.)
  Three distinct forms of eye exist in the Arthropoda the Compound ;
eye, the Simple Ocellus, and the less known Compound Ocellus,
common     in larval insects, first described by Dr. Landois.
   The relationship of the Compound eye to the Simple Ocellus   shown        is
to be very distant, although   believe that these two types have been
                                  I
evolved from a common but very rudimentary primitive type.     On the
other hand, that between the Compound e34e and the Compound
Ocellus of a larval insect,      very close, the Compound eye being
                                   is
merely  an  aggregation  of a great number of these ocelli, variously
modified in the more highly differentiated Insects and Crustaceans.                    A
fourth form of eye exists, in which the Ocelli are less closely uuited                  :
this forms a connecting link between the compound eye and the
compound ocellus.    It found in the Isopods, and may be conveniently
                           is
termed the Aggregate       eye.
     The Simple Ocellus consists        essentially   of   a     pigmented    capsule,
behind a convex corneal           lens, containing a cellular vitreous, which
is    separated from     the    retina by a fine fibrous membrane. The
retina itself   a layer of Bacilla, comparable with those of Jacob's
                is
membrane in the Vertebrate, except that the highly refractive outer
segments of the rods are turned towards and not away from the
refractive media.   The fibrous membrane, between the rods and the
group only. I    cannot help suspecting that a better knowledge of this type will    lead
to its absorption into Seteocriaus. — 1'. H. C.

vitreous, is attached around its periphery to a structure which bears a
strong resemblance to a ciliary muscle.            This is enclosed in a ring-like
sinus,    which    surrounds    the   ocellus almost as the canal of Petit
runB round      the lens  of  a Vertebrate.      The vitreous is composed of a
single layer of cuboid or prismatic cells, each with a nucleus near its
inner extremity.        These cells extend from the inner surface of the
 corneal lens to the outer surface of the fibrous membrane.
    The Compound eye has a lenticular cornea beneath which the
crystalline cones and great rods are placed.            These are separated from
the deeper nervous        structures by a membrane comparable with the
fibrous membrane of the Simple Ocellus ; I have named this membrane
the Membrana Basilaris.
    The Membrana Basilaris is usually attache! to the Cornea by an
inflected ring of integnment, the Scleral Ring, so that the Crystalline
Cones and the Great Rods are entirely enclosed in a case.                      I have
called all these structures the Dioptron, and have come to the
conclusion that they are all Dioptric in function.                They apparently
correspond to the Cornea, Vitreous and Fibrous membrane of the
 Simple Ocellus.
    The Membrana Basilaris, like the fibrous membrane, has a sinus
 around its periphery, and is connected with the inflected integu
mentary ring by fibres, which have a disposition similar to those of a
 ciliary muscle.
    The Dioptron is nourished by Lymph Sinuses, which carry the
circulating fluid from the Aorta* into the interior of the Dioptron and
 permit its exit into the common lymph spaces of the head.
    Beneath the Dioptron is a nervous structure of great complexity ;
 this I have named the Neuron.
    The Neuron consists of a Retina, an Optic Nerve, and an Optic
Ganglion.
    The Retina is       essentially a layer of rod-like bodies, Bacilla, sup.
ported    by a delitate Neuroglia. The Bacilla are similar to the rods
 and cones of a Vertebrate in size, in form, and in structure, each has
 an outer highly refractive, and an inner protoplasmic segment.                     In
 some cases the outer segment is double, like that of the twin cones of
 fishes.                            I
           In other specimens have detected a Lenticulus between the
 segments.       As in the Simple eye the highly refractive segments are
 turned towards the Dioptric media.
     A. layer of cells has been also demonstrated             between the Basilar
 membrane and Bacilla ; these in the majority of insects send pigmented
 fringes inward, between the outer segments of the Bacilla.                       The
 fringes are wanting in the diurnal flies, they represent the pigment
 layer of the Vertebrate retina.
     I have spoken of the parts which underlie a single corneal
           * I have eo designated the anterior extremity of the dorsal vessel.

142                       Mr. B. T. Lowne.         On  the           [Apr.  12,
Lenticulus as a segment of the Dioptron. In many insects, especially
in the larva, each segment has a distinct Retinnla, consisting of a
small bundle of Bacilla, which is connected with the ganglion by a
distinct nerve enclosed in a separate pigmented sheath.                 I  have
named this form of retina Segregate.             In other insects the retina is
continuous over       the  inner  surface   of the  Basilar membrane, but is
connected with the deeper structures by a number of separat- nerve
bundles ; whilst in the most highly developed Insects, a single
decussating nerve connects a continuous retina with the ganglion.
 The ganglion consists of several nuclear and molecular layers, which
 are extremely like the corresponding layers of the retina of a
 Vertebrate.
    All the structures of the Dioptron are developed from the cellular
 Hypoderm, whilst all the structures of the Neuron are formed from a
 solid papilla, or from a number of papilla? which are outgrowths
 from the Cephalic Ganglia, so that in this respect there is ground for
 a morphological comparison of the Dioptron with the dioptric struc
 tures, and of the Neuron with the nervous structures of the eye of a
 Vertebrate.
     The Compound Ocellus of the larval insect is merely a single
 segment of a compound eye, with all the apparatus of the Dioptron
 and Neuron.         I have used the term compound in relation to the
 refractive apparatus.        The Neuron consists of a single bundle of
 Bacilla connected with the ganglion by a separate nerve bundle.
     For several years I sought in vain for an explanation of the
 manner in which the compound eye could serve the purpose of
 vision.     I  discarded all the theories hitherto advanced, as being
 defective,   and   incapable of explaining the phenomena, consistently
 with the structure of the Great Rods.
     Two years ago, whilst examining the recent eye of a small moth
  (Pterophorus), I was surprised to observe that the structure of the Great
  Rods was very different to anything with which I had previously been
  acquainted.      The inner extremities of the Great Rods have been
  named Spindles, and are well known to present a very remarkable
  structure.
     I first observed, in this moth, that the Spindles are, during life,
  large ovoid bodies, filled with transparent highly refractive fluid; the
  slightest injury gave rise to the escape of the fluid and left the
   Spindles in a shrivelled condition, the usual appearance of these
  bodies.
     A further investigation     has shown me that all compound eyes when
  nninjured    have   similar ovoid   Spindles. These organs appear to act
  as magnifying and erecting lenses.            Their anterior foci correspond
  to the position of the subcorneal       images, and the posterior foci   with
  the Bacillar layer of the retina.

  1883.]      Structure and Functions      of  the   Eyes  of Arthropoda.       143
     It  is well known      that   if an object-glass   is placed in the reversed
  position beneath the stage of a microsoope, and the instrument
 is then focussed for its posterior focal plane, it can be used as
 a telescope.      I   regard the Dioptron        as  an aggregation of similar
optical     arrangements ;     the Corneal   lens corresponds      to the inverted
 objective,    and the Spindle to the microscope.
    I have made and given a series of measurements of the parts of an
insect's eye in support of this view ; the focal lengths of the corneal
lenses,    those of the spindles, and their relative distances, from each
other, as well as the number and size of the corneal images are con
sistent    with this theory.       Therefore   a continuous    picture,  a mosaic of
erect   magnified central portions of the several subcorneal images, falls upon
the   retina, and the sharpness of vision is not necessarily dependent on
the   number of corneal facets.
    The complex        modifications of the Dioptron appeared at first in
many cases to offer insuperable            objections to this view, and this
necessitated a very careful reinvestigation of these structures, more
especially in relation to the changes which they undergo in the pre
paration of sections      for microscopic observation.
    These    researches have shown that many of the modifications
 observed    are due to differences in the nature of the material of which
 the  refractive elements are composed, not only in different genera
 and   families,    but even in the same species in different stages of
development.
    In many cases the refractive media consist of an oil-like fluid,
which is decomposed or dissolved in the process of preparing the
object for microscopic examination ; in other cases                     the media
consist in part at least of practically indestructible Chitin.                 And
farther the great elasticity of the parts gives rise to profound modifi
cations the result of alterations of tension.
   In the first, or introductory portion of my paper,            I  have reviewed
the work of my predecessors with the object of showing the relation
of previous observations         to the theory which I have enunciated.         The
remainder of my communication is divided into four parts.
    I. The Structure and Functions of the Dioptron.
    II. The Strncture and Functions of the Neuron.
   III. The Development of the Compound Eye.
   IV. The Morphology of the Eyes of Arthropods.
                I. The Structure and Functions of the Dioptron.
   In this portion of my paper the structure of the Dioptron                      is
described, and      its relation to the views    I have adopted is discussed.
   Perhaps the most important additions to our knowledge of this
organ has been the discovery of the very important part played by
the oil-like fluid already alluded to.        This fluid is easily decomposed,

144       Structure and Functions     of Eyes of A rthropoda.      [Apr.  12,
and resolved     into a reddish granular precipitate and a transparent
fluid, which mixes readily with water and saline solutions ; it is
blackened by osmic acid, and rapidly dissolved by ether, oil of cloves,
and, though less rapidly, by alcohol.
   A subcorneal lens has long been recognised in the eyes of Isopods.
and has been regarded as a modified crystalline cone. Miiller believed
a similar lens to be present in the compound eyes of some insects.
Of late this lens has been overlooked ;     I have, however, found that it
really exists in the majority of Arthropods.            It consists of the
oil-like  fluid just spoken   of, enclosed in an elastic capsule.    It gives
the Cornea the peculiar brilliancy which it posseses during life.         The
fluid contents   of the lens is permeated by a more    or less dense  stroma,
which, when the oil is rapidly dissolved, by reagents, splits into four
parts.    These   are the bodies described    by Claparede     as
                                                                  " Semper'i
nuclei."
   In   some insects   the lens can be isolated, and its capsule can then
bo ruptured by pressure on the thin cover-glass, so that the escape of
the fluid can be actually observed.         The empty capsules are then
seen to be finely   wrinkled, and usually torn by a single fissure.
   In  some insects    the lens is developed from the cornea, in others
from the outer portion of the crystalline cone.
   The Spindles of the Great Rods also consist chiefly of the same
refractive fluid, hence the profound modifications which they undergo
when disturbed for purposes of investigation, or even as the result of
post mortem change.
   The formation of a subcorneal image as well as that of an erect
image on the retina is discussed in this part of my paper, and the
theory is shown by measurements to be in harmony with the actual
conditions which have been observed.
   The remainder of this part of my paper is occupied by a consider
ation of the principal modifications of the Dioptron.
   I have recognised four distinct modifications of the Cornea, three
of which exist in different stages of development in the cockroach.
I have   named these modifications,
   I. Simple Continuous Cornea.
   II. The Facetted     Cornea.
   III. The Kistoid     Cornea.
   The fourth modification is apparently confined, amongst insects,
to the imago condition in the Gnats; in these the cornea consists of
the crystalline cones of the nymph united to each other by a thin
cuticular lamina.      I have used the term lenticular to distinguish this
form of cornea.
     I  have incorporated such knowledge as      I  have been able to glean
with regard to the development of the cornea and subcorneal lens
with this section of my paper.

described ; these afford an exceedingly             difficult problem, on which
further work will undoubtedly throw much light, especially in rela
tion to the morphology of this organ.               Some details with regard to
the structure of the Great Bods are also added, which did not find a
place in the general description of the Dioptron.
                 II.  The Anatomy and Functions of the Neuron.
    The Neuron consists of three           parts — the Retina, the Optic Nerve,
and the       Optic    Ganglion. The minute structure of these parts is
fully described        in this portion of my paper. The relation of the
nerve fibres to the Bacilla and the Great Rods is also discussed.              The
optic ganglion consists of parts which are clearly comparable                  with
the nuclear and molecular layers of the Vertebrate retina.

 presents features         of extreme interest and importance, especially in
 relation to the phenomena of Ecdysis.            The segregate retina of many
 larvas is entirely replaced at the final Ecdysis by a newly formed
 retina,    which is continuous, so that it appears as if a kind of
 internal Ecdysis affecting the epithelial elements of the nervous
 system occurs with the general integumental Ecdysis.

   Modern research has shown that, besides the well-known carbo
hydrate principles such as sugar, &c, there are several dextrins
distinguishable by their optical properties and their cupric oxide
reducing power.
   From the- colloidal principle starch, which has no cupric oxide
reducing power, principles (dextrins) are producible by the action         of
ferments possessing gradually increasing cupric oxide reducing power
until maltose     reached, which constitutes
                 is                              the final product, and
which possess little more than half the cupric oxide reducing power
                 a
of glucose.
   This    one foundation point connected with the researches
          is                                                       bave

been conducting upon the physiology of the carbohydrates in the
animal system.

                                is

acid and heat.                              •
  Proceeding upon these facts, and taking the cupric oxide reducing
power before and after subjection to the converting action of sulphnric
acid and heat,   I    have prosecuted
                                    investigations upon the transfor
mation of the carbohydrates    within the animal system with the
result of acquiring knowledge of an altogether unexpected nature.
  Hitherto what has been observed as regards the transformation            of
carbohydrates  by the action of ferments and chemical agents, has
been  a change attended with increased hydration — for example, the
passage of starch into the successive forms of dextrin and maltose

   From the mucous membrane of the alimentary canal a ferment              is
obtainable which converts (1) glucose into a body possessing the
same kind of cupric oxide reducing power as maltose         ;(2) cane-

starch either into maltose or a dextrin of low cupric oxide reducing

   The presence of carbonate of soda modifies the action of a maltose-
forming ferment, and leads to starch passing into a dextrin of low
cupric oxide reducing power instead of into maltose.
   The portal blood contains a ferment which possesses a maltose or
a dextrin-producing power, and the contents of the portal system
during digestion are charged with a notable amount of maltose some
times, and at other times   low cupric oxide reducing dextrin.

     After the introduction of glucose into the circulatory system, I have
observed     the presence of maltose.
    The liver also contains a ferment capable, under certain conditions,
of carrying glucose into maltose, and I have further witnessed, by the
same kind of action as the sugars and dextrins are moved from
one to the other, the conversion      of a carbohydrate into the colloidal
material belonging to the animal system (glycogen) which holds the
analogous position of starch in the vegetable kingdom.
    Evidence has likewise been supplied that by an action of the same
nature as that which moves the carbohydrates        from one to the other
in the carbohydrate      group, they are, under certain conditions, carried
into a body out of the group, and thence not susceptible of being
brought into glucose by the converting action of sulphuric acid ; and,
on the other hand, under other conditions, a substance is brought into
the carbohydrate      group, and its nature made recognisable by the con
verting action of sulphuric acid and its cupric oxide reducing power.
    The subject as it even now presents itself is a large one, and I
 propose to deal with it in detail in a series of communications.      The
 first will be devoted to that which refers to the alimentary canal.

    The authors describe     a method    of taking photographs of diffraction
 spectra produced by a small Rutherfurd speculum ruled with 17,460
 lines to the inch. The lines in the spectra were accurately measured
 by the aid of a microscope magnifying 25 diameters and a dividing
 engine.
    The length of the spectra which were taken on three different pistes
 was 14 to 15 inches, and the measuremen8s were accurate to the y^j5^
 of an inch.    From these measurements the wave-lengths of the lines
 were calculated.     The spectra include lines with wave-lengths 4674
 and 2024. They were produced by electric sparks condensed by a
 pane of glass coated with tin-foil.
    Of the electrodes used, one always consisted of cadmium, the other
 of the metal or the solution of the metal, or other elementary
substance, the wave-lengths of the lines of which was to be determined ;
thus all the spectra were referable to the cadmium lines. Great
accuracy is attainable by this method, and lines which have appeared
identical or coincident in two different spectra, have thus been proved
to differ in refrangibility.
    All the spectra were compared with spectra obtained with the prism
spectroscope described by one of the authors in the
                                                                  " Scientific

were    not varnished.      A certain number    of lines measured by previous
observers have been compared with the new measurements.                Taking
the numbers given by Thalen, Lecoq de Boisbaudran, and Comu for
150 lines     in the spectra of magnesium, zinc, cadmium, aluminium,
indium, thallium, iron, &c, a close agreement with their measurements
affords satisfactory evidence of the accuracy of these determinations.
Besides    the wave-length, a very careful description of the appearance
of each line is given, together with its linear measurement indicating
its   position on a series of photographs obtained with the prism
spectroscope, which series of photographs is presented with the paper.
A distinction is drawn between those lines determined directly with
the grating and others too faint to be seen on diffraction photographs,
which were measured by the aid of the prism spectroscope and an
interpolation curve 9^ metres in length. The total number of lines
 measured and described is 2307, namely : — Magnesium, 42; zinc, 151 ;

 IL "On the Limiting Thickness of Liquid Films."                   By A. W.

                                    (Abstract.)
     The previous investigations of the authors have shown that the
  specific electrical resistance of a soap film thicker than 374 X 10-0
  mm. is independent       of the thickness, and that the composition       of
  films formed    of M. Plateau's " liquide glycerique " may be largely
  altered by the absorption or evaporation          of aqueous vapour which
  attends even slight changes in the temperature or hygrometric state
  of the air
              (" Phil. Trans.," Part II, 1881, p. 447).
     In the present paper they describe a modified form of the apparatus
   which they previously employed.         The glass case in which the films
   are produced is surrounded      by water, and additional precautions are
   adopted for maintaining the aqueous vapour within it at the tension
   proper to the liquid of which the films are formed.          These changes

 150           On   the  Limiting Thickness of Liquid Films.               [Apr.  19,
 have entailed considerable alterations         in details, but the main features
                          4
 of   the   apparatus       remain    unaltered.     The new form, however.
 possesses the important advantage that the temperature and hygro-
 mctric state of the air in contact with the films can be kept perfectly
 constant during the progress of the experiments.                     With this ap
 paratus    a  number       of  measures     have  been    made of the electrical
 resistance of films which have thinned sufficiently to show the black
 of the first order of Newton's rings. The chief interest of these lie*
 in the information which they afford as to the thickness of such films.
 To deduce the thickness from the resistance, it is necessary to assume
 that the specific resistance of the films is the same as that of the liquid
 in mass. The authors' previous experiments do not enable them to
 assert the truth of this assumption for such thin films, and it was
 therefore important to ascertain by an independent method whether it
might be taken as approximately true.                                           .
    .For this purpose between 50 and 60 plane films were formed in a
glass tube 400 mm. long, and 18 mm. in internal diameter.                         The
 tube was closed by pieces of plate glass, and placed in the path of
one of the interfering rays in a Jamin's " interferential refractometer."
When the films had become black, a known number were broken br
bringing an electromagnet near to the tube, and thus moving some
sewing needles, which had been enclosed along with the films. The
mean thickness of the films was deduced from the displacement of the
                             "
interference " fringes caused by their rupture.               For reasons given in
the paper two tubes were used.              One was placed in the path of each
of the interfering rays, and the mean of the values obtained by
breaking the films in each tube in turn was taken as the result of the
experiment.
    Two liquids were observed, viz., M. Plateau's " liquide glycerique,'4
and a soap solution containing no glycerine.               Details are given in the
paper.      The following are the means of the various groups of
observations.

    The agreement between these numbers is sufficiently close to make
the fact that they are approximately correct unquestionable, and to
prove that the mean thickness of a black film is nearly the same for
both liquids.

    The      electrical   observations   afford   a  means  of comparing the
thicknesses of different black films, and observing whether the
thickness of the black portion of any particular film alters as its area
increases.       The results obtained in the paper, and in a previous pre
liminary investigation on the same subject (" Proc. Roy. Soc," 1877,
No. 182, p. 334), are summed up by the authors as follows : —
    (1.) Persistent soap films, which thin sufficiently to exhibit the
black of the first order of Newton's rings, invariably display an
apparent discontinuity in their thickness at the boundary of the black
and coloured portions.
    (2.) The whole of the black region at the time of, or very soon after,
its formation, is of uniform thickness.
    (3.) This thickness remains nnaltered in any film, whether the
coloured parts of the film are thinning^ or thickening, increasing or
diminishing in extent.
     (4.) It is different for different films, bnt no connexion has been
 traced betweeu its magnitude and the time which elapses between the
 first formation of the film and the first appearance of the black, or
 between either of these and the time of observation.
     (5.) The mean values of this thickness are the same to within a
  fraction of a millionth of a millimetre, whether the filmR are plane or
  cylindrical, in contact with metal or with glass, formed of soap
  solution alone, or with the addition of more than two-thirds of it*
  volume of glycerine.
      (6.) Two totally independent methods of measuring the thickness of
  the black portions of the films give concordant results.
      (7.) The mean value of the thickness calculated by giving equal
  weight to the results of the electrical and optical experiments is
  116 X 10-8 mm.              The extreme values were 7"2 x 10-' and
  14 5   X 10-8 mm.
      The smaller of these quantities is therefore a limiting thickness to
  which a soap film in air saturated with the vapour of the liquid from
   which   it is formed rarely attains, and below which none of the films
   observed by ns have thinned.

in the blue.
   3.   A photographic spectroscope, with one prism of a refracting angle
  of 62°, and a length of collimator and camera of           9  inches.
    The general appearance of the corona seemed to the naked eye (of
 Dr. Schuster) not to have been strikingly different to that of the two
 previous eclipses, either in brilliancy or extension, but the photographs
 reveal very essential differences.
    Some time observations were made at the first and last contact, and
 the length of the eclipse was measured to be 74 seconds.
    The second part of the paper gives the results of a careful investi
 gation of all the photographs obtained.
    Three photographs         of the corona itself with different times of
exposure, viz.,  3,    11, and 23 seconds, show a gradual increase in the
extension    of  the  corona.    Care had been taken to fix, by means of
                                                                                    of is a
 wire stretched across the camera, the position of the corona, and             it
believed that the orientation      is    accurate within probably a quarter
a degree.       The photographs show the prominences very well, and
 confirm   the  distiuction which has been drawn between the inner and
 the outer corona.       The shape of the corona was very irregular. A close
 connexion     between    the outline of tho corona and the state of the
 sun's surface  is    placed beyond doubt.          During the time of minimum
 sun-spots   a  great   extension   in  a   direction   approximately coincident
both •with the ecliptic and with the sun's equator           is  observed, and we
 can generally    trace
                      a    distinct line  of  symmetry nearly agreeing with the
 sun's *xis of rotation. In addition to the long equatorial rifts, short
 but sharp rifts appear near the sun8s poles. At times of great solar
 activity these rifts are not seen, nor        is there any symmetry whatever
 in the   general   outline of  the  corona.
    During the present eclipse the photographic impression of one of
the rilts reached to a distance of 1*4 solar diameters away from the
 sun's limb. As regards form and general appearance of the streamers
 two points deserve special notice.            One  is  the remarkable curvature
 of some of the coronal rays.          The rays seem in many cases to start
 almost tangentially from the sun's limb sometimes they are wider
                                                    ;
near the sun's limb, contracting as their distance increases          ;    some of
the   rifts, however,    spread  out  in  a  fan-like fashion.   The  second point
to be noticed   is   the transparency of the streamers   :     in two instances at
least we can trace structural details through the luminous streamers.

 1883.]        Oh   the Total Solar Eclipse  of May   17, 1882.         153
    A drawing      of the corona from   the hands   of Mr. W. M. Baillie
shows a good agreement with tho photographs.
    The position of a comet which appeared during totality, can bo
accurately fixed by means of the photographs.           At 18 h. 24 m. 36 s.
G.M.T., the comet's place was found to be Dec. 18° 34' 59" N.;
R.A. 3 h. 34 m. 43 s.
    An examination of the different photographs shows a slight but
progressive change in the comet's position. This is in part accounted
for by the moon's motion over the solar disk during the eclipse ; but
part of it is very likely due to the proper motion of the comet, which
apparently was receding from the sun during the eclipse.
    Some interesting results were obtained by means of the prismatic
camera.      The strongest impression of the prominences was obtained
in the ring corresponding to the calcium lines H and K.         The hydro
gen lines Ha (C) Hp (F) EL,, (near G) and Hj all appear in the
strongest prominences ; but differences are noticed         in the relative
intensity of some of these lines.       Thus, one prominence is especially
rich in violet light, and shows both Hy and Ha stronger than two
adjacent prominences, which in their turn show a greater intensity
 of Hp.     This can be explained on the supposition that the first men
 tioned prominence was hotter than the others, an explanation which is
 confirmed by the fact that it shows a great number of lines reaching
 far into the ultra-violet. The line (X=5875), which generally goes by
 tlie name of Ds, is also represented in the prominences, and a very
 weak impression of one prominence, corresponding to a wave-length
  5315 (K 1474), can be seen.     One of the prominences shows two lines
 in the infra-red; one of them corresponds very likely to X=8240, the
 other is beyond the limit of the normal spectrum published by one of
 ns.   Besides these well-defined prominences the photograph shows two
 rings, which are evidently due to the lower parts of the corona, and
 therefore correspond to true coronal light.      The wave-length of one
 of these rings is 5315, the well-known corona line ; the second ring
 corresponds to D3.      The yellow ring is much fainter than the green
  one, but more uniformly distributed round the surface of the sun.
     An instantaneous photograph taken about five seconds after the end
  of totality shows still the prominences, and also at the cusps short
  extensions corresponding to the hydrogen lines, and due no doubt to
  the higher parts of the chromospheric    layer.
     The photograph taken with the spectroscopic camera shows close to
  the sun a strong continuous      spectrum, reaching from F to a place
  beyond X 3490 in the ultra-violet.     At some distance away from the
  sun there is a sudden falling off in intensity, but traces of the
   continuous spectrum in the region near G can be seen up to a height
   of 1'47 solar radii on the southern side of the solar disk, and to a
   height of "9 of a solar radius on the northern side.

154         On the Total Solar Eclipse     of May 17,1882.       [Apr.   19,
    A  strong prominence, which was cut by the slit, gives a com
plicated spectrum.     The calcium lines, and especially the lines H aud
K, stand out prominently. Then, as might be expected, all the
hydrogen lines are represented, including those in the nltra-violet,
photographed by Dr. Hnggins in star spectra.          Some unknown lines
bring up the total number of lines photographed to 29.              In the
outer regions of the corona the continuous spectrum is traversed by
the reversal of the solar line G and by a number of faint lines.
About thirty of these coronal lines have been measured.
    In conclusion, we may briefly review the results we have obtained.
The direct photographs of the corona are chiefly of interest in con
nexion with previous and future eclipses, and we believe that those
wo have obtained will be found of value, as they have been taken
during a time of maximum sun-spots, as they extend further than any
photographs previously obtained, and as the position of the corona in
the sky has been fixed by means of them to within a fraction of a
degree.
    The photograph taken with the prismatic camera is of importance
when we come to compare spectra of different prominences, which are
found to give lines with different relative intensities caused no doubt
by differences of temperature.      Two prominence lines in the ultra-red
have been discovered.       It is also proved that the green line of the
corona is a line specially belonging to the corona.        It is only very
faintly present in the prominences, but forms a distinct ring round a
large part of the solar disk.     A faint ring corresponding to D3 is also
seen.
    The photograph of the spectrum of the corona and prominences has
yielded an abundant harvest.         Twenty-nine lines of one prominence
have been photographed,       and the  great importance which the metal
calcium plays in the solar eruptions has been emphasized.             Other
lines well known     hitherto  as chromospheric   lines, but not traced in
the prominences, are now shown to belong to them also, and a number
of unknown lines, especially in the ultra-violet, has beeu added to the
list.
    As regards the corona we may point out that only one line has

the corona seems to have been especially rich in lines.             Thollon
observed some in the violet without being able to fix their position;
and Tacchini could determine the position of four true corona lines
in the red. We have been able to photograph and measure about
 thirty additional lines.

been once more proved by the presence of the dark Fraunhofer set of

IV.    Note on Syringammina, a New Type of Arenaceous Rhizo-
       poda." By Henry B. Brady, F.R.S. Received April 10,

    The specimens to which the following note refers were dredged in
the Faroe Channel in the autumn of last year, during the cruise of
H.M.S. " Triton," and were sent to me for examination by Mr. John
Murray, F.R.S.E., under whose direction the scientific observations of
the expedition were carried out.
    It is now a well-known fact that the region lying between the north
coast of Scotland and the Faroe Islands possesses certain features of
 unusual interest owing to the existence, side by side, of two sharply
defined areas, of which the bottom temperature differs to the extent
of 16° or 17° Fahr. The depth of the two areas is very similar, ranging
from 450 to 640 fathoms, and they are separated by a narrow ridge
having an average depth of about 250 fathoms. The physical aspects
 of this phenomenon have been the subject of much discussion, and
 the biological conditions attendant thereupon are of almost equal
 importance ; indeed, so far as the Rhizopoda are concerned, there are
 few areas of the same extent that have so well repaid the labour of
investigation.     On the "Lightning" Expedition of 1868, super
intended by Dr. Carpenter and Sir Wyville Thomson, the cold area
furnished amongst other interesting organisms, the large Lituoline
 Foraminifer Beophax mbulosa, a form which has since been obtained
 near the same point on the cruise of the " Knight Errant," but has
never been met with elsewhere.       The warm area yielded at the same
 time Astrorhiza armaria, a large sandy species previously unknown to
                                              "
British naturalists. On the " Porcupine         Expedition of 1869, another
modification of the latter genus, Astrorhiza crassatina, was obtained in
the cold area; and near the boundary line an entirely new arenaceous
type was dredged, to which the generic named Botellina has been
assigned by Dr. Carpenter.       From the fact that all the specimens of
the form appeared more or less broken, it has been inferred that the
tests were adherent when living ; but the fragments were abundant,
and consisted of stout tubes, many of them upwards of an inch
in length, the interior being subdivided by a labyrinth of irregular

                                                                           " Knight
Errant,"* the rare genns Storthosphara was found in the warm region,
and in the cold area specimens of Commpira which measured more
than an inch in diameter, rivalling in size the finest of the tropical
Orbitolites, and therefore amongst the largest known Porcellanous
Foraminifera.
   The bottom-dredgings obtained on the cruiRe of the "Triton" in
August and September, 1882, have not been fully examined, bnt the
surface-gatherings made by means of the tow-net are remarkable for
the abundance of the curious pelagic type Hariigerina.                   This genns
had not previously been found living in the British seas, and the
specimens procured were equal in size and beauty to any of those
collected in southern latitudes during the
                                                    " Challenger " voyage.
   Of the Rhizopoda contained in the dredgings, by far the most note
worthy is the arenaceous form which I propose to describe in the
present paper. It may be stated at the outset that two specimens were
secured, but owing to the excessively fragile nature of the organism,
both were in a more or less fragmentary condition, though sufficient
remains to indicate their principal structural features.
   The general appearance of one of the specimens, drawn to the
natural size, is shown in PI. 2, figs. 1, 2, 3 ; the second was too much
broken to be of service except for purposes of dissection.              The figured
specimen   is  about   an  inch   and  a   half (38 millims.)     in  diameter,  and
about eight-tenths of an inch (20 millims.) in thickness, but it is
probable that the latter dimension may not be much more than half
that of the entire organism ; indeed, it is evident that the test when
complete was a rounded mass, which if developed with any degree of
symmetry, must have been a sphere of about an inch and a half
diameter.      The structure revealed by the fractured surfaces is that of
a congeries of branching and inosculating tubes radiating from a
common centre.
   The fragile nature of the investment is due to the fact that the
walls are composed of fine sand with scarcely a trace of inorganic
cement.     In this respect the organism bears a close resemblance to
several   well-known arenaceous Rhizopods, notably to Astrorh'aa
arenaria, but the difference in size renders the absence of incorpo
rating cement a much more noticeable feature ; for whilst the test of
the latter species, though loosely arenaceous, has sufficient strength
and substance to bear handling without injury, that of the present
form will scarcely support its own weight when taken out of water,
and crumbles into a mass of sand on the gentlest attempts at manipu
lation. It is hardly possible to lift even small fiagments by means
of forceps, and the specimen would have been in less satisfactory

condition than they are, were it not that the disintegrated por
tions formed a layer of sand in the bottom of the bottle, partially
embedding the larger pieces.               Owing to this want of cohesion it
has been        found impossible    to prepare thin sections      of any part of
the test.
      The inferior     aspect of the specimen, represented in PI. 2, fig. 1, is
entirely a fractured surface, and is probably something approaching a
median section ; but it is much too uneven to show any regularity of
structure,      except at some points near the periphery. The only portion
remaining of what was originally the exterior of the test is shown in the
side view, fig. 3, at the point marked a.           The convex or "superior"
aspect of the specimen,         as it stands on the plate, exhibits chiefly the
open ends       of the transversly-broken tubes.
      The different portions of the structure examined in detail roveal
 little beyond what may be realised at the first glance.
      The "inferior" surface of the specimen displays somewhat more
 regularity in the radial arrangement of the tubes than could be made
  apparent in the drawing, owing to the unevenness of the fracture.
  The organic        centre appears to have been broken away, and it is
  impossible to say whether there has been originally any true nucleus,
   in the shape of a well-defined primordial            chamber.    The central
   portions, so far as they are left, consist of a network of branching and
   often contorted tubes, of somewhat smaller diameter than those of the
   exterior, and lass regularly disposed (PI. 3, fig. 8).
       Nearer the periphery the system of tubes takes a distinctly radial
   character, and in a favourable           section appears divided into con
   centric layers or tiers of gradually increasing depth (fig. 6).            The
   concentric "partitions" exhibited in the radial section of the test,
    fig. 6, d.d., are not, like the
                                      " labyrinthic layers " of Parkeria, con
   tinuous septa of cancellated        structure, but are formed by lateral
    branches, given off at intervals, which unite so as to produce a more
    or less regular network (fig.
                                        7).    As nearly as can be made out,
    there may have been ten or eleven such reticulated
                                                                 " partitions," at
    intervals varying from -Jj inch (1*26 millims.) near the centre, to
    ts inch (2-5 millims.) near the periphery.
        As already stated the tubes are not of uniform diameter, those near
    the centre measuring sometimes no more than               inch (045 millim.),
     whilst near the exterior they often exceed ^ inch (1 millim.), the
     average diameter being about      J,   inch (0735 millim.).    The external
     surface is granular, but in the dry condition it is tolerably smooth ;
     the interior is smooth and well finished.      The internal cavity whether
     of the radial tubes or the branches is continuous, exhibiting neither
     constrictions, septa, nor labyrinthic subdivision. The thickness of the
      walls is about
                      ^   inch (0125 millim.).
        The peripheral ends of the tubes are rounded, and closed by an

of the test, in precisely the same way as in Astrorhiza arenaria and                    its
immediate allies.    The rounded terminations are shown in the side
view, fig.   3,   at the point marked a   ;   and on   a   larger scale in fig.   5.
  With regard to the animal inhabiting the test, there not mnch          is
to be said. When examined by Mr. Murray, fresh from the dredge,
the tubes were partially filled with dark-coloured sarcode and          ;         in   the
preserved specimens, the peripheral portions of the fragments                         that
have been dissected were in this condition.  Owing to the intermixture
of sand-grains       has been found impossible to examine the tube-
                        it
contents under high magnifying powers, but they appear in                               all
respects similar to the sarcode found in the tests of many of the
larger arenaceous Foraminifera which have been preserved in the same
way, namely, a dark, somewhat firm, granular, gelatinous mass,
which on drying forms nearly black branching threads.
   There can be no doubt that the organism described in the foregoing
paragraphs       the representative of a new type of arenaceous Rhiio-

poda, and the generic term Syringammina (ovpiyl- iyyoi, a pipe, ap/to'.

designation.    In the absence of complete specimens its zoological
characters cannot be fully stated, but the following will serve for                     its
identification.

Murray informs me by letter that the dredge employed on this occa
sion was of very much lighter description than those generally used                    in
deep-sea dredging. It came up with a large quantity of ooze in the
bag, the top layers of which were of pale brown colour, soft
and watery, the deeper layers somewhat compact and of slaty hue.

One        of the specimens rolled ont of the                oozy layer of the deposit
when the dredge was emptied on the deck and broke,                         unfortunately,
in the hands of the sailor who lifted it ; the other was found on
passing the mud through                    the sieves, and when first observed
appeared quite spherical."
     I learn that a somewhat similar specimen was dredged at a depth
of 1000 fathoms off the Azores, during the "Challenger" cruise,
but that it went to pieces in the sieve.*
     A few words must be added respecting the zoological position
 and affinities of the new genus.                 On the whole, Syringammina finds
its nearest allies, so far as living Foraminifera are concerned, in the
deep-sea varieties of Astrorhiza.                   Comparing it with Astrorhiza
arenaria,\ its investing walls are found to be constructed in precisely
the same way of loosely aggregated                 sand, and even in the size of the
grains there is great similarity, though this may be in a measure
 accidental.          But whereas the test of Astrorhiza consists (typically)
 of a few tubes, generally unbranched,                  radiating on one plane from
 a central        cavity or chamber, that of Syringammina is formed of
 a multitude of tubes which radiate nearly equally                      in all directions,
 and have numerous              branches which inosculate freely. In Astrorhiza,
 as in Syringammina, the peripheral ends of the tubes                        serve as the
 general aperture ; and in both the orifices are masked by aggregations
 of loose sand, forming rounded and apparently                   closed terminations.
      The genus Park-ria has already been referred to in describing the
 mode of increase by concentric layers, and both in size and general
 contour there is considerable resemblance between Syringammina and
  the fossil type.          But the similarity of internal structure, apparent on
 a comparison            of some of the drawings now furnished, with the
  illustrations accompanying the original memoir on Parkeria and
 Loftusia.4l ^s mlle11 more remarkable and cannot be passed over with
 out notice.           Owing to the difference iu the magnifying powers
 employed, the resemblance in the drawings is more striking than in
      *  It           of service to those who have the opportunity of dredging, to note
            may be
  that the sandy      skeletons of organisms of this sort may be sufficiently strengthened
  to bear handling by placing the specimens          for a time in strong alcohol, and then
  drying ; afterwards, when thoroughly dry, saturating with a very dilute solution of
  dammar in benzole, and draining on blotting-paper.           The dammar solution should
  be so weak that it does not leave a gloss on the surface of the specimen when
  finished.
      t   M. Sars, Carpenter, and Norman assign these deep-sea sandy forms to the
  <ame genus      as the shallow- water organism, Astrorhiza limicola, which has a chitinous
   investment, coated with soft mud.        I have not disturbed the arrangement, but my
   impression is that they represent two distinct genera.

the specimens          ;   nevertheless    the radiate    tubular     structure and the
concentric arrangement of the parts are features common to both
forms.       On the other hand, the cancellated layers of Parkeria, which
form continuous septa of greater or less thickness, are only repre
sented in Syringammina by an open network of anastomosing tubes.
Mr. Murray has called my attention to the close similarity that
exists between the texture of the natural surface of the recent form,
and that presented by some infiltrated specimens of Parkeria, after
being etched by means of acid.
    Morphologically, however, Syringammina appears to find a closer
parallel in the group of fossil Rhizopods described by Professor Duncan
under the term Syringo8phwrid.ce *                  Of these the test in its typical
condition is a spheroidal body from 1 to 3 inches in diameter, com
posed of radiating tubes open at their peripheral ends.                         The tubes,
which are branched and inosculating, are arranged in conical bundles
radiating from the centre of the test, and the intervening spaces are
filled with an accessory network of branching tubes which present a
variety of characters.             The walls are formed of granular carbonate of
lime.      The tubes of this fossil type are of much smaller diameter
than those of Syringammina, and their association in conical bundles is
a very distinctive feature ; besides which, the test presents no evidence
of concentric structure.
    The material at present available for investigation is insufficient
for any detailed comparison of the structure of these organisms, hut
it is amply sufficient to show that there exist analogies of great
interest between the groups they respectively typify ; and it encourages
the hope that living specimens may yet be found that shall satis
factorily elucidate the still doubtful points in the organization of the
fossil types.

     This paper contains               the results      of researches on butter, cheese,
milk, the cereal foods, bread and lentil flour.
    The author some time ago, as the result of a series of experiments,
indicated that it was probable the soluble and insoluble fatty acids in
batter fat did not exist as simple glycerides, but in the complex form
of compound ethers — palmitic and oleic acids being combined in the
name molecule with butyric acid. The results of a further investigation
into the character of butter fat are given, which tend to confirm this
theory of its constitution.               Butter fat is proved to vary in composi
tion far beyond the limits previously supposed, and a table of repre
sentative samples is given, showing the ordinary variations which
occur.       Ordinary fats are contrasted with butter fat, and it is sug-
    vor,. xxxv.                                                                    m

gested that the latter, from its complex character, probably performs
some more specific office in the system than the former.
    The proximate analyses of ten descriptions of cheese are given, and
the composition of the fat extracted has been determined in each case.
The soluble and insoluble fatty acids are shown to possess the normal
relation existing between these acids in milk fat, a result held to be
inconsistent with the views advanced by some chemists that the
albuminoids become slowly changed into fat.
   Tabular results are given of a wide and comprehensive investi
gation into the variations which occur in the composition of the milk
yielded by different cows under the varying conditions of food and
season. Besides cow's milk, the proximate constituents of other kinds
of milk have been determined, and as the analyses of the whole of the
milks have been conducted on an uniform method, the results will
be found valuable for purposes of comparison.
    The changes which occur in sour milk have been investigated and
the results given, with a statement of the amount of depreciation
which occurs in the non-fatty solids, according to the period for which
the  milk has been kept.
    Tabular results are given of the proximate analyses of the different
cereals, of wheat flour, and of oatmeal, and also a complete analysis of
the ash of each. The proximate constituents of the cereals, &c, have
 been partly determined     on new lines, and partly by an improved
 method of analysis.
     Judging from the variable results obtained by different chemists, the
 author suggests that the saccharine matter appears in some instances to
 have been overlooked, while in others it must have been determined hi
 an aqueous extract of the cereals, without regard to the transforma
 tions which the soluble albuminoids produce in starch and other
 carbohydrates in presence of water.
    The albuminoids of the cereals have been found to possess varying
 degrees of diastatic action in converting starch, rye standing at the
 top, and rice at the bottom of the scale.
    Tabular results of the proximate analyses of aerated and home
 made bread are given ; the changes which occur in flour during the
 baking process have been studied, and the sugar present identified as
 maltose.   The results of a proximate analysis of lentil flour made on
 the same lines as the cereals, are given, and also a complete analysis
 of the ash of lentils.

                                  (Abstract.)
    In this paper   the author selects from a series of fossils  transmitted
from     Australia since the communication of the 1st February, 1883,
the pelvis of a mature Thylacoleo, and gives results of a comparison
of it with that of Macropus major, Felis Leo, and Dasyunis ursinur,
incidentally referring to pelvic characters of tho Wombat, the Koalr ,
and the Phalangers.
    The results are that the few correspondences with the Kangaroos
relate exclusively to a common marsupial nature ; to these, in the
 Dasyurines, are added other resemblances not found, save in Car
nivorous Marsupials ; and, finally, prominent characters are shown in
which     Thylacoleo  exclusively repeats those presented by the pelvis of
 Felis Leo.
 III. " On the Continuity of         the Protoplasm through the Walls
        of Vegetable Cells."        By Walter Gardiner, B.A., late
        Scholar of Clare College, Cambridge. Communicated by
        W. T. Thiselton-Dyer, C.M.G., F.R.S. Received April 16,
        1883.
                                  (Abstract.)
    After quoting a passage from Professor Sachs' " Vorlesungen fiber
 Pflanzen-Physiologie," " every plant however highly organised is
 fundamentally      a protoplasmic body forming a connected whole,
 which, as it grows on, is externally clothed by a cell membrane and
 internally traversed by innumerable transverse and longitudinal walls,"
 the author suggests that any observations          which demonstrate an
 actual continuity in organs of large extent must be of interest, as
 tending to show the truth of Sachs' statement in a sense somewhat
  more literal than his own.     At the time that tho above remarks were
 written, the instances of the existenco of any protoplasmic continuity
  between adjacent cells were but few, being limited to sieve tubes and
  to Tangl's results with regard to the endosperm cells of Strychnof,
  Phoenix, and Areca.     Then came the author's investigations upon tho
  pulvini of Mimosa, Robinia, and Amicia, and subsequently to them,
  but previous to the present communication,       appeared an important
  paper by Russow, in which he had proved that in the bast parenchyma
   cells and the phloem ray cells of numerous plants, e.g., Populus,
                                                                m  2

 Salix, &c, the closing membranes of the pits were perforated by fine
protoplasmic threads.         In the present paper the author details his
results upon pulvini, treats of the methods employed, and gives an
account of his investigations as to the structure of endosperm cells,
which were undertaken with the object of controlling his previous
researches.    Since experiments showed that all preservative reagents
were unsatisfactory, fresh material alone was employed.               In investi
gating the subject     of   protoplasmic continuity    the  method of swelling
the cell-wall and subsequent staining was adopted.              Either sulphuric
acid   or chlor.  zinc.   iod.  was  used as   the  swelling agent ; and, after
washing, the sections were stained with Hoffmann's violet — in which
case they were subsequently           washed out with glycerine —or with
 Hoffmann's blue. The latter dye was found to be a particularly
satisfactory reagent for staining the protoplasm alone, while methylene
blue, on the other hand, especially stains the cell-wall.              After the
action of  chlor.   zinc.  iod. and  subsequent staining     it  was  still fonnd
to be impossible to colour the protoplasmic threads running through the
cell-wall, and since the author's experiments had led him to believe
that this was merely due to phenomena of diffusion (the solution of
the colloidal dyes diffusing but little into the colloidal protoplasm),
he adopted the modification of dissolving the solid Hoffmann's bine
in a 50 per cent- solution of alcohol saturated with picric acid, which
was found to be perfectly successful as a stain.
   Having shown that in its reactions the pit membrane differs markedly
from the rest of the cell- wall, the author proceeds to give a detailed
account of his results with pulvini.                In Mimosa, Robinia, and
Amicia, the parenchymatous cells of the pulvini were found to com
municate with one another by means of delicate protoplasmic threads
which perforated the closing membranes of the pits.                    In many
instances it appeared as if the thread went bodily through the pits,
but the author was disposed to believe that in reality a sieve-plate
arrangement was present in every case.             The protoplasm of the bast
fibres also appear to communicate through the pit membrane by
means of a sieve-plate-like structure.             Thus from the epidermal
cells right up to the last living bast fibre, which impinges on the first
dead vessel, a direct continuity from cell to cell has been established,
and such a pulvinus may be regarded aa a connected whole.                     The
author has observed that a means of communication between adjacent
cells appears to exist in the pulvini of Phaseolus multiflorus, and
Desmodium gyrans ; in the cells of the leaf of Dionaea museipula ; in
the stamens of Cynara Scolymus, and in tendrils ; but in consequence
of somewhat hurried observation, owing to the lateness of the season,
he cannot regard these results as entirely conclusive, and intends to
work over the subject in further detail on a future occasion.
   In order to clear up certain doubtful points with regard to his work

   1883.]     Protoplasm through     the  Walls of  Vegetable Cells.      165
 •on  pnlvini, and to set his investigtions on the firmest possible basis,
  the author now commenced the study of endosperm cells, since in
  them the cells were exceptionally large, and the pit membrane being
 very thick, the presence of any threads running through its substance
 would be likely to be clearly seen.       Having confirmed Tangl's results
 with Strychno8, Phoenix, and Areca, he examined in detail the seeds
 of some fifty species of palms, and besides those of typical represen
tatives   of the following orders: — Leguminoseae, Rubiacete, Myrsineae,
 Loganiceae, Hydrophyllaceae,       Iridaceae, Amaryllidaceae, Dioscoriacete,
ilelanthaceae,    Liliaceae, Smilacae, and Phytelephasieae — in all of which
 lie found that the cells were placed in communication with one
another by means of delicate threads passing through the walls of the
cells.    In uupitted cells, e.g., Tamus and Dioscorea, the threads
traversed the    whole thickness of the wall. In the greater number of
instances the cells were pitted, and the threads passed across the pit
membrane ; and in certain cases, e.g., Bentinckia, Kentia, Howea,
Lodoicea, and Aspernla, communication was established both through
the thickened walls and through the pits. The endosperm cells displayed
in their structure every possible modification, both of thickness or
thinness of the pit membrane, of clearness or difficulty of observation,
and of degree of development of the middle lamella.             The develop
ment of the endosperm was not worked out in any case, but the cells
 were shown to communicate         with one another at a very early period.
 When sections of living endosperm tissue were treated with sulphuric
acid, and stained with Hoffmann's blue, the same results were obtained
as with pnlvini, only here everything was on a much             larger scale.
 Thus both th- methods and results received every confirmation.
    The author then treats of his investigations on the subject of
Plasmolysis, in which he had established that when the plasmolytic
condition is induced in a cell the contracted primordial utricle does
not lie free in the cell-cavity, but is connected on every side to the
cell-wall by means of numerous             fine protoplasmic threads.     His
experiments lead him to the conclusion that the above phenomena do
not give any definite assistance           or confirmation to the study of
perforation of the cell-wall, for as often as not the threads bear no
relation to the pit, the only significance implied being that the
 protoplasm and the cell-wall are intimately connected the one with
 the  other.
    Finally, the author remarks that, although he is aware of the
 danger of rushing to conclusions,         yet that when his results, which
 were foreshadowed by Sachs and Hanstein when they demonstrated
 the perforation of the sieve-plate, are taken in connexion with those
 of Russow, it appears extremely probable that the communication
  between adjacent cells not only takes place in the parenchymatous
 cells of pnlvini, in the phloem parenchyma cells, in the cells of

wider if not of universal occurrence.      At any rate we were now in a
position to get a clearer insight into such phenomena as the downward
movement of a sensitive leaf upon stimulation, of the wonderful
action of a germinating embryo on the endosperm cells, even on those
which are most remote from it, of the action of a tendril towards its
support, and of a series of phenomena in connexion with general cell
mechanism, which were too numerous to mention, and could not be
treated of in his present paper.
    The paper is accompanied by forty figures, which illustrate the
principal instances of protoplasmic continuity referred to in the

IV. " On the Dependence of Radiation on Temperature." By
       Sir William Siemens, F.R.S., D.C.L., LL.D. Received
       April  25, 1883.
    Sir Isaac Newton held that the radiation of heat from a hot body
increased in arithmetical ratio with the difference of temperature
between it and the surrounding bodies.          This law forms a rough
approximation to the truth over a very limited range of temperature.
 MM. Dulong and Petit carried out an elaborate experimental
research on the rate of cooling of hot bodies by radiation, extending
to somewhat higher temperatures, and deduced from their observa
tions the empirical formula —
               Rate of cooling =m(l-0077)'(l-0077T-'-l).
    Here T is the temperature of the hot body in degrees Centigrade, I
 the temperature of the surrounding matter, and m is a constant
depending on the nature of the radiating body.         This formula agrees
 very fairly with experimental results for ordinary temperatures, but,
 like Newton's law, it has been shown that it cannot be applied for a
wider range.
    The anomalous results which Newton's law and the formula of
MM. Dulong and Petit lead to, when applied to the cooling of
 bodies at a very high temperature,          are well illustrated by the
attempts    at  deducing  therefrom  the  temperature of the solar photo
                                                              " Le Soleil "),
sphere. Waterston and Pere Secchi (in his work entitled
following Newton's hypothesis, obtained 10,000,000° C. as the prob
able solar temperature, and Captain J. Ericsson, on the same hypo
thesis but assuming other constants, arrived at a temperature between
 2,000,000° and 4,000,000° C.         Strangely contrasting with these
determinations     are those  of Pouillet  in 1836, and Vicaire in 1872,

  1883.]     On the Dependence     of Radiation   on Temperature.         167
who, employing D along and Petit's empirical formula, deduce the
 values 1461° and 1398° C. for the solar temperature.         Between these,
extreme estimates       we  have   those of Dr. Spoerer, 27,000° C., of
Zoelluer,    27,700°, Professor    James Dewar (1872), 16,000°, Rosetti
(1878), 9000°, and Hirn (1882), 20,000°.
    In my own investigations on this subject, by comparing the
spectrum of the sun as regards the proportion of luminous rays with
those of the electric arc and gas flames,            I have arrived at the
conclusion that the temperature of the photosphere does not exceed
2800° C., which is in close agreement with the limit assigned by M.
Sainte-Claire Deville, deduced from the observations of Frankland
and Lockyer on the hydrogen lines in the solar spectrum.          Sir William
Thomson, in a paper communicated to the Philosophical Society of
Glasgow (1882), has compared the power of the sun's radiation per
unit of surface with that of a Swan incandescent carbon filament, and
has shown that it is about sixty-seven times greater ; he concludes from
these data that the estimate       I had formed of the solar temperature,
i.e., nearly 3000° C., cannot be very far from the true value.
     These diverse and indirect results have long impressed me with the
 need of further experimental investigation of the dependence of radia
 tion on temperature ; and it has occurred to me lately, that the diffi
culties with which Dulong and Petit had to contend in making their
measurements by means of a mercurial thermometer, where the losses
due to conduction and convection are very great, and exceedingly
difficult to determine, might be avoided in adopting a method of
conducting the experiment which forms the principal subject of my
present communication.
    It is well known that the measurement of electrical currents and
resistance is susceptible of very great accuracy compared with all
thermal measurements ; hence my endeavour has been to estimate
thermal     effects entirely by electrical methods.         In the Bakerian
Lecture for 1871, which        I had the honour of delivering before the
Royal    Society  (" Proc. Roy.   Soc.," vol. 19, p. 443), I showed that the
resistance of a platinum wire can be expressed as a linear function
of its temperature by an empirical formula, the constants of which
must be determined for each individual wire ; hence conversely, if
resistance of a wire previously calibrated is measured, its temperature
can be deduced.       From theoretical considerations   I  showed that
                              -T-=aTi-r/JT + 7
might     be expected to represent     the relation between    the resistance
and absolute temperature.        This formula agreed closely with my own
experimental     results for platinum, copper, silver, iron, and aluminium
wires (" Journal of the Society of Telegraph Engineers and Elec

 168                          Sir W. Siemens.                      [Apr.   26.
tricians," vol. i, p. 123, and vol. iii, p. 297), and has since been verified
by Professor A. Weinhold in the case of platinnm from 100° to
1000° C. (" Annalen der Physik und Chemie," 1873, p. 225).
   The apparatus which I propose for determining the dependence of
radiation on temperature consists of a platinnm or other wire, 0476
millim. in diameter, suspended between two binding screws, marked
(A) and (B) on the diagram, carried on two suitable wooden stands.
The binding screws are connected through an electro- dynamometer
(D), for the purpose of measuring the current, to a secondary battery,
                   Diagram showing arrangement of experiment.
the   number    of cells  in which can      be  varied.  A high    resistance
galvanometer     (G) is also inserted     between the binding    screws   as a
shunt to the platinnm wire.
   The electro-dynamometer        is of the ordinary form, in which the
current passes through a fixed coil, and a movable coil consisting of a
single twist, hnng by a torsion spring in a vertical plane at right
angles to the plane of the fixed coil.       The couple due to the current
is balanced by the torsion of the spring, hence the angle of torsion is
proportional to the square of the current. The current through the
high resistance galvanometer being a measure of the difference ot
potential between the extremities of the platinum wire, the reading
of the galvanometer, divided by the main current as determined by

 1tS83.]     On    the Dependence      of Radiation       on Temperature.           169
 the electro-dynamometer, is proportional to the resistance of the wire.
 Hence the constant of the instrument and the resistance of the gal
 vanometer being known, the resistance of the platinum wire could be
calculated, as the current was varied by altering the number of cells
composing the battery.
   The measurements were made in all cases when equilibrium had
been established between the radiation and the energy of the current,
as evinced      by the constancy of the readings of the electro-dynamo
meter and galvanometer.
   Having made a rough preliminary series of experiments to test
the   suitability of the method and apparatus, with satisfactory results,
on April       17th    I  made a second series, the results of which are
recorded in Table I. Column             I   gives the current in amperes passing
through the wire ; column             II    the difference of potential in volts
between the terminals as deduced from the readings of the galvano
meter ; column        III  the rate at which the energy of the current was
converted into radiant energy, represented by the product of the
electromotive       force and current, and therefore measured in volt-
amperes     or  watts    ; column IV the resistance            of the wire, being the
ratio of the electromotive force to the current ; column V the corre
sponding temperature of the wire in degrees Centigrade.                         Finally,
column VI describes the condition of the wire as apparent to the eye.

    toT   various values in this formula, a curve can be constructed
    showing the relation between the resistance and absolute temperature.
    Such a curve was drawn, and approximated for high temperatures to
    a straight line, as evidently must be the case from the form of the
    equation.            By solving the equation for the maximum value of —

abscissae      of the curve proportional to the watts absorbed, and the
ordinates proportional to the temperatures in degrees Centigrade, the
dotted curve marked B represents the relation between the power
and the temperature for the results given in the tables.
    I   have sought to express this relation by an empirical formula in
order to carry the curve to still higher temperatures.             The equation —
                    Temperature=A       (log a:)2 + B (log *) + C,
where x      represents watts, agrees with the experimental results.            The
constants      A, B, C have the values,
                                  A= -63.

    Mr. McFarlane, in a paper communicated to the Royal Society on
January 11th, 1872, has arrived at the equation —
                           Rate of energy =a+       bt + cfi,
where a, h, c are       empirical constants and      t  is the difference   of tem
perature,     from his experiments made through a very limited range of
 temperature, viz., about 60° C. (" Proc. Roy. Soc," vol. 20, p. 90,
 1872).      Professor James Dewar, from experiments extending from a
 temperature of 80° to the boiling points of sulphur and mercury, also
 deduces a parabolic formula.          (" Proceedings of the Royal Institu
 tion," vol. 9, p. 266.)
    Making nse of the         equation    I have    given, the rate      of energy
 absorbed for a temperature         of 2780° C, is 155,000 watts, or sixty-
 seven times the rate of absorption at a temperature of 1670° C. Since
 1670° C. is not much          below the temperature of an incandescent
 filament (reverting to Sir William Thomson's calculation for the ratio
 of the radiant power per unit of surface of the sun to that of the
 incandescent filament), the temperature of the sun comes out to be
 about 2780° ; which is in very close agreement                 with my former
 estimate based on other grounds.            The effect of absorption between
 the sun and the earth would bring the two estimates into still closer
 agreement.
     If  we attempt to form a natural equation to the curve,         it is apparent
 that    it will consist of two terms —
     (i.) The term due to radiation,
      (ii.) The term depending on the convection and conduction of the
  air.     The conduction of heat by the wire into the terminals may be
  neglected, as by taking a considerable length it becomes a small
  quantity of the second order.                          I

present be represented by »»F(f). Hence we have —
                  Rate of conversion of encrgy=AT" + wiF(/).
   According to Prevost's theory of exchanges, the hot body is itself
receiving radiant energy from the surrounding bodies ; hence the
radiant energy is more appropriately represented by A(T" — <"), where
< is the temperature    of the surrounding bodies.  Similarly it would
appear probable    that  the conduction and convection will depend on
the difference of"temperature.    Hence
                    Bate of energy = A (T"-<") +mF(T— t).
    The constants       A   and vi   will depend on the nature of the radiating
body and on the surrounding medium.
    Although for theoretical purposes it is important to eliminate the
conduction and convection, yet in most cases a medium is present, and
 it has been shown by Mr. Crookes that, within limits, variations in
 pressure have only a very small effect on the amount of heat lost by
 conduction and convection.
    I have not as yet been able to make any experiments on the deter
 mination of the term mF(T—       but   /),my intention to make further
                                                   it   is

 suggesting  a method  which appears to me likely to yield nseful results.
 He proposes to construct a chimney' of white paper, and to fix      over         it
 the wire through which the current         passing.  The
                                                        is  chimney will
 collect all tho heated air ascending by convection, and by suitable
 means its temperature and the rate of flow can be measured, and
 hence the rate of loss of heat by convection estimated.
    It might be supposed that conducting the experiment' t» taeuo
 would diminish the convection.    According to the original researches
.of Dulong and Petit, the rate of cooling diminished in a geometrical
progression,      whose ratio was             ^.    as the   pressure   diminished in     a

Soc.," 1880, vol. 31, p. 239)             described some experiments on this
point, and showed that a diminution of pressure from 760 millims. to
120 millims. had a very slight effect on the convection.    From 120 to
5  millims. the effect was somewhat more marked.         A reduction of
pressure from      millims. to
                   5             millims., however, produced twice as

7G0 millims. to    millim.

a very high exhaustion must be obtained.
  It still remains to describe the experiments by which the constants

a,      of the empirical formula connecting the resistance of the wire
      /3,   7
with its absolute temperature were determined. The wire was enclosed
in a glass tube, stopped at either end with plug, through which the                 a
wire passed centrally. The tube was fixed in metallic trough, with                         a
an aperture in its cover sufficiently large to admit a mercurial thermo
meter placed in contact with the tube.         In the first instance, the
trough was filled with melting ice, and the resistance of the wire
measured by a Wheatstone bridge. The ice was then removed, and
two Bunsen burners were placed below the trough, and the tempera
ture gradually raised by increasing the pressure of the gas in the
burners.
     Inthis way a series of simultaneous observations were made of the
temperature of the wire and its corresponding resistance up to 100° C.
Th- results are given in the subjoined table. Care was taken at each
reading that the thermometer had become stationary, and really
represented the temperature of the wire. A second series of observa
tions were taken as the wire cooled from 100° to zero and the results                              ;
are likewise given in the table.

                              I
    In a preliminary note* communicated to the Royal Society the
 formulated results of a lengthened series of experiments with the
 induction balance, and     I  now present the experimental evidences
 which led me to these conclusions.
    From numerous researches previously made by means of the
induction balance, the results of which I have already published, I
felt convinced that in researches upon the cause of magnetism, 1
should have in it the aid of the most powerful instrument of research
ever brought to bear upon the molecular construction of iron, as indeed
of all metals.    It neglects all forces which do not produce a change
in the molecular structure, and enables us to penetrate at once to the
interior of a magnet or piece of iron, observing only its peculiar
structure and the change which takes place during magnetisation or
apparent neutrality.

    The induction balance, while being one of the most simple instru
ments as regards        its construction, and most powerful as to its powers
of appreciating        minute differences in the molecular construction of
metals,     requires a lengthened previous practical knowledge of its use
and powers in order to obtain zero readings for each experiment.
Tims with it we can very easily obtain an effect, such as a marked
difference       between two pieces of iron of similar size and chemical
composition ; but to reduce these differences, separate and measure
them by the zero method, is of a peculiarly difficult nature.               Not only
does the electromotive force vary with each piece of iron, but also the
time of its discharge, the time or duration of the effect being more
variable and more indicative of the molecular structure than the
electromotive force. Again, the form of the induction balance must
vary according to the nature of the experiment.                      In some cases,
where it is desirable not to pass an electric current through the metal,
fonr coils should be used, as in the first instrument I presented to the
 Royal Society in 1879.*             In others we should use three, two, or but
 one coil, as in the instrument which                I shall describe in this paper.
 In order to avoid complication             I  will only mention results which can
 be easily obtained          by this most simple form of apparatus, results
 which I believe can only be attributed to the molecular nature of
 magnetism.
     This theory has long been foreseen, and predicted in almost com
 plete    perfection as regards the rotation of the molecules, by many
 authors,     the earliest of whose notices, and the most clearly defined as
  being very near the results obtained by myself, will be found in the
  remarkable work by De La Rive,f 1853, who in chapter iii, page 317,
  under the title of
                           " Influence of Molecular Actions upon Magnetism
  produced      by Dynamic Electricity," says : " We have seen that heat,
  tension     and mechanical actions generally facilitate magnetisation.
  M.  Mattencci      has found that torsion         and percussion, and mechanical
 actions,    not only facilitate the magnetisation produced upon soft iron
  by   a  helix that is traversed by a powerful current, but they also
 contribute, when the current has ceased to pass, to the destroying the
  magnetism in a very rapid manner ; the same philosopher has likewise
 observed that torsion, when it does not pass beyond certain limits,
  augments the magnetisation                produced upon steel needles by dis
  charges of the Leyden jar.
     "
        M. Marianini, who has made numerous and interesting researches
  upon magnetisation,         arrived at curious results upon the aptitude that
  iron bars may acquire of becoming more easily magnetised in one
  direction than in another."

   M. De La Rive sums up a series of interesting experiments in these
remarkable words : " The whole of the magneto-molecular phenomena
that we have been studying leadjus to believe that the magnetisation of
a body is due to a particular arrangement of its molecules, originally
endowed with magnetic virtue, but which in the natural state are 60
arranged that the magnetism of the body that they constitute is not
apparent.    Magnetism would therefore consist in disturbing this state
of equilibrium, or in giving to the particles an arrangement that
makes manifest the property with which they are endowed, and not in
developing it in them. The coercitive force would be the resistance
of the molecules to change their relative positions.
    " There remains an important question to he resolved :
    "Are mechanical or other actions, disturbers as they are of the
electrical state, able of themselves to give rise to magnetism ?"
    Da Moncel, in his remarkable work on Magnetism, 1857, sustained
and developed the views of De La Rive, and later, Wiedemann in
" Poggendorff's Annalen," 1857 — 1859, as well as in his remarkable
" Lehre von Galvanismus," 1861, sustained a similar theory.
Wiedemann has lately given a resume of his researches in the
" Lumiere Électrique," Paris, January 28, 1882, where he says —
    " Nous admettons que les metaux magnetiques sont composes de
molecules qui ont une polarite magnetique ; nous no voulons r-n
preciser quant a la cause mcme de cette polarite, qn'elle provienne
de la separation des fluids magnetiques, des vibrations d'un mil-u
entourant les molecules ou mieux encore de l'existance de couianfe
elementaires.
    " Un corps ainsi constitue n'aura pas,    en general, de magnetisme
libre, parceque les axes magnetiques des molecules seront diriges dans
tons les sens et maintenus dans leurs positions respective^ par te
forces moleculaires.   Mais une force magnetique ext^rieure, telle qn'nne
helice oil passe un courant, leur donnera une direction generale.
    " En poursuivant cette hypothese, M. Weber a reussi a expliqner
theoriquement 1'accroisement de la magnetisme d'une barre sonmise
a l'influence d'une helice aimantee jusqu'a un maximum.
    " Nous supposons, en outre, que les molecules dans leur mouvement
 eprouvent une certain resistance qui les empeche de suivre complete-
 ment l'influence des forces qui agissent sur elles."
    In my preliminary note I gave the formulated results of a length
 ened series of researches upon magnetism by the aid of the induction
 balance.   As these agree in all important points with the theory of
 De la Rive, 1853, I do not wish it to be considered as a new theory
 or conception of molecular rotation, but as a theory based entirely
 upon researches into all the conditions of magnetism, and one which
 clearly defines the conditions of polarity and neutrality.
    Gilbert, 1600, remarked the influence of torsion, stress, and vibra

tions upon magnetism,             since    which time numerous researches have
been made by means of torsion.
    Matteucci* employed induction currents, by means of which he
observed that mechanical strains increased or decreased the magnetism
of a bar of iron.
    Wertheimf published a long series of most remarkable experiments,
in which he clearly proves the influence of torsion upon the increment
or decrement of a magnetic wire.
    Wiedemann^ published his interesting experiments upon torsion-
flexion in relation to magnetism, and in his remarkable work,
                                                                                  " Galva-
nismus," 1861, relates his discovery of magnetism produced in an iron
wire upon the passage or after of an electric current.                      He also gives
a molecular theory of magnetism, similar to that of De La Rive, 1853,
except that Wiedemann supposes that neutrality is the result of a
heterogeneous          arrangement, thus differing completely                   from the
symmetrical neutrality that I have defined.
    Villari§ showed increase or diminution of magnetism by longitu
 dinal pull according as the magnetising force is less or greater than a
certain value.
    Gore,||  in numerous interesting experiments, shows the influence of
 electric torsion and the identity of molecular sounds.
    Sir W. Thomson,^ in a remarkable paper, shows the critical value
 of the magnetisation of iron, nickel, and cobalt under varying stress,
 and also the effects of longitudinal as well as transversal strain upon
 its electric conductivity.
    Tomlinson* * hao recently shown completely the influence of strain
 upon the conductivity of all metals, and that strain produces a mole,
 cular change in their structure.
    These employed each a somewhat                     different method, either by
 primary or secondary currents acting upon a galvanometer or the
 action of magnetism upon a magnetic needle.
    This field of research has been so thoroughly examined that                   I should
 have hesitated         before trying to reproduce the results by ordinary
 or similar means.            The indnction balance, however, seemed to me
 peculiarly adapted,        from   its extreme sensitiveness to molecular changes
 of structure, to analyse suoh changes as are produced by magnetism.

a repetition of several experiments tried long since by others,          ifit

not for the fact that the induction balance enabled me to observe all
the effects of stress on iron by means far more sensitive than any
hitherto employed, and notice effects which, without its aid, would
pass uuperceived.      Some idea of this extreme sensitiveness may                    be
inferred from the fact that     ifwe balance two pieces of iron to a com
plete  zero,  the  addition  or  subtraction   of the T6d\,oy part of iron,
or the smallest filing to large balanced mass of iron, will give out
                          a                                                           at

magnetism   it   isfar preferable to use thin flat strips, known as hoop
iron as we can then have any desired amount of surface in the form
      ;
of a thin flat bar.
   Jam in had previously recognised the importance of using thin and
wide steel pieces for his well-known magnets.          We can easily mag
netise them to saturation, and where torsion         applied the contour

study the conditions of neutrality without the constant hindrance                    of
superposed magnetism, as we constantly find in the case of a wire or
bar of iron.

forms of coils and methods of obtaining perfectly defined wros.

that they can, asjdesired, be moved to any portion of the strip of ironr
in order that different portions of the same strip may be tested under
a similar stress.
   The coil D is joined to a telephone     J or a sensitive galvanometer,
whose terminals are reversed at each make and break of the current.
and we may either pass the current in the manner described or may
reverse all the communications, passing the current through the coi!
instead of the wire, and listening with the telephone to the induced
surrent upon the iron wire alone.
   The phenomenon of molecular movement upon the passage of an
electric current through a wire or a coil surrounding a bar of iron
was discovered by Page, 1837, and De La Rive published several
memoirs on this subject in the " Comptes Rendus," 1846, wherein he
not only clearly demonstrates the molecular cause of the sounds
emitted at each change of the current, but also foreshadowed the
                                         "
theory which he published later in his Treatise on Electricity," 18-53.
These movements have since been studied in a variety of ways, and
by different methods, but they are all based upon the discovery of Page;
as these sounds accompany all the rotations produced by torsion, in
many cases too feeble to be heard, but becoming clearly audible by
means of the microphone.
                                                        I
   In my paper on " Molecular Magnetism," 1881, proved by three
different methods the identity of these sounds with all the phe
nomena of rotation. In the induction balance we observe only by the
angular displacement of the molecules upon its wire or strip of iron.
reacting both upon its own wire and the exterior coil ; and the
currents obtained from 1 centim. length of wire are sufficient to be
clearly heard in the telephone held 10 centims. distant from the ear.
and this with a feeble current of one Daniell element ; under these
conditions we hear no sounds in the wire itself, but they at once
become audible by increasing the electric current or by the use of the
microphone.     We cannot, however, analyse sounds obtained         in this
way, nor can we perfectly analyse the induced currents               which
Matteucci was the first to obtain, unless we reduce them to a zero
by an induction balance, a zero from which it is perfectly easy to
perceive and measure the slightest change in the molecular structure.
   Before relating a few of the representative experiments, and in
                            I
order to avoid repetition, will repeat the theory I gave in my pre
liminary note, based entirely upon researches on magnetism by the
aid of the induction balance.
                           Theory of Magnetism  .
   1. That each molecule of a piece of iron, steel, or other magnetic
metal is a separate and independent magnet, having its two poles

and distribution of magnetic polarity exactly the same as its total
evident magnetism when noticed upon a steel bar magnet.
   2. That each molecule can be rotated          in either direction upon
its axis by torsion, stress, or by physical forces, such as magnetism and
electricity.
     That the inherent polarity or magnetism of each molecule is a
     3.
constant quantity like gravity ; that it can neither be augmented nor
destroyed.
     4.That -when we have external neutrality, or no apparent magne
tism, the  molecules and their polarities arrange themselves so as to
satisfy their mutual attraction by the shortest path, and thus form a
complete closed circuit of attraction. .
   5. That when magnetism      becomes evident, the molecules and their
polarities  have  all rotated symmetrically in a given direction, pro
ducing a north pole if rotated in this direction as regards the piece of
steel, or a south pole if rotated in the opposite direction.  Also, that
in evident magnetism, we have still a symmetrical arrangement, but
one whose circles of attraction are not completed    except through an
external armature joining both poles.
                              Experimental         Evidences.
     If in the induction
                      balance already described we place an iron strip
1 or 2 centims. in width    by £ millim. thickness, and pass rapid
intermittent currents through it by means of the rheotome I, there is-
no induced current upon the coil D, as long as this strip, rod, or iron
wire is entirely free from torsion, but the instant we apply the
slightest torsion upon it by means of its key C, a very strong induced
current in the coil gives loud tones in the telephone, which we can
reduce to zero, and measure by the compensating coil E.
  The phenomenon has this remarkable character : that a torsion of
bnt -j-J-o part of a complete turn suffices to rotate the molecules to
so great an extent as to be almost at the maximum of rotation that
can be produced by torsion.              I
                                have demonstrated in previous papers*
the phenomenon    of molecular rotation, and that the induced currents
so obtained are not direct from the central rod or wire to the coil, as-
the wires of the coil are perpendicular to the strip or rod of iron, and.
consequently at the zero of inductive effect ; the induction from the
central core upon the coil takes place through the medium of the
rotated molecules whose angular displacement allows its reaction, both
upon the coil and its central conducting strip, rod, or iron wire ; a»
similar effect would take place              if,
                                      instead of the rotated molecules,-
numerous oblong pieces of iron were rotated to a similar angle upon
the conducting rod of iron.   The induction or reaction of these could

take  place at any degree which is not parallel or perpendicular      to
cither the coil or its central condncting core, in direct proportion  to
its angular displacement.
   The induced currents      from molecular rotation are extremely
powerful in proportion to the length of wire or strip of iron acting

 1883.J      Theory of Magnetism baaed on New Researches.            187
upon the coil ; and they have the distinctive feature that the maxi
mum effect is obtained with an extremely feeble torsion, differing
entirely from induction obtained through the medium of the spirality
or increased parallelism of the conducting wire in relation to the
secondary coil, as the effect here is a gradually increasing force, and
exceedingly feeble at tho degree of torsion sufficient to produce the
maximum of molecular rotation.         Thus we have a distinct phe
nomenon of molecular induction, its law of rapid maximum separating
it completely from that obtained from non-magnetic metals, or from
spirality of electric currents.  If we compare the force obtained by
molecular rotation with mere spirality of the electric current, we find
that   J,  of a single turn gives the maximum for iron, whilst for a
conducting copper wire it would require a spiral of similar diameter
of fifty whole turns to equal or balance the power obtained from mole
cular induction, thus the effect is 900 times greater for the same
degree of spirality ; and if we neglect its distinctive feature of rapid
maximum and compare it with ordinary electro-magnetic force, we
find that it requires upon an iron core fifteen whole turns of similar
conducting insulated copper wires to produce the same force ; or for
the same degree of spirality of conducting wires, the electro-magnetic
induction thus formed is 270 times weaker than that of molecular
induction.    Thus we have not only its distinctive feature of rapid
maximum, hut an induced current which cannot be imitated nor
accounted for except on the hypothesis of molecular rotation.
   It will be seen from the following diagram that the rotation takes
place very rapidly with the first degree of torsion, and after 20° or
^ of a complete turn shows only the increased effect due to
continued spirality.
   It is evident from the above diagram that the molecules are
rotated to their maximum during the first 20°, or in reality during
the portion within the limits of elasticity ; from this point the
molecules become rigid by the strain of torsion, and they are then
only rotated directly as the spirality of the wire or rod.  The diagram
only shows the effect of a right-handed torsion, the opposite torsion
giving equal though opposite electric currents.
   If the wire is free from strain, no increase of electric current
changes its zero ; nor does it while under torsion, though we may
then produce a confused zero, when a powerful current is used, as the
electromagnetic    effects from its centre free from strain superpose
themselves upon those due to rotation.       For this reason we should
not employ more than one small bichromate cell, as its most powerful
effects are obtained with a comparatively weak primary current.
    Knowing this, we observe that, after the passage of an extremely
 6trong current (which may be in the same or contrary direction), and
 return to our previous feeble current, we have exactly the same

188                       Prof. D. E. Hughes.                 [May   10,
induced force   as before, and   with the same clear zero.     Thns the
molecules are not only rotated by torsion as already shown, but they
have an inherent polarity which cannot be augmented nor destroyed.
    We may, however, increase the molecular rotation and consequent
force obtained by the application of heat, thus allowing greater
molecular freedom.       Annealing increases the effect in iron in a
marked degree, and alloying has a marked influence in rendering the
molecules of iron more rigid. The induction balance allows us to
appreciate this differential freedom in different varieties of iron and
steel, and in a future paper    I shall show how this phenomenon of
rotation can be applied to important practical results by investigations
into the chemical nature of different varieties of iron and steel, and
show distinctly the separating line of iron and steel.
                            Molecular Inertia.
    A  phenomenon of inertia is observed in these experiments, which I
regard as not only being a proof of rotation, but of possession by th-
molecules of true inertia.    For when a slight torsion of 20° has been
applied to the strip or rod of iron, and we return it slowly to its zero
of torsion, we have a remaining rotation of the character of residual
magnetism ; this is generally about a quarter of the maximum effects
and of the same polarity, the rod then requiring a momentary
mechanical vibration iu order to allow the molecules freedom to
return, which they at once do to an absolute zero ; we have here a
lagging behind which is characteristic of inertia. We have, however,
more evident proofs, for if instead of freeing the rod gradually from
torsion, we allow it to spring back suddenly, then the molecules
continue their rotation by their acquired velocity far beyond zero,
producing in most cases (where the rod of iron is very soft) a
contrary polarity of fully one-half of its previous value, and although
 the rod is perfectly free from torsion, we must apply a slight torsion
 in the previous direction before obtaining a zero ; we have here a zero
 under torsion evidently due to molecular inertia, for the instant we
 give the slightest mechanical vibration to the rod, the molecules
 return to their true zero, and now the slightest torsion produces its
 true polarity as before.
    This inertia is far greater in soft iron than in hard iron or steel,
 being directly proportional to its softness, the consequence of this
  being that the time of rotation or discharge of soft iron is very slow
 compared with that of steel, and requires a compensation for time of
discharge for each species of iron.   I have already mentioned this as a
difficulty in obtaining true zero observations, and  I now make use of
this very troublesome inertia to determine at once the degree of
 softness of any wire or rod.
    We can understand this phenomenon when we know that while the

1883.]         Theory of Magnetism based on New Researches.                 189
molecules in steel are excessively       rigid, they have   the    quality of
-lastic rigidity,    consequently the elastic pressure which prevented free
rotation     serves to restore them quickly to their previous zero, and also
prevents any springing past or rotating from beyond their true zero.
                             Effects of Magnetism.
     If   the moleculesof iron have inherent polarity and rotate freely
upon their axes, we should expect that we could rotate them by the
influence of an exterior permanent magnet alone, and this proves to be
the case, for if (when the rod is free from torsion and the molecules
are at zero) we approach a powerful compound permanent magnet
perpendicular to the rod, the molecules rotate under its influence as
freely as we have seen previously under torsion. Supposing the
magnet to be at 20 centims. distance, and that we gradually lessen this
distance, we find the maximum rotation whilst the magnet is at
5 centims., passing this point it gradually diminishes to a complete
zero when distant 3 centims. the molecules now being parallel with the
rod or the inducing coil according to the direction of rotation, and
Oonsequently (as before explained) no induced currents are possible.
If   we now continue to approach the magnet, the molecules are still
further rotated, and we have now strong induced currents of the
-pposite polarity to the previous, notwithstanding that the rod is
evidently magnetised continually in the same sense.
    The rotation here, with its zeros and change of polarity, whilst the rod
is gradually magnetised by increasing degrees of magnetic force, is due
to the magnetic influence being perpendicular to the rod, allowing full
rotation, from the circular neutrality which         I
                                                    shall explain later ; but
if the magnet is approached in the line of the rod, instead of perpen
dicular to     it,
               we have continued increased rotation until     it touches the
rod in this case we do not cross
      ;                                  a zero, because the molecules can
-nly turn in the direction of saturation.
                           Symmetrical   Arrangement.
     "When we have a rod of soft iron, free from torsion,     it   is   perfectly
 homogeneous in its structure, and we have       acomplete zero at all por
 tions of the wire, rod, or strip of iron, at the extremities as well as at
 the centre.    In order to observe this we should employ a very narrow
 coil, the one employed by myself being     single insulated wire, wound
                                             a
 spirally upon itself upon a cardboard, being a marvel of workman
 ship, given me by Mr. A. Stroh     ;by means of this coil, whose thick
 ness does not exceed -J^ millim., we can explore rods of any length,
 and if any portion is under strain we at once hear loud tones. Thus
I  find in all rods that have not been annealed, spots or places show
 ing strains which have been caused by their mechanical treatment,
 such as hammering, rolling, or drawing into wire. We can by this

190                       Prof. D. E. Hughes.                    [May 10,
means not only perceive the strain but determine its direction by the
polarity obtained.    I  have no doubt but that some day this will be
practically applied to the appreciation of strains in iron shafts or
cannons.
   If we apply torsion to a soft iron rod, we find the degree of rotation
equal at each section observed, quite independent of its length, con
sequently we find perfect symmetry of rotation throughout.          If  we
magnetise the rod   in such a manner   as to leave its residual magnetism
with several consequent poles, the portions into which the rod is
thus divided are similar in their symmetry to several distinct magnets
with their similar poles placed opposing each other, producing
reversed induced currents at each consequent pole.
   When we take observations by the indnction balance, either upon
electric conductivity or magnetism, we do not observe the effects as
generally observed by other methods, viz., after the current has had
time to reach its stable condition ; we really observe the effects pro
duced during the first instant of time, known as the variable period,
observing from the first instant of electrical contact to a certain
maximum, which can never be greater than the length of time of
these contacts.   These results are obtained by the rapid contacts of
the rheotome, producing 500 vibrations per second, which the ex
tremely rapid action of the telephone allows us to appreciate.      Thus,
the actual duration of the electrical contact is but 101ao part of a
second ; and this proves the extremely rapid action of molecular
rotation, as the effects which we have noticed are all produced in this
fraction of a second.
                           Magnetic  Conduction.
   The following experiments were made by means of an induction
balance of four and three coils, described fully in my paper,
                                                                   " Proc.
Roy. Soc.," vol. 29, p. 56, 1879. The following diagram shows its
etectrical communications.

1883.]        Theory of Magnetism    based on New Researches.         101
    In fig. 3, two flat primary coils A', A" are near two similar
secondary     coils B', B", the distance between these coils being
regulated by means of adjusting screws.          The coils of B', B" are
wound in contrary direction to each other, consequently the induced
currents    in each coil, if of equal strength, neutralise each other ; as
shown by the arrow, the induced currents act upon the telephone C.
The primary coil A' is joined through the battery D to the rheotomo
E and coil A".
    If we introduce a wire or bar of iron F' in the coils A', B', the in
duced currents are increased        by the magnetic conductivity from
the upper to the lower coil, and as the coils A', B' and A'', B" can
be at any desired distance, or from 1 millimetre to 1 metre apart,
we can test the conductivity of iron through any desired length.
If we introduce into the second pair of coils A", B" a piece of iron
of the same form, size, and molecular structure as that already
in A', B', its effect on indnced currents equals those of the first pair
of coils and we have a perfect zero, but in practice we find that there
is always some slight difference, even when the pieces are cut off the
same bar ; we have to compensate for this difference, and thus
measure the differential structure.
    In fig. 4 we have three coils, being the form adopted in my sono
meter ; the secondary coil B being equidistant from the primary coils
A', A", acts upon the secondary coil in reversed direction, consequently
a perfect zero of effect is found whenever the action of A' equals that
of A", and this can be easily found by displacing either coil. If we
 introduce a bar of iron between the coils A' and B, the balance no
 longer exists, owing to the greater electromagnetic      conductivity on
 that side, but if the bar of iron F' F" is passed through the centre or
 axis of all the coils, as shown in the diagram, we have no effect
 except that due to a differential conducting power on one of its sides,
  the direction and force of which can be found by the amount of dis

 placement    of the coil B necessary to find a 8ero. Thus, we can at
•once find the slightest strain or fissure, such as partial rupture in iron
 rods of any size or form. The coils may be close together or widely
 separated, and would find a practical application if applied to shafts
 undergoing constant strain, such as the screw shaft of steamboats.
     The balance shown in fig. 3 is the one     I generally employ, aud is
 preferable for the following experiments.
     If we take a flat disk of iron similar in form to our usual current
•coins, we find that if it is placed flat on or parallel with the coils, we
 have a great reduction of induced currents upon the pair of coils in
 which it is placed, due to the energy expended in creating the
 " Arago " circular currents, and its action then is precisely similar to
 copper or all non-magnetic metals, but if this disk is revolved 90°, or
 placed perpendicular, it then acts simply as a magnetic body and
 similar to the bar of iron F ; the induced currents on its pair of coils
are strengthened by the reaction of its electro-magnetic conductivity.
    That conduction itself is due to molecular rotation is proved by the
 fact that soft iron shows a far higher conductivity than hard iron or
 steel ; we observe here the same results of freedom and rigidity, and
 all the previous effects of rotation are again repeated as conduction
 Soft Swedish charcoal iron shows such a marked superiority over all
 other irons and steel, as regards its power or the force obtained, that I
 feel convinced that the same superiority would be shown by its use for
 the cores of all electro-magnets, particularly those of telegraph in
struments, where rapid action and the maximum of force obtainable
from a feeble current are required.
    Faraday showed that iron loses its magnetic force at red-yellow
heat, and the induction balance is peculiarly adapted for investigating
this phenomenon.       If we place an iron wire or rod, as at F, we find
on heating it that its conductivity gradually rises, being at black heat,
just before the visible red, double of that noticed at the ordinary
temperature, being a similar result to that previously noticed with the
single coil balance. But if we increase the heat until the rod becomes
red-yellow, all conductivity instantly vanishes and the iron apparently
has lost all its powers, being then similar to a piece of copper or other
non-magnetic metal ; what takes place is, however, not destruction,
for, at red heat, its inherent polarity reappears instantly with its full
previous force.     There seems no gradual diminution or reappearance
of its polarity, it is sudden and apparently instantaneous, its time of
action being less than the y^Vo Part of a second. The induction
balance will, no doubt, in the future, enable me to investigate this
phenomenon.
    I find that the conducting power of soft iron is greatly reduced by
magnetising,     generally one-fourth of its total conductivity, the
residual magnetism being in reality a partial rotation, thus reducing

1883.]        Theory   of Magnetism    based on New Researches.        193
the available total amount of rotation. This is so evident from a
series of experiments I have made on this subject, that I can safely
pr-dict    that if an iron wire could be held charged to magnetic satura
tion, we should obtain no conduction whatever, and its action as
regards the production of induced currents would be similar to copper ;
or, if the rotation were already complete and rigid, we should have no
magnetic conductivity. We can observe this partial rotation in an
iron rod, whose conductivity has been reduced by magnetising, as we
have only to vibrate the wire, its molecules being rendered free
instantly return to zero, and we have its previous full conducting
powers.
    The slightest torsion     also reduces   its conductivity, the greatest
effect being on the first few degrees of torsion ; thus torsion not only
r-tates the molecules during its elastic- stage, but holds them im
prisoned or fixed as rigidly as in hard iron or steel.
    This form of induction balance allows us to demonstrate that
polarity apart from the molecules does not exist. For if we balance
 one pole of a long magnetised iron or steel bar, we find the same con
 ductivity for either pole, and the induced currents obtained are all in
 one direction, no matter if the coils act upon either pole or the
 apparent neutral centre ; thus it is impossible with this form of
 balance to perceive any difference between north or south polarity.
 All that we observe is the degree of rotation of the inherent polarised
 molecules, and that this is symmetrical throughout is shown by the
 -qual conducting power of all parts of a magnetised rod.
    This form of induction balance also shows that the conducting
 powers of a bundle of fine iron wires and thin flat strips are equal,
 the thin band or strip of iron being superior to the fine wires if they
 are closely pressed together, as the maximum of induced rotative
 effect in all magnetic bodies is at or near the surface, consequently, a
 tube of iron will give greater power for a feeble force than a solid bar.
    The time of discharge during which the molecules rotate or return
 to zero is comparatively short in bundles of loose iron wires, flat
 strips, and thin tubes, but exceedingly slow in solid bars. This con
 firms the results obtained by other methods, and which have already
 received practical application.
                         Visible Effects of Magnetism.
     I have been able to repeat the greater portion of my researches
  with the induction balance, by simply observing the effects produced
  by magnetising iron and steel upon a magnetic direction needle
  according to the indications already given by the balance ; by this
  means we are enabled to render visible most of the effects, bnt cannot
  so well determine the canse ; in fact, without the aid of the induction
  balance all researches upon magnetism must remain incomplete.         We

bat   ifwe apply   a few slight elastic torsions the magnetism rapidly
disappears.   This effect has been observed and numerous researches
have been made on this subject since Gilbert, 1600. Wertheim, 1857.
in the " Annales de Chimie," has given              detailed account

experiments upon    the  diminution     of magnetism by    torsion.
   The diminution depends entirely upon the freedom of its molecules,
for if wo take a pure Swedish charcoal iron well annealed,             single     a
slight torsion completely renders the rod free from magnetism, the
molecules at once rotate to neutrality.          have in my possession, and

torsion produced by the fingers upon its surface.             Hard tempered

 neutral  ;  ordinary hoop iron requiring generally eight double right
 and left elastic     torsions before it is nearly neutral ; there will be,
 however, still a slight residual magnetism, which can be instantly
rendered neutral by a slight torsion given to the rod when held
 vertically; or we may reverse the residual magnetism by the same
directive influence of the earth's magnetism.
   I have found it convenient to attach two brass clamp keys to the
extremities of the rods, or simply turn the ends at right angles, as
shown in the     following diagram.
   Wertheim,      1857, remarked        that if we magnetise a wire under
torsion, there    will  be a   diminution upon freeing it from torsion, a
still greater upon giving it a
                                      contrary torsion ; and that its original
force is in a measure restored
                                      by returning to the torsion under which
it was magnetised,
                         designating this phenomenon as " La rotation du
maximum de magnetisme," and it is difficult to explain this phe
nomenon except upon the hypothesis of molecular rotation.
   Wiedemann discovered that a wire becomes magnetic on or after
the passage of a
                     current, and in his " Galv&nismus " he points out its
 molecular character.       SirW. Thomson* expresses his opinion that the
effects are due to the outside
                                    twist of the wire forcing the current to
pass round a fixed centre, and,
                                       consequently, that the effects can be
explained    as ordinary electromagnetism.           This view evidently takes
notice of the spiral action of the current alone.              I have repeated
this experiment, and find that the
                                          magnetism increases directly as the
electromotive force, so it would be difficult to infer that the action
of the current is due
                           to molecular rotation, if it was not for the fact
that the wire is
                    magnetic after the passage of the current, as can be
rendered visible by torsion, consequently            I believe Wiedemann was
fofly justified in regarding this effect as one of molecular rotation.
   Dr. Hooke, 1684, remarked that steel or iron was
                                                               magnetised when
Wed to redness and placed in the magnetic meridian.                      I have
lightly varied this experiment by heating to redness three similar
at»l bars, two of which had been
                                          previously magnetised to saturation
              separately with contrary polarity as regards each other,
and placed
the third
           being neutral ; upon cooling, these three bars were found to
have identical and        similar polarity. Thus the molecules of this

  most   rigid material — cast steel — had become free at red heat,      and
  rotated under the earth's magnetic influence, giving exactly the same
  force on each, consequently the previous magnetisation of two of these
  bars had neither augmented nor weakened the inherent polarity of
  their molecules.     Soft iron gave under these conditions by far the
  greatest force, its inherent polarity being greater than that of steel.
     The gradual rotation of the molecules may be observed by strongly
  magnetising a soft iron wire!.      If we then pass a feeble electric
  current we find a slight diminution of magnetism after ite passage.
  and as we increase the force of the electric current the molecul-s almost
  entirely rotate to zero ; and if we heat the wire to redness, or simply
  put it in mechanical vibration, we have at last perfect neutrality- the
 current having rotated the molecules as it does an exterior needle
 perpendicular to itself, being simply Oersted's discovery of -xternal
 rotation of the needle applied to the molecule itself.      The wire when
 thus rendered neutral can, as Wiedemann           remarked,   again show
 evidence of magnetism.       The neutrality here is that known as chain
 or circular magnetism, each molecule forming a link of a chain whose
 circle of attractions is completed around the axis of the wire
 througli which the current has passed.
    In order to perceive the change of polarity which torsion produces
 when an electric current is passing through an iron wire, the wire, which
 may be 2 millims. diameter, and 40 centims. in length, should be placed
 horizontally east and west, the centre of the wire being 3 or more
 centims. above the axis of the needle, thus differing completely from the
 position of the wire in Oersted's discovery, as in the latter case the
 maximum rotation is obtained when the wire is parallel with the needle ;
 bnt in the following experiments the maximum effect is obtained when
 the needle is at right angles to the conducting wires, and none what
 ever if parallel, its action being perpendicular to the exterior rotations
 of Oersted's discovery ; and a similar phenomenon will be observed in
 all the rods mentioned later in the case of superposed magnetism.
    An iron wire, under the conditions above mentioned, shows strong
 north or south polarity by a left or right handed elastic torsion ; and
 if we leave the wire with a slight remaining permanent torsion,
producing movement of the needle to the left, it diminishes upon
breaking the electric circuit, and increases to its previous value on
re-establishing the current; this is due to a slight mechanical mole
cular twist. If we now magnetise this rod slightly in a contrary
direction (the needle then having a movement to the right) we find
that upon re-establishing the current it now increases the right
deflection.    Thus the slight magnetism has completely reversed the
influence of the previous mechanical torsion.
    The question here arises, have we rotated the molecules from their
previous position, or is it simply the reaction of magnetism considered

 1883.]        Theory  of Magnetism   based on New Researches.            197
apart from molecular rotation, which has changed the spiral direction
of the electric current ? The answer to this is most clear — that it is
entirely due to molecular rotation.      If  the wire is perfectly neutral,
we obtain by the current of one half-pint bichromate cell 45° deflec
tion of the needle to the left for a left-handed torsion, and a similar
degree    to the right for a right-handed torsion, depending altogether
upon the softness of the iron for the degree of force obtained, but in
all cases perfectly equal on each side.       If we magnetise the wire so
that   it produces about 45" to the right, then a torsion to the right
produces no effect whatever; the molecules         have already    rotated   to
the degree     which mechanical torsion .could produce, and torsion aided
by the   electric current can produce no further rotation. The left-hand
torsion, however, preserves its full maximum effect, and restores the
molecules to their previous position.      If again we magnetise the wire
to saturation, so that the needle is violently moved to the right,
having 80° or more deflection, then the right-hand torsion, instead of
augmenting it, instantly reduces the deflection to 45°, being the
maximum allowed by a right-handed torsion.            We have here, in the
case of an electric spiral, decreased effects from an increased me
chanical torsion in the same direction, and the experiment clearly
shows the rotation of the molecules independent of mechanical direc
tive action.
    Being desirous of noticing the effects of powerful electric currents,
Dr. Warren De La Rue, F.R.S., kindly aided me by passing a current
from his well-known chloride of silver bat.tery through iron and steel
wires.     A  condenser, 42'8 microfarad capacity, charged by 3,360 cells,
was   used. We first passed this enormous electric charge longitudinally
 through    the permanent    magnet   I have described,  fig. 5, completely
destroying its evident polarity by rotating the molecules to neutrality.
    This experiment was followed by discharging the condenser through
magnetised      and neutral steel knitting needles with a similar result.
Many     authors   have stated that a steel wire or needle became mag
 netised by the charge from a Leyden jar, and as this is contrary to the
 neutrality  I  have spoken of, we continued the experiments with a view
 to determine the conditions of such magnetic effects.       We have found
 that the magnetisation supposed to be the result of the electric spark
 is in reality due to the direction in which .the needle lies at the time of
 the passage of the spark. Thus wires, when held perpendicular to the
 magnetic meridian, or east and west, became perfectly neutral, even
 when previously strongly magnetised; but if they were held in the
 magnetic meridian, a feeble magnetism          was always produced, the
 direction of which was due entirely to the earth's polarity, and had no
 relation whatever with the direction of the current.       If, however, the
 wires were twisted, as in a rope, then we had electromagnetic        effects,
  due to the direction of the twist and current.

  198                      Prof. D. E. Hughes.                  [Maj    10,
     Similar but stronger effects were observed on soft iron wires. A
 neutral iron wire, 3 millims. diameter and 40 eentims. in length, was
 held vertically, to represent a lightning-rod, the enormous spark or
 charge from the condenser, charged by the 3,360 cells, striking its
 upper portion. This rod became invariably magnetised by the earth4s
 directive influence, its upper portion being in all cases south and its
 lower north. The magnetism, however, was comparatively feeble, and
only equal to that obtained ou the same wire by mechanical vibrations
caused by repeated blows on the upper portion of the wire with a
wooden mallet.       From these experiments we draw the conclusion that
every lightning-conductor must be magnetised, but that if it is without
spirality the magnetism can never be greater than that due to the
directive influence of terrestrial magnetism.
    If we could destroy or change the inherent polarity of iron, we
should expect to find traces of it in wires which had been submitted
to such an enormous electric current, but the wires thus acted upon
remain similar in every respect to ordinary iron wires, their polarity for
a given force and their neutrality being similar in nature and degree;
consequently the inherent magnetic polarity has not been changed or
destroyed.
                                 Neutrality.
    The induction balance is affected by three distinct arrangements of
molecular structure in iron and steel, by means of which we have
apparent external neutrality.
    In fig. 6, at A, we have neutrality by the mutual attraction of each
pair of molecules, being the shortest path in which they could satisfy
their mutual attractions.    At B we have the case of superposed mag
netism of equal external value, rendering the wire or rod apparently
neutral, although a lower series of molecules are rotated in the oppo
8ite direction from the upper series, giving to the rod opposite and
equal polarities.     At C we have the molecules arranged in a circular
chain around the axis of a wire or rod through which an electric
current has passed. At D we have the evident polarity induced          by
the earth's directive influence when a soft iron rod is held in       the

 1883.]        Theory    of Magnetism,   based on New Researches.         199
magnetic meridian. At E we have a longitudinal neutrality produced
in the same rod when placed magnetic west, the polarity in the latter
case    being transversal.
     In all these    cases we have a perfect symmetrical arrangement, and
I   have not yet found a single case in well-annealed soft iron in which
I   could detect a heterogeneous       arrangement,   as Wiedemann supposes,
in the case of neutrality.
     We may observe this symmetry without the aid of the induction
balance ; for, if we magnetise a rod under torsion (which we have
already shown produces an ultimate rigidity), and observe the effects
upon a directive needle, we find that every portion is equally mag
netised, and in the same symmetrical            arrangement of its molecules.
We can also observe the probable existence of the double molecule, A,
fig. 6, by magnetising a rod with feeble magnetic power.            We then
find a certain degree of magnetism, which is of exactly the same force
as that produced when magnetised under a right-hand torsion, and if
now we again magnetise it under a left-hand torsion, we have still the
same force.        This, without the existence of a double molecule, would
have required a far greater inducing magnetic power to have rotated
 the molecules to the same degree under a contrary torsion.        The limits
of this paper do not allow me to bring further proofs of the existence
 of the double molecule, which the induction balance plainly indicates,
 as it requires a separate papeiron this subject alone.        If we consider
 the fire magnets of Dr. Hooke, we know that we cannot produce
 neutrality by heat, that we cannot melt or manufacture iron, except
 under the influence of the earth's directive influence, and that we can
 only produce apparent neutrality by vibrations or torsions, allowing,
 by the molecular freedom          thus given, a complete closed circle ot
 attractions, as at A or C, and that a< similar apparent neutrality arises
 from the superposed magnetism of B, or the tranversal P, both of
 which in small wires or rods are apparently completely neutral.
     We can produce a perfectly symmetrical closed circle of attractions
  of the nature of the neutrality of C, fig. 6, by forming a steel wire
  into a closed circle, 10 centims. diameter, if this wire is well joined
  at its extremities by twisting and soldering.        We can then magnetise
  this ring by slowly revolving it at the extremity of one pole of a
  strong permanent magnet, and to avoid consequent poles at the part
  last touching the magnet, we should have a graduating wedge of
  wood so that whilst revolving it may be gradually removed to greater
  distance.    This wire will then contain no consequent points or external
   magnetism, it will be found perfectly neutral in all parts of its closed
   circle; its neutrality is similar to C, fig. 6, for if we cut this wire at
   any point we find extremely      strong magnetic polarity, the wire being
   magnetised by this method to saturation and having retained (which
   't will indefinitely) its circle of attractions complete.

   My researches upon the molecular structure of neutrality required
various kinds of iron and steel ; my friend, Mr. W. H. Preece, F.B.S.,
kindly used his influence with the wire manufacturers supplying the
 Government telegraphs in procuring for me sixty different samples of
iron and steel of a similar gauge, but of different qualities, as the
 induction balance has since proved, and the results obtained will be
 given in a future paper upon the " Molecular Structure of Iron and
 Steel."
                           Superposed Magnetism.
    Knowing that we can rotate or diminish magnetism         by   torsion, I
 was anxious    to obtain a complete rotation from north polarity to
 neutrality,  and   from neutrality to south polarity, or to completely
 reverse magnetic polarity by a slight right or left torsion.
    I  have succeeded in doing this and obtaining strong reversal o;
 polarities, by superposing one polarity given whilst the rod is under a
right torsion with another of the opposite polarity given under a left
torsion, the neutral point then being when the rod is free from torsion.
 The rod -should be very strongly magnetised under its first or right-
 hand torsion,   so that its interior molecules are rotated, or, in other
 words,    magnetised to saturation ; the second magnetisation in the
contrary sense and torsion should be feebler, so as only to magnetise
the surface, or not more than one-half its depth ; these can be        easily
adjusted to each other so as to form a complete polar balance of       force.
producing when the rod is free from torsion the neutrality as shown
at B, fig. 6.
    If we now hold one end of this rod at a few centimetres distance
from a magnetic directive needle we find it perfectly neutral when
free of torsion, but the slightest torsion right or left at once produces
violent repulsion or attraction, according to the direction of the torsion
given to the rod, the iron rod or strips of hoop-iron which        I use for
 this experiment being able, when at the distance of 5 centims. from
the needle, to turn it instantly 90° on either side of its zero.
    The external neutrality that we can now produce at will is absolute.
as it crosses the line of two contrary polarities, being similar to the
aero of my electric sonometer, whose zero is obtained by the crossing
of two opposing electric forces.
   This rod of iron retains its peculiar .powers of reversal in a re
markable degree, which distinguishes it completely from ordinary
magnetisation, for the same rod when magnetised to saturation under
a single ordinary magnetism loses its evident magnetism by a few
elastic torsions, as I have already shown, but when it is magnetised
under the double torsion with its superposed magnetism, it is but
slightly reduced by vibrations or numerous torsions ; and I have
found it impossible to render this rod again free from its double polar

 effects, except by   strongly remagnetising it to saturation with   a  single
 polarity, the superposed magnetism then becomes a single directive
force, and we can then by a few vibrations or torsions reduce the rod
to complete    neutrality.
    The effects of superposed magnetism and its double polarity I have
produced in a variety of ways, such as by the electromagnetic influence
of coils, or in very soft iron simply by the directive influence of
earth's magnetism, reversing the rod- and torsions when held in the
magnetic meridian, these rods when placed magnetic west showing
distinctly the double polar effects.
   It is remarkable also that we are enabled to superpose and obtain
the maximum        effects on thin strips of iron from    \  to \ millim. in
thickness, whilst in thicker rods the effect is far less, as it is masked
by the comparatively neutral .-state of the interior, the exterior mole
cules then reacting upon those of the interior, allowing them to com
plete in the interior their circle of attractions.
   I have already mentioned several different forms of induction
balance which are applicable to — 1. Testing the softness of iron and
steel ; 2. Researches upon the cause of tempering in steel ; 3. Find-
iug the dividing line of iron and steel ; 4. Finding mechanical strains
in shafts, eannons, or steamboat screw shafts ; 5. Showing unmis
takably the best quality of iron for electro-magnets ; 6. Researches
upon all the phenomena of magnetism, and upon all questions relative
to the molecular structure of metals.
    I was anxious to show upon the reading of this paper some me
chanical movement produced          by molecular rotation, consequently I
have arranged two bells that Are struck alternately by a polarised
armature put in motion by the double polarised rod I have already
described, but whose position at 3 centiins. distant from the axis of
the armature remains invariably the same.          The magnetic armature
consists of a horizontal light steel bar suspended by its central axle,
carrying at its extremities two glass beads 5 millims. diameter serving
as hammers ; the bells are thin wine glasses, giving         a clear musical
tone loud enough by the force with which they are struck to be clearly
heard at some distance.       The armature does not strike these alter
nately by a pendulous movement, as we may easily strike only one
continuously, the friction and inertia of tthe armature causing its
movements      to be perfectly dead beat when not driven by some
external force.
    The mechanical power obtained is extremely evident, and is sufficient
to put the   sluggish armature in rapid motion, striking the bells six
 times per second, and with a power sufficient       to produce tones loud
 euough to be    clearly heard in all parts of the hall of the Society.    Ah
 this is the  first direct transformation of molecular motion into me
 chanical  movement I am happy to show it on this occasion.

F.R.S., at the instance of the Royal Society,* revealed a remarkable
peculiarity, namely, the fact that over one portion of that channel the
temperature of the water at the bottom differed 12° to 14° F. from
that obtained at similar depths in the other portion, and further
investigation by H.M.S. " Porcupine" in 1869 confirmed the observa
tions previously obtained on board the " Lightning."
    The cause of this phenomenon appears to have been unsuspected at
the time, but during the voyage of H.M. S. " Challenger " several
such peculiarities were observed, though not to such a marked extent,
and a theory wan formed that where differences of bottom temperature
existed at equal depths in adjoining areas those areas would probably
be found separated by submarine ridges.
    Viewing the question on board the " Challenger " from our owu
observations, combined with those previously obtained in the " Light
ning," " Porcupine," and " Shearwater," and with the advantage of
Dr. Carpenter's conclusions on oceanic circulation published in the
"
  Proceedings of the Royal Society " for 1869, it seemed to us reason
able to suppose that in those areas where the minimum temperature
was found constant from a given depth to the bottom over an area
contiguous to another where the temperature decreased as the depth
increased, those areas must be separated by a submarine ridge, as
then the phenomena might be readily explained.           For instance, the
condition might arise (a) if the minimum temperature was the mean
winter temperature of the coldest portion of the separated area, in
which case the water at the surface would be flowing in, whilst below
it v. ould be flowing out over the submarine ridge, as seems to be the

case    with the Mediterranean and Red Seas ; or (6) the minimnm
 temperature might be that which exists outside the separated area at
the lowest part of the submarine ridge, in which case the water would
be flowing in at the bottom over the ridge, and out at the surface, as
seems to be the case in the Sulu, Celebes, and Banda Seas.
    As the voyage of the " Challenger " was devoted to general oceanic
research, it was found impracticable to spend much time over parti
cular localities without lengthening the voyage considerably, and
consequently there was no opportunity of testing by actual soundings
the correctness or otherwise of this theory. This seemed to be practi
cally of very little consequence, as in the Faeroe Channel, close to our
own shores, the same phenomenon existed, and a short time devoted
to its further exploration would decide whether a submarine          ridge
there separated the two areas of different bottom temperatures, as was
                                                    " Challenger " reports
predicted would be the case in No. 7 of the
published by the Admiralty; for, applying our views to the results
obtained in the Faeroe Channel in 1868-69, we concluded that, as in
both areas in that channel the temperatures        agreed fairly well to a
depth of 200 fathoms, whilst at greater depths a marked difference
existed, we should find a submarine ridge across the channel with from
200 to 250 fathoms over it, and that as in the cold as well as the warm
area the temperature    at 200 fathoms   exceeded the mean annual tem
perature   of the 60th parallel of latitude, the whole body of the water
was moving steadily to the north-eastward over the ridge.
    The late Sir Wyville Thomson considered the Faeroe Channel as a
test qnestion, and consequently     represented to the Hydrographer of
the Admiralty (Sir F. J. Evans, R.N., K.C.B., F.R.S.), in 1880, the
desirability of despatching a small vessel to obtain some soundings
and other observations in this locality.      The Hydrographer having
recommended this project to the favourable consideration of the Lords
Commissioners of the Admiralty, their Lordships sanctioned the small
                                           "
hired surveying vessel " Knight Errant (employed on the west coasts
of the United Kingdom) being sent to the Faeroe Channel, and during
the month of August, 1880, a sufficient number of soundings            and
temperature observations were obtained to show that a submarine
ridge existed, though the actual extent of the ridge was not deter
mined. A full account of the results obtained in the
                                                        " Knight Errant "
was published     in the " Proceedings of the Royal Society of Edin
burgh," session 1881-82.
    The existence of a submarine     ridge having been ascertained, Sir
Wyville Thomson represented to the Royal Society the advisability of
more thoroughly investigating it by a series of cross-sections           to
determine the slopes on each side, and to ascertain with greater exact
ness the limit of the cold area and the nature of the bottom on this
 ridge.    The Royal Society recommended Sir Wyville's views to the

favourable  consideration  of the Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty.
but their Lordships, whilst agreeing that the exploration of the Faeroe
Channel was very important, were unable to spare a vessel for the
purpose during the summer of 1881, and, unfortunately, before the
end of that year Sir Wyville, whose health had been undermined by
exposure to the vicissitudes of climate during the voyage of the
" Challenger," succumbed to a severe illness without being able to
complete either the report of the voyage of the
                                                         " Challenger," or the
many investigations he had undertaken as bearing more or less on
that voyage.
   Shortly after the death of Sir Wyville, Mr. John Murray, one of
the naturalists of the " Challenger
                                        "
                                          expedition, was selected to succeed
him as the editor of the " Challenger" Reports, and, as he had accom
panied the
             " Knight Errant " in her cruise to the Faeroe Channel in
1880, and was also of opinion that the exploration of that channel bore
directly on the results of the voyage of the " Challenger," he again
brought before the Royal Society the desirability for further investiga
ting this submarine ridge, and at their instance the Hydrographer.
with the sanction of the Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty.
directed H.M.S. "Triton" to carry out this work, and Mr. Murray
embarked in that vessel to assist in making the necessary obser
vations.

fitted to take the place of the " Porcupine

coas8s of the United Kingdom, had everyapplian.ee on board necessary
for the work, with the exception of dredges, trawls, and dredging line.
Somo dredges remaining from the stock returned by the " Challenger"
were found available, and the Royal Society provided the trawls and
necessary rope.    All the instruments were of the pattern used in the
" Challenger " expedition excepting one deep-sea thermometer which
was an improvement on the ordinary type in use by Mr. Buchanan.
   Narrative. — The " Triton

                                                Stornoway on the 25th July,
and between that date and the 4th September, made three trips to the
Faeroe Channel, each trip being about ten days' duration.            Notwith
standing the generally unfavourable condition of the weather ex
perienced, five sectional lines of soundings were obtained across the
ridge (which has been named after the late Sir Wyville Thomson),
and numerous other souudings between these sectional lines, makinga
total of 135 soundings, 14 serial temperature soundings, and 17 hauls
of the dredge or trawl.*          The work of sounding and obtaining
temperatures was proceeded with steadily on every occasion when the
weather was sufficiently clear to admit of the position of the soundings
being ascertained by astronomical observation ; during misty or foggy

weather either the dredge or trawl were usually put out, or the tow
nets lowered to such depths as required.
    After completing the work in the Faeroe Channel, the vessel left
Stornoway for Oban, and from thence proceeded into the Atlantic
about 100 miles north-west of Ireland, to test some pressure gauges in
connexion with the observations of Professor Tait on the thermometers
of the " Challenger," for which purpose Professor Chrystal, of the
University of Edinburgh, accompanied the ship on this section of the
voyage.       The "Triton" finally returned to Glasgow on the 17th
September, and then resumed her ordinary surveying work.
    The W yvtlle Thomson ridge. — The soundings obtained in the " Triton,"
combined with those formerly taken in the " Knight Errant," prove
conclusively the existence of a submarine ridge in the Faeroe Channel,
extending from the edge of the bank north of Rona Island to the
fishing bank to the south-west of the Faeroe Islands.       To the north-
east of this ridge, the temperature      of the water at depths exceed
ing 350 fathoms is under 32° F., whilst to the south-west of it the
temperature at similar depths is above 42° F., excepting in one
part, where, for a short distance south-west of the deepest part of the
ridge, a drain of the Arctic water is carried across, and is sufficient to
cool the bottom water below 40° for a distance of 8 miles from the
;uis of the ridge.
    The general depths over the Wyville Thomson ridge, which is
 100 miles in length, by 10 in width, are from 250 to 280 fathoms,
 with here and there shoaler heads.      In one part, however, there is a
 saddle or gap 7 miles wide, where the depths are from 300 to 330
 fathoms.      On each side of the ridge the depths increase to 600
 fathoms or upwards.
    The indications given by the lead as well as the dredge and trawl,
 show that the Wyville Thomson ridge consists of stones and gravel,
 whilst to the north-east of the ridge, in the cold area, the bottom is of
 a hard blue mud, and to the south-west a softer gray mud.
     The ridge seems to be a portion of a chain of hills, mostly sub
 merged, which stretch irregularly from the bank off the north-west
  coast of Scotland to the Faeroe Islands, Iceland, and Greenland, for
  we know that depths of about 200 fathoms exists between the Faeroe
  Islands and Iceland, as well as between Iceland and Greenland.        As
  oceanic soundings become more numerous, doubtless many more such
  chains of submarine elevations will be discovered, for there is reason
  to believe that the floor of the ocean is not so level as is generally
  supposed.      The absence of mud on the top of the Wyville Thomson
  ridge may be accounted for by the water flowing over it, washing
   away all the small particles.
     Plans and Diagrams. — To show the position and form of the ridge, a
   series of diagrams and a plan have been constructed.   The plans shows

 206                Staff Commander T. H. lizard.               [May   10,
 all the soundings obtained, as well a9 the position of the five sectional
 lines across the ridge, and the line of demarcation between the cold
 and warm areas, for which purpose the isotherm of 40° has been
 selected as the best distinctive mark. The diagrams            show the
 temperature curves, and a profile of each section exhibiting the form
 of the ridge, and the distribution of temperatare from the surface to
 the bottom.
    The diagrams all appear to point to the same conclusion, thns
 agreeing with theory, namely, that the water is flowing steadily to the
 north-east over the ridge. For instance, in Plate 7, Section A, it will
 bo seen that the curves of temperature begin to diverge rapidly below
the depth of 170 fathoms, and by referring to Plato 5, Section A,
 it will be seen that the least depth over the ridge on this section is
 120 fathoms.    In Plate 7, Section B, it will be seen that the curves
 taken in the warm area and on the ridge, agree very closely, whilst
 that taken in the cold area, 10 miles north-east of the shortest cast
 obtained on this section, 260 fathoms, begins to diverge rapidly at
 200 fathoms from the other two curves.     In Plate 7, Section C, curves
taken in the warm and cold areas are sensibly the same to the depth
of 300 fathoms, and a reference to Plate 5, Section C, will show that on
this section the least depth found on the ridge was 305 fathoms. In
sections B, D, and E, where the least water on the ridge is much the
same, the isotherm of 40° »n each section at a distance of 10 miles
from the axis of the ridge, is found at almost precisely the same
depth, viz., 280 fathoms, or the precise depth of the ridge, whereas in
 Section C, where the depth of the axis of the ridge is 305 fathoms,
the isotherm of 40° is found at a depth of 300 fathoms in the
cold area, and in Section A, where the depth on the axis of the ridge
is 120 fathoms, the isotherm of 40° is at a depth of 250 fathoms in the
cold area. The depth then at which the isotherm of 40° is found in
the cold area depends on the depth over the ridge.             As before
mentioned, in the warm area, all the temperatures exceed 40°.
    The question then arises, if the water is flowing steadily over the
Wyville Thomson ridge to the north-east, how is it the water at the
bottom in the cold area retains its low temperature ? This has
hitherto been very difficult of explanation, as there was apparently no
outlet for it over the ridge, and conseqnentJy     we might expect that
its temperature would be influenced by the mass of heated water
above ; for the excess of inflow in the Faeroe Channel might be
altogether absorbed by the outflow, which we know is constantly in
progress between Iceland and Greenland.        The soundings and tem
peratures taken this year, however, led to the discovery of a slight
outflow of the cold Arctic water over the deepest part of the Wyville
Thomson ridge, in the 7-mile gap, which breaks the continuity of
the 300 fathom contour-line of soundings.      Here the cold water was

  1883.]      Soundings and Temperatures        in the  Faeroe Channel.      207
 traced    flowing across the ridge, and gradually increasing in tempera
 ture as it moved to the southward, until at a distance of 15 miles
 from the axis of the ridge, it was of the usual normal temperature of
the warm area in that locality.
     This outflow of cold water seems to affect all the bottom tempera
tures to the westward of Section C ; for, whilst to the eastward of
that section they are from 45° to 46° at depths of 500 fathoms, to the
westward they are from 42° to 43°, that is 3° lower.
     There is then apparently a regular interchange of the waters across
the Wyville         Thomson ridge, the Atlantic water flowing north-east
into the Arctic basin «n the surface, and as far down as the ridge
permits, over the greatest portion, whilst over the deepest part of the
ridge there is a small outflow of Arctic water into the Atlantic, which
although of infinitely less volume than the water moving to the north
east, yet appears        to be sufficient to enable the bottom water of the
Arctic basin, immediately adjacent to the ridge, to retain its low
temperature.          Were there no other outlet to the Arctic basin, it is
 probable the outflow over the ridge at the bottom would equal the
inflow at the surface, but, as before remarked, we know the surface
 water on the western side of the Arctic basin has a steady flow to the
 southwards along the coast of Greenland.
     The existence of the Wyville Thomson ridge in the locality pre
 dicted, tends to prove the general correctness of the theory formed in
 the "Challenger,"        but farther observations in other localities where
  the same phenomenon         exists, are requisite to determine its absolute
  correctness, more especially when we remember that in nearly every
   instance where the bottom temperatures         differ materially in adjoining
  areas, the minimum temperature          in one of those areas, the warm, is
  found at a considerable height from the bottom ; whereas in the other
  area, the cold, the temperature decreases with the depth, the minimum
  being   at the bottom.      In  the Faeroe Channel, however, the tempera
  ture in  the warm area decreases as the depth increases, whilst in the
   cold area   it remains almost constant at 30£° F. at depths exceeding
  350   fathoms, thus reversing the rule which obtains elsewhere.            For
   instance, in the Mediterranean the temperature of the sea is constant
   at 55° F. at
                    depths exceeding 100 fathoms, whereas in the Atlantic,
   the only sea    in communication with the Mediterranean, the tempera
   ture outside   the Straits of Gibraltar decreases as the depth increases.
   In the Red Sea the temperature is constant at 70° F., at depths
   exceeding 100 fathoms, whereas in the Indian Ocean it decreases with
   the depth.     In the Sulu Sea the temperature is constant at 50o.5 F.
    at depths
                exceeding 400 fathoms, whereas in the adjacent seas the
    temperature decreases to 39°, and there are also considerable areas in
    the Atlantic, as well as the Pacific, where a minimum temperature is
    reached at a certain depth, whilst in adjoining areas the temperature

208                Staff Commander T. H. Ti8ard.                 [May   10.
either decreases to the bottom, or a lower temperature is found at a
similar depth.     These differences, though slight, give reason for
believing that the flow of water from the Antarctic is impeded by
submarine ridges.    The Arctic water is apparently quite cut off from
the general oceanic circulation, excepting at the surface, and to a
depth of 200 fathoms.
   Tides. — When the weather was favourabl-, and the dredge or trawi
was down, we noticed, more especially in the western part of the
Faeroe Channel, a regular tidal set, the greatest strength recorded being
three-quarters of a mile per hour. The direction of the tidal stream
appeared to vary considerably, and unfortunately our opportunities
for observations were few, for, as a rule, the long swell usually
experienced entirely masked the tide, the
                                               " Triton " being so
                                                                     light,
that on almost all occasions when the engines were stopped, even
with the trawls down, the normal position was broadside to the swelL
The height of the waves usually experienced was from 9 to 12 feet.
but waves of 17 feet from trough to summit were not uncommon, and
early in September, during a gale, they were recorded as 25 feet from
trough to summit.
   The highest wave recorded during the voyage of the " Challenger1'
was 23 feet from trough to summit.
   At all times we noticed that the sea was shorter and heavier on
the Wyville Thomson ridge than on either side, and sometimes when
crossing it we observed peculiar
                                    " smooths," as if oil was floating on
the surface, or a spring welling up from the bottom.              In these
smooths the temperature of the water remained unaltered.
   Dredgings and Trawlings. — The result of the dredgings and trac
ings, as well as of the surface dredgings, by the tow net, will be
reported on by Mr. John Murray, who accompanied the "Triton"
throughout her exploration of the Faeroe Channel.

III.   " Preliminary Note on the Innervation of the Mammalian
       Heart." By L. C. Wooldridge, D.Sc, M.B., George Henry
       Lewes Student. Communicated by Dr. M. Foster, Sec.
       R.S*   Received April 23, 1883.
   The research was carried out in the Physiological Institute
                                                                                                 at
Leipzig. The immediate object was to determine the function
                                                                                                 of
nerves which are to be seen on the surface of the ventricles of the
hearts of mammals. It was important to know their functions on the
following grounds —    :

1883.]         On   the Innervation of   the Mammalian Heart.              227
    In the frog, stimulation of the sinus produces stillstand of the heart.
The inhibitory fibres have at any rate here a provisional ending.
    On the other hand the result of stimulation of the ventricle may         be
regarded    as a form of acceleration.
    In  the  dog,   the   vagus  and   accelerans   nerves   act  on  different
mechanisms (Bast).
    Having regard to these facts the possibility of the ventricle nerves
being accelerator presented itself.
    To know the function of these nerves was not only interesting,
per se, bnt also as forming an appropriate introduction' to the nearer
investigation of the nervous mechanism of the mammalian heart.
    The following observations on the accelerans will be first re
corded :—
    Hitherto in the- dog, the experiments on the accelerans- nerve- have
been carried out almost exclusively with that of the right side. It
 was more convenient in the present case to work with the left nerve
 (Ansa Vieusseni).         The author has observed' that- in many cases
 stimulation of the left accelerans is without' any influence on the
rhythm of the heart ; and that this was not due to accident, such »s
lowering of- the temperature, was shown by the control stimulation of
the right accelerans.        This fact is not without importance for the
remainderof the research, as will be seen.
    Minimal electrical stimulation of the- vagus overcomes completely
 the action of the accelerans, but th- accelerans overcomes the normal
 slight tonic action of the vagus (Baxt). In an experiment; of the
 author there existed, owing to stimulation of the medulla, a most
 powerful tonic vagus action. Thus —
                                                        '
           Average of pulse beats before division of vagi. ....       8
               „           „         after      „          „    ... 18
     Yet stimulation of      the  accelerans   overcame   this and' produced
 marked quickening.         If during the stimulation of the accelerans a
 very   small  cardiac   branch  of vagus (in the thorax) were stimulated,
 it exerted its inhibitory influence, and overcame the accelerans,
 though it did not depress the pulse to- the same degree that the tonic
 vagus action did. With our present knowledge, this- experiment
 points to a difference between the stimulation of a nerve from its
 centre, and the electrical stimulation of its trunk.
     The ventricular nerves are very numerous, but requirein the dog the
 use of special methods, in order to be seen well ; the author recom
 mends strong carbolic acid for this purpose. These nerves form at any
  rate the greater part of the nervous connexion between the auricle
  and ventricle. They cannot be adequately stimulated after they have
  passed on to the ventricle, since the stimulus affects the heart itself
  too.   This is more particularly the case for electrical stimulation. As
                                                                   Q X

228           On   the Innervation    of   the  Mammalian Heart.    [May  10,
is   well known,      very   slight stimulation with a Faradaic current
destroys the activity of the ventricle by bringing about a peculiar con
dition of fibrillar contractions.
   The anthor's procedure was as follows : The ventricular nerves pass
     •
on to the ventricle at definite points of the auricnlar ventricular
boundary, where they are collected into larger trunks.                He has
observed that division of these trunks has no influence on the rhythm
of the heart, nor does it in any way impair the action of the vagus or
accelerans nerve. These ventricular nerves are therefore not essential
to any of these processes.
   The ventricular nerves are the continuation of certain definite
cardiac nerves, which can be isolated in the thorax at a distance from
the heart.    When these cardiac nerves are stimulated, some of the
ventricular nerves must be stimulated too. In particular, the majority
of the nerves on the posterior surface of the heart, are derived from a
trunk which arises either from the left vagus ganglion, or from some
part of the Ansa Vieusseni. .This nerve usually runs quite isolated
to the heart.     The result of stimulation of the peripheral end of this
nerve are as   follows   :—
    Out of 14 experiments, it exerted in A a vagus action, without any
acceleration ; in 2 an acceleratory action without any inhibitory ; in
8 it had no influence on the rhythm.            The nerve sometimes gives off
obvious   branches     to  the   auricle ;   in  some of the cases where no
influence on '.the rhythm was produced, " these had been cut away.
Particular attention was given to this nerve, because it is easy to
isolate, and because it certainly contains fibres which go on to the
ventricle.
   The author also -stimulated the other cardiac branches, which are
in obvious connexion with the ventricular nerves.            Sometimes they
produced inhibition, -sometimes acceleration, but also in this case the
division of the trunks .which continue these nerves on to the ventricle
did not produce any change in the result of their stimulation. The
author from the above observations concludes that the ventricular
norves have no direct influence on the rhythm of the heart.
    Stimulation of the central end of those cardiac nerves, which are
continued on to the ventricle, is followed by marked reflex phenomena;
and this fact, in conjunction with the negative .-result just recorded,
leads the author to regard' the ventricular nerves as being chiefly
sensory, or more exactly, centripetal.
    The reflex phenomena are, rise and fall of blood pressure, slowing
and quickening of the pulse.          On placing a small piece of blotting
paper soaked in acetic acid on to the surface of the ventricle in the
rabbit, a rise of blood pressure was observed; the acetic acid was
moderately strong ; a second application to the same part had no
effect. On tearing through the nerve trunks from which the ven

 1883.]        On the Motor Roots    of the Brachial Plexus, $c.       229
tricular nerves start,      reflex movements     of the animal (dog) were
observed.
    The reflex acceleration of the heart beat, to be obtained by central
stimulation of the cardiac nerves, is marked, and is not due to change
in blood pressure.      The fact that sensory nerves go to the heart was
shown long ago by Ludwig and Cyon's discovery of the depressor
nerve in the rabbit.
    In the dog a large nerve (or two smaller) runs from the left vagus
ganglion and sometimes from the trunk, and ends chiefly between the
coats of the aorta, giving occasionally a branch to the Arteria
Pnlraonalis.      The peripheral stimulation of this nerve is without
effect.     The central stimulation produces slowing of the heart and
fall of blood pressure ; sometimes the slowing is followed by accelera
tion.      The nerve is very sensitive to mechanical stimulation.
    The extent and importance of the centripetal nerves which como
from the heart and great) vessels, is clearly shown in the author's
experiments.       Whether the ventricular nerves are solely centripetal
or not has not been fully determined. . It is rendered probable by the
author's experiments,         that both vagus and accelerans act on
mechanisms      in the  auricles.  In some cases the author has observed
changes of blood pressure follow stimulation of the peripheral ends of
nerves going direct to the heart, either without any change in the
beat, or without a corresponding         change.   But his observations on
this point are too few to draw definite conclusions.        The mercurial
manometer was used. The dogs were narcotized with opium, and
then the brain divided through the pons, the object being to render
the subsequent steps of opening the thorax' painless, and still to pre
serve reflex actions.
 IV. " Note on the Motor Roots of the Brachial Plexus, and oh
        the Dilator Nerve of the Iris." By David Ferrier, M.D.,
        LL.D., F.R.S., Professor of Forensic Medicine in King's
        College. Received April 24, 1883.
     In  a  communication to the Royal Society (pnblished in the " Proc.
 Roy. Soc.," vol. 32, 1881) on the
                                       " Functional Relations of the Motor
 Roots of the Brachial and Lumbo-Sacral Plexuses," my colleague,
 Professor Gerald Yeo, and myself gave an account of the results of
 electrical stimulation of the several motor roots of the brachial and
  crural plexuses in the monkey.         We there described the muscular
  actions of the upper extremity as resulting from stimulation of the
  first dorsal up to the fourth cervical nerve.
      The careful dissections made at our request by Mr. W. Tyrell
  Brooks, Demonstrator in the Physiological Laboratory, King's College,

  230                           Dr. D. Ferrier.                   [May   10,
  and a repetition of the stimulation experiments which       I have made,
  have revealed an error in the enumeration of the roots of the brachial
                                                    I
  plexus, which, in common with Professor Yeo, wish to correct. What
  we took for the first dorsal nerve has proved in reality to be the
  second dorsal.     Hence the results of the experiments must be read as
  applying to the spinal nerves from the second dorsal to the fifth
  cervical respectively, instead of from the first dorsal to the fonriL
   cervical, as stated in our paper.
      The anterior 4division of the second dorsal nerve in the monkey,
  apparently invariably, gives a well developed communicating branch
  to the first dorsal, besides giving off the second intercostal n-rve and
  a branch to the stellate or inferior cervical ganglion of the sympa
  thetic.
      The three branches, as seen in a dissection made for me by Mr.
  Brooks, seem pretty equal in size, and all come off from th- main
  trunk together.
      The brachial plexus in man is not usually, in text-books of ana
  tomy, considered a& deriving any of its component roots below the
  first dorsal. In " Quain's Anatomy " (9th ed., p. 61ft), however, a
  branch from the second to the first dorsal is given as a variety.       On
  this subject Dr. D. J. Cunningham has published a 8note in the
  "Journal of Anatomy and Physiology," vol. xi, Part III, p. 539, 1877.
  Dr. Allen Thomson having mentioned to him that he had on one or
  two occasions seen such a communicating branch in man, he in
  vestigated the point, with the result of finding -a communicating
  branch from the second to the first dorsal in twenty-seven out of
  thirty-seven dissections.     Of the . ten cases where it was not found,
  five were so complicated by previous interference in the dissecting-
  room or by pleuritic adhesions and thickenings, that they may be con
  sidered as doubtful.      But, even including these, it appears that the
  second dorsal sends a communicating branch to the first in seventy-
   three per cent- of the cases. Hence it should be considered as more than
  a mere variety. If a perfect homology exists between the roots of the
   plexus in man and the monkey, the second dorsal root would be the one
   presiding over the intrinsic muscles of the hand.         Presumably in
 (those cases where it is not found, its functions are represented in
 -the first dorsal.
      Dilator Nerve of the Iris. — Professor Yeo and I mentioned in our
  paper (sup. cit.) that in one case in which we directed special attention
          4
  to the pupil, stimulation of the anterior roots from the first dorsal to
  the fourth cervical — in reality from the second dorsal to the fifth
  cervical — caused .no change in the pupil, though the movements of
i the limb occurred with regularity.
     •I have since investigated this point during the course of another
  research on whioh       I  have been for some time engaged.       I have

  1883.]      Oh  the Motor Roots of   the Brachial Plexus, fyc.      231
 experimented on four monkeys.             The animals were thoroughly
 narcotised with chloroform, and kept so during the whole course of
 the experiments.     The posterior roots of the nerves under investiga
 tion were cnt, and the anterior stimulated within the vertebral canal,
 with a weak induced current from the secondary coil (distant 20—15
 centims.) of a Du Bois Raymond's magneto-electromotor           and one
 Daniell.   As in former experiments, a large flat electrode was placed
 on the sacrum as a neutral poiut, the exciting electrode being a
 hooked needle, by means of ?vhich the roots could be easily insulated
 and separately stimulated.
    In the first experiment   I  failed to obtain dilatation of the pupil
 from stimulation of the spinal roots from the second dorsal up to the
 fourth cervical, though the functional activity of the roots was
indicated by movements of Jthe limb. In ,the second I exposed the
dorsal roots from the eighth op to the third inclusive. Though
different strengths of current were tpied no change in the pupil
occurred, unless when the cnrrent was so strong as to cause diffuse
stimulation.      In such case both pupils would occasionally become
dilated, as under sensory stimulation in general.          The functional
activity of the roots under investigation was shown by contraction of
th- thoracic muscles pn the side of stimulation.
    In the third experiment, however, results were obtained of such
definiteness and uniformity, as to indicate almost without further
confirmation the origin of the dilator nerve of the iris.
    In this experiment the spinal nerves were exposed from the sixth
cervical to the eighth dorsal inclusive. The posterior roots were cut
on the left side, and the anterior roots stimulated, while the eyes were
carefully observed by two assistants — my pupils, Mr. Norvill and
Mr. East. Dilatation of the left pupil occurred almost invariably on
stimulation of the .second dqssal root, whereas no change whatever
could be perceived on stimulation of any of the other exposed roots.
This   was verified over and over again, and the several roots repeatedly
compared with each other.       The distance of the secondary coil in this
experiment ranged from 2Q — 18 centims.
    Stronger currents not carefully insulated caused dilatation of both
pupils wherever the stimulation was applied, an expression .only of
general sensory stimulation.
    After death a careful dissection was made for me by Mr. Brooks,
and the effective root, which was marked, proved to be the second
dorsal.    An examination with a lens showed that the fibres of the
posterior root of this nerve had been completely severed.
    The results of the third experiment were entirely confirmed by the
fourth, which was carried out alike in every detail.

    In this exposed the spinal nerves froni the seventh cervical to the
fourth dorsal, and cut the posterior roots on the left side.

232                               Present*.                          [Apr. 5,
   Here again with the utmost uniformity on each stimulation of the
second dorsal the left pupil, and this one only, became widely dilated,
whereas stimulation of the other roots was entirely negative in respect
to the pupil.
   I ascertained in this experiment that a strength of current which
would suffice to excite the muscles of the limb or trunk to action, would
frequently fail to cause any dilatation of the pupil when applied to the
second dorsal.      Somewhat stronger, but yet barely perceptible on the
tongue,   the  current  at once caused the pupil to dilate.      Occasionally
also if the second root had been stimulated repeatedly, the iris failed
to respond, probably from mere exhaustion of the nerve.
   Circumstances such as these would,       I think, account for the absence
of the pupil-reaction in my first experiment, and also in the experi
ment related by Professor Yeo and myself, where the second dorsal
root was really under stimulation.
   The general result of these experiments is to show that in the
monkey, and presumably also in man, the dilator fibres of the iris,
contained in the cervical sympathetic, are derived from the anterior
root of the second dorsal nerve.

         Huggins, D.C.L., LL.D., F.R.S. Received May 21, 1883.
    Sir John Herschel says : " It (the bridge) sets the wood of the
upper face in a state of regular vibration, and this is communicated
 to the back through a peg set up in the middle of the fiddle, and
                                          '       '
through its sides, called the soul                   of the fiddle, or its sounding-
post."*

                says: "L'âme a pour usage de transmettre au fond les
vibrations de la table                           son diamètre est determiné par la
qualite du son qu'on veut avoir ; il est maigre quand elle est trop
 mince, et sourd quand elle est trop grosse. "t

discussion of the functions of the sound-post.

                                    Il nous semble que l'on doit expliquer l'effet
de l'âme de la maniere qui suit. L'âme, ou les pressions exterieurs par
lesquelles on la remplace, a pour effet de donner au pied du chevalet
un point d'appui autour duquel il vibre en battant sur la table de son
autre pied.         Si l'un des pieds n'etait appuyé sur un point fixe, il se
relèverait pendant que l'autre s'abaisserait,                    parceque      les cordes
n'agissent pas normalement à la table, puisque l'archet les ébranle
 très obliquement,          ce qui entraîne       le chevalet dans un mouvement
 transversal quand il n'a pas de point d'appui fixe.                     Lorsque l'archet
est dirigé normalement            aux tables, cet inconvénient n'existe plus, et
 l'âme n'est plus nécessaire.";];

'/'    holes.    One foot of the bridge rests upon a comparatively firm
support, namely, the sound-post, which is a solid rod inserted between
the two plates, back and belly, of the instrument. It is only the
other leg which agitates the elastic wooden plates, and through them
the included mass of air."*
     The experimentsf which follow have been made for the purpose of
ascertaining whether it be any part of the function of the sound-post
to convey vibrations to the back, or whether this post acts solely as a
prop supporting the belly, so that its elasticity is not injured by the
pressure from the strings, and also, as Daguin states, affords the firm
basis which he considers necessary for one foot of the bridge.
     Mr. Hill, and other practical men, maintain that the quality of the
wood of which the sound-post is made affects the tone of the violin,
as undoubtedly do very minute differences of position.               If the quality
of the    wood    is important   we   must admit    that  vibrations are conveyed
by the post.
     Whether or not the sound-post exercises the function of trans
mitting vibrations, it is obvious (1) that it performs the important
duty of contributing to the support of the belly ; (2) that the nodal
 arrangement of the belly, and also that of the back, are influenced by
 the pressure of the ends of the post against the upper and lower
 plates ; (3), that Helmholtz is right, at least so far that the leg of the
 bridge under the 4th or G string has much more power than the other.
 in setting the belly into vibration.
     The usual way of investigating vibrations by the scattering of
 6and over the surface of the agitated body is difficult of application
to the violin, on account of the curved form of the upper and lower
 plates.      I found a convenient method to be by the use of what I may
 call a touch-rod. It consists of a small round stick of straight-
 grained deal a few inches long ; the forefinger is placed on one end,
 and the other end is put lightly in contact with the vibrating surface.
 The finger soon becomes very sensitive to small differences of agitation
 transmitted by the rod.
     The experiments were made on a strongly made modern violin, and
 in some cases repeated on a fine violin by Stradiuarius in the posses
 sion of the writer.
      The sand method, and also the touch-rod, showed that the position
 of maximum vibration of the belly is close to the foot of the
 bridge under the 4th or G string.               The place of least vibration is
 exactly over the top of the sound-post behind the other foot of the
   bridge. The back is strongly agitated, the vibrations being kast

powerfully felt where the sound-post rests, which is at nearly the
thickest part of the back.   These effects were very satisfactorily
observed on a violoncello,       where the phenomena are on a larger scale.
   When the sonnd-post           was removed from the violin, the large
difference of the amount of vibration on the two sides of the belly
was no longer present, the belly was about equally strongly agitated
on both sides, making allowance for the string which was bowed.
The tone became very poor and thin, as is well known to be the case
when the    sonnd-post is removed. The vibration of the back was now
very feeble, as compared with its vibration when the sound-post was
present, a circumstance     in favour of the view that the sound-post
conveys vibrations to the back.
  A clamp of wood was prepared which could be so placed on the
violin, as to connect by an arch of wood outside the violin the place
of the belly behind the bridge where the top of the sound-post
presses, with the place of the back where it rests.    It was expected
that the wooden arch wonld j-estore to some extent the connexion of
belly and back which was broken by the removal of the post, and
carry, though imperfectly, vibrations from the upper plate to the
back.
   When this clamp was put on, the poor and thin sound was altered
to the fuller character of tone which belongs to the violin when the
sound-post is in its place.   On testing the condition of the back its
normal state of vibration was found to be in a large degree restored.
If, while the strings were being bowed, the clamp was suddenly
removed, the tone at the same moment fell to its poor character, and
the vibration of the back as instantly diminished.
  It was further observed that      the upper part of the clamp pressed
                                      if
upon the belly without the lower part coming into contact with the
lack, the tone was altered in the same direction as when the sound-
post was present, but       was not until the lower part of the clamp
                           it
was in contact with the back that the normal character of the
tone was fully restored.    A similar effect to that resulting from the
pressing of one end of the clamp only was produced by firmly placing
one end of    awooden rod at this part of the belly. This effect may
l)e due to the setting-up in the belly, by pressure at this part,    of
the peculiar nodal arrangement which the post produces when in its
place.*

244                          Dr. W. Huggins.                     [May   24,
    There could be no doubt that vibrations were carried by the
clamp, for the lower end was powerf ally agitated when the upper end
rested upon the belly. If the sole function of the sound-post is to
serve as a firm prop for the foot of the bridge, it should fulfil this
condition most fully when placed under the foot of the bridge.            In
this position of the sound-post, however, as is well known, the tone is
much injured.
     In order to separate that part of the function of the sound-post
which serves as a support from the further function it may possess as
a transmitter of vibrations, it was desirable to introduce such altera
tions in the structure of the sound-post as would enable it to retain
its supporting power, and yet greatly modify and, if possible, stop its
 power of transmitting vibrations. A sound-post was made in which
 about half an inch of the middle was cut out, and a piece of lead
 inserted, also a sound-post in which instead of lead sealing-wax was
 put in. The effect of these compound posts, which retained uninjured
 their prop power, was to modify greatly the quality of the tone, but
 not to diminish its quantity in any marked degree, a result in favour
 of the view that the character of the wood of which the post is made
 does influence the tone, and that vibration is transmitted by the pos8
  As these compound posts could transmit vibrations freely, it was
  desirable to contrive a post which would not carry vibrations and yet
  form a firm prop.      A post was made with a piece of hard India-
  rubber inserted in the middle, but this post was found by experiment
  with a tuning-fork to transmit vibrations to some extent.            Other
  materials were tried without success. A post capped at each end with
  pieces of sheet vulcanized rubber stopped almost complet-ly the
  sound of a tuning-fork when the foot of the fork rested on the rubber
  over one end of the post, while the other end equally protected with
  rubber rested on a body capable of reinforcing the sound of the fork.
  This rubber-capped post was firmly fixed in position in the violin, so
  that it would be able to support fairly well the belly and foot of the
   bridge, and yet not be able to carry vibrations; unfortunately it does
   not seem possible, from the nature of things, to have a rigid prop
   which does not transmit vibrations, but this post with thin sheet
   rubber at the ends firmly forced into position, must have been fairly
   efficient in its supporting power.    The effect on the tone was about
   the same as when the sound-post was removed.           When the wooden
   clamp was put on, then the normal tone returned, and the back
   vibrated strongly.
       These experiments appear to show that the sound-post is more than
   a prop, and that besides its other functions, it does transmit vibrations
   to the back in addition to those which are conveyed through the sides.
       Experiments with sand and the touch-rod appear to me to show
   that Helmholtz's statement is too absolute when he says " it is onlr

1883.]          On the Sound-post and Strings     of the Violin.        245
the other leg of the bridge which agitates the elastic wooden plates."
Undoubtedly it is the 4th string foot of the bridge which is the
more powerful in agitating the upper plate, but the other foot appears
to me also to have an influence.        When the post is placed exactly
under the foot of the bridge, then the belly on this side is almost
without vibration ; if the post is absent, then this foot appears to
agitato its own side of the belly as strongly as the other foot.
As there is no post on the 4th string side of the fiddle, that foot
stands in a position most favourable for setting up vibrations in the
 belly, being nearly halfway between the supports of the belly at the
 tail and the neck end    of the violin. The other side of the belly, on
 the    1st string side, where the other foot of the bridge rests, is
 divided into two parts by the damping effect of the end of the sound-
 post, namely,    the part a and the part   b. It  is obvious  that this foot
  of the   bridge is unfavourably placed for setting the part of the belly,
     into vibration, since it is so far from its central mobile part.     On
 the other hand, its position is favourable for a portion of its energy
  of vibration to be transmitted through the post to the back.
      Practically very small differences of position of the top of the post
  behind the foot of the bridge are found to alter largely the character
  of the tone of the fiddle, and in the case of fine instruments the
  setting of the post is an operation demanding much care and judg
  ment.      The explanation lies probably in the circumstance that a
  small difference in the position of the post will alter greatly the pro
   portion of energy passing through the post to that which is absorbed
   into vibrations of this side of the belly.  At the same time it must also
   alter slightly the nodal arrangement of the belly which must have an
   influence on the tone.    If from the form of construction, or relative
   quality of the wood of the upper plate as compared with the under
    plate, the conditions of a violin are such that the highest quality of
    tone of which it is capable requires a relatively larger amplitude of
    vibration of the back, the position of the sound-post should be nearer

246                        Dr. W. Huggins.                      [May  24,
the bridge.   In a contrary condition of things the sound-post should
be farther from the bridge.      The extreme range needed in different
violins is about a quarter of an inch. At the same time any shift of
the post must affect the relative mobility of the two sides of the belly.
   If the sound-post transmits vibrations, these will be in addition to
those received from the sides of the violin.   It may be, therefore, that
one condition which determines the best position of the post, is the
degree in which from their form and material these fulfil this duty.
All the sides must share in this duty, but the touch-rod shows that a
large part of this action is borne by the parts of the sides which
curve inwards under where the strings are bowed.        It is in harmony
with this view that Mr. Hill states, that if the inside blocks at the
corners, which are put to strengthen these parts, extend in a small
degree into these curved portions, the tone is injured.
   The plane of the vibrations of the strings is that in which they are
bowed, which is more or less oblique to the bridge.       The vibrations
may be considered divided into two sets at right angles to each
other, a and b.
                                    a
   The touch-rod shows that these vibrations exist strongly in the
upper part of the bridge.      I  venture to suggest that the use of the
peculiar cutting of the bridge, which was finally fixed from trials by
Stradiuarius, is to sift the vibrations communicated by the strings
and to allow those only, or mainly, to pass to the feet which wonld
be efficient in setting the body of the instrument into vibration.
the other vibrations which would be injurious in tending to give a
transverse rocking motion to the bridge being for the most part
absorbed by the greater elasticity given to the upper part of the bridge
by the cutting.   Below the two large lateral cuts the touch-rod shows
a very great falling off of the vibrations b. In the case of a violon
cello these vibrations were also very greatly reduced below the side
openings of the bridge.
   The violin on which the experiments were made was without a bass
bar, which is a piece of pine glued to the under side of the belly on

the 4th    string side.   This bar is regarded as strengthening the
belly, and also enabling it to respond better to the lower notes. The
touch-rod showed no difference in the general behaviour of this
violin, from a fine one by Stradinarius containing a bass bar.*
                      On the Proportional Thickness of the Strings.
  As the lengths of the strings are the same, we have only the two
conditions of weight and tension on which their pitch depends.      It is
obvious that for equal pressure on the feet of the bridge, as well as for
more    convenient fingering and bowing, the strings should be at the
same tension.     They should, therefore, differ in weight, so as to give
 fifths when brought to the same tension.      The weights of the strings
 must be inversely as the squares of the number of vibrations, which,
 in the case of fifths, is as 3 to 2, namely, as 9 to 4. As the first three
.strings are of the same material, it is more convenient to take their
diameters, which must be as 3 to 2, that                    is,
                                                each string in advancing
 from the 1st string must be half as thick again as the string next to
 it. In the case of the 4th string covered with wire, we must find the
 ¦weight of the 3rd string of gut, and take a 4th string of which the
 weight      to
             is   9 for the 3rd string.

   It will be seen that the 1st string is thicker, and the 3rd            thinner,
and the 4th much lighter than the theoretical values.              Therefore the
tension of the 1st string would be greater, and that of the 3rd and
4th strings less than they should be in relation to that of the 2nd
string. The greater flexural rigidity of the 4th string will have a
small effect in the direction of making the vibrations quicker, and
therefore of making the tension required less.
   By means of a mechanical contrivance I found the weights neces
sary to deflect the strings to the same amount when the violin was in
tune.    The results agreed with the tensions which the sizes of the
strings showed they would require to give fifths.
   A violin strung with strings of the theoretical size was very un
satisfactory in tone.
   The explanation of this departure of the sizes of the strings which
long experience has shown to be practically most suitable, from the
values they should have from theory, lies probably in the circumstance
that the height of the bridge is different for the different strings. It
is obvious, where the bridge is high, there is a greater downward
pressure.     By this modification of the sizes of the strings there is not
the greater pressure on the 4th string side of the bridge, which wonld
otherwise be the case.         On the contrary, the pressure is less, which
may assist the setting of the belly into vibration.             There is also the
circumstance that the strings which go over a high part of the bridge
stand farther from the finger-board, and have therefore to be pressed
through a greater distance, which would require more force than is
required for the other strings, if the tension were not less.

   In the course of a paper by Professor Humpidge on the above subject,
recently read before the Society,* the author seeks to decide between
the atomic weight 9"2 for beryllium, resulting from my comparison of
the atomic heat of the element with that of silver and aluminium- t

 attempting to prepare even a few decigrams of beryllium are so great,
 that both sets of experiments have been objected to on the ground,
amongst others, that the metal employed was in all cases impure.               My
specimen     admittedly contained a minute quantity of platinum, and the
proportion of known impurity in one of MM. Nilson and Pettersson's
specimens reached 13 per cent. Unfortunately, Professor Humpidge's
metal, though claimed to be the purest yet prepared, is shown by
analysis to be rather less pure than one of the specimens employed by
Nilson and Pettersson, hence the experiments lately made known to
the Society do not carry the inquiry beyond the point previously
reached, save in one noteworthy particular, namely, that there appears
to be a considerable, though irregular, rise in specific heat of the
element as the proportion of impurity             diminishes ; but the value
is still much below that required for the atomic weight 942.             Thus for
a specimen       of beryllium which contained 13 per cent- of known
impurity     Nilson  and Pettersson obtained the specific heat 044084
between 0° and 100" C, and for a less impure specimen 0"425 ; while
Professor Humpidge- in one of his experiments with a material that
contained 6 per cent- of impurity, found the specific heat to be nearly
0-45 (044497).      In all these cases corrections were applied which wer-
believed to eliminate the effects due to the impurities known to be
present —in part mechanically mixed with the metal and partly alloyed
with it.
    These results all tend in one direction, that is to say, to apparent
gain in specific heat with increased purity of material, and in so far
they approach the still higher value obtained in my old experiments.
But even if the latter had not been made, the apparent rise in specific
heat shown by the other determinations, would suggest the necessity
for appeal to data afforded by beryllium of undoubted purity. In order
that further experiments should now be considered decisive, the metal
should not only be pure, but in the form of a homogeneous mass
 obtained    by fusion, as the specimen         I  used was an apparently
 uncrystalline product of fusion, while the metal employed by Nilson
 and Pettersson chiefly consisted of
                                            " aggregations of little prismatic
 needles," mixed with the oxide.
    The most promising source of pure beryllium is the double fluoride
 of the element and potassium, but          I have not hitherto succeeded in
 making the product of reduction form a button of metal.
     Professor Hartley has very recently made known some highly
  interesting spectroscopic evidence* affecting the position of beryllium
  amongst the metals, and so directly bearing on the question of its
  valence that I may be permitted to refer -to the results in this place.
     If the atomic weight of beryllium be 1348, the element is a triad and
  the formula of its oxide must be Be203. The latter therefore resembles-

alumina in being a sesquioxide, bat is at once distinguished as it does
not afford an alum-like double sulphate as do alumina and its homo-
logues, and has comparatively little in common with that group, save
the tendency to form highly basic salts. Nilson and Pettersson,*
admitting this, maintain that beryllium is a leading member of another
group of triads, which includes the rare earth-metals scandium.
yttrium, lanthanum, didymium, terbium- erbium, &c. The recent
spectroscopic evidence above referred to is opposed to this contention,
as the spectrum of beryllium is stated to be wholly unlike the spectra
afforded by the rare earth-metals with which it is classed in the memoir
above cited. If, then, beryllium does not find a place in the two known
families of metallic triads, or pseudo-triads, it must stand alone ; and
in any case as a triad it is outside Mendeleef's classification. But if the
atomic weight of beryllium be 9"2, according to my result, the metal is
a diad and the symbol for its oxide is BeO. It is, therefore, the first
member of Mendeleef's        second series of elements.         This position
is quite in accordance with the spectroscopic evidence obtained by
Professor Hartley, from which he concludes that " beryllium is the first
member of a diad series of elements, of which in all probability calcium,
strontium, and barium are homologues."

4one end of which projected the necessary conductor.             This element
 was placed between two plates of finely divided lead likewise 4 inches
 square.    These were joined together, and formed the positive element
 of the cell. Each half of the positive plate was about a quarter of an
 inch distant from the negative, and all three plates were encased in a
 thin specially prepared fabric. The elements were contained in a
 leaden case, and the liquid was sulphuric acid of the strengths given
 in the various experiments.      This cell was placed inside the cylindrical
copper vessel used in the previous experiments,             and precisely the

Tables    VII, VIII, and IX, and plotted out in the curves IV, V, and
VI.     The different results are for different degrees of saturation. It
is evident from an inspection of those tables and diagrams, that the
influence of heat on secondary cells is the same in kind as in the
Daniell cell, but that it differs very much in degree.                  Tbe electromo
tive force practically remains constant for all degrees of temperature,
but the internal resistance diminishes as the temperature                      increases at
a very steady rate, increasing again as the temperature                         is lowered.
The effect of varying the percentage of acid in solution is not very
 marked, though as might have been anticipated from Kohlrausch's
observations, the 30 per cent- proportion gives the lowest resistance.
 The mean average reduction in resistance between 0° and 100° C, is
 59"6 per cent.       This is shown by the following table : —

 IV. "Examination         of the Meteorite which fell on the 16th
       February, 1883, at Alfianello, in the District of Verolan-
       nova, in the Province of Brescia, Italy."           By Walter
       Flight, D.Sc, F.G.S. Communicated by Professor G. G.
       Stokes, Sec. R.S.     Received May 17, 1883.
    I gather from a short preliminary notice, which has been sent by
 M. Denza to Professor Daubree, and has been published in a recent
 number of the " Comptes Rendus," a few particulars respecting the
 fall of this stone, and its general appearance.
    The fall took place, with a loud detonation, at 2.55 p.m. on the day
 above mentioned ; it was heard in the neighbouring provinces of
 Cremona, Verona, Mantua, Piacenza, and Parma. In Alfianello it
 is described as " epouvantable.'"
    It descended from N.N.E. to S.S.W., at a distance of about 1.50
 metres from a peasant, who fell famting to the ground ; telegraphic
 wires were set in motion, and the windows were shaken.          It struck
the ground about 300 metres south-west of Alfianello, in a field on an
estate called Frosera, penetrating the soil, in the same direction as it
passed through the air, from east to west, to a depth of about
1 metre, the path through the soil being about l-50 metre.          When
taken out of the ground it was still a little warm. It fell complete,
but was at once broken to pieces by the farmer of the estate.
    The stone is oval in form, and somewhat flattened in the centre, the
lower part being larger and convex, like a kettle, the upper part
being truncated.     The surface is covered with the usual black crust,
and strewn with little cavities, now met with as individuals, now in
groups, and in the eye of some people bearing a resemblance to the
impression of a hand or the foot of a she-goat.        The stone weighs
about 200 kilos.
    In structure this  meteorite  belongs  to the group Sporadosideres
oligosideres, and resembles Aumalite, being almost identical with the
meteorite of New Concord, Ohio.
    The substance is finely granular, of ash-grey colour ; a polished
surface    appears to be finely grained and breccia-form, with the
elements offering different gradations of colour.     Metallic grains are
disseminated, and little nests are noticed, of iron with one of the
compounds, of a yellowish-white or bronze.       In one place where the
metallic grains are numerous they appear to bear to the stony portion
the ratio 68 : 1000. The density of the stone is 347 to 3-50.
    The meteorite was dried at 120°, and treated with solution of
mercury chloride, and thus there were dissolved the troilite and nickel-
iron. The troilite constituted 6"919 per cent- of the meteorite, and
the nickel-iron forma 24108 of the stone, with the composition —

    Here, again, as   I have shown in earlier analyses, the percentage of
 nickel present  in nickel-iron increases as the percentage of nickel-iron
 becomes  less.
    By long treatment with hydrogen chloride the silicates acted upon. by
 that reagent and the silicates which resist the action were separated,
 and the stone appeared to possess the composition —

   The soluble silicate, which amounts to 50"857 per cent., and consti
tutes one-half the weight of the stone, consists of—

   This olivine, which gives a green colour to a fragment of the rock
that is at once recognised,     is of uuusual composition, containing as it
does  more than 50 per cent- of iron oxide.                  It agrees most closely
with   that which occurs in the meteorite of Ensisheim, the first
recorded  fall which has been preserved in any collection; it fell 17th
November,     1492.     The latest analysis of that stone is by Frank
Crook, of Baltimore, made in Gottingen in 1868, and he found in the
soluble portion of that stone 52490 per cent- of iron oxide.

found to be almost entirely chromium oxide, doubtless present in
combination with some iron protoxide, alumina, and magnesia as

V. " Circular concerning Astronomical Photography." .-From E.
        C. Pickering, Director of Harvard College Observatory,
        Cambridge, Mass., U.S.A.
                           Astronomical   Photography.
     The important part that photography is likely to play in< the future
of     astronomy renders it desirable that an opportunity should be
afforded to astronomers to acquaint themselves 4 with the improve
 ments continually made in this branch of their science.          This could
 best be done by the establishment at convenient places of collections
 designed to exhibit the progress of photography as applied to astro
 nomical observations.
     The Harvard College Observatory has som-- special advantages for
 forming suoh a collection, since it already -possesses many of the
 early and historically important specimens <which would naturally
 form part of • the series. Among these may be mentioned four series
 of daguerreotypes and photographs of various celestial objects taken
 at this Observatory. 4These series were respectively undertaken in
 1850,    1857, 1869, and 1882.
     At   present,   the astronomers   of tho. United States have no ready
 means      of comparing their 'photographic       work with " that done in
  Europe, or even. with that of their own countrymen.          The proposed
  collection of photographs, so\ far as it could be rendered complete,
  would greatly reduce the difficulty.
      It is therefore desired to form, at the Harvard College Observa
  tory, a collection- of all photographs of the heavenly bodies and of
  their spectra whioh can be obtained for the purpose ; and it is hoped
  that both European and American astronomers will contribute
  specimens to this collection.      Original negatives would be particularly
  valuable.     It may •happen- that some such negatives, having slight
  imperfections which would limit their value for purposes of engrav
  ing, could be spared for a collection, and would be as important
   (considered as astronomical observations) as others photographically
  more perfect.       In some cases, astronomers may be willing to deposit
  negatives taken for a- special purpose, and no longer required for
  study, in   a  collection where they would retain    a permanent value    as

 1883.]     Circular concerning Astronomical Photography.              261
parts of an historical series.      Where photography is regularly em
ployed   in  a  continuous   series  of observations, it is obvious that
specimen negatives only can be spared for a collection. But in such
cases  it is hoped that some duplicates may be available, and that
occasional negatives may hereafter be taken for the purpose of being
added to the collection, to exhibit recent improvements or striking
phenomena.
   When negatives cannot be furnished, glass positives, taken if
possible by direct printing, would be very useful.       If these also are
not procurable, photographic prints or engravings would be desir
able.
   In connexion with the photographs themselves, copies of memoirs or
communications relating to the specimens sent, or to the general subject
of astronomical photography, would form an interesting supplement to
the collection.    A part of the contemplated scheme will involve the
preparation of a complete bibliography of the subject, including a list
of uupublished photographs not hitherto mentioned in works to which
reference may be made.
   The expense which may be incurred by contributors to the collec
tion in the preparation and transmission of specimens will be gladly
repaid by the Harvard College Observatory when desired.

The Bakerian Lecture—'- On Radiant Matter Spectroscopy.
      A New Method of Spectrum Analysis," was delivered by
      William Cuookes. -F.R.S.           Received May 24, 1883.
    The following is an Abstract    : —
    For several years  I have been examining the phenomena presented
by various   substances  when struck by the molecular discharge from
the negative polo in a highly exhausted tube.          I  have ventured to
call this discharge "radiant matter," and under its influence a large
number of substances emit phosphorescent light, some faintly and
others with great intensity.      On examining the emitted light in the
spectroscope most bodies give a faint eontinuous spectrum, with a
more or less decided concentration in -one part of the spectrum, the
superficial colour of the phosphorescing substance being governed by
this preponderating emission in one or other part of the spectrum.
Sometimes, but more rarely, the spectrum of the phosphorescent
light is discontinuous, and it is to bodies manifesting this pheno
menon that my attention has been. specially directed.
    For a long time past I have been haunted by a bright citron-
coloured band or line appearing .in these phosphorescent           spectre,
sometimes as a sharp line, at others as a broader nebulous band.
but having always a characteristic appearance and occurring uni
formly in the same spot. The best way to bring out the band is to
 treat the substance under examination with strong sulphuric acid.
drive off excess of acid by heat, and finally to raise the temperature
to redness.    The anhydrous sulphate thus left frequently shows the
 citron band in the radiant matter tube, when before this treatment the
 original substance shows nothing. I soon came to the conclusion that
the substance I was in search of was a- earth, but on attempting to
determine its chemical properties I was baflled.
    Much chemical evidence tended to support the view that the band
might be due to a compound of lime.             By neglecting the portion
showing    least  citron band,   and   separating all the elements present
 which gave little or none,    I  could generally concentrate the citron
 band into a solution which — according to our present knowledge of
 analytical chemistry — should contain little else than the earths

 1883.]             On Radiant Matter Spectroscopy.                   263
alkaline earths, and alkalies.    Ammonia added to this solution would
precipitate an earth, and in the filtrate oxalic acid would precipitate
an insoluble oxalate, showing the citron band strongly.         This was
found on analysis to consist of strontic and calcic oxalates.         The
strontia being separated, the remaining lime formed an oxalate which
gave the citron band.
    So far all the chemical evidence went to show that the band-
forming substance was calcium, and further tests tried with the
purified oxalate confirmed this inference. Every analytical test to
which it was subjected showed lime, and nothing but lime ; all the
salts which were prepared from it resembled those of lime, both
physically and chemically ; the flame spectrum gave the calcium
lines with extraordinary purity and brilliancy ; and, finally, the atomic
weight, taken with great care, came out almost the same as that for
calcium, 39"9 as against Ca 40.
   On further examination it was found that most native compounds
of lime gave the citron band.       It was found in clear and colourless
Iceland spar, native calcic phosphate, a crystal of arragonite, a
stalactite of calcic carbonate from Gibraltar, cinnamon stone (lime
alumina garnet), iron slag from a blast-furnace, pink coral, com
mercial plaster of Paris, and most specimens of ordinary burnt lime.
   Evidence stronger than this in favour of the view that the citron
band was an inherent characteristic of .calcium could scarcely be ;
hut, on the other hand, there was evidence equally conclusive that the
band was not essential to calcium.
    Starting with a lime compound which showed the citron band, I
could always obtain a calcic oxalate which gave the band stronger
than the original substance ; but if I started with a lime compound
which originally gave no citron band, I could never by any means,
chemical or physical, constrain the lime or the earthy precipitate to
yield a citron band.
                                I
   The only explanation that could see for this anomaly was that the
elusive citron band was caused by some element precipitated with the
calcic oxalate, but present in a quantity too small to be detected by
ordinary chemical means.          The calcic oxalate was ignited and
 dissolved in hydrochloric acid, and fractionally precipitated in three
 portions with ammonic oxalate, the first and third portions being
 comparatively small.     They were then tested in the radiant matter
 tube.   All three portions showed the citron band, but the portion
 which came down first gave the band decidedly the strongest, and
 the third portion precipitated showed it weakest.
    It having been found that the substance giving the citron band
 formed a sulphate more soluble in water than calcic sulphate, 4 lbs.
 "eight of commercial        plaster   of Paris, which     showed     very
 faint traces of the citron band, were mixed with water and poured on

a large   filter. A few ounces of -water were poured on, and after
passing through, poured back, and the exhaustion repeated several
times.    The aqueous extract was then evaporated to dryness, ignited
with sulphuric acid, ground in a mortar with small successive quan
tities of water, and precipitated with ammouic oxalate.       The precipi
tate, ignited with sulphuric acid, showed iae citron band very fairly.
far more intensely than it was seen;in the original calcic sulphate.
    These experiments are conclusive in proving that the citron band
is not due to calcium, but tb some other element, probably one of the
earthy metals, occurring4 in very minute quantities but widely dis
tributed along with calcium, -and I at once commenced experiments to
find a more abundant supply of the body sought for. Amongst other
substances tested I may note the following as4 giving a more or less
decided citron bandoi in! the spe6trum when' treated with srulphnnc
acid in the manner indicated above : — Crystallised barytic chlorate,
heavy spar, common limestone, strontic nitrate, native strontic car
bonate, crystallised uranic nitrate, commercial       magnesic sulphate,
commercial     potassic sulphate,4   tobacco ash, wagnerite (magnesic
phosphate      and   fluoride), zircon;- cerite,- and commercial      eerie
oxalate.
    Some specimens of zircon appeared sufficiently rich to make it
probable that here might be found an available source of the citron
band yielding body.      I found it in crystals frdm Green River, North
 Carolina, from Ceylon, from Expallly, from Miask (Oural),4and from
Brevig, and having a' good supply of North Carolina zircons, these
were worked up by a'pro6ess given in detail in the paper.
    I may condense a' year's work on zircon, — over 10 lbs. weight of
 crystals from North Carolina having been worked up — by stating
that the     result wasT comprised in' about 300 grs. of an earthy
residue, and about 2 ozs. of oxalate,-chiefly calcic4; the former gave
 the citron band very well.
    The zirconia prepared from these1 zircons, when tested, sometimes
showed the citron band, and at other times none.        A zirconia rich m
 citron band, fractionally precipitated by ammonia, yielded precipitates
of increasing richness, the last fraction showing1 the citron band
strongly.
    The calcic oxalate obtained from zircon' gave' unsatisfactory results,
so attention was directed to'the earthy residue.     This was found to be
of highly complex character, containing thoria, ceria, lanthana,
didymia, yttria, and probably some of the newly-discovered rarer
earths.
    The position of the citron band in the spectrum falls exactly on the
strongest absorption band of didymium, so that a piece of didymiura
glass or cell of solution of the nitrate entirely obliterates the citron
band.    This naturally suggested that the band was due to didymiam.

 1883.]                 On   Radiant Matter Spectroscopy.                   265
     Cerite was accordingly the next mineral experimented on. The
powdered mineral tested in the tube in the original way gave a good
citron band.        The mixed earths after extraction were converted into
sulphates, dissolved       in water, and the cerium metals precipitated       by
long digestion      with excess of potassic sulphate.
     The precipitated double sulphates were converted into oxalates,
and after ignition and treatment with sulphuric acid, the mixed ceria,
lanthana, and didymia were tested in the radiant matter tube, but the
merest trace only of citron band was visible.
     This experiment proved the inadequacy of the didymium explana
tion, and     further tests showed that not only could I get no citron
band in pure didymium compounds, but the spectrum entirely failed
to detect didymium in many solutions of the earth which gave the
 citron band brilliantly.
     Attention was'now turned tb the solution filtered from the insoluble
double sulphates.        Potash wafer added, and 'the precipitate filtered off,
and tested in a radiant matter' tube.         The spectrum, of extraordinary
 brilliancy, was far brighter than any              I   had hitherto obtained.
 Unfortunately, however, the quantity was too small to be subjected to
 very accurate chemical analysis.
     Search was now made amongst other minerals rich in the rarer
 earths. Thorite was finely powdered, treated with sulphuric acid, and
 tested in the radiant matter tube.         It gave the citron spectrum most
              —
 brilliantly equal in fact to the mixture of earths obtained from
 zircons at so great an expenditure of time and trouble.                Orangite
 treated in the same manner gave almost as good a spectrum.                 Pure
 thorinic sulphate prepared by myself was found not to give the citron
  band, but three specimens prepared and given to me by friends all
  gave it, so it was not unlikely that in thorite and orangite might at
  last be found a good source of the long-sought element — that in fact
  the body    I   was hunting for, if not thorina, might possibly be Bahr's
  hypothetical wasium. Two pounds of orangite and thorite were
   extracted with hydrochloric acid.       The solution was precipitated with
   potassic sulphate, taking the usual precautions           to secure complete
   precipitation.     A   bulky precipitate    enstted,   which   contained   the
   thorina and cerium        earths.  These Were separated and tested, and
   found to give only a faint citron baud.
      The solution of earthy sulphates soluble in potassic sulphate was
   precipitated with amnionic oxalate.          The precipitate ignited with
   Bulphuric acid, and tested in a radiant matter tube, gave the citron
    spectrum   with great brilliancy.
       Certain chemical facts concerning the behaviour of the sought-for
    element which came out during the course of the tentative trials
    described   in the paper considerably narrowed the list amongst which
    it might probably    be found.    All the evidence tends to show that it

     Some of these claimants it is certain will not stand the test of
farther scrutiny. Thus samarium and yttrium /3 are in all probability
identical; and         I  have not included philippium, as Roscoe has conclu
sively proved that this is a mixture of terbium and yttrium, and my
own results confirm those of Roscoe.                   Moreover, some of these so-
called elements will probably turn out to be mixtures of other known
elements.         But in the confessedly very imperfect state of our know
ledge    of   the   chemistry of these metals it is not safe for me in this
research to assume that any one of them will surely not survive. The
complete list as it stands will therefore be taken to contain all hitherto
claimed as new, although it is almost certain to include too many.
    In .the second column " Yes " or " No " indicates whether the solu
tions give an absorption spectrum when examined by transmitted
light. After numerous experiments I satisfied myself that the metal
giving the citron band spectrum was net one of those giving an
absorption         spectrnm.        The possible elements, therefore, became
narrowed to the following list : — Cerium, lanthanum, mosandrum,
scandium,         terbium, thorium, ytterbium, yttrium, yttrium «, and
zirconium.
    Of these the patassic sulphate reaction excludes cerium, lanthanum,
scandium, thorium, yttrium a, and zirconium, so there are left only the
following :—
                                         Mosandrum,
                                         Terbium,
                                         Ytterbium,
                                         Yttrium.
     Certain chemical        reactions for a long time made me dismiss yttrium
 from the      list of   likely 'bodies. In my analysis of zircons, towards the
 latter part      of the process, I used the following process to separate the
 iron: — The solution mixed with tartaric acid and excess of ammonia
 was allowed to stand for some time.               A small quantity of a precipitate
  gradually formed, which was filtered off, and it was this filtrate, after
  separating the iron with ammonic sulphide, that yielded the greatest
  quantity of substance giving the citron band. Now one of the methods
  of separating yttria from alumina, beryllia, thoria, and zirconia is to
  precipitate it as tartrate in the presence of excess of ammonia, the
                                                                      "
  other earths remaining in solution. 'Fresenius says : — The precipita
  tion ensues only after some time, but it is complete."
     The precipitate thus obtained with tartaric acid and ammonia should
  therefore contain all the yttria : it gave no citron band whatever in the
   radiant matter tube; whilst the residue, which should be free from
   nmplicity in calculating the values     from the composition of their salts, hy which
   these metals are  ch-fly  discriminated, taken the type of oxide to be MaO.

yttria, proved for    a    long time the only source of material      wherewith
to investigate   the chemical      properties of the body giving      the citron
spectrum.
   Another reason which made me at this stage of the research pass
over yttria was that    had already tested this earth in the radiant
                           I
matter tnbe.  In a paper on " Discontinuous Phosphorescent Spectn
in High Vacua," read before the Royal Society, May 19, 1881, said,        I
" Yttria shows a dull greenish light, giving continuous
                                                      a spectrum.'
  For these reasons for a long time omitted yttria from my list
                          I                                                      of
possible bodies, and considered that the earth,   not a new one,
                                                          if               might
turn out to be either mosandra, terbia, or ytterbia.
   About 15 lbs. weight of samarskite was worked up, partly                hy the
hydrofluoric     acid method     of Lawrence      Smith,  and partly by   fusion
with potassic bisulphate.
   These methods both gave as a result a large quantity of mixed
earths containing most,         ifnot all, -the bodies' enamerated in the fore
going   list.   Tested  irf'the  radiant   matter tnbe this mixture gave the
citron spectrum very Brilliantly.
   These earths were treated by a series of chemical processes too long
and complicated to describe in this abstract, and the result of about
five hundred fractional precipitations gave me a mixture of earths
having an H equivalent, M=48,-and showing a strong absorption
spectrum;    a    mixture having an H equivalent, M=33, having no
absorption spectrum        ;and intermediate earths.
   In the radiant matter tube all these fractions gave th- citron band
spectrum well, but that of the earth of lowest equivalent was much
the brightest, and that of the highest equivalent the least intense.
                                -
   Three methods are available for the partial separation of the<e
earths and for the complete purification of any one of them. The
formic acid process        isbest for separating terbia, as terbic formate         is
difficultly soluble in water, the other formates being easily soluble.
   Fractional precipitation with oxalic acid separates fi«t erbia.
holmia, and thulia, then terbia, and lastly yttria.           This   isthe only
method which     is   applicable for the separation of small quantities            of
terbia from yttria.
   Fusing the nitrates separates ytterbia, erbia, holmia, and thulia
from yttria. It       is not so applicable when terbia         is
                                                                present, and       is
most useful in purifying the gadolinite earths.            This process    is the
only one known for separating ytterbia from yttria.
   Selection must be made of these methods according to the mixture
of earths under treatment, changing the method as one earth or the
other becomes concentrated on one side or thrown out on the other.
Each operation must be repeated many times before even approximate
purity is   attained.   The operations are more analogous to the separa
tion of members of homologous series of hydrocarbons by fractional

distillation than to the separations        in mineral chemistry     as ordinarily
adopted in the laboratory.
    Pure terbia ignited with sulphuric acid and tested in the radiant
matter tube shows no citron band spectrum.               A concentrated solution
of the purest      terbia   obtained    in this way, when examined by the
spectroscope,     showed no absorption lines whatever : proving the
absence of   erbium,     holmium, and thulium.
    I did not attempt any separation of erbium, holmium, and thulium
from each other, as the evidence obtained was sufficient to show that
the element giving the citron band spectrum               was not one of these
three metals.      Likewise     I  had  far too little  material to enable me to
enter on a work of such difficulty with any prospect of success.
    The chemical characters of mosandra are so little known that T
could n-t attempt to search for it.           But„as the citron band-forming
earth always appeared concentrated amongst those whose double sul
phates were most soluble in potassia sulphate — and, of these, amongst
those having the palest colour and lowest atomic weight — it was
scarcely conceivable        that the earth I was in search of should ulti
mately prove     to   be  one  -whose properties did not in any case corre
spond to these   —   of a dark orange<yellow colour, forming a difficultly
soluble double potassic sulphate, and having the very high equivalent
of M=5142 ; these being the properties ascribed to. mosandra by the
discoverer, Professor Lawrence Smith.
    Ytterbia was prepared from gadolinite, .as this mineral is said by
Nilson to contain mostOytterbia. It was separated from accompanying
earths by processes described in the paper.             The resulting earth gave
 at first a faint citroiuband spectrnm, evidently due to impurity ; on
 repeating the purification several times I at last .succeeded in obtain
 ing a white earth which gave only the merest trace. of citron band
 spectrum.     Its hydrogen equivalent, 5840, rand its. chemical properties
 showed that it was probably Marignac's ytterbia. . Subsequent ex
 periments satisfied me i that this earth did not contain more than
 nshrs Part of yttria.           -The extreme tediousuess .of the chemical
 operations necessary to obtain this high degree of purity, and the
 long time they required, .prevented .me from pushing these iesults
 beyond what was necessary to prove-the special point at issue.
     The yttria, purified as already described, might still contain traces
  of terbia, together with erbia, holmia,              and thulia.     These were
  gradually  removed      by  the  fusing  nitrate  process. .The   atomic  weight
  gradually got down to 3l-Q, but the. spectra did not vary very much ;
  that from the earth of loweet atomic weight being, however, the most
  brilliant.
     Pure yttria is qnite white.       That from gadolinite on testing in the
  radiant matter tube gave a spectrum absolutely              identical with that
  given by the zircon, cerite, thorite, orangite, and samarskite yttria.

Pure yttria was also prepared from yttro-tantalite, enxenite, tyrite.
and also from plaster of Paris and common limestone.      In no case
         I
conld detect any difference in the position or intensity of the lines
shown by their phosphorescent       spectra.
                   The Phosphorescent Spectrum- of Yttria.
  The spectrum shown by pure ignited yttric sulphate in a radiant
matter tube is one of the most beautifnl objects in the whole range of
spectroscopy.   The spectrum is best seen under low dispersion and
not too narrow a slit. It consists essentially of a broad red band, at
intensely brilliant citron band, and two almost equally brilliant green
bands.     Other fainter lines are also seen, but they are not characteristic.
Coloured drawings and maps of the spectrum to scale accompany the
paper. This description applies to the spectrum shown either by pure
yttric sulphate or by an earth tolerably rich in yttria.            When traces
are present th- citron band only is seen.           A little more- yttria brings
out the first and then the second green band, and finally, as the pro
portion of yttria increases, the red and blue bands appear.
   The paper next gives a description of experiments made with pure
yttria, and with various compounds of          it,to see which would give the
most   characteristic   spectrum.     The   sulphate heated to redness was
found to give the best results. Pure yttria precipitated by ammonia
did not phosphoresce in the slightest degree, and, necessarily, no
citron band spectrum was to be seen.          The yttria was removed from
the  tube,  converted  into  sulphate,  heated   to redness, and again tested.
This time     itgave the citron band magnificently.            This shows what
apparently    trivial circumstances     will  alter   the  whole course       of
                                                                              an
investigation.      In 1881, when searching for discontinuous phos
phorescent spectra,  I   tried a similar experiment with pure precipitated
yttria, and entirely missed its citron band spectrum.                Had first
                                                                           I
treated   the  yttria with    sulphuric  acid   instead    of testing the earth
itself in the radiant matter tube the results would have been very
different, and this research would probably have never been under
taken.
  Yttria was now prepared by igniting the precipitated oxalate                  at   a
red heat.  On testing    in the radiant matter tube
                          it                                 it
                                                     phosphoresced
with feeble intensity, the light being  about one-twentieth of that
given by the ignited sulphate       under similar conditions.         The    citron
band was almost as sharp as the sodium line, and was shifted one
division towards the blue end. The two green bands were visible,
but very hazy and indistinct, and only to be resolved into bands with
difficulty.

ness of this spectrum test forced itself on my notice than    I sought for
yttrium in other minerals.       The facts which I had noticed in con
nexion with the variation of the appearance of the citron spectrum,
according to the quantity of yttrium present, showed that it might be
possible to devise a process for the rough quantitative estimation of
yttrium, and after several experiments a spectrum test was devised
sufficiently delicate to detect one-millionth part of yttria in a mineral.
A table is given showing the results of this quantitative spectrum
analysis, from which it is seen that amongst other substances a specimen
of coral contains one part of yttrium in 200 parts ; strontianite, one
part of yttrium in 500 parts ; chondrodite, from Mount Somma, one
part in 4,000 ; calcite, one part in 10,000 ; ox bone, one part in

     Owing    to the indirectness of the methods hitherto used for
 estimating the quantity of blood pumped out from the left ventricle
 at each systole, this important factor in all calculations of the work
 done by the heart has never been satisfactorily determined.       Of the
  later physiologists who have investigated the subject, Volkmann and
  afterwards Vierordt, from calculations based upon the mean velocity
 of the stream of blood in the unbranched aorta, obtained the fraction
  4^ as representing the ratio of the average weight of blood ejected
 at each systole of the left ventricle to the weight of the whole body.
 Tick, from data obtained by placing the arm in a plethy sinograph, and
 estimating the velocity of the stream of blood in the axillary artery
  from the increase in volume of the whole arm at each systole of the
  heart, arrived at a much smaller fraction, about 1()'ao, for the ratio
  between the weight of blood thrown out at each systole and the body-
  weight.

272                   W. H. Howell and F. Donaldson.                 [May   31.
     At the suggestion of Professor Martin, and under his directions,        we
undertook some experiments upon this subject, making use of                  his
method of isolating the heart. The quantity of blood ejected from            the
left ventricle at each systole under varying conditions of venous pres
sure, arterial pressure, and pulse-rate, can be determined directly with
this method by catching the blood as it is pumped out from the tube
connected with the aorta of the dog.          In all the observations made the
blood was collected during a period of 30 seconds, and the quantity thus
obtained divided by the number. of heart beats occurring during that
 time, as shown on the kymograph, in order-to determine the quantity
 pumped out at each systole.         The results of our work fall under four
 different heads.
 I.   The 4Maximum      Quantity of Blood which can he thrown out from (k
                         Left Ventricle at a single Systole.
     The method of working in determining this quantity was- to increase
 the amount      of blood flowing into the right side of the heart, by
 raising the-supply flask connected with the superior vena cava, until
  a limit was reached in the amount of blood pumped out froBi the left
  ventricle, i.e., .a point beyond which increase of the press ar-- and the
  quantity of . the blood flowing into the right side of the heart canssi
  no increase in the quantity of the blood sent out from the left
  ventricle.
      The main result of those experiments may be stated at follows:
  With a mean pulse-rate of 180 per minute in the dog, the mean ratio
  of the maximum weight of blood pumped out from the left ventricle
  at each systole to the body- weight is ^^-g-, or 400117.      The maximum
  outflow from the left heart was obtained in all cases at or below a
  venous pressure on the right side of 60 ceutims. of dffibrinated calf*
  blood (46 millims. of mercury).
      With regard- to the maximum outflow from the left ventricle at the
   normal pulse-raie (120 per minute) of a dog, we have only one
   experiment to offer.      According to that experiment the ratio of the
   maximum weight of blood pumped out f com the left ventricle at each
   systole to the body-weight, with a pulse-rate of 120 per minute, is
   about Y^g, or -00M.
      In applying these results to the normal dog,O.we believe that the
   average quantity. .of blood pumped out from the left ventricle a'
   each systole in the living dog is approximated most nearly in our
   experiments by the maximum outflow ; in other - words, we think it
   probable that the left ventricle during life is distended at each
   diastole to about its maximum capacity.         In coming to this conclusion
   we were influenced chiefly by three considerations.            1. The saaw
   opinion has been expressed by Royar, the result of his work on the
    frog's heart. 2. Calculations of the time required for a compWe

circulation of the blood to take place in a normal dog, based upon the
maximnm quantity of blood sent out from the left heart at each
systole, as determined by our experiments, give results which agree
with what we would expect from the time found necessary by
Vierordt                          for the jugular-femoral path.
                  from direct experiment                          3. It
is probable  that in onr experiments the left heart, at the time the
maximum outflow was obtained from                         it,
                                           worked under conditions of
pressure closely resembling those to which          subject during life.
                                                                it   is
The pressure in the left auricle, with the highest venous pressure
(46 millims. of mercury) used on the right side, had a maximum
value of 20 millims. of mercury, a mean value of 16 millims., which
is probably about what occurs during life, since Goltz and Gaule
found that the maximum pressure in the right auricle of the dog                                  is
about 19'6 millims. of mercury.
   Owing to the difference in pulse-rate between the dog and man, no
inference can be made with any certainty from the results obtained
with the dog to the case of man.
II.    Influence     of   Variation    of   Arterial Pressure        on the   Work   done   by   the
                                               Heart.
     Arterial pressure was varied by raising or lowering the end of the
outflow tube leading from the aorta.    As the result of the experi
ments we can state that variation of arterial pressure from 58 to 147
millims. of mercury, have practically no direct effect whatever upon
the quantity of blood sent out from the left ventricle at each systole.
  Since the pulse-rate       not altered, the work done by the left
                                      is
ventricle, therefore, varies directly as the arterial pressure against
which     works, within the limits named. For how much wider limits
             it
than  those given this may hold true we have not yet determined.
Since there    every reason to believe that under normal conditions
                    is
the force         of the systole
                              more than sufficient to completely empty
                                      is
the  ventricular cavity, and  we have found that with arterial pressures
from 58 to 147 millims. the quantity of blood pumped out from the
left ventricle at each systole remains constant,    seems probable that
                                                                      it
within these limits at least the force of the ventricular contraction                             is
not influenced by variation in arterial pressure, but remains maximal
throughout.
      III.   Influence     of   Variation    of   Venous Pressure on the Work done               by
                                              the Heart.

from 10 centims. to 60 or 70 centims., and the outflow from the aorta
 measured   for each venous pressure used.    The records of these

the experiments,       it   was found that the outflow from the left           ventricle,
and consequently          the work
                              done by                 it,
                                           increases with the venous
pressure, but not proportionally, up to the point of maximum work.
It certain that the most direct factor influencing the quantity
  is                                                                                        of
blood sent out from the ventricle     the intra-ventricular pressure
                                               is                                           by
which    it   is   distended
                        during diastole.    Leaving out the aspirating
action of the  thorax, the intra-ventricular pressure during life must
be mainly owing to the action of the auricles, since the pressure in the
great vein emptying into the auricles probably never rises . to any
important positive value, indeed, according to the experiments                              of
most observers, has    mean negative value.
                            a                    The contraction of the
auricles then must have the most important and direct effect upon the
w ork done by the ventricles.
       IV.    Influence   of   Bale   of   Beat on the Work done     ly   the Heart.
   The rate of beat of the heart was varied in these experiments                            by
heating or cooling the blood supplied to it. In this way the pulse-
rate was changed in one case from 228 to 77 beats in a minute, and
back again to 140 in a minute, in another case from 204 to 6545, and
back again to 157, and so on.     The general result may be stated as
follows  —
         :  A diminution of pulse-rate, brought about by lowering the
temperature of the blood flowing into the heart, causes an increase
in the quantity of blood thrown out from the ventricle at each systole,
and consequently an increase in the work done at each systole, and
vice versa.    The changes in the outflow from the ventricle at each
systole are  not, however, inversely proportional to the changes    the             in
pulse-rate.    The total outflow and the total work done during any
given period of time decreases with         diminished pulse-rate, and
                                                      a
increases with an increased pulse- rate.

       the Theory of Descent."          By W. B. Carpenter, C.B., M.D„
       F.R.S. Received May 31, 1883.
                                    (Abstract.)
    This paper is supplemental to the series of Memoirs formerly pre
 sented by the author on the structure of certain of the higher forms
 of the group of Foraminifera ; in which he laid down the new prin
 ciples of classification afterwards worked out by him, in conjunction
 with Messrs. W. K. Parker and T. Rupert Jones, in his " Introduction
to the Study of the Foraminifera;" and especially to the first of those
memoirs (" Phil. Trans.," 1856), which consisted of a Monograph of
 the genus Orbitolites, and of some general doctrines deduced from the
study of it as to the Range of Variation in Species, a question which
was much occupying the attention of philosophical naturalists. The
                                                  "                       "
subsequent publication of Mr. Darwin's               Origin of Species       having
led him unhesitatingly to adopt            the                of  " Descent
                                                 principle                     with
                "     "
Modification      or Genetic Continuity," he had applied it to the con
struction of    a pedigree    of the Orbitoline     type  ; between the smallest
and simplest, and the largest and most complex                 of which,    he  had
                                               " continuity   " could
shown in his first memoir that such                                     be clearly
traced out.
    Starting with the very simplest type of Foraminiferal organisation
— a minute globular or pyriform monothalamous shell, with a single
orifice, enclosing a particle of sarcode — he showed (1) that the exten
sion of such a particle into a spirally-coiled sarcodic cord, invested by
a porccllanous     shell, becomes a Gornuspira ; (2) that a constriction of
this cord at the points at which additions are made to the length of

  1883.]               Researches on the  Foraminifera.                211
 the shell, with a partial interruption of the tube at these points, gives
 us   Spiroloculina, the ancestral form of the whole Milioline series ;
 (3) that the flattening-ont of this tube (as in the more advanced
growth of Cornuspira), and the formation of a complete septum across
 its mouth, traversed by separate pores for the issue of sarcodic fila
ments, convert     it into a Peneroplis, whose sarcodic  body consists of a
succession of segments, occupying the successive chambers of the
shell, which are divided by septal partitions, but are connected by
" stolon               " that traverse them
           processes                          ; (4) that the subdivision of
these   chambers by transverse partitions into " chamberlets," and of
the segments of the body into " sub-segments," the shell still growing
along a spiral axis, gives us Orhieulina ; the chamberlets of each
chamber retaining a communication with each other by a continuous
gallery, which is occupied in the living state by a band of sarcode that
connects together all the sub-segments formed by the division of any
one segment ; and (5) that the opening-out of the Orbieuline spire,
and the progressive extension of the alce of its successively-formed
chambers round its umbilicus, at last brings these alce together, so
that they unite into a continuous ring ; and by the addition of new
rings to the periphery of the preceding, a circular disk is formed — the
plan of growth thus changing from the spiral to the cyclical, which is
the distinguishing character of Orbitolites.
    The materials at that time possessed by the author only enabled him
to trace back this pedigree with any certainty from the typical Orbito-
Hles, which exhibits no trace whatever of spiral growth, to the spiral
Orbiculina ; but he expressed his belief that the " nuclear mass " in
which every Orbitolites originates — consisting af a pyriform " primor
dial segment," surrounded by a single turn of the
                                                           " circumambient
segment," is essentially an abbreviated Milioline ; and he was thus led
to rank Orbitolites as the most specialized type of the family Miliolida.
    It was, therefore, with singular satisfaction that he found in a new
form of Orbitoline disk, brought up from a depth of 1,500 fathoms in
the " Porcupine
                    "
                      expedition of 1869, the complete realisation of his
hypothetical pedigree: the formation of this disk commencing in a
minute primordial chamber, which first extends itself into a closely
coiled spiral tube like that of a Cornuspira, then shows an incipient
septation in the later coils of this tube, which constitutes it a Spiro
loculina ; then flattens-out and becomes camerated as a Peneroplis ; then
undergoes the subdivision of its chambers which converts it into an
 Orbiculina ; and, finally, by the fusion of the lateral extensions of the
chambers into complete annuli, assumes the cyclical plan of growth
 characteristic of Orbitolites.    To this beautiful species, whose disk
 attains a diameter of T85 of an inch, whilst its thickness does not
 exceed        of an inch, the name Orbitolites tenuissima may be appro
  priately given.

278                  Researches on the Foraminifera.             [June   14,
    The passage of each individual of this species through a series of
forms which, in the classification of M. D'Orbigny, belong to four
different Orders, sufficiently proves that, among Foraminifera, plan of
growth is a character of secondary value ; whilst the retention, in the
perfected disk, of the entire series of those ancestral forms, through
 which the very simplest of Foraminiferal organisms has become
evolved into one of the most complex, invests this abyssal type of
 Orbitolites with a peculiar interest and value.
    Having been for some time engaged in the study of th- large
collection of Orbitolites (chiefly made on the Fiji reef) brought home
by the
          " Challenger," with a view to the preparation
                                                            (at the request
of the late Sir C. Wy ville Thomson) of a complete tteport upon this
generic type, the author has delayed the publication of this r-mark
able confirmation of his previously-expressed views, until he should
have concluded his investigation of the large mass of new material
which has 4thus come into his possession ; having early seen rea-on to
believe that his recent study would prove of some value in its general
relation to the Theory of Descent.      And he now offers the res<ulta of
it as a contribution to that great inquiry, in the conviction that (as
was admirably said thirty-five years ago by Sir James Paget)
                                                                       " the
highest laws of our science are expressed in the simplest terms, in the
lives of the lowest orders of creation."
   The aggregate of the phenomena presented by the evolutionary
history of this type (and equally, the author fully believes, by that of
every other of the more complex types of Foraminifera) may be thus
summed up : —
   1. That there has been a progressive     specialization in the structure
of the shelly envelope, which, in the highest type of Orbitolites (the
lnrge 0. complanata of the Calcaire Grrossier and of the Fiji reefs)
attains a very extraordinary complexity.
   2. That this specialization has followed a very definite and well-
marked line.
   3. That this progressive complication in the structure of the disk
is attained without any corrasponding specialization in the structure
of the animal, whose sarcodic body retains throughout (as far as the
most careful examination can enable us to determine) its primitive
homogeneou sness .
   4. That all the ancestral forms through which the highest type has
passed, are still living and flourishing under exactly the same condi
tions (so far as can be ascertained) as itself.
   The full discussion which the doctrine of the
                                                       " Origin of

having clearly established that what has been called the Law of
 Natural Selection is simply a generalised expression of the fact, that

 which are best adapted to their environments.             The causes of such
 variation, not being in any way accounted for by " natural selection,"
 must be looked-for either in the influence of the " environment " on
 the organism,     or on some tendency to vary inherent in the organism
itself  ;  and the question which now most occupies the minds of thought
ful Evolutionists, is whether the variations that have conduced to the
establishment      of the higher types are " aimless," or whether they have
followed a definite " plan."
   From a careful consideration of all the circumstances of this case,
the author comes to the conclusion not only that such a " plan " can
be clearly traced out in the present case, but that " natural selection "
can have had scarcely any share in determining the progressive evolu
tion and relative distribution of the several forms of the Orbiloline
type.

                                     (Abstract.)
   The paper begins by quoting the two usually accepted descriptions
of the peritoneum as far as the relations of the omentum and trans
verse     colon are concerned.       The old account, that which makes the
transverse colon to be between the two ascending layers of the great
omentum, is first given. Afterwards the new account is repeated ;
this says that the colon is not between the layers of the great
omentum, but only adherent to them.              The development of the colon
is next mentioned, and Haller's theory, that the colon and omentum
become adherent, is discussed.           Reasons are given to show that the
old account of the 'peritoneum is the true one, and that, therefore,
Haller's theory is unacceptable.          After speaking of the development
of the omentum and its relation to the transverse colon, the changes
which the author believes to occur are described.          Instead of adhesion
taking place between the omentum and colon, it is shown that the
peritoneal fossa, which at early periods exists between them,
 gradually disappears, owing to an unfolding or drawing out of the
 peritoneum at that point.          It is further shown that when this has
 taken place the transverse colon comes to be between the two ascend
 ing layers of the great omentum.

        B.Sc. Assistant to the Linacre Professor, Oxford. Com
        municated by Professor Moseley, F.R.S. Received May 23,
        1883.
                                     (Abstract.)
    1.  In Alcyonium      there is a groove    lined by remarkably long cilia,
situated on the ventral side of the stomodaenm. This groove, which
lias already been superficially referred to by O. and R. Hertwig, has
important morphological relations in the group Alcyonaria which ha?e
not been previously referred to.            I   propose to call it the sipho
noglyphe.
    2.  The cilia of the siphonoglyphe, as seen in a living Alcyoninm,
moving in unison, produce a current from without inwards which
 brings particles of food and fresh streams of water into the canal
 system of the colony.         The cilia lining the rest of the stomodseum
 prodnce currents in an opposite direction, from within outwards.
     3. A siphonoglyphe, varying in size and in the length of the cilia,
 is present in the same position in all the non-dimorphic Alcyona
 rians (without solid calcareous or horny axes)           I have examined, e.g. ,
 Coalogorgia, Briareus, Nephthya, Spongodes, Tubipora, Clavularia,
 Heliopora, &c.
     4. Amongst the dimorphic Alcyonarians               the siphonoglyphe is
  usually absent     in  the autozooids, but   well developed in the siphonc-
  zooids.    In Sarcophyton, however, a feebly-developed siphonoglyphe
  is present in the autozooids in addition to the well-developed ones
  in the siphonozooids.
     5. In Primnoa and Villogorgia,           the only examples of Alcyona
  rians with solid axes I have examined, no siphonoglyphe can be
  found, and     I   am inclined to think, from the researches of other
   observers, and from general considerations, that it is not present in
   any genera in which the fleshy parts of the colony are represented
   only by a thin crust covering solid axes.
      6. The paper contains some speculations to which          I have been led,
   by these researches, concerning the probable phylogeny of the gronp,
   and a diagrammatic arrangement of the Alcyonaria on these lines.
      7. Finally   I  propose to divide the Alcyonaria into five principal
   groups  :  1st.   The    Proto-Alcyonaria, including only those genera
   which do not form colonies.           2nd. The Stolonifera, including the
   genera    Clavnlaria,    Cornularia,  Tubipora, &c, in which the votmg
   colonies spring from a creeping stolon.         3rd. The Pennatulidae, which
   remains   as heretofore.     4th.  The  Gorgonidae, a group which contains
   only those genera in which there are solid horny or calcareous axes,

and no siphonoglyphe.                 5th. The Alcyonidre, a large and somewhat
heterogeneous group containing all the remaining genera of the
Alcyonaria, which, though exhibiting many wide variations, inter se,
agree in possessing no            specially marked characters of deviation from
an   ideal central form from which, 1 suppose, they must have sprung.

    In a former paper (" Proc. Ttoy. Soc.," vol. 33, p. 462) we laid
before the Society the results of a series of experiments by which we
bad endeavoured to ascertain accurately the differences in the dura
tion of the latent period of contraction of skeletal muscle (frog's
gastrocnemius)        which could be brought about by varying the follow
ing   influences    : —
    1. The weight of load.
    2. The mode of applying weight (supported or unsupported).
    3. The strength of stimulation.
    4. Temperature.
    5. Fatigue.                                                                          •
    We have since been engaged in determining the relative duration
 of the latent periods of different skeletal muscles of vertebrate
animals.       Besides several muscles of the Bana temp., we have
 examined some from the toad, tortoise, small mammals, and birds.
 In this paper, which is intended to be a continuation of the one
 above referred to, we beg leave to lay before the Society the results
 of these experiments and our general conclusions.
     We know from the works of Fick,* Marey.t Ranvier,J Fredericq,§
 Richefc, || and one of us,^[ that various muscles in the same animal
 have a mode of contraction differing more or less from one another,
  and adapted to the kind of work they have to perform.                         But in the
  works of most of these authors little information can be found
  concerning the variations in the duration of the latent period, in dif
  ferently contracting muscles, whether those of the same animal or
  those of different     animals.

   As our desire was to obtain information of the latency actually
occurring in the mnscle, we adopted the same plan in this ser-s as
in our former experiments of stimulating the muscle directly. The
whole length of the muscle was introduced into the secondary circuit.
and a contraction registered, resulting from     maximal opening shod

The- arrangement of the apparatus was similar to that employed                     in
our former series of experiments.
   We shall tabulate the mean results of a series of measurements                  of
curves obtained from a number of observations upon the animals
above mentioned,     and we believe they will prove, that while the
latencies for different muscles of the same animal bear amongst
themselves certain proportion to the length of their succeedinj
curves, we can by no means reason from one group of animals                        to
another what this relationship may be.
   Though the duration of the latency of each individual muscle var-s
within certain limits in different frogs, we think we can vouch for the
correctness of the inter-relationship of the results furnished       the      by
various muscles employed in arriving at the averages given. Our
measurements confirm with considerable exactitude those obtained                   by
one of us from experiments made with the muscles of Rana e*en-
lenta* in which another method was employed.          We have naturally
regarded those results as most satisfactory, in which, by working
rapidly, we succeeded in obtaining representative curves of the whole
series of muscles furnished by one animal.

    It  is worthy of note that the more pronounced differences of latency
 between toad and frog lie in the muscles of the extremities ; the
 trunk muscles yield more nearly equal values.                 An appeal to function
 shows that the circumstance           is highly probable.           The frog which
 depends upon speed       of   movement        for   procuring   its  food, for safety
 14rom enemies, and preservation from death in times of drought, has
  different motor requirements       from the toad, which depends for safety

surrounding objects, whilst it rather waits for its food to come to                    it,
than attempts to pursue it. But the requirements of the trunk
muscles are much more similar in the two animals, and thus we find
the hyoglossus for procuring food, and the rec. abdominis for
spawning, respiration and flexion of the body, yielding very similar
values.

estimation  of its latency, a second recording surface had to                           be
employed.   The apparatus was therefore so arranged that the tendon
of the muscle drew upon the membrane of      Marey's tambour, which
                                                         a
acted as a weight beneath the lever which recorded on the plate                         of
the pendulum.    By means of a second inverted tambour armed with                       a
light lever, the transmitted movement was written on a rotating
cylinder. The commencement of the curve including the time                              of
latency, was drawn on the rapidly moving plate of the pendulum, and
simultaneously a graphic record of the shape and duration of the

the most    rapid movement of which the animal is capable. The semi
membranosus passes over three joints, and a considerable extent of
contraction is necessary in order to enable it to flex the foot on the
knee, and the thigh on the pelvis.        Both of these muscles arrive
speedily at a maximum of contraction, "18" and "24", and coincidently
with this rapid action we have the relatively short latency quoted.
There is a considerable difficulty in estimating the length of curve of
the tortoise muscle, owing to its gradual retnrn to the base line.
Usually a notch in the descending part of the curve shows the
distinction between the active curve and the after shortening which is
so marked a feature in the action of the muscles of this animal ; but
occasionally the one passes into the other by insensible gradations.
We have, however, endeavoured by varying the burden to produce
some indication of this notch when none at first existed, and we have
confined ourselves to the results which we believe to be correct.
                          Warmblooded Animals.
    The muscles    of warm-blooded animals were examined in situ, the
circulation being as little as possible interfered with, and the animal
 kept well under the influence       of anaesthetics. A modification of
Ranvier's rabbit-holder was utilized in order to support the animal in
 the necessary relationship to the recording lever.    The head-holder at
 one end of a small board, consisted of a loop of metal covered with
 cord, which received the suout or beak and anterior part of the head,
 whilst a piece of string run through two openings in the loop, and
 behind the occiput kept the head in position, and facilitated the
 administration    of ether. The board which served to support the
 animal was perforated with numerous holes, through which strings
 attached to the animal passed.     The under surface of the board was
 fitted with a ball and socket joint, which could be clamped firmly to
 the sliding table on which the lever rested.      By a screw which fixed
 the cup around the ball, this joint could be tightened when the board
  was adjusted    to any given position, and thus the muscle to be
  examined could be brought into direct line of traction with the lever
  without altering the attachment of the animal or otherwise disturbing
  the apparatus.   The axis of the lever was provided with a short arm
  projecting on the side opposite to the lever, to which a thread passing
  from the muscle was attached.      The arm was drawn downwards by
  the contracting muscle, and the lever therefore upwards, so that a
  curve in every way comparable to those obtained by direct traction was
   drawn.

     We will not recapitulate the results given in the tables further
 than by drawing attention to the extremes of the values obtained.
 In the December frog we found the triceps directly stimulated had the
 shortest latency ("0114"), whilst the hyoglossus had the longest '015".
 The muscles of the trunk hyoglossus and rectus abdominis (compound
 but parallel fibred muscle) exhibited longer latencies than did the
 muscles of the extremities ; the muscles of the arm again longer than
 those of the leg.
     In forming our conclusions concerning the duration of the latent
  period of contraction of skeletal muscles, and the variations it is
  subject to, we must refer repeatedly to our former paper, of which
  this, as has been said, may be regarded as the continuation.
      The latencies of gastrocnemii of Bana temp., examined between
  January and Aprilj and selected at random, varied between wide
 limits, namely from -008" — "0208". These values include also measure
  ments taken from curarised gastrocnemii,                   but as we have already
  pointed    out,    the small dose of curare employed appeared in no way to
  cause any divergence in reaction of the muscle from the normal. In
   this respect our results confirm the view expressed by Pfliiger. In

 1883.J         Variations    of Latency in certain Skeletal Muscles.        287
support of this we may mention that the shortest latency referred to
occurred in a curarised, the longest in a non-curarised muscle.                In
the case of the toad, variations due solely to the individual were con
siderable, but the divergencies          were not so great as in the case of the
frog.       Thus   in six  gastrocnemii taken from different individuals the
range was from 40125" to -017", in the triceps (six muscles) from
4012" to -015", and in the hyoglossus 4015" to -024".                We seldom
found any material difference in the latencies of corresponding muscles
in the same animal.           The toads examined in December and January
yielded latencies averaging "0121" (triceps) and "0191" (hyoglossus
and rectus abdom.), whilst the March animals gave 40128" (triceps)
as the shortest, and 4015" (hyoglossus              and biceps) as the longest
latencies.        The subjects of the latter experiments were unspawned
animals, and the reaction of the trunk muscles was marked by an
 accession of irritability.
     In the tortoise, the long parallel fibred muscles, omohyoid and
 semibranosus, yielded the shortest latencies, viz., •Q225" and "0247"
 respectively, whilst the wide bellied biceps and the broad but short
 extensor communis digitorum gave distinctly longer periods ("028"
 and -033").        The gastrocnemius of a kitten, aged two months, showed
 a latency of -018", and that of a white tame rat -011".
      In the pigeon the pectoralis major has a slightly shorter latency
  ( 01") than the gastrocnemius,        but in the blackbird the biceps (a muscle
  intimately connected, as is the pectoralis, with flying movements)
  appears to have a latency longer by -0015" than the gastrocnemius             of
  the same bird.         It is worthy of remark, however, that the blackbird
  had been reared and kept in confinement, and therefore it is probable
  that the muscles connected            with flight were to a certain extent
   uneducated      and undeveloped.
      To sum up the variations in latency obtained between the frog
   muscle, which, free from exceptional influences, yielded the shortest
   (4008"), and the tortoise muscle,      which yielded the longest (4033"), we
   have   but a range through "025", a variation small enough to be in itself
   surprising, but still more so when we consider the relative durations of
   the   contractions to which these latencies are initial. We may certainly
   infer from these       results that, though the intralatent processes in the
   various muscles        of a given animal have a certain inter-relationship
   with the      resulting contractions, and that each muscle variety gives
    divergencies from its normal latency and contraction only within
    certain limits, that we can establish no argumenfof probabilities from
    an animal of one
                         species to an animal of another species as regards the
    latency preceding contraction.        The same holds true of warm-blooded
        'well as of cold-blooded,  of Carnivora as of Rodentia.
       The literature published during the last twenty years relating to the
     duration of the latent period, bears witness to the very different lines

varying results which they have obtained.            It seemed to as, therefore,
that time devoted to a systematic examination with one exact method
of the many aspects of the subject would be advantageously employed,
and would furnish results relatively correct, and of a value which
would be greater than could be obtained by grouping the conclusions
of numerous authors, whose methods and objects of research differed
and who had no unanimous starting point for their investigations.

whilst Mendelssohn, § who has admirably grouped the results obtained
by these and other authors, found that in frogs taken at random of
various sizes and in different seasons, the latency varied within the
wide limits of -004" — 012". Navalacbin||, who has ably investigated
the production of heat during the active contraction of striated
muscle, has pointed out that the latency of the frog's gastrocnemius is
shorter in the spring than in the summer months.                Here we have to
do with another element rather than with temperature —namely,
with the spawning of the animal, the most disturbing internal
influence to which a frog is liable.               The latencies before and
after spawning are various, the irritability of the muscles being
different.      This is in its effect almost convertible with the experience
of Helmholz, Engelmann, Lantenbach, and others,^ who have pointed
out that increase in strength of stimulation shortens the latency. In
the spring-time the irritability of the animal is increased, and maxi
mal stimulation, which in the summer frog would produce a certain
definite effect, is here hyper-maximal (so to speak) and the latency is
correspondingly shortened.            To the . same reason, i.e., an increase in
irritability,    Mendelssohn      looks  for the explanation of the shortened
latency of the muscle, whose nerve has just been divided.                We mnst,
however, confess that we are unable to confirm his results, i.e., that the
latency in the case of the muscle of which the nerve has just been
divided, may be temporarily shortened by half, in the case of the
Bana temp.         The latency given by Gad ("004") associated with a
lengthening      of  the muscle as precursor to its general contraction, we
cannot attempt to criticise, as we have very rarely ourselves seen the
form of curve he represents as being normal, but which he only

obtained where the muscle is transfixed by the lever.        An intra-latent
lengthening of the entire muscle does occasionally occnr, but in our
experiments it had no constant relationship whatever to the time of
stimulation,and we therefore regarded it as a chance extension.    "We
have not, however, been able to find time to repeat the experiments —
using his methods — from which Gad deduces his results.
   The brief latency that Place and Klunder obtained from stimulation
of the  already shortening muscle, we have rarely seen. When it does
occur, its accurate estimation becomes extremely difficult, as it is
necessary to separate the moment when active contraction commences
from the passive shortening which preceded         it,
                                                    and one phase often
passes into the other by almost insensible gradations.     Fallacies of so
extensive a nature arise from the use of a slowly moving recording
surface, and of a short lever, that we have in all cases employed a
rapid swing of the pendulum myograph, and a lever multiplying the
contraction by six or seven times, for the production of the curves from
which our data of latencies are taken.          In the fatigued muscle,
for instance, commencing contraction      isvery gradual so gradual in
                                                            ;
fact that its earlier phases may, with a short lever, be readily mistaken
for prolongation of the latency.
     a                                We need not point out that with a
comparatively slowly moving cylinder slight inaccuracies in measure
 ment — at all times subject to occur— are multiplied proportionally as
the speed becomes slower.
  A     cursory examination of the tables in our first communication
shows that of the causes therein examined, the most potent in affect
ing the latency are variations in temperature             and fatigue   ;   of
secondary importance are the strength of stimulation and the mode
of suspension of the extending weight.
    Temperature.— In the gastrocnemius of an

                                                                    (indirect
stimulation)    we  saw for  an excursion  through 20° C.  (viz., from   5° to
25°) a variation of .014" in the length of the latency      ; in the muscle
tjf another animal heated from the normal room temperature
                                                                        (17°)
through 14° C.,   a   variation of -01" was obtained.     Taking the room
temperature as the starting point, we find in these experiments that
lowering the temperature through 5° increased the latency "004",
 "0033", and -0027" respectively.         Heating through 5° above the
normal yielded a shortening of .0016" — -0012", but though these
 figures represent a usual result, occasionally there      is a much more
 extensive variation.      Thus, in one case with an unusually long
 latency (.017") at the room temperature, heating through 5° reduced
 the latency '01''.    After this point in the heating process had been
 reached, the course of the latency under higher temperatures              was
 strictly comparable with that of other muscles with a more ordinary
  initial latency, and we should regard this circumstance as furnishing
 a   proof that this abnormally long latency was in reality owing to

some unstable   cause    not usually operative.     We have seen snch
muscles allowed again to cool to the room temperature fail to give
again the long initial latency at first manifested, whereas, as a rule,
the result obtained from a given "temperature for the same muscle is
constant or nearly so, should heating and cooling not have been carried
to a deleterious extent.    We cannot regard a muscle, showing a long-
latency and a long curve, as being in both respects in series with a
more quickly contracting muscle, cooled down through a certain
range of temperature.      One of the most important features in the
divergence, is in the change of elasticity in the case of the cold
muscle, but beyond this we have variations of kind between muscles
which must help to account for the intimate relationship between the
latency and curve in any given mnscle.
   Fatigue. — M. Ranvier has recorded the remarkable fact that the
latency of the thoroughly fatigued red muscle of the rabbit, may
bear the proportion to that of the fresh muscle of nearly five to one.
He says, if the strength of the stimulation is increased, the latency
shortens again, as contractibility is redeveloped.     Since the fatigued
muscle is equally elastic, bnt less irritable than the fresh muscle, a
stimulation which at first produces a maximal result, soon becomes
sub-maximal, then minimal, and finally ceases to be effective ; so that
constant increase of stimulation is required to elicit an equal (in the
sense of a maximal) effect.     Mendelssohn has described an increase of
latency from "008" to -03" in the gastrocnemius of the frog as the
result of fatigue. These extensive variations are quite possible, but it
not infrequently happens that the length of the latency is rather
 apparent than actual as a result of fatigue. A careful examination
 of the curve of a fatigued muscle will often enable us to determine
 a very gradual but definite departure of the lever attached to the
 mnscle from the abscissa, in what, at first sight, seemed to be the
 actual latency. This would be concealed by a thick abscissa, or lost
 by the use of a too slightly amplifying lever.
    In our former paper we gave tables showing that 1,300 induction
 shocks (producing maximal single contractions), increased the latency
 -00526", and that two minutes' tetanus had the effect of lengthening
 this period -0066".    We also pointed out that it is in the extreme of
 fatigue that the rapidjncrease in the latency occurs.      Exercise short
 of  distinct fatigue was  seen   even  to shorten the  latency to a slight
 extent.    This may have been in part due to the increase of extensi
 bility which   Volkmann has shown occurs in earlier stages of fatigue
 of the muscle.     In the later stages of fatigue, however, the extensi
 bility decreases  as  the elasticity of the shortened mnscle increases,
 and here we have a corresponding increase in the latency.

been discussed in           our previous paper, and need not occupy us here ;
from a physiological point of consideration these are in the economy
of the living animal liable to smaller variations, and therefore of lees
interest than the effect of change of temperature and fatigue.
     Physiologically considered, the weight raised when the muscle is in
service will be constant for the individual, when the stimulations are
equal.         The researches of Navalachin have shown that most work is
done and less fatigue produced                when stimulation sub-maximal in
character is applied to the frog's muscle, and no doubt the muscle in
service during life, is usually excited by sub-maximal stimulation (in
an electrical sense).           It is important to bear in mind that a constant
weight       used     in a series   of experiments bears a different relationship
to the muscle of a frog weighing x grms. or x + or x — grms.,
inasmuch as it affects variously the elasticity of the stronger or
 weaker muscle. In highly extensible parallel-fibred muscles with a
 small limit of elasticity, such as the hyoglossus, the divergencies
 obtained by incommensurate weightings are very considerable.
     Our experiments tend, we think, to support the idea which has
 been expressed by many physiologists, that the relationship between
 length of latency and the conditions of elasticity and extensibility of
 the muscle is a close one.
                                          Conclusions.
     1. The limits within which the normal latency varies (intentionally
  introduced extrinsic influences apart) appear to be as follows : —
      a.   In gastrocnemii of various frogs at different seasons —
                                  liana temp. -008"— -0208."

      (The complete          exclusion of certain influences, nutritive, thermal,
   &c., is impossible.)
       2.   Conclusions     as to the length of the latent period based on the
   duration       of the contraction are liable to error ; especially is this the
   case when we attempt to reason for one class of animals from the
   relationship found in another.
       3. The duration of the latency increases and decreases in direct
   but unequal proportion to the amount of weight which the muscle
   lias to    lift.
        4.  Increase in strength of stimulation is accompanied by a shorten
    ing of the       latent period.      The variation seems to depend on the
    absolute strength        of the stimulus employed, viz. : (a) Increase from
     minimal to      stimulation giving rise to maximal contraction is accom

panied   by a steady and marked decrease in the duration of the
latency- (i) When once maximal contractions are arrived at, con
siderable increase in strength of stimulation does not alter the length
of the latency-     (c) After a certain point haa been reached, further
increase in strength of stimulus (hyper-maximal) causes elongation of
the latent period associated with signs of injury to the tissue.
   5. Fatigue must attain a considerable degree before it materially
affects the length of the latency.         When it once begins to produce
an effect it rapidly lengthens the latent period of muscles removed
from the animal or in which circulation has ceased.
   6. Changes in temperature,         even minimal in amount,     cause a
marked alteration in the latency.
   Lowering of temperature is accompanied by a steady elongation,
and elevation by a rapid shortening of the latent period.       When the
heat becomes intense (for frog over circa 36° C.) the length of the
latency seems again to increase, as the muscle passes into heat rigor.
   7. In observing the above variations in the duration of the latency,
we have failed to find the wide extremes given by some authors as the
limits of this phase of the contraction of striated muscle

on the dark discharge, and the special conditions of the negative dis
charge ; this paper contains a number of experiments, more especially
on the latter subject, and also others intended to throw light on the
general nature of the electric discharge through gases.

resistance to the electric discharge.  This was found to be the case,
for example, with a residual air charge in a spheroidal vessel 7 inches
(17*8 centims.) long, and 5 inches (12-7 centims.) diameter (fig. l),the
pressure of minimum resistance was as high as 3 millims., 3947 M ;
while in a tube 22'5 inches (57 centims.) long, and T625 inches (4'1

diameter (fig. 3), it was 1 millim., 1316 M-      It is evident, therefore,
that not only the dimensions of the tube, but possibly also the shape
of the terminals, have an influence on the pressure of least resistance,
and it is very probable that in the atmosphere, where lateral expan
sion is practically unlimited, the conditions of minimum resistance are
different from those which exist even in very large tubes, and that
this may influence the height of the aurora.
   The paper next deals with the discharge in miniature tubes § inch
(2-2 centims.) long, and      J inch (0-63 centim.) diameter, with ter
minals nearly touching (fig. 4) ; at first it required 2,400 cells to pass.
then   a single cell would do so, but after standing a short time it
required 4,800 cells to reproduce a discharge.           In another tube
1^  inches (444 centims.) long-   and § inch (0-95 centim.) diameter, with
the terminals distant 0 00104 inch (040264 millim.), it required 2,240
cells to produce a discharge, then the potential had to be increas-d to
11,240 cells to do so.     Ultimately even this number failed, but after
the   tube had lain by for some days, 600 cells could pass. It is very
possible that the strong discharge in the first instance volatili8ed a
portion of the terminals which were of platinum, and that this
volatilized metal condensed afterwards, or else that the terminals
absorbed the gas so completely as to produce a vacuum too perfect to
admit of a discharge taking place ; and that, ultimately, sufficient of
the occluded gas was again given off to render it again possible.
   In connexion with the occlusion of gas by terminals, a case is
described in which the terminals are of palladium, and the charge
hydrogen (fig. 5). After a few discharges the terminals occluded some
of the gas, and when a fresh one was produced, a volatile compound of
hydrogen and palladium was given off, especially from the negative,
and produced a dense mirror-like coating on the inside of the tube

     The paper next describes experiments to ascertain the length of the
 spark in dry air and in air saturated with moisture. It was found to
 be practically the same in both cases. With 10,860 cells the mean
 length of the spark between two paraboloidal points was found to be
 in dry air 0'45 inch (1*1 centims.), in moist air Q'M.7 inch (l'l
-centims.).
     The next subject taken up is the discharge in a tube from two
  batteries, first in the same, and then in contrary directions.       In the
  tube are two terminals at each end, one pair at opposite ends being
 enclosed in two short pieces of tube, 9 inches (22"8 centims.) long,
  and  \  inch (l-27 centims.) diameter ; the main tube being 31 inches
  (95-2 centims.) long and      If inches (4-4 centims.) diameter (fig. 7).
  The various phases of the stratified discharge are represented in an
 engraved mezzotint steel plate copied from photographs, and show
 the effect of the one stratified discharge on another stratified dis
 charge produced by a second battery. It is seen that two discharges
 in contrary directions may take place in the same tube, and that the
.one modifies the aspect of the other.
     Experiments are also described in a tube in the form of a cross
 with four arms at right angles (fig. 8) ; with two separate batteries
.connected in various ways with the different members.           The experi
 ments were made both in air and in hydrogen. By the introduction
 of external resistance in one of the batteries, the discharge could be
 readily identified as belonging to that battery by the effect of the
 resistance on the character of the stratification.     In one of the mezzo

an external resistance is introduced in one of the discharges, reducing

   The authors remark that one cannot but be impressed, from the
experiments described in the paper, and others in their former papers,
by the apparent plasticity of the aggregate assemblage of molecules
constituting a stratum which yields to external influences that
modify its form.
   The authors describe and figure a case of complex strata in the form
of an outer bracket convex towards the negative (fig. 9), and close to it

dimensions,   37 inches      (94 centims.) long and 5J-| inches (14-8
centims.) diameter.      In these the stratification, which is compara
tively  narrow    at the  terminals, extends in a conical form from the
terminals to the full diameter of the tube.
   They have found that the dark space in the discharge in vacuum
tubes is only relatively actinically dark in comparison with a stratum,
and they succeeded in obtaining a photograph of the dark space in
thirty-five minutes as strong as that from a stratum in two and a -half
seconds ; consequently they conclude that the dark space is 840 times
less actinically bright than a stratum.
    The authors next describe a number of experiments, by means of a
Thomson-Becker electrometer used on a method, to avoid leakage,
proposed to them by Professor Stokes, to ascertain the difference of
potential in different parts of a vacuum tube having a number of
rings sealed within     it, also in other tubes of special construction.
 These bring out instructive information in reference, not only to the
 relative resistances of different lengths of a column of gas at various
 pressures, but also forcibly to the impediment presented by the

   It   is   shown that, at moderate exhausts, the resistance to the                      passage
 of the discharge      uniform along the length of the column
                          is                                            gas,              of

    The authors have next studied the electrical condition of a gas                              in
the immediate vicinity of the negative terminal.        In order to do this
they constructed a tube       inches (11*4 centims.) long and

condition   of the discharge itself within the tube.     It is certainly very
remarkable     that while the potential of the negative ring was abso
lutely zero, a high negative potential should be developed in its near
vicinity.
    The authors remark that everyone familiar with the appearance of a
stratified discharge will have noticed when the negative terminal is a
ring, that as the exhaust proceeds a spindle of light approaches, and
at last protrudes through the interior of it (fig. 11, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5) ;
this spindle they regard as a visible exponent of strong action among
the molecules of gas composing it. In order to probe its electrical con
dition, they prepared a tube with a central idle wire, surrounded by a
minute glass tube, except its extremity, and projecting to a distance
of f inch (0495 centim.) from the plane of the ring, which was made
negative.     Another idle wire was sealed in the tube 015 inch (0"38
centim.), from the periphery of the ring.       As the exhaust proceeded
                                   Fig.  11.
 with a charge of carbonic anhydride, the spindle approached the
 ring, and ultimately protruded through it.        It was found that the
  potential of the central idle wire increased with the exhaust, until
  it nearly or quite equalled that of the whole tube ; while that of
  the external idle wire was only 04054 that of the tube.
     A great number of experiments were made to test the potential

     In the course of an extended examination of all varieties of saline
solutions      by means of the spark and a photographic camera, I have
observed two spectra of mnch interest.              I detach my notes from the
paper in which they are embodied in order to give them an earlier
publication.
     Boron.  — In order to ascertain whether sodinm borate would yield
 any spectrum        beyond that due to sodium, a strong solution of borax
 was    first examined and subsequently a saturated solution of boracic
 acid. The graphite electrode with which the solution was submitted
 to the     action of the spark, was opposed to a pole of a tin-cadmium
 alloy, in order that the wave-lengths of any lines that might appear
 could be determined by reference to those of tin and cadmium.               It is
 a   remarkable fact that when a saturated solution of borax is used, the
 sodium lines        are not visible, while there appear three strong sharp
  lines, which as they are       likewise yielded by boracic acid must    be con
  sidered as    characteristic of boron.

spectrum was obtained consisting of a beautiful group of lines with
three isolated rays.     These lines are attributed to silicon, because they
are rendered equally well by sodium silicate, sodium fluosilicate, and
by hydrofluosilicic acid, the electrodes being either of gold or of carbon.
The strength of the lines       is proportional to the strength of the hydro
fluosilicic acid solution      examined.      The fiducial lines of the tin-
cadmium alloy and some          of the air lines were employed as before in
obtaining measurements         from which the wave-lengths of the silicon
lines were calculated by means of an interpolation curve.            Below are
given the wave-lengths of the silicon lines, together with          their scale
numbers    referring    to  their position on the prism spectrum.           The

for by a difference in strength of the spark employed.                     This

  Professors Liveing and Dewar took the lines which they mapped from
  sparks passed
                   " between poles of purified graphite in air, carbonic
  acid gas, hydrogen, and coal-gas.    The same lines have been observed
  in photographs of the spark between iron, and between aluminium

 showed very distinctly the lines of magnesium and iron."
     From these quotations it will be seen with what great care the
 preparations for these observations on the carbon spectrum were
 made.      If the poles employed had been those of graphite only, 1
 should have had little hesitation in attributing the seven lines to the
                                                                              ^

 Even the purest iron wire contains small traces of silicon, and
aluminium of the usual commercial quality certainly contains a con
siderable quantity. There is, therefore, a suspicion that the carbon
spectrum was contaminated by silicon, for a series of seven consecutive
 lines so nearly coincident with those in the spectrum of another
 element of the same class would be very remarkable.

Society     (Part II, 1882), and in which is considered the vibrations in
the   form of the axis of       a solid core, and the action of two vortices on
one    another.      In the present communication I have confined myself to
the   case of a single hollow vortex in an infinite fluid, and to vibrations
symmetrical        about the straight axis.      The reason why      I  have chosen
to   begin with the hollow vortex is given below.
     The vortex-atom theory, as presented by Sir W. Thomson, has
always seemed to me to labour under two difficulties.                    It does not
explain the gravitation of the atoms, nor does it afford, so far as one
can see, any means of explaining the different densities of the various
elements.        When      the exceedingly    small density of the ether com
pared with what we call ordinary matter is considered, it is clear that
the    supposition that matter is composed of vortices of the same
density as the ether is surrounded with great difficulties, and we are
driven to the conclusion that, if a vortex-ring theory be the true one,
the cores of the vortices must be formed of a denser material than
the surrounding ether, and that probably this core has rotational
motion.       The theory of gravitation propounded by me in the " Pro
ceedings of the Cambridge Philosophical Society
                                                                "* only necessitates
that the circulation or cyclic constants of the vortex-atoms                    shall
exceed a certain amount which depends directly on the mean pressure
 and density of the ether.            It needs, therefore, no additional hypo
 thesis to the theory of Sir W. Thomson, but flows naturally from it.
 This is not the case with the explanation of difference of density here
 offered, as the simplicity of the theory is to some extent lost be
 having two elementary matters in the place of one.
      With these views on the probable constitution of matter I have
 attempted the problem of determining mathematically the properties
 of a hollow vortex in an incompressible             fluid, lined with an interior
 layer    of  a   different  density   from  the  surrounding fluid. "When the
 density is the same as the surrounding fluid, and the interior hollow
  vanishes, we have the vortex-ring of the ordinary theory as a parti
  cular case.       An extreme case in the opposite direction is when there
  is no internal layer and no rotational motion in the fluid at all ;
  merely the cyclic motion about a ring-shaped hollow.                    This is the
  case considered in the present communication.
      If we can argue from the case of two spheres, two vortices making
   forced pulsations of the same period will attract one another with a
   mean force whose principal part depends on the inverse square of the
   distance, when they are in the same phase, and repel one another
    according to the same law when in opposite phases.                     When the
    periods are not the same they will alternately repel and attract, and
    the mean effect, so far as the forces depend on the inverse square, will

 vanish.    If the pulsations of two atoms have natural periods, different
or not, but modified by the action of each other, then there will be a
 residuary effect also inversely as the square of the distance, but
 whether attractive or repulsive remains to be seen.            It is possible that
 gravitation may be due to such a residuary action.                      The force
 depends    on  the  time  of pulsation     and  the  amplitude.      For  a hollow
 vortex without core the time for the same atoms depends on the
square root of the logarithm of the ratio of the radius of the section
to the radius of the aperture, and would therefore vary slowly with
alterations of energy.       This, therefore, is an objection to the theory
that gravitation depends directly on the actual pulsation rather than
on the residuary effect mentioned              above.    The amplitude would
 naturally vary with the energy, and this would make the attraction
between two masses alter with the temperature.                  On this point no
experiments have been made, and the only apparent argument against
         I
it that can think of are Kepler's laws for the motion of the planets.
If ihis theory were true the squares of the periodic times would not
vary simply as the cubes of the mean distances, but also as a quantity
depending on the mean temperature of each planet.                    But this is no
decisive argument against it, as those distances are not themselves
accurately known ; are, in fact, determined by this law from the
earth's distance from the sun, determined by other methods.
   The vortex-atom theory has its most interesting connexions with
the explanation of the spectral lines of the elements.               These lines, to
far as they depend on the vibrations of single atoms, might arise from
several different kinds of vibrations of the form of the ring. Thus,
the hollow ring can have —
   (1.) Deformations of the circular axis:
                                                    — these must, as has been
shown by Sir W. Thomson,* be such that the axis at any time is
deformed into a helix wound on the surface of a tore, or the ring is
twisted. This mode of vibration for a solid core of the same density
as the surrounding fluid has been investigated by Mr. J. J. Thomson
in the memoir referred to above.
   (2.) Waves running round the surface of the ring, so that any cross-
section is crimped into small elevations and depressions, and the ring
itself is fluted.
   (3.) Vibrations of the aperture. This is really a case of (2).
   (4.) Pulsations of the hollow, whereby the volume of the hollow is
periodically altered.
   (5.) Swellings of the ring, travelling in one direction or the other
round the ring, so that the ring seems to be beaded.
   Cases (2) and (4), when the ring is moving steadily, are discussed
in this paper.
   It would be venturesome to draw conclusions in the present state

of onr knowledge respecting the properties of these atoms, or attempt
to find analogies even with the ordinary kinetic theory of gases. For
instance, the vortex-atoms are        polar,  and therefore do not behave
towards one another indifferently for all modes of approach.          Clearly,
also, the temperature of a gas composed of vortex-atoms could not
depend on the translatory velocity of mean square, but would depend
in some way on the mean energy.          In this connexion it is interesting
to notice that the time of vibration of a ring in class (2), when at
least the     ring is moving steadily, is independent of its energy,
depends in fact only on the constants of the ring, the fluid, and the
inverse square root of the number of crimps in a cross-section.             If
relations are to be sought between spectral lines they would arise
from classes 1, 2, 5. But from Mr. Thomson's investigations it would
appear that       in the case of a solid tore, the time of vibration in
class   (1) would depend on the temperature.
     Section  I of the paper is devoted to a consideration of the functions
employed in the investigation. In Section        II is considered the motion
of a rigid tore in fluid moving parallel to its straight axis.              In
 Section   III,  the problem of the steady motion of a hollow vortex is
 taken up, together with the small vibrations of classes (2) and (4)
above.      It will be sufficient to give here a short abstract of the
 results arrived at in Section III. The cross-section of a ring is
 throughout considered as small compared with the aperture, and the
 expressions giving the form of the hollow and the velocity of trans
 lation are carried to a second approximation, the quantity by which
 the approximation proceeds being the ratio r/{R+ y^R2— r3)}=&,
 where r, R— r, are the radii of the mean cross-section and aperture
 respectively ; when the ring is small this is very approximately
 r/2R.      The condition that the hollow must be a free surface,
 gives   a relation  which the volume of the hollow must satisfy, which
  for very small rings reduces to the constancy of the radius of the
  hollow.    For a solid ring the corresponding condition is, of course,
  the constancy of volume.      This makes an essential difference between
  the two theories.
     To a second approximation the velocity of translation is unaltered
  and is given by
                             V=-^—(3logi-2\
   whilst to the second approximation the surface        velocity, relative to
   the hollow itself, is1

    Tn the steady motion considered, the fluid carried forward -with the
ring forms a single mass without aperture, even for extremely small
cores, though not for infinitely small ones. For values of R/olO1
there   will be no aperture, whilst for less values the fluid carried         for
ward will be ring-shaped. To a first approximation the energy                 due
to the cyclic motion is the most important, and is the same as for a
rigid ring at rest of the same size, it does not depend on the veloeity
of translation, except in so far as this determines the size of the
aperture ; as entering in this way the principal term varies inversely
as the velocity of translation, and thus increases with diminished
translatory motion, a result obtained by Sir W. Thomson* from
general reasoning.       The terms obtained by the second approximation
arise from the translatory motion.
    Lastly, the times of vibration in classes (2) and (4) above are
determined, when the ring moves stpadily.             In class (2), or for fluted
 vibrations, the time of vibration for small rings is given very
approximately by ^d/(2pv/'0l ^ being the density, and p the pressure
of the fluid at a great distance, whilst n is the number of crimpings
in a section.      This is the proof of the statement made above as to
 the independence of the temperature.          In class (4) the time of pul
 sation is (/u1/2p) v/(log4/A;).    As 1c depends on the size of the ring,
 and therefore on the energy, this time is not independent of the
 latter, but varies slowly with it. The times here given must be
 understood as applying to rings moving steadily ; when a ring is
 changing its size they must be modified.             The investigation of this
 case, and of that in which there is a core of denser matter than the
 surrounding fluid, I hope shortly to take up.

different pressures, as liquids have definite boiling points, and whether
these pressures are identical with their vapour tensions.
    When a liquid is heated by conduction, as for example when a
flame is   placed below a vessel containing liquid, till the temperature
rises to its boiling point, either ebullition or superheating takes place.
It would thus seem that, in the case of superheating, the surface of the
liquid is not large enough to afford escape for the gaseous molecules
liberated ; or the convection currents are not rapid enough to convey
the superheated liquid from the lower strata to the surface.        If the
surface is superheated, the first reason would seem to be correct ; if
the surface, on the other hand, is at its normal temperature, the second
explanation is applicable.      When ebullition takes place, the liquid
increases its surface by the formation of bubbles, and as heat is totally
absorbed in producing evaporation,         the temperature of the liquid
remains constant.      If the supply of heat is increased, evaporation is
also more rapid, and facility is given to more rapid evaporation, by the
formation of more numerous and larger bubbles, which increase the
evaporating surface.
   A solid has a limited surface, which cannot be increased by forma
tion of bubbles ; and it might therefore be expected that on increasing
the supply of heat, the temperature of the 'solid should rise, until a
 temperature is reached at which its rate of evaporation is equivalent
to the rate at which heat is communicated to it.     Reasoning thus, the
 existence of hot ice was maintained by Dr. Carnelley and other writers
 in a series of letters which appeared in " Nature " during the years
1881 and 1882.
  On the other hand, a liquid       in the spheroidal state presents a free
surface   of evaporation in every direction, and yet although exposed to
radiation from a white-hot surface, its temperature does not rise even
to the boiling point ; and we find it impossible to raise the temperature
of water above 90°, by applying heat to its surface.           In such cases
the surface appears to be large enough           to allow vapour to escape
with sufficient rapidity to prevent superheating.
   If,  then, the rate of evaporation at the surface of a solid   isindepen
 dent of the extent of that surface, but      isinfluenced only by the rate
 at which heat    iscommunicated to     it,
                                          and, as in the case of liquids, by

                               is        itfollows that solids have definite
 temperatures of evaporation, or subliming points, corresponding to
 definite pressures, as liquids have definite boiling points.
     Otir experiments with water, acetic acid, benzene, naphthalene, and
 camphor, show that this        the case
                               is        ; and that with ice and camphor
 these pressures are sensibly the same as the maximum tensions of the
 4vapours of these solids at corresponding temperatures.      In the case of
  •ce, the maximum    temperature which can be attained under any given
  pressure is indicated by James Thomson's ice-steam line.

    That the temperatures observed cannot be absolutely the same is
 evident ; for there must be a certain excess of pressure in the neigh
 bourhood of the surface of the solid in order to produce a flow of
 vapour from it to the surrounding space ; and consequently the
 evaporating substance must have a higher temperature corresponding
 to this higher pressure.     Our results, we venture to think, show that
 with solids, as with liquids, this difference, even when rapid evaporation
 is taking place, is an extremely minute one.

       F.R.S. Received June 6, 1883.
    It is just a century since James Six (the inventor of the well-
known Six's registering thermometer) commenced some occasional
 comparisons of the temperature of the air at the top and bottom
of the tower of Canterbury Cathedral. We do not precisely know
the position in which the instruments were placed, and, as ther
mometer screens had not then been invented, his observations can
only be accepted as approximately correct ; but as the work in which
they are recorded is rather scarce, it may be well to give an analysis
of the results. The observations were not consecutive, but made at
various dates during 1 784-92 ; the lower thermometer was 5 feet,
and the upper one 220 feet above the ground.             The daily maxima
were about 1° warmer at the top during all frosty period ; alike at the
top and the bottom when the temperature               was between 40° and
50°, and lower     at  the top by   from   3°  to 5° when  the temperature
was about 50°.        The minima gave analogous but more marked
differences.    Some very severe frosts occurred while these experiments
were in progress, and with bottom temperatures             of — 2°-5, +6°,
and + 6°45 respectively, the top temperatures were 16°, 17°, and 21°,
showing an excess at the top of 17°"5, 11°, and 14°45. In ordinary
weather the excess of the top minima was not so great, but the
average excess was 6°, and there was not a single night when it was
colder at the top than at the bottom.
    The author is not aware of any further experiments having been
made upon this subject in this couutry until 1861, when the Rev.
R. Main, F.R.S., Radcliffe Observer, had a record commenced of a
Six's registering thermometer, and dry and wet bulb thermometers
placed near the anemometer on the Radcliffe Observatory, Oxford.
These instruments were 105 feet above the ground, and were read

 about 9 A.M. in conjunction with other thermometers at 5 feet above
 the ground.       The readings of these instruments have since that time
 been    published in extenso, but the author has seen no discussion of
 them, and is not aware whether the thermometers have been verified
 or not, nor how they are mounted.
    In 1868 Mr. James Glaisher, F.R.S., instituted a series of readings
of the dry and wet bulb thermometers at the Royal Observatory,
 Greenwich, at the respective heights of 4 feet, 22 feet, and 50 feet
above the ground.        The observations which are published in extenso
in the "Proceedings of the Meteorological Society," vol. v, p. 29,
extend only from June 25 to August 6 — a period of six weeks during
the hottest part of the year.        The results show that during the day
hours the temperature at      4 feet was at times 7° and 8° higher, and at
night 3°, 4°, and 5° lower than at 50 feet above the ground.
    The subject was mentioned at the Meteorological Conference at
Leipzig in 1872, and both Messrs. Wild and Scott undertook to have
experiments made, with the following results : —
    In 1872—74 Professor H. Wild carried out experiments with
thermometers and hygrometers placed at the heights of 6 feet, 52 feet,
and 86 feet above the ground on a scaffolding at the Pulkowa
Observatory.        (" Repertorium fur Meteorologie," vol. v.)
    During 1873-75 readings of maximum and minimum, and dry and
wet bulb thermometers were made on behalf of the Meteorological
Office at the Kew Observatory, 10 feet, and on the ornamental Pagoda
in the Royal Gardens, Kew, at the respective heights of 22 feet,
69 feet, and 129 feet above the ground.         Mr. R. H. Scott, F.R.S., in
concluding his report        on  these  observations  (" Quarterly Weather
                                           " That so far as the evidence
Report," 1876, Appendix 3 ), says:
adduced in this paper goes, it indicates that, on the average of a con
siderable series of observations,       the influence of height on mean
thermometrical and hygrometrical results is not very great, but that
on individual occasions very material differences are observed.
    Lastly, Mr. G. Dines has recently communicated to the Meteoro
logical Society (" Quarterly Journal," vol. viii, p. 189), the results
 of observations which he has made with thermometers           placed 4 feet
and 50 feet above the ground at his residence at Hersham, Walton-on-
 Thames. These observations, which extended from September, 1876,
 to September, 1878, inclusive, show that on the average the mean
 daily range of temperature at 50 feet was 2°-l less than at 4 feet, the
 mean of the maxima at 50 feet being l°-2 lower, and the mean of the
 minima 0°49 higher than at 4 feet.
     It will be seen from the above abstract that, up to the end of 1881,
 there was no precise information as to the form of the curve of daily
  temperature at considerable heights above the ground. It was known
  that the amplitude of the daily range was materially reduced, but the

amount of the reduction was unknown, and, owing to the absence of
hourly readings at night, no data existed for determining the shape
of the curve during the night and early morning hours.
    The Council of the Meteorological Society have therefore 8hought
it expedient to endeavour to obtain accurate and complete information
upon the subject.     The author had been for some years in communi
cation with Mr. E. C. Hackford, verger of the parish church of
Boston, Lincolnshire, the tower of which rises, quite free from any
obstructions, in a very flat country, to the considerable height of
273 feet. The site was extremely suitable, and Mr. Hackford was a
practised observer ; he having consented to make the observations.
arrangements     were made for obtaining instruments.            Th- first
essential was a thermometer which could be read without climbing to
the top of the tower.     This requirement having been brought to the
knowledge of Sir      W. Siemens, F.R.S., he very kindly placed at the
disposal of the Council one of his electrical thermometers.
    The principle of these instruments was fully explained by Sir W.
 Siemens in the Bakerian Lecture, 1871, and published in a paper " On
the Dependence of Electrical Resistance to Temperature," printed in
vol. iii of the
                 " Journal of the
                                  Society of Telegraph Engineers."        It
is therefore merely necessary to state that the thermometer consists of
a spiral of insulated wire coiled round a core of wood, the whole being
protected by a brass sheath.      The resistance of the wire increasing
with increase of temperature it is only necessary to measure the
resistance in order to learn the temperature.     The current is provided
by a six-cell Leclanche battery, and a light cable carries the insulated
wires up to the thermometer, and connects it with a galvanometer
with a roller contact. The position of the contact maker when the
galvanometer is at zero depends upon the resistance in the thermo
meter, and therefore the position of the contact maker, as shown on a
graduated scale, gives the temperature.
    On receipt of the thermometer from Messrs. Siemens Brothers'
 works, it was at once forwarded to Kew Observatory for verification,
 and    the report was that it worked very satisfactorily, but was
somewhat sluggish.
    The consent of the vicar (Canon Blenkin) to the use of the tower of
the church having been obtained, the Assistant Secretary of the
Meteorological Society (Mr. W. Marriott) was intrusted with all the
 arrangements.      He went to Boston at the end of February, 1882, and
 erected the following instruments.
    (1.) In the churchyard, where there is a good exposure, a
 Stevenson screen containing dry bulb, wet bulb, maximum               and
 minimum thermometers, all at 4 feet above the ground.
    (2.) On the roof of the belfry, in its south-east corner, 4 feet above
the roof, and 170 feet above the ground, a precisely similar Stevenson

  1883.]         Th-rmometric and Hygrometric          Observations.        313
 screen   with similar thermometers to those at 4 feet. From this point
 upwards the tower is quite open, besides which there is free circulation
 of the air through the large open windows on the four sides of the
 tower.
     (3.) In a box with three of its sides louvre boarded, and of which
 the   height, breadth, and depth are respectively 1 foot 5 inches,
8£ inches, and b\ inches, the Siemens electrical thermometer and also
a   standard thermometer for occasional          check readings.     The box or
" wall             "
          screen     faces   west-south-west, is attached        to one of the
northern pinnacles of the tower, and is 260 feet above the ground.
When first put up a board was fastened on the south side of the
screen    to protect   it from the sun's rays       ; as  this, however, hardly
afforded    sufficient protection, an outer screen was placed over the wall
screen     in September.         The cable has been brought down the
inside of the tower, then through the belfry, and so to the base of the
tower inside the church, where the galvanometer is fixed.
    The accompanying figure shows the relative situations of the three
sets of thermometers.
                        A = Siemens' Thermometer.
                        B = Stevenson's Screen on Belfry.
                        C = Stevenson's Screen in Churchyard.
     All the thermometers are read every morning at 9 o'clock ; and
  simultaneous readings of the electrical thermometer at the summit of
  4the tower and     of the dry bulb thermometer in the churchyard,
  together with the direction and force of the wind, the amount of cloud,
  "weather, &c., are also made regularly at 11 a.m., 1, 3, 5, 7, and 9 p.m.

314                                    Mr. G.     J.      Symons.                                       [June             21.
    All the observations have been made by Mr. Hackford in the most
careful and satisfactory manner.
    Systematic observations commenced with April, 1882, and th-
whole of the records have been examined by Mr. Marriott. As the
series is still in operation, and some classes of weather have not yet
occurred, it is impossible      to give at present final results.  The
leading features of the first nine months' work are, however, of con
siderable interest, and may be thus epitomized : —
   Table I gives the monthly means of the readings of the maximum,
minimum, and dry bulb thermometers in the churchyard, and on the
roof of the belfry, at 9 a.m., from April to December, 1882.
    From this it will be seen that the mean maximum temperature at
4 feet exceeds that at 170 feet by 1°49, while the mean minimum
temperature at 4 feet falls below that at 170 feet in almost every
month, the mean difference being 0°44. The range of temperature                                                                is,
therefore, 2°    43less on the belfry than         at   feet above theit     is        4
ground.
    The temperatures at       a.m. show that on the average the air at
                                       9
4  feetis  10-3 warmer than at 170 feet.

considerably warmer than at the top of the tower. The greatest
difference is from 9 a.m. to 3 p.m., after which it begins to get less and
less.
   On examining the individual readings for each day, two interesting
features are clearly brought out, viz., (1) that in fine bright weather
the temperature at 4 feet during the day is much higher than on the
top of the tower, —in summer the difference sometimes reaches 5° at
1 p.m. ; and (2) that in foggy weather the temperature       at the top of
the tower is always higher than at 4 feet, the upper part of the
tower being generally free from fog. In clondy and wet weather the
temperature is uniformly higher in the churchyard than at the top of
the tower.
    These observations, however, like nearly all those previously made,
refer mostly to the day time ; it was felt of pre-eminent importance
that readings should be taken occasionally throughout the night as
well as the day. Hitherto the usual difficulties in obtaining observa
tions requiring night attendance have prevented any considerable
number of such records being obtained, but every effort will be made
 to increase their number, especially when extreme atmospheric condi
tions prevail. During last winter there were eight occasions upon
which one of the church officials was on duty all night, and for those
periods we have complete records.
    The following are brief descriptions of        the weather    on  each
occasion : —
    November 11-12. Fine clear cold night, followed by a fine day,
                         with slight fog.
         „     18-19.  Dull, wet and squally.
         „     25-26. Fine bright night, dull day, rather windy.
    December     2—3. Dull, with suow at night, fog in afternoon.
                9-10. Dull and cold.
         „     16-17. Dull and damp.
         „     23-24. Fine and bright, slight fog 5-9 p.m.
         „     30-31. Cloudy night, wet day with fog.
    The temperatures are given in Table III.
    The prevalence of fine clear nights is readily seen by the increased
temperature at the upper station ; the presence of fog is also indicated
in a similar manner ; while cloudy skies, rain, and wind prevent
 radiation, and so on the days and nights of their occurrence the
temperature is always highest near the ground.
    From the foregoing it seems that the difference between the
temperature at 4 feet and 260 feet is chiefly regulated by the amount
of cloud, and by the relation of the temperature of the surface of the
ground to that of the general body of air passing over it. If so, it
will follow that the mean difference between the temperature at the
two heights can only be determined by very numerous observations,

or by careful considerations of the conditions of weather and of soil
temperature under which each individual set is made.
   As regards hygrometry the data at present obtained relate solely to
9 a.m. and to the heights of 4 and 170 feet respectively. The mean
relative humidity at these points for nine months of 1882, is given
in the following table, which shows that the differences, though some
what larger in summer than at other periods, are not generally of
importance.

     It  is well known that drills and other tools of the same class which
  are guided      by their cutting edges tend to, or at any rate can produce
  holes which are not circular in section, and further, that if the tool
  have n equidistant edges, the hole which it produces, if not circular
  in section, will have n + 1 sides or similar arcs,* but the exact shape
  of these holes and the      limits to their possible departure from circularity
  have not as             I
                   far as am aware been hitherto examined.
      The problem consists in finding all the figures which will circum-
     *
        These sides are in general very much curved, and in fact aro not distinguishable
   without measurement    when n is greater than 3 ; but when n = 2 the departure from
   the circular form is often
                               very wide. A good instance of this may be seen in the
   holes bored in rock for blasting.   These holes are made by an iron bar with a chisel-
   shaped   end, and the section of the holes is a triangle with the corners rounded off.

scribe a rotating polygon, that is, the figures on whose sides the angles
of the enclosed polygon shall all lie during the whole revolution
of the latter in the former. But before proceeding to do this it may
be as well to consider how the departure from the circular form
originates.
   Let AB, CD, fig. 1, be the tool, which for simplicity may be
supposed to have two cutting edges only, AO, BC; its axis being
CD.
   The tool is guided by the edges AC, BC, and the axis may be
considered to remain parallel to a fixed straight line, but to be other
wise free.
  In    fig. 2 let DEF be the section of the hole, ABC the drill seen in
plan, and    C   the axis of the hole.
  If   the hole is circular C and C will be identical, but if by any chance
C and C are mutually displaced, one edge (BC in the figure) will have
a deeper layer of substance to cut than the other, and the result will
be that the instantaneous axis about which the drill is revolving is
-hifted from C to some point, P, lying between C and B, but by turning
about any point between C and B, AC will have to cut through a layer
of substance gradually increasing in depth, and when this depth is
equal to that along BC, P and C will coincide, but as BC will now
 encounter a layer of diminishing thickness, P will move through C to
some position between A and C.
    These alternate variations of the depth of the cut at the two edges
 may continue indefinitely, the section of the hole varying at each
 revolution, but if certain conditions are fulfilled the figure produced
 will remain constant in character after the first revolution.
    Since P is always on that side of C on which the cut is deepest, and
 C is on the same side of the perpendicular from C on AB, C will
describe some curve round C in the opposite direction to the rotation of
 ACB. That         while the drill rotates in one direction, its geometrical
                  is,
 axis describes some curve in the opposite direction round the axis of
 the hole.
   If   instead of the centres  C   and C being mutually displaced, one of
 the edges meets with an accidental obstruction, or   if  one of the edges
                                                                         is
 blunter than the other, the same results will be produced, except that
 when the last mentioned cause operates the effects tend to accumulate,
 and this probably       the actual origin in most cases.
                        is
    The same sort of result will occur whatever be the number of the
 cutting edges of the tool, viz., the instantaneous axis will always be on
 that side of the geometrical axis on which the cut      is  deepest, or the
 resistance to progress of the edge greatest, and in virtue of this the
 geometrical axis will rotate about the axis of the hole in a direction
 opposite to the motion of the tool.
    This fact at once suggests a method of analysing the figures swept

ont by the angles of the tool. Let e be the distance between C and                     C
and 0 the direction of the line joining them, then e can always                        be
expressed by the following equation : —
                                   e=e0   +- 2ej sin (t80 + *j)                       (1).
and since the tool is a          rigid body, its angles are displaced from the
position     which    they would     occupy were the hole circular by an amount
n in a direction 0.
   Let Aj, A2 (fig. 3), be the adjacent angles of the tool, which is sup
posed to be a regular polygon of n sides, Pj, P2 the paths along which
they move, c the centre of hole, and pl p2 the path described bye',
the centre of the polygon.
    It is clear that if Plt P8, . . . are to form parts of a single curve.

             A2 must occupy the same position when the polygon has
turned through          — that     . . . An,  At occupied at first    ; thus, while    the
                         n
polygon rotates once, its centre will move n times round the centre of
the hole, and hence if 0 be the angle which AC makes with a filed
line passing through c, and if 0 also be measured from the same Hoe,

hence     e  goes through n complete cycles, while 0 increases by 2s-; but
as   e revolves in a direction opposite to that of the polygon, it will go
through      Ti + l cycles if the 0 be measured        from a line fixed in the polygon.
Let OA be this fixed line, then A goes through n+1 cycles of displace

of the ith term, while CA revolves once ; hence the symmetry of the

    If, however, without confining         ourselves to necessarily small values

   Thus we see that a hypotrochoid with its generating circles in the
ratios given will circumscribe an w-sided rotating polygon, the dia
meter of whose circumscribing circle is 2p0.                 In order that the rota
tion may be mechanically possible, the polygon and hypotrochoid
must not cut one another at any part of the revolution, and this
condition limits the possible value of e.
   Let ABCD, fig. 4, be part of the polygon, and EFGH part of the
hypotrochoid, then it may be shown that if a side of one figure cuts
that of the other, the cutting sides will contain the greatest area
between them when, as at B and C, the adjacent angles of the polygon
are equidistant from the adjacent corners of the hypotrochoid.                     For
the angular motion of B and C is a maximum when passing the
middle of the side of the hypotrochoid, and a minimum when passing
the corners, so that, since BF=CG, C will leave G faster than B
approaches      F, and vice versa, hence the area enclosed between the
points        p2, by BC and FG will diminish if the polygon rotates, and
hence    if BC is    a  tangent to FG when BF=CG, the sides can never
cut one another.         The distance of the middle point of the side of the
 polygon     from its centre is />0cos-, while the distance of the corre-

       tween Chemical Constitution, Physiological Action,                 and
       Antagonism."     By T. Lauder Brunton, M.D., F.R.S.,               and
       J. Theodore Cash, M.D. Received June 13, 1883.
                                (Ahs tract.)
   This paper is divided into several parts.      In the first the   authors
consider the general action of ammonium salts, and show that the
action of the ammonium is considerably modified by the acid radical
with which it is combined.
   All the ammonium salts affect the spinal cord, motor nerves, and
muscles, and in advanced poisoning tend to poison all those structures.
The course of poisoning varies with the salt employed.        The chloride,
bromide, and iodide form a series in which a stimulant action on the
cord is best marked in the bromide, and the paralysing action upon it
and upon motor nerves most strongly in the iodide.
   Motor nerves are also paralysed by the sulphate and phosphate,
though less strongly than by the iodide.
   The iodide tends to arrest the circulation sooner than the other
salts.
   Ammonium bromide appears to have a special tendency              to  cause
coagulation of the stroma of red blood corpuscles.           The    sulphaie
does so to a less extent, and the phosphate and iodide have a             still
less effect.
   In the second part the action of salts of compound ammonias            was
investigated. The substances employed were ethylamine, trimethjl-
 amine, and triethylamine ; the chlorides, iodides, and sulphates of amyl

 1883.]        Chemical Const8ution, Physiological Action,     fyc.       325
ammoniam and of dimethyl ammonium ; trimethyl ammonium and
tetramethyl ammonium iodide ; ethyl ammonium chloride, diethyl
ammonium chloride, iodide, and sulphate; triethyl ammonium chloride,
iodide, and sulphate ; tetraethyl ammonium iodide.
     The compound ammonias affect the spinal cord, motor nerves, and
muscles.       The spinal cord is first stimulated and then paralysed,
stimulation being evidenced by twitchings or convulsions, and the
paralysis by loss of reflex action and motor power.
     There is a marked difference in the action between ammonia
and the compound ammonias ; while ammonia causes well marked
tetanus, compound ammonias, as a rule, produce symptoms of motor
paralysis with the exception of those in which one atom of hydrogen
only is substituted by an alcohol radical.         This paralysis appears to
be partly due to their action on the spinal cord and nerve centres,
and partly to a curara-like action on the motor nerves.
     Some of them apparently increase somewhat the excitability of the
 spinal cord at first, but this is temporary, and is shown rather by
 hyperesthesia or tremor than by convulsion; and tetramethyl and
 ethyl ammonium salts differ from the di- or tri-methyl or ethyl
 ammonias in having a much greater tendency to cause convulsions.
     The effect of the acid radical on the physiological action is less
 marked in the case of the compound ammonias than in the salts of
 ammonia itself.
     The iodides of the compound ammonias paralyse motor nerves more
 quickly than either chlorides or sulphates.
     No difference was observed between the paralysing action of corre
  sponding chlorides and sulphates.
      The irritability of the muscle is increased as a rule by the chlorides,
  sometimes increased and sometimes diminished by the sulphates, and,
  as a rule, though with some exceptions,         decreased by the iodides.
  The contractile power of the muscle is less affected by the chlorides,
  more by the sulphates, and most by the iodides.
      On comparing the effect of the substitution of different alcohol
  radicals for hydrogen in the compound ammonias, it was found that
  the least  active substances were the ethyl, diethyl, and triethyl com
  pounds. In the case of the iodides and sulphates of these compounds
   only, was the minimal irritability of the muscle undiminished.         The
   difference between ethyl and methyl compounds was more observable
   in the case of the iodides and sulphates than in that of the chlorides.
   The iodides all have a strong tendency to paralyso the motor nerves,
   but this is most marked in the case of tetramethyl and tetraethyl
   ammonium iodides. Tetramethyl appears to act in a somewhat smaller
    dose than the tetraethyl ammonium.
       Sulphates of the methyl compounds have a stronger tendency to
    paralyse motor nerves than those of ethyl compounds, and the ethyl

  326              Drs.   T. L. Bmnton     and  J. T. Cash.      [June   21,
  compounds have a greater tendency to exaggerate the irritability of
  the muscle at first.
     Salts of methyl, ethyl, and amyl ammonium are more active than
  the corresponding ones of the di- and tri-compounds,       but the tetra-
  componnds are most active of all.
     In  the next part of the paper the effect of salts of the alkalies
  on muscle and nerve are considered.          The substances investigated
  were the chlorides of lithium, sodium, potassium, rubidium, and
  caesium.   These   differ from ammonia in having very little tendency
 to stimulate the spinal cord, and the chief symptom of poisoning by
 them is increasing torpor.
     Slight excitement of reflex action is noted at first in the case of
 potassium and rubidium.
     The motor nerves are not paralysed by caesium or rubidium except
 in very large doses, but the other substances of this group paralyse
 them to a greater or less extent.        Lithium and potassium are tbe
 most powerful.
      The contractile power of muscle (as shown by the height of curve)
 is increased by rubidium, ammonium, potassium, and caesium.            It is
 unaffected by sodium excepting in large doses, and is almost invariably
 diminished by lithium.
     The duration of contraction, as shown by the length of the curve.
 is increased by rnbidium and ammonium in large doses, by sodium,
 and caesium.    It is shortened by ammonium, lithium, and rubidium in
 small doses, and by potassium.       The contracture or viscosity is in
 creased by rubidium and ammonium in large doses, by lithium, and
 sodium. It is diminished by rubidium and ammonium in small doses,
 by caesium, and potassium.
    The action of substances      belonging to the alkaline earths and
 earths, is discussed   in the next section.   The substances investigated
were the chlorides of calcium, strontium, barium, beryllium, didymium,
erbium, and lanthanum. In regard to their action upon the nervous
system, these substances fall into two groups, (a) containing beryllium,
calcium, strontium, and barium; and (6) containing yttrium, didymium,
erbium, and lanthanum. Group a has a tendency to increase reflex
action as evidenced by spasm or tremor.         With group 6 reflex action
in the cord appears to be little affected, but they appear to have a
tendency to paralyse motor centres of the brain in the frog.
    Group a all paralyse motor nerves to some extent.      Lanthanum has
also a slight paralysing action, but the other members of group b have
not, agreeing in this respect with sodium and rubidium, and differing
from all the others.
    In regard to their action on muscles these substances cannot be
divided into sub-groups. The contractile power of muscle is increased
by barium, erbium, and lanthanum.          It is sometimes increased and

 1883.]         Cliemical Constitution,  Physiological Action,   fyc.       327
 sometimes diminished by yttrium and calcium.             It is diminished by
 didymium, strontium, and beryllium. The duration of contraction is
increased by barium, calcium, strontium, yttrium, and erbium.              It is
unaffected, or slightly diminished by beryllium,              didymium,     and
lanthanum.
     Contracture    is increased by barium, calcium, strontium, yttrium,
and      beryllium.    The contracture produced by barium is enormous,
resembling that produced by veratria, as the authors have shown in a
former paper.         It is, like that of veratria, diminished by heat, cold
and potash, and may be abolished by these agents.            It is not so well
marked when the drug is injected into the circulation as when
locally applied to the muscle.
     The action of some of the more important of those drugs can be
graphically represented by a spiral, the terminal members of which
are potassium and barium, and these two are to a certain extent con
nected by ammonium as an intermediate link.
     The alteration effected in the action of the different members of
 these groups on muscle by the subsequent application of another, is
next discussed, and it is shown that the effect of one substance upon
 muscle may be increased or diminished by the application of another.
 One of the most curious points is that two substances having a
 similar action may, instead of increasing, neutralise each other's
 effect.
      Potassium shortens       the lengthened muscular curves produced by
  barium, calcium, strontium, sodium        in large doses, and lithium, and
  reduces the contracture        which they cause. Sodium in large doses
  lengthens the curve and increases the contracture of the normal
  mnscular curve, and it adds to the length of the long curves caused
  by   calcium and strontium.         The veratria-like curve of barium is
  counteracted by almost all the substances which produce a shorter
  curve than itself.      There is remarkable antagonism between barium
  and rubidium.       Rubidium in large doses produces an elongated curve
  with enormous contracture almost like that of barium.         This abuormal
   curve is reduced to the normal by barium, and if this is applied to a
   greater extent than is sufficient to antagonise         rubidium, it again
   produces the prolonged curve characteristic of the barium itself. In
   the case of calcium and strontium, which have a similar action in
   prolonging the curve, we find no antagonism ; the one tending rather
   to increase the effect of the other.       Some relations are pointed out
   between the atomic weights of antagonising elements.               Although
   the data are too limited to draw from them any general rule, the
   authors think that they may possibly lead by-and-by to some useful
    result.  Thus, calcium reduces the barium curve to the normal before
    it causes its own peculiar curve.     This may be looked upon possibly
    as the result of the union of the barium and potassium               having

     Rubidium in large doses has the same effect as barium in causing &
 veratria-like curve, but barium destroys the effect of rubidium before
 producing its own effect.

     In  the next division the authors show that by alternate application
of    acids and alkalies the muscle of the frog may be made to describe
 on a slowly-revolving cylinder curves which almost exactly resemble
 those described on a quick cylinder by the normal contraction of a
muscle on stimulation        ; and also those which the muscle describes    on
irritation after it has been poisoned by barium. They consider tL&:
the contraction of muscle may be possibly due in some measure
at least to alterations in acid or neutral salts which the muscle
contains.
    The lethal activity on frogs of the chlorides experimented upon is
as follows : the potassium being most powerful, and calcium least
powerful ; potassium,           beryllium,   rubidium, barium, ammonium,
caesium,     lithium,   lanthanum, didymium, erbium, strontium, yttrium,
sodium, calcium.
VII. "The         Influence of Water in the Atmosphere on the Solar
        Spectrum and Solar Temperature." By Captain Abxet,
        R.E., F.R.S., and Colonel Festing, R.E. Communicated
        at the request of the Committee on Solar Physics.                 Re
        ceived   June    14, 1883.
    In our paper          " Atmospheric
                      on                   Absorption in the Infra-red of the
Solar Spectrum"          (" Proc. Roy. Soc," vol. 35, p. 80), we stated
that the absorption by water coincided with the absorption bands
to be found in the solar spectrum, and our proof rested on photo
graphs which had been taken for some time back. In the diagram
which we published (and in which are slight errors in shading
at some parts, and which we here correct) we showed the coinci
dences as far as X10,000, that being the limit to which we could
accurately fix the wave-lengths.            Simultaneously almost with the
publication of our paper, there came into our possession an aeconnt
of Professor Langley's researches on the solar spectrum, conducted by
means of the bolometer, a perusal of which determined us to vary

1883.]      On   the   Solar Spectrum and Solar Temperature.            32&
our method of observations in order to definitively test our conclu
sions as regards intensity of absorption in the part of the spectrum
below the red which we had explored, and also to ascertain if our
deductions held good in the parts we had not explored.                It thus
became necessary to go over the work done by Langley as far as our
instrumental means would allow. One of the most remarkable
features in it seemed to be the failure of Cauchy's formula for
refraction, his prismatic spectrum extending below A to a distance
equal to AG, whilst theoretically it should end at a distance equal to
AE. Our first labour was to ascertain the correctness of this by
means of photographs taken with the diffraction grating.          Since 1880r
when the temporary map of the normal spectrum of the infra-red
from X7000 to 10,500 was published, a large number of photographs
for the determination of lower wave-lengths have been taken, with
the result that a map as far as 15,000 can now be constructed, showing
all the delicate Fraunhofer lines which exist in this lower region,
but this extent is not sufficient for a comparison with Langley's solar
thermogram, which extends to X28,000. Unfortunately in our climate
the atmospheric conditions preclude getting any results much lower
 than 15,000, except on very rare occasions.      Advantage has been taken
 of cold dry days to take rougher photographs, which though not so
 defined in detail as those up to X15,000, are yet sufficiently accurate
 to compare with Langley's map.          His map is accurate to figures over
 the 100 on the tenth-metre scale, and our photographs have the same
 accuracy.      As a result of the comparison of our photographs to
 X22,000, with the map, we may say, that the wave-lengths agree, and
 the failure of Cauchy's formula is confirmed.        Our photographs were
 secured by separating vertically the different orders by means of a
 white glass prism of 30°. The coincidences of the different spectra
  were thus readily seen, and the X value at once ascertained.            The
  glass employed throughout our researches is the same as that used by
  Langley, to whom one of us recommended        it,  and of which he speaks
  in such high praise.       The use of rock-salt for anything except for
  purely absolute quantitative work becomes unnecessary, and for com
  parative work the glass is as effective and more certain.          No rock-
  salt prism which we have tried will bear the use of     a   collimator, the
  lens of which  is   filled by the radiation the surfaces have never been
                                           ;
  nearly as perfect as those of the glass.    The principal Fraunhofer lines
  were almost indistinguishable, unless the aperture of the collimating
  lens was very largely diminished.          This was the case with four
   separate prisms, which when first tried were newly polished by an
   optician.   Professor Langley has been more fortunate than ourselves
 in   this respect, and has been able to compare his glass with rock-salt.
   We owe, however, a debt of gratitude to Dr. Guthrie and Professor
   Tyndall for having given us rock-salt with which to experiment, and

•only   wish our report of its behaviour might have been more
 favourable.
    Having confirmed the correctness of Langley's wave-lengths as far
 as A.22,000, we proceeded by means of the thermopile to examine
the spectrum obtained when using the crater of the positive pole of
 the electric light as a source of radiation, and also subs-quently the
 variations caused by placing different thicknesses of water in front of
 the slit.  The thermopile we used was constructed specially for us by
 Elliott Brothers, some two years ago, when we had made a commence
 ment of this work.* It is a linear pile of twenty-six couples to the inch,
and one face is covered by a silvered slit with moveable jaws. The
4couples are mounted in the usual manner, and enclosed in a chamber
with transparent ends which can be exhausted, if necessary. Outside
 this again is a water jacket, through which a constant stream of cold
 water can be made to circulate. The instrument is extremely delicate,
 and answered our purpose well. Two reflecting galvanometers were
 used at different times, one having an internal resistance of about
•0-5 ohm, and the other of 0-12 ohm.            The thermopile was mounted
on a stand, moveable horizontally by a -crew of 1&£ turns to th- inch.
The range of movement was 6 inches.              The pile was always moved
in one direction during one set of observations. To form the spectrum
the following arrangement was adopted.            A condenser of whit- glass
threw an image     of  the crater  on the slit of a collimator having a focal
length of 20 inches, the lens of the collimator had a diameter of
1^ inches, and the rays of light were rendered parallel for C, and
then fell on a glass prism (sometimes two) placed at approximately
the angle of minimum deviation for that ray. A lens of 20 inches focal
length attached to a camera formed the spectrum, which could be
received either on a sensitive plate or on the face of the pile.           The
width of the collimator slit was            of an inch for the electric lights,
and for the sun -^-g inch. The width of the slit of the thermopile
was in the former case           inch, and in the latter -fa. In order to
obtain fiducial points in the spectrum, the arc was focussed on the
slit, a sodium spectrum formed, and a photograph taken. The sensi
tive plate was replaced by the thermopile, and the D line brought in
the centre of the jaws of the silvered slit, and this point on the
screw was used as the zero of the scale.           From measurements of the
photographs the exact position of all lines and bauds could be readily
obtained and referred to the reading taken with the thermopile. A
check photograph and zero reading were taken at the end of each
series of observations.      An assistant kept the image of the crater on
the slit (which had a length of 431 inch), one of us attended to the
movement of the pile, while the other took the galvanometer readings.
The unused face of the pile was covered with thick folds of non-con-

¦ducting    material, and the jacket of the pile was kept fall of water,
 the whole       being enclosed to form part of the camera by means
of a thick covering. At each movement of the pile at least three
readings of the galvanometer were taken.          In each series of observa
tions, and for each water spectrum examined, at least six series were
made.
    We believe that the results we put forward are fairly representative
quantitatively, and without doubt the positions of maxima and minima
maybe relied onto one-eighth turn of the screw.         At the same time it
must be remembered that the breadth of the slit of the thermopile is
a measurable quantity, and one which cannot be neglected, but its
existence is a necessary evil.      For this reason the positions of bands
are more exact in the photographs than in the thermograms, and any
small discrepancy in position should be discounted in favour of the
photograph. When using the solar radiation, which is four times
more intense than that of the crater of the electric light, and when
both slits have been narrowed, the absorptions are sure to be more
intensely marked than when a wider slit is used, the reason of which
is obvious.       Langley employed a spectrum which was of about the
same purity as ours (" American Journal of Science," vol. 25, p. 169,
 1883, and
               " Phil. Mag.," vol. 15, p. 153, 1883), but the width of his
 bolometer strip being about one-fifth that of the jaws of the thermo
 pile slit, and his spectrum longer, the absorptions are shown with
 greater strength than they are in our curves, whilst in our photo
 graphs the absorptions are even more marked.
     Our first result was the thermogram of the crater of the positive
 pole, and this is shown in Curve I, Diagram I.       This is the mean of a
 dozen curves which all lie very closely on this mean.        One thing we
 learn from it is that the temperature of the crater is always very
 uniform with any carbon, and is what we might expect when we
 consider that it is the temperature at which carbon vaporises.           In
                it  with Tyndall's  curve   given  in " Heat   as a Mode   of
 comparing
  Motion," we are struck by the difference exhibited in the two near
  the apices ; this difference,    however, is explicable as will be seen
  further on, when it is remembered that his source of radiation was
  one composed of various temperatures.         Next, in order to ascertain
  the amount of absorption due to different thicknesses of water, it was
  found necessary to employ cells with glass sides, and, unfortunately,
  not being in possession of parallel glass of the same material as the
  prisms, it became necessary to take the absorption curve of the cells.
  This is found in Curve II. Water was then placed in the cells before
  the slit, and the readings taken.       Curves VI, VII, and   VIII are the
   water curves corrected for the cell-absorption, and they were con
  structed to enable a comparison to be made with the curve of the
   solar spectrum.

  A  reference to the diagram will show that the thermograms of the
water spectra have absolute coincidence with the absorptions shown
in the photographs. The thermogram is, however, more delicate in
some respects   as for instance, in the dip in the curves commencing

£ inch of water it is distinct in the thermogram. The reason of this
is that when high intensities of radiation are nearly equal, an ap
parent equality of intensity of image is produced in a photograph
when exposure is prolonged.      By shortening the exposure and thus
sacrificing the rest of the spectrum, this band can be brought ont.
Russell and Lapraik (see " Journal of the Chemical Society," 1881)
found this band visually when using a thickness of 14 feet of water,
apparently,   therefore, the thermopile is more delicate for gentle
shades of radiation than is the eye.
       Diagram  II  shows the Curves I, VI, VII, and VIII, transformed to
    the normal scale of wave-lengths        (figuredI',  VI', VII', and VIII'

    of the crater on this scale corresponds to a wave-length of about 7350,
    or just at the limit of the red as usually visible.    It  will also be seen
     that the depressions are not so marked as in the prismatic scale.

ferr-d to the normal scale; and that in dotted line is Langley's
curve (" Phil. Mag.," March, 1883) transferred to our scale, so that
the maxima correspond.          The chain-dotted curve is curve No. VI',
Diagram     II ; but  it must   be borne in mind that the vertical scales
are different, inasmuch as the slits of the thermopile and colli
mator were narrower in the case of the sun than in the case of the
electric light. To make an absolute comparison, the ordinates of
the solar curve must be multiplied by 4-5. It will be seen that,
generally, our curve corresponds          with Langley's, the difference
in position of the maxima and minima being in no case greater
than one-sixth turn of the screw of the thermopile.          His radiation
receiver was so much narrower than ours, that his readings would
show the rises and depressions more exactly.          A comparison of the
curves will show that almost all the atmospheric absorption is
due to watery stuff. The depression shown in Langley's and our
own solar curves at 8660 is not coincident with water.                   His
shows the water-band at 8240 (which is that shown in the photo
graphs), and, no doubt, we missed it owing to the steepness of the
descent from X7900. The dip at 8660 is probably due to a hydro
carbon, to which we will not here refer further in the present com
munication.      We wish to emphasise the fact that the "a" group,
corresponding to X7200, is not due to water as a liquid ; nor when we
look at Diagram I and see the absorption of 2 feet of water, can we
suppose that in the dip from 7300 to 7600 the A line is included.
   Professor Langley in his paper states that the atmospheric absorp
tion in the infra-red of the spectrum is comparatively small, and he
gives a hypothetical thermogram of the extra-atmospheric solar
spectrum in which the maximum energy is in the yellow, and the
energy curve descends steadily on both sides of this maximum. We
do not think our experiments quite confirm his views in this respect.

    We submit that a comparison of the thermograms of the solar
spectrum and those of the electric light points to the conclusion that
 much the greater portion of the absorption in the infra-red of the
 former is due to the presence of water-stuff. In the case of the
electric light it will be seen how large a proportion of the energy is
absorbed by even   If   inches of water, especially between X10,000 and
X21,000.    If water in the state of vapour, as we believe to be. the
case, absorbs as  much energy as the same amount in a liquid state,
the sun's rays are absorbed to at least a corresponding ext-nt in
passing through our atmosphere, which must, we believe, always con
tain more than an equivalent of    If inches of water.
   Now Langley's normal solar curve may be considered representa
tive of a thermogram taken under the most favourable conditions
for dryness of atmosphere, and it cannot be supposed, even under
these circnmstaDces, that between the spectroscope        and the solar
atmosphere there could have been less than ^ inch of water (or its
equivalent in vapour), judging by the depression in it. Fig. 2,
Diagram IV, shows the general form of his curve corrected for the
absorption due to   |  inch of water ; from which it appears that there
must be a large proportion of energy emanating from a source of com
paratively low temperature.
   The prismatic thermogram of the spectrum from a source haviog a

 single temperature appears to be one having a sharply-defined maxi
 mum (see Diagram V).         Curve A is the curve of the crater of the
electric light, Curve B is that of an incandescent light produced with
thirty-eight Grove's cells, and Curve C that produced by thirty
Grove's cells ; the same lamp being used in both cases.         The current
used was 2'25 amperes and the electromotive          force 5'1 volts in the
last case, and in the former 2-95 amperes and 6-3 volts.        (The deflec
tions of the galvanometer attached to the thermopile, due to the naked
lights, in the two cases were as 105 to 207.)      The thermogram from
a source of mixed temperatures        would be the integration of those
from each temperature separately.        In illustration of this we have
taken the three thermograms just mentioned, and transformed them
(see Diagram VI) to the normal scale of wave-lengths, the ordinates
of B being exaggerated four times, and those of C eight times. Curve
D is formed by making the ordinates the mean between those of A
and B, and the ordinates of E are the sums of those of D and C.
Thus E would represent the thermogram of a source composed of
the temperature of the positive pole of an arc lamp, an incandescent
lamp worked by thirty-eight cells and one worked by thirty cells, in
the proportion of 1, 4, and 16.      In these last two curves, there is a
lump, so to speak, which corresponds approximately in position to that
 shown in Langley's solar curve as corrected for £ inch of water (see
 fig. 2, Diagram IV), indicating the presence of energy due to a low
 temperature source or sources.     The mottling on the sun's disk when
 seen in a telescope makes it evident that at its visible surface there is
 a considerable   range of temperature, and we have evidence of eclipse
 observations that outside its ordinarily visible surface          there is
 much matter at a still lower temperature which is competent to produce
 a continuous       solar spectrum.   With these amongst other facts
 before us, we are disposed to doubt whether the extra-atmospheric
 spectrum of the sun would give such a simple thermogram as
 Professor Langley has suggested, and whether the maximum energy
 would be found in the position in which he places it. We believe
 that the curve would have a form rather more allied to our Curve E.
     At first sight it might appear hopeless to try and affix an approxi
 mate value to any solar temperatures,       but we think that it is not
 impossible to determine with some approach to probability the maxi
  mum temperature to which any compound curve is partially due,
  more particularly when, as in the case before us, the general form of
  the corrected curve indicates an excess in quantity of low temperature.
  From an inspection of the curves in Diagram V it appears that for
  any temperature higher than that of Curve A the position of the
  maximum will be but very slightly shifted towards the more refrangi
   ble end of the spectrum, also that the general form of the curve must
   be similar to that of A, and that the areas within the curves, which
                                                               z 2

are measures of energy, will be very nearly proportional to the
ordinates of the maximum or to ordinates not far from them on the
more refrangible side.
    Now the part- of the spectrum which suffers least absorption by water,
and which in the solar spectrum is free from any very intense Fraun-
hofer lines, is near 4 on the prismatic scale. It has been shown by
Dewar,* and he deduced the same from Rosetti's formula, that the
temperature of the source is nearly proportional to the square root of
the total radiation, or, in other words, of the area of the thermogram
curve. The incandescent lamp worked by thirty cells had approximately
a temperature of 1,100°, and the same when worked by thirty-eight
cells of 1,500°, and the areas of the curves in the two cases are
as 106"4 to 50"4, and the galvanometer deflections when compared
together, as already stated, as 105 to 207, or about two to one in
both cases.         This would give about the temperatnres above stated,
taking either one as correct. The area of the curve of the crater is
very nearly sixteen times that of the thirty-eight cell curve, or the
temperature of the crater, using Dewar's formula, would be about
6,000°, a temperature corresponding to that obtained by him.
  "
    We have already shown at what point of the solar spectrum aqueous
absorption has least effect, and if we may calculate from this the
probable area of the curve of maximum temperature.                    In our pris
matic solar thermogram the scale of the ordinates is 4"5 times the
scale of the crater thermogram, but the ordinates of the point of the
spectrum above referred to are nearly equal. Hence the highest solar
temperature would be ^45 X 6000°, or about 12,700°, using the same
relations of temperature and radiation.f           Taking, however, the square
root of the whole area of the solar curve, as would be the case when
direct and not spectrum measurements were made, we should get a
temperature of about ^2 -5 times that of the crater, or 9,600°, a tem
perature also very similar to that obtained by Dewar under the condi
tions specified.
    In conclusion we say, 1st, that the thermopile experiments have
confirmed our previous views as to the coincidence of the absorptions
by water and those shown in the solar spectrum; 2nd, that the
 extension of the work beyond our previous point emphasises them ;
 3rd, that the highest temperature of the sun is not less than 12,700°,
 a temperature far higher than that which has been recently put forward
 by Sir W. Siemens ; 4th, that the existence of a large quantity of solar
 radiation due to low temperature has been shown to be more than
 probable.

      Received June 11, 1883.
                                 (Abstract.)
   In  a  former paper ("Phil. Trans.," Part II, 1859) the authors had
given the actual weights, and the percentage proportion in the entire
body, of the individual organs, and of certain             more arbitrarily
separated parts, of 326 animals     — oxen, sheep, and pigs — in different
conditions as to age, maturity, fatness, &c. They called particular
attention to the wide difference in the proportion by weight of the
stomachs and intestines in the three descriptions of animal ; 8he pro
portion of stomach and contents being very much the highest in oxen,
considerably less in sheep, and little more than one-tenth as much in
pigs as in oxen. On the other hand, the intestines and contents con
tributed a less proportion to the weight of the body in oxen than in
either sheep or pigs ; the percentage by weight in pigs being nearly
twice as high as in sheep, and more than twice as high as in oxen.
With these very characteristic differences in the proportion of the
receptacles and first laboratories of the food, the other internal organs
collectively, as also the blood, contributed a pretty equal proportion
by weight of the entire body, in the three descriptions of animal.
   Ten animals had been selected for the determination of the chemical
composition, namely — a fat calf, a half-fat ox, and a fat ox ; a fat
lamb, a store sheep, a half -fat sheep, a fat sheep, and a very fat sheep ;
a store pig, and a fat pig. In these, in the collective carcass parts, in
the collective offal parts, and in the entire bodies, the total nitrogenous
substance, the total fat, the total mineral matter, the total dry sub
stance, and the water, were determined      ; and the results were recorded
and discussed in detail.
   It was shown that, as the animal fattened, the percentage of nitro
genous substance decreased considerably, whilst that of the fat and of
the total dry matter increased in a much greater degree.              It was
estimated that the portions of well fattened animals which would be
consumed      as human food would contain three, four, and even more
times as much fat as dry nitrogenous substance ; and comparing sach
animal food with wheat-flour bread, it was concluded that, taking into
consideration the much higher capacity for oxidation of a given weight

  1883.]                 Composition  of Animal Food.                   343
of fat than of starch, such animal food contributed a much higher
 proportion of non-nitrogenous substance, reckoned as starch, to one of
nitrogenous substance than bread. In fact the introduction of our
staple animal foods, to supplement our otherwise mainly farinaceous
diet, did not increase, but reduced, the relation of the flesh-forming
material to the respiratory and fat-forming capacity of the food.
    Finally, the actual amount, and the percentage, of total ash, in most
of the internal organs, and some other separated parts, were given. It
was shown that the percentage of total mineral matter, like that
of the nitrogenous substance, decreased, not only in the entire body,
but especially in the collective carcass parts, as the animals matured.
It was the object of the present communication to record the results of
the complete analysis of the ashes of the collective carcass parts, of the
collective offal parts, and of all parts, of each of the ten animals.
Forty complete ash analyses had been made.
    As was to be expected, more than four-fifths of the ashes consisted
of phosphoric acid, lime, and magnesia ; these making up the largest
amount in the ash of the oxen, less in that of sheep, and less still in
that of pigs.       Potash and soda were also prominent constituents.
Assuming, for the purposes of illustration merely, that one of phos
phoric acid was combined with three of fixed base, the ashes of the
 ruminants showed an excess of base ; whereas, according to the same
 mode of calculation, the ashes of the pigs showed no such excess.
    It was, unfortunately, only in the case of the offal parts of the pigs
 that the ash of the chiefly bony, and that of the chiefly soft parts, had
 been analysed separately.       The results showed a considerable excess
 of acid, especially phosphoric, in the ash of the non-bony portions ;
 presumably, in part at any rate, due to the oxidation of phosphorus
 in the incineration.     In further reference to the point in question, it
 may be stated that although the oxen and sheep show a higher per
 centage of total nitrogenous substance than the pigs, yet the amount
 of pure ash yielded from the non-bony parts is higher in proportion
 to that from the bones in the case of the pigs than in that of the
 ruminants.
    Comparing the percentage composition of the ashes of the entire
 bodies of the different animals, the chief points of distinction were that
  — in the ash of the
                         pigs there is a lower percentage of lime, and a
  higher percentage of potash and soda, than in the corresponding ash of
  the ruminants ; there is a somewhat higher percentage of phosphoric
  acid in the ash   of the pigs and of the oxen than in that of the sheep ;
  and there  is a higher percentage of sulphuric acid (and somewhat of
  chlorine also) in the ash of the pigs than in that of the other animals.
     A table showing the quantities of total ash, and of each individual
  mineral constituent, in each of the ten animals analysed was given.
  Not much stress was laid on the amounts in the particular animals

analysed   ;   as the actual weights and condition of animals coming           under
  similar designations may vary considerably.
     It was of more interest to consider the amounts of the mineral
  constituents in carcass parts, in offal parts, and in all parts, per 1,000 lbs.
  fasted live-weight, of each description of animal.
     It was shown that a given live-weight of oxen carried off much
 more mineral matter than the same weight of sheep, and                    a
                                                                           given
 weight    of sheep  much   more   than   the  same   weight   of  pigs. With
 each description of animal the amounts of phosphoric acid, lime- aid
 magnesia, are less in a given live-weight of the fatter than                  of
                                                                              the
 comparable leaner individuals.      Of both potash and soda, again, the
 quantity  is  less in  a given live-weight of the fatter animals. The
 same may be said of the sulphuric acid and the chlorine             ;in fact,       ia
 a greater or less degree, of every one of the mineral constituents.
    It was estimated that the loss to the farm of mineral constituents
 by the production and sale of mere fattening increase was very small
 It was greater of course in the case of growing than of only fatten
 ing animals. In illustration, the amounts of some of the most impor
 tant mineral constituents removed annually from an acre of fan-
 average pasture and arable land in various products were compared.
 Such estimates could obviously be only approximate, and the quantit-s
 will vary considerably. With this reservation,          itmay be stated that,
of phosphoric acid, an acre would lose more in milk, and four or five
times as much in wheat or barley grain, or in hay, as in the fattening-
increase of oxen or sheep.      Of lime, the land would lose about twice
as much in the animal increase as in milk, or in wbeat or barley
grain but perhaps not more than one-tenth as much as in hay.
      ;                                                                             Of
potash, again, an acre would yield only            afraction of     a pound         in
animal increase, six or eight times as much in milk, twenty or thirty
times as much in wheat or barley grain, and more than 100 times aa
much in hay.
    From the point of view of the physiologist,         would doubtless have
                                                       it
been desirable that the selection of parts for the preparation and
analysis of the ash should have been different, and more detailed.
The agricultural aspects of the subject had, however, necessarily
influenced the course of the inquiry       ;and the extent of the essential
work had enforced the limitation which had been adopted. The
results must be accepted as     a substantial contribution to the chemical
statistics of the feeding of the animals of the farm for human food.

    This paper contains an account of experiments made with the view
of    determining the solubility of salts in water at temperatures abov-
the boiling point of water.         They were originally undertaken with the
object   of   further  investigating the anomalies presented by sulphate of
soda, but the method adopted was afterwards applied to many other
metallic salts, and the paper presents an account of determinations so
made, together with a discussion             of the theoretical bearing of the
results.
    The main conclusion arrived at is that solubility is directly related
to   fusibility.     Of the salts operated upon some habitually crystallise
with water       of crystallisation, others habitually    in the anhydrous state.
When the        latter are written down in the order of their melting points,
beginning        with   the most fusible, it is observed that increase of
solubility consequent upon a given rise of temperature above 100° C,
 is greatest in the most fusible, least in the least fusible, and all the
 cases observed follow this rule in regular order.               If the results are
 represented       graphically, taking for abscissae the degrees of tempera
 ture and      for ordin ate 8 the quantity of salt dissolved in 100 parts of
 water, it is at once seen that the higher the melting point the more-
 nearly do the curves so constructed           approach a straight line.        The
 relation is illustrated by the case of the chloride, bromide, and iodide
 of potassium, the solubilities of which at all observed temperatures
 follow the order of the melting points.             Also in comparing together
  two such salts as chlorate and chloride of potassium, the solubilities and

guard-ring pieces. The electrostatic measure- of the capacity was
calculated from the dimensions of this condenser.                The electromag

cation of the method given in § 775 of Maxwell's " Electricity and
Magnetism."        In this method the condenser has to be repeatedly
charged    and   discharged by a commutator, and a very elaborate com
mutator would be required to work the guardrring part of the con
denser ; for this reason the capacity of the guard-ring condenser was
experimentally compared with the capacity of another condenser
without a guard-ring, the capacity of the latter being altered until
the capacities of the two condensers were equal.                 The electromag
netic measure      of   the  capacity    of the    condenser   without    a guard-

        Jacksonian Professor, Cambridge, and Alexander Scott,
        MA.., D.Sc. Received June 21, 1883.
     The conduct    of the experiments relating to a new determination of
 the atomic    weight of manganese recently communicated to the Society*
 has led ns to prosecute some further studies in this field of research.
 The following note deals with the preliminary results arrived at re
 garding the molecular weight of a member of a class of bodies which,
 strange to say, have not been previously selected for accurate determi
 nations of this kind. The substituted ammonias are peculiarly fitted to
 reveal the effect of small differences from whole numbers in the con
joint values of the atomic weights of carbon and hydrogen. By selecting
 tertiary amines of high molecular weight it is possible to integrate
 these small positive or negative increments through the increase in the
 number of carbon and hydrogen atoms in the substituting radical. There
 is also a special advantage in employing the fully saturated ammonium
 derivatives for experiment.         Theoretically it ought to be possible to
 ascertain by this method whether the atomic weight of hydrogen
 differs from unity, provided the atomic weight of carbon be accepted
 as sufficiently well defined, from other methods of investigation.               The
 difficulty  of  getting perfectly pure     substances   for such  work,    together
 with the hygroscopic character of the ammonium compounds, introduces
 serious difficulties, and for the purpose of testing the accuracy of the
 proposed method,        the preliminary experiments       have been made        with
 triethylamine.
     The triethylamine employed was made by the action of chloride of
 ethyl on ammonia, and was transformed into the bromide of tetraethyl-
 ammonium.        This bromide of the fully substituted ammonium was
 decomposed by dry distillation into triethylamine and bromide of
  ethyl, and the base separated in the form of the chloride.               The free
  base was separated from the chloride with caustic potash, and after
  careful drying     with anhydrous oxide of potassium was subjected
  to  fractional   distillation.   The portion boiling between 90° and 91°
  was converted into the hydrobromate and its equivalent relation to

   The effect of the nitrous acid treatment has been to lower the
molecular weight, thus proving the presence of small quantities of
bases derived from more complicated radicals than ethyl, probably
propylamine.

of triethylamine was fractionated with great care, and the por

and lower       molecular weights being revealed by the analysis.         No
doubt,     the amount of this impurity is exceedingly small, but still
sufficient to prevent a definite conclusion being reached as to the
correct value for pure triethylamine.         As Stas's method of titration
is capable of giving concordant results within one ten-thousandth
of the molecular weight, the large variation, amounting to one four
hundred and fortieth of the mean molecular weight of the first and
third sample of the last fractionation, shows that the material is by no
means pure enough for the problem we desire to solve.            At the same
time, the middle and largest portion of the last distillation has probably
a molecular weight very near that of the pure base, and may provi
sionally be accepted.     If the molecular weight of the hydrobromate is
182"012, then the value for triethylammonium is 102-061 ; and if we
subtract from this the value for ammonium found by a similar method
of titration, viz., 184074 (Stas), the resulting number 834987 is the
molecular weight of the hydrocarbon molecule CfiH12.            This value is
probably as accurate a value of the molecular weight of a hydrocarbon
 as has been hitherto determined,         and is sufficient to prove that if
hydrogen has the atomic weight of unity, then carbon is twelve,
 and thus the addition of six atoms of carbon to twelve atoms of
 hydrogen results in a compound the molecular weight of which
 may be expressed as a whole number,             viz., 84, within the limits
 of experimental error.        This value may be due to the summa
 tion of posi8ive and negative variations from the respective values
 of 1 and 12 for hydrogen and carbon required by Prout's law,
  and therefore in itself would not prove anything about the law
  of whole numbers in either atom, unless other methods enabled the
  atomic weight of carbon or hydrogen to be otherwise defined.
  Now the labours of Dumas and Stas have shown that if oxygen is
  taken as 16, then carbon is 12-005, so that the number 834987 for
  C6H12 would necessitate hydrogen being rather less than 1 instead
  of being more,      as generally acknowledged when 0=16 is taken
  as the standard.      Whatever conclusions further investigation may
  induce chemists to adopt, there can be no doubt the present method
  is capable of very great refinement         in the determination of the
  molecular weights of hydrocarbon        radicals,   and when exhaustively
  treated must lead to results of importance.          We intend to continue
  this investigation, employing other bases than triethylamine, and
   trust to reach more definite conclusions by working on material of
   greater purity.   We will leave for future discussion Schiitzenberger's
   investigation on the variability of the atomic weight of carbon, which
   is very far from being confirmed by the method of verification we have
    adopted.

  The author has investigated the following genera —      :
  Rhtncobdellidj;. — Pontobdella, Pisckola, Clepsine, Branchellim.
  Gnathobdellidj;. — Aulostoma, Hcemopis, Hirudo, Hcemadipsa,               St-

  The author gives    abibliography of the most important literature
upon the group since the appearance of Moquin-Tandon's monograph.
           External Characters and Evidences     of   Segmentation.
   The author, in attempting to answer the question —How far           inthe
series of Hirudinean genera     do  external characters express the   meta-
merically segmented nature of their organisation — follows in the
                                                          ?
footsteps of Gratiolet and Vaillant, who have dealt with Hirudo and
Pontobdella respectively in this connexion.        The further question-
How far do such metameres represent the somites of          bristle-bearing
                                                              a
worm — first suggested itself to the mind of De Quatrefages.
      ?
   The author shows that these external evidences of metamerism              in
Pontobdella are most complete, and further that they have a precise
relation to the metamerism expressed by the internal organisation.
The normal somite here presents four annuli of varying size, each
with its special and distinct arrangement of papillae.
   The clitellum involves two reduced somites, each consisting        oftwo
annuli, the generative pores being placed between these respectively.
The nerve-cord exhibits a corresponding condensation in this region.
Twenty somites can be readily distinguished, while posteriorly there
are indications of several others, which       is in accordance with the
existence of twenty-three post-oral ganglia and with Leuckart's obser
vations (Hirudo) upon the condensation of an even greater number             of
primitively separate ganglia in this region.       They are rudiments        of
originally existing somites.
   In Branchellion  it  may be shown that three annuli comprise the
 somite, that in the median region, •while every annulus bears              a
hranchia (lateral appendage), the most anterior annulus of the somite
 bears a vascular dilatation at the base of its branchia.
   Similar dilatations, although in a more rudimentary condition, exist
 in a similar position in Piscicola, Clepsine, and Pontobdella.

     In Sirudo the external evidences of metameric segmentation are not
 so   pronounced, but minute examination shows that point for point
Hirudo agrees almost absolutely with Pontobdella.                     The somite com
prises     five  annuli,   the  clitellum     three  somites,   the   generative pores
being placed in the two more posterior.
    There is an absolute           regularity in the position of the nephridal
pores, these occurring in the posterior annulus of a somite.
    The internal organisation bears the same relation to these external
characters which was stated to obtain in Pontobdella.                      The similar
characters of other genera           are  less fully dealt  with.
    The external characters thus express in the fullest manner th-
metamerically segmented character of the internal organisation, and
these relations are identical throughout the group.

    Cuticle. — This presents similar characters throughout the group.
    Epidermis. — This consists throughout the group of a single layer of
 nucleated cells.        These vary in size in different genera.
    Two varieties        of connective tissue may intrude upon the series of
 epidermic      cells : —
    1.   Pigmented connective tissue cells, and
    2. Capillaries of the vascular system.
    No pigment is ever developed in the epidermic cells themselves, as
 is the case in Peripatus (Balfour). The extent to which this intrusion
 takes place (in respect of the pigmented tissue at any rate) varies
 much in genera and species, and even in individuals.                   In most leeches
 it varies also from point to point, producing the coloured pattern upon
 the surface     of the body.
     The intrusion of capillaries only takes place in the Gnathobdellidae ;
  in the Rhyncobdellidae they stop short of the epidermic series of cells
  or merely     insert themselves between the bases of these cells.
     Two modifications of epidermic cells may take place — *
      1. They may become glandular.
      2.  They may become sensory.

   over the surface       of the body.        They may remain small, and in the
   series    of epidermic      cells not passing below them (Piscicola), or
      *
         The author takes no account here of the origin of the nephridia j they may be,
   however,   glandular modifications of epidermic cells, but if so are much specialised.

 varieties.

 they open directly into its lumen, in the latter their ducts enter into

is   protruded they are much stretched, when withdrawn, thrown into
 folds.

They are exceedingly abundant.         In the Rhyncobdellidae, Pimcth.
 Pontoldella, and Branchellion they occur even far back in the body.
and send their ducts forward in bundles to open upon the surface           of
 the clitellum.
    7. Prostomial Glands.
                            —The author has observed this variety             in
 Hirudo, Auhstoma, Nephelis, and Trocheia.     They form clear content*
and send ducts forwards to open upon the prostomial region. They
occur all round the mouth, but in great number in the prostominm.

whole body in that region, rather than as merely a central region ;

manner in which it protrudes and recedes into a temporary sac

structure of the whole anterior portion of the body in the Gnatho-
bdellidae shows that such is the case.        This can only be made clear
by a series of figures which the author gives.

   Muscles in the walls of the vesicle of the nephridium.
   Muscles developed in the skin.
                    Histological Characters of the Muscles.
   The muscles are formed of elongated cells arranged either in bundles
or  lying singly.
   These cells may be much branched ; such branched cells occur upon
the wall of the alimentary tract, and among the dorso-ventral muscles.
The cells consist of a cortical and medullary substance, greatly
differentiated from one another.       The medullary substance is granular
and   lodges a large oval nucleus in all cases.

   The author has worked out the histology of the connective             sub
stance,  and traced its various metamorphoses throughout the group.
   The matrix consists of a    jelly-like substance, which varies much in
amount in different genera ; its amount determines the "limpness
                                                                          " or
rigidity of the leech.      Hcemopis and Aulostoma, whose bodies are
         "
always limp," possess a great quantity, while Clepsine and Nephelis,
whose bodies are rigid, possess very little.
   In the matrix are embedded indifferent corpuscles.
   The corpuscles undergo certain metamorphoses : —
   1. Entoplastic metamorphosis — the cell preserving a rounded form
— Vacuolated cells — Fat cells.
   A semi-fluid substance accumulates in droplets in the cell, giving it
a reticulately vacuolated appearance ; such cells resemble Waldeyer's
plasma cells.     They are very common in Pontobdella.
   Fat globules also accumulate, and running together form fat cells,
similar in character to the fat cells of Vertebrata.         This occurs in
 Clepsine and Piscicol-a.  This substance formed presents all the cha
 racters and reactions of fat.

    Rounded connective tissue-cells are rare among the Gnathobdel-
lidae, Trocheta being the only genus which presents        such. They
occur in masses, and are also very generally arranged in rows, pro
bably prior to their conversion into botryoidal tissue.
   2. Ectoplastic metamorphosis — the cells forming fibres.
   The cells of most wide-spread occurrence are cells which have elon
gated, and it may be branched and formed fibres.
   It is possible to trace this process ; a slightly irregular cell elon
gates more and more, and its processes become drawn out, so thai
ultimately little cell-substance is left and a long very fine fibre is
produced, the cell all the time doubtless adding to matrix.
  In   Pontobdella   these fibres may become elastic.   They   always    mi
singly.
   3. Ect-entoplastic metamorphosis — the cell developes pigment.
   a. The cells take no part in the formation of a vascular system.
   This series of modifications is well seen in Pontobdella. Indifferent
cells develope pigment ; this may be traced, originating in yonie
animals (recently hatched).
   Such cells either remain rounded or they divide into irregular
groups, and afterwards become much branched.          The process mar
be shortened, the cell branching, and forming pigment simultaneously.
   The rounded cells lie more deeply, the branched cells lie more
superficially, and form the pigment of the dermis.
   p. The cells take part in the formation of a vascular system—
                                    " tissue.
Botryoidal tissue — " Vasofibrous
   A set of modifications similar to those just described takes place,
but intracellular vacuolation taking place at the same time vascular
spaces are formed.    These come in communication with the capillar-s
of the true vascular system on the one hand, and with the sinuses on
the other.
  4.  Entoplastic metamorphosis — Vacuolation to form Capillaries.
   The capillaries of the true vascular system are probably formed by
the vacuolation of indifferent connective tissue cells.
   It may be noticed here that in forms where no canalisation of
                                                                         is pig

                                             always colourless, while
forms with red blood such canalisation of pigmented tissue has
occurred in the formation of the vascular system.

   Blood. — In the Rhyncobdellidae —
   The blood  is colourless.
   Colourless amoeboid corpnscles occur in very large numbers,          but
present no remarkable histological characters.
  In the Gnathobdellidae —
  The blood   is red, the plasma containing dissolved haemoglobin.

1883.]            Contributions to   the   Anatomy of     the   Hirudinea.         355
   Colourless amoeboid cells certainly occur in large numbers.         In
Nephelis and Trocheta these are almost as large as in Pontohdella.
   In Hirudo and Aulostoma these, although not so large, undoubtedly
exist in large numbers, in addition to free nuclei.
   The blood in all the genera coagulates rapidly when withdrawn
from the body, filaments of fibrin or some allied substance can be
seen forming on the slide.
   Blood Spaces. — These belong to two different systems, which arc,
however, in direct communication, there being only one fluid.         The
author shows that one system represents the closed vascular system,
while the other represents ccelom, vessels, and sinuses.
   The vessels may, to a certain extent, be distinguished by their
muscular walls, the walls of the sinuses not being muscular.
   Communications between these two systems of spaces, vessels and
sinuses exist only at certain definite spots, as in the Rhyncobdellidae ;
the vascular dilatations at the sides of the body which are most fully
developed in Branchellion affording means of communication ; or else
the spaces establishing that communication, although very numerous,
have a special mode of formation and a special natnre, such spaces
 constitute bo try oidal tissue (Gnathobdellidae).
   The author describes at length the distribution of the vessels and
sinuses.
  The conclusion                the author has arrived concerning the
                         at which
ccelom in the Hirudinea may be thus summed up : —
  The somewhat scanty embryological evidence which exists upon this
point favours the view that the ccelom developes by a splitting in the
mesoblast ; that it      is,
                      in fact, that modification of an enteroccele which
Professor     Huxley has termed       a    schizoccele.
   This cavity persists to some extent in all the genera, and while                 it
remains most fully developed in the Rhyncobdellidae,        reduced to a
                                                                   it  is
minimum in Nephelis and Trocheta, being then represented only by the
ventral sinus and its immediate branches.
   In the Rhyncobdellidae, at any rate in Clepsine, Pontohdella, and
Branchellion, the ccslomic remnants (sinuses) continue to be lined
with ccelomic epithelium cells. In many places they form      continuous   a
layer, but generally some of them have become free and are to be seen
floating in the blood.  These free ccelomic epithelium cells, which are
much larger than the ordinary blood corpuscles, are only to be seen in
the sinuses they are probably too large to pass through the com
               ;
 municating channels.   In the Gnathobdellidae there no trace of such
                                                                  is
cells.
  A      process has been      taking place, which the author proposes to term
              —     " scattering of the ccelom " — connective tissue
diacoelosis    a                                                     growths
having  more or less completely filled up, the remnants forming the
                                                 it
sinus system.  Different remnants remain in different genera.
                                                                       2   A   2

356                        Mr. A. G. Bourne.                  [June  21,
    The organs which, in animals possessing a well-developed co&lom,
lie within that cc-lom, either get blocked ont by connective tissue
growth or remain enclosed in the remnants.        The same organs but
remain in different remnants in different genera.    No better instance
can be given of this than the varying position of the nepbridial fume]
in Clepsine, Pontobdella, and Hirudo.
    The lumen of the existing ccelom, as above described, comes into
communication with the lumen of a true vascular system, which ws
probably either derived at a very early period from the archaic
enteroccele, or was formed independently by hollowing in connectm
tissue cells.     That the communication between tbe two is of a
secondary nature, and not a persistence of the original commumca-
tion, which must have existed if one developed from the other. is
indicated by the existence of colourless amoeboid cells in the ovarian
sac and around the vas deferens in Hirudo.         These were probaUr
closed at a very early period before the development of haemoglobit
This may have a phylogenetic bearing only, but it may very possibly
be a process which is repeated ontogenetically.
    The development of new ccelomic space (botryoidal tissue) may be
termed psendocoelosis.
    That this new space is   " ccelomic " is amply demonstrated    by the
fact that in its highest development it encloses the nephridial    funnel
 (Nephelis), and, further, that such perinephrostomatous portions of it
may acquire a definite musculature and the "botryoidal
                                                          " cells become
modified to form a secondary ccelomic epithelium. The interpretation
which the author would put upon this process is that an archaic
enteroccele gradually undergoes diacoelosis, being replaced by a pseudo-
coele.    This primary and secondary caelom exist simultaneously side
by side in all existing GnathobdellidiB.
    In the Rhyncobdellidae considerably more of the primary ccbIob
remains, and the secondary coelom has not yet appeared upon the
scene.
                               Nephridia.
     The nephridia are in all cases tubular organs, opening on the one
 hand into the ccelom, and on the other to the exterior.
     The funnel, the opening to the coelom, exists in all the genera,
 although its existence in Hirudo and allied genera has always beet
 denied, but it has long been known to exist in Clepsine, Nephelis, and
 had also been described in Pontobdella.
     The condition of these funnels presents a serial modification. h
  Clepsine and Pontobdella they are fairly simple, but in Nephelis toi
  Trocheta they become drawn out into lobes, and in Hirudo and its
 allies this process has beeti carried to an extreme, the central lumen

 1883.]        Contributions to the Anatomy   of the Hirudinea.       3o7
 has become lost, and the whole has become a many-lobed, ciliated,
 spongy mass.
    Following upon the neck of the funnel is a dilatation into which
 blood corpuscles are carried by the ciliary current. In Hirudo and
 its allies the ciliated mass above described comes to surround this.
    The position of this funnel varies :—
      in Clepsine it opens into the ventral sinus ;
      in Pontobdella into special perinephrostomatous sinuses ;
      in Hirudo and Aulostorna into remnants of a circumtesticular
          sinus;
      in Nephelis and Trocketa into botryoidal spaces (pseudoccelom).
    The portion of the gland which follows upon the funnel exhibits a
 degenerate condition ; this is probably to be accounted for by the fact
that the funnel is gradually losing physiological importance, its
 function in regard to the secretion of nitrogenous waste being taken
on by the blood-vessels.      Those genera in which the funnel remains
best developed exhibit but little capillary development, and vice versa.
    Following upon the degenerate portion or testis lobe is a portion
 with numerous cells containing branched ductules ; these collect
together and a central duct is formed, which after a long and winding
course either opens directly to the exterior (Clepsine), or into a space
which then opens to the exterior.
    The lumen is throughout intracellular in origin.
    This description, excepting as regards the funnel, does not apply to
 Pontobdella or Piscicola.
    The author describes as existing there a most curious network of
tubules, apparently continuous throughout the body and not seg
mented.      These tubules are exceedingly small, and their continuity
is a very difficult point to determine with certainty.
    These tubules are arranged very irregularly, they turn, twist, bend
upon themselves, and anastomose with one another in a most elaborate
manner.      Their walls become very thin at parts, but never present
any opening. The walls present a rod-like structure, such as exists in
the nephridial cells in other genera. The lumen is intracellular, the
c-lls being much branched and very large.
    The author has been unable to trace their connexion with the
funnels, or with a series of very rudimentary vesicles, but such a con
nexion probably exists. The author has also been unable, owing doubt
less to the roughness of the skin, to see the external apertures ; he has,
 however, seen them in Piscicola, where a similar structure obtains.
    The author proposes to reserve any general conclusions as to the
systematic position of the Hirudinea which may       be drawn from these
facts for another communication.

honour to contribute to the Society,t and draws an inference from
the specific heats of different specimens of the metal which       cannot     I

   Professor Reynolds remarks that all the results obtained by Nilsci
and myself tend in one direction, viz., to a considerable, thonra
irregular, rise in the specific heat as the impurities diminish.
   If, however, we compare the three determinations from which this
inference     drawn —

isalso a fall between that of the second and third sample which                                is
proportionally greater that the general rise. In other words, the
irregularity       nearly counterbalances           the regularity.     On     the     other
hand, as   have already stated, my result
           I                               probably slightly too high,
                                                       is

porous metal.   In  Nilson's experiments the metal was enclosed                           in  a

diminished impurities,      hardly appears that the specific heat

Nilson's picked 2 decigrammes, but rather with his first sample, con
taining 13 per cent, of impurities.      Since sending in my paper I have
prepared more that 3 grms. of much purer metal, and can now obtain
any quantity in yields of 3 to 5 decigrammes for each experiment.
The metal is decidedly crystalline in structure, mostly in thin plates
of a high metallic lustre, and of a grayish colour resembling iron.
No accurate analysis of these samples of the metal has been made, as
it has been nearly all used for the attempted preparation of organo-
glucinum compounds.        But in my next contribution to the Society      I
hope  to be  able to give accurate    analyses of several samples.
   I only briefly alluded to the theoretical aspects of the question in
my paper, and do not intend to refer to this until            I  have more
evidence to offer than a determination of the specific heat between 10°
and 100° C. ; but the very remarkable result arrived at by Professor
Hartley from spectroscopic evidence cannot be left unnoticed.          This
chemist concludes from his experiments that glucinum is a dyad
metal, and that its homologues are calcium, strontium, and barium —
elements with which it has not the slightest analogy.         And it seems
strange that Professor Hartley should consider some slight spectro
scopic resemblance between glucinum and the metals of the alkaline
earths to outbalance all the weighty chemical and physical differences
between them.      Glucinum differs strikingly from the metals of the
alkaline earths, both in the free state and combined as oxide, as
hydrate, carbonate,     oxalate, chloride, fluoride, sulphate,      &c.   If
glucinum is really a dyad metal (which may possibly be the case), its
nearest homolognes are decidedly magnesium and zinc ; not calcium,
strontium, and barium.

   The liver of Invertebrates is generally considered             by biologists       to
be nothing more than a pancreas in function, but the observations
         I
which have made seem to me to indicate that it discharges other
functions in addition to the preparation of a digestive ferment. The
colouring-matters fonnd in the bile of Vertebrates do not occur in that
of Invertebrates, with one exception, and that is, haemochromogen in
Astacus JtuvicUilU and in Pulmoniferous Moilusca, for             I have shown in
a former paper* that hwmochromogen is present 'in mammalian bile.
The only observations on the colouring- matters of Invertebrate bile with
which I am acquainted are those of Sorby,t and some casual observa
tions of Krukenberg,J but neither of these observers makes any men
tion of the facts to which I have to call attention. Hoppe-Seyler§
failed to detect bile pigments and bile acids in Invertebrate bile. With
the exception of these three observers, so far as I know, no systematic
examination has been made of the bile and extracts of the liver or
enteric appendages of Invertebrates.
   The animals examined by me were selected from the three sub-
kingdoms Moilusca, Arthropoda, and Echinodermata. Among Vermes
I also examined L8mbricug, Hirudo, and Aphrodite, with a negative result
as regards enterochlorophyll (Lumbricus contains lutein in the wall of
the intestine).      The most striking fact which presents itself in such
examinations as      I  have to record is the wide distribution of one
colouring-matter, which is beyond doubt a chlorophyll pigment, in the
bile of Moilusca and some Arthropoda, and in the appendages of the

 intestine of Echinodermata,           e.g.,   in the radial or pyloric       coeca    of star
 fishes.       As this colouring-matter is always found in the appendages of
 the enteron,       I
              propose the name Enteroehlorophyll for it. Zoochlorophyll
 would be a shorter and more euphonious name, but as chlorophyll has
 been found         in the integument of several Invertebrates, the same name
 would apply to the latter, hence the former is more suitable.
      Ishall take the animals seriatim, and proceed to describe the
 results of my examination, prefacing the observations         with this
 remark — that          I have
                       relied on the spectroscopic and chemical proofs
of the presence of chlorophyll. It is useless to expect that the chloro
phyll in the state in which it occurs should be capable of developing
oxygen in the presence of sunlight in the livers of Mollusca or in the
pyloric coeca of starfishes, &O, so that one iB deprived of the aid of
the test  which is mainly relied upon by recent observers, such as
Professor Lankester*      and Mr. P. Geddes; t but fortunately the
amount of material obtainable       allows one to compare the spectra of
 enteroehlorophyll,  in  different solutions, with those of chlorophyll
 obtained from leaves, and to stndy their respective spectra when the
 colouring-matters are treated by certain reagents. When this is done,
 the conclusion forces itself on one's attention that the enteroehloro
 phyll, obtained from the sources already mentioned, is the same as
 that which occurs in plants ; for when two colouring-matters have the
 same spectrum when dissolved in the same medium, and when their
 respective spectra are altered in the same manner by the same reagent,
 then we may conclude, according to Vogel and Kundt, that the two
colouring-matters    are identical.     The spectrum of chlorophyll, or
rather of the mixture of colouring-matters which compose           namely,       it,

          is

is present in greater or less amount, and that other pigments, such as
lutein or     xanthophyll, may be present.§

shall here give the position in wave-lengths of the bands of an alcoho'
ether extract of leaves of     Primula alone, and treated with nitric acid. I
have chosen the leaves of that plant since various sings and suails, whose
bile spectra will be referred to further on, feed on them.               An alcobo'
ether extract gave four bands.         I did not measure carefully the bands
of the second half of the spectrum, so shall only refer to the bands of
the first half: —
                      1st Band                    X674— 643

                      4th   ,                    X548—530?
   This solution was filtered, evaporated at a gentle heat, and                   the
residue extracted with rectified spirit and filtered.           The solutiou      was
a fine green colour and gave a series of five bands as follows : —
                      1st Band                    X 684— 634

   When this was treated with a couple of drops of nitric acid, the
 preen colour became yellowish, and the bands gave the following
 readings  : —

   In   the case of enterochlorophyll the treatment with nitric acid
generally makes the solution slightly greenish, although previously it
may have been yellow.          I believe this is due to the fact that in the
livers of Mollusca, &c., the pigment is present in a more or less reduced
condition, probaby due to the action of a ferment on the chlorophyll, or
to the fact that it is sometimes preseni in the form of a radical or
chromogen*

    Colouring-matters of Liver of Osti oea Edulis. — The alcoholic extract
 of the liver of Ostroea is a greenish-yellow colour by daylight, and
 more orange-j-ellow by gaslight, and examined in a deep layer gives a
 band in red, which is placed over a shading.               This peculiarity     of a

 dark band superimposed on a shading is noticeable when a crashed
 Hydra viridis is examined         with the microspectroscope,         and the
 same appearance was noticed in the spectrum of a leaf of Anacharis
with which the Hydra was associated.           In a thin layer of the alcohol
extract of the liver of Ostroea another band became detached, covering
F. The first spectrum referred to is mapped in sp. 2. The band in
red extended     from —

and the second     from —
                                   X509— 484.
   When treated with nitric acid the solution became faintly greenish
and then a    doubling of the band in red was seen to have taken place,
the first band faded very qnickly leaving the second, but before it
disappeared the following readings were obtained :—

   These measurements      show beyond all doubt that the liver of Ostroea
contains a colouring-matter    ivhich when treated in alcoholic solution with
nitric acid gives the same spectrum as a similar solution of leaf green
when treated with that reagent; and
                                        therefore the liver of Ostraea contains
chlorophyll.    A microscopic examination         showed that this colouring-
matter as     it occurred   in  the liver was more of an orange-yellow
colour than it is generally seen in molluscan livers, excepting Mytilus
and other Lamellibranchiate Mollusca, which have a marine habitat ;
but it is not due to the presence of parasitic algce.
   Liver of Mytilus edulis. — The liver of this Mollusc contains the same

cernible in a deep layer, while in a shallower depth a third became

    The colouring-matters were seen by the microscope to be deposi8d
 in brown granules, and no parasitic algae could be detected.
    In the yellow ether extract of the liver no band in red could h
 detected, but two feeble bands, one at F, the other between F and G.
 were visible, probably due to the presence of a lutein pigment
 Chloroform extracted no colouring-matter.

in red extended from \678 — 656, but was difficult to read. TFitli
nitric acid the iiqaid became greenish and gave the same series of
 bands as before.

bands    now appeared, which were difficult to read, but the first
extended from \678 — 656, and the fifth probably from X505 to
484 (?)
   In the microspectroscope the bands appeared as shown in sp. 5.
In another specimen of Anodonta an orange-coloured mass was
found in the intestine, which gave two bands like those of reduced
haematin, and a third close before F, the latter extending from X505—
486.
   Liver of Unio. — The appearances coincided with those just given
for Anodonta.
   All the extracts of the livers of the above Lamellibranchiates were
treated with ammonium sulphide with a negative result, and therefore
did not contain haemochromogen.
   The colouring- matter of the liver of Anodonta was partiallr
soluble in ether with a yellow colour, and this solution showed
practically the same spectrum as the alcohol extract.

     Bat    some slight differences were observable in the behaviour of the
colouring matters of this liver towards solvents from those already
 described.        This  I think may be due to the greater abundance of the
 colouring-matters present." Thus an ether solution gave two bands
 in red, and was a greenish-yellow colour. The first band extended
 from X696— 690, the second from X674— 661. The alcoholic solution
 did not seem to be fluorescent. Chloroform extracted some colouring-
 matter of a faint yellow colour, giving bands like those of the ether
 solution, that in red extending from X684 — 661. And a bisulphide of
 carbon solution showed a band in red and one at the blue end of the
  green.      In addition to the two bands mentioned above, the ether
 solution gave three others (as shown in sp. 7), which measured
 as follows : —

      When an alcoholic solution was treated with ammonia the spectrum
 remained unchanged, and caustic soda was similar in its action.
  Sodium amalgam also failed to produce a change. Sulphide of
 ammonium developed no bands, and therefore hromatin was absent.
  I   may here remark that no lutein nor tetronerythrin was found in
 the liver, nor was any found in the integument or elsewhere, an
  observation which is important when one compares these results with
  those obtained in examining the " bile

The partially decomposed liver (which had broken down into a
greenish-white pulp) in another specimen gave four bands when a
strong light was concentrated on its surface, viz., a band in red
covering C, another close before D, one just before E, and the fourth
between b and P. No haematin could be detected.
    ii'ver of Fusus antinuus. — The filtered golden-yellow rectified spirit

liver of Buccinum ; that in red extended from X676 — 660, the nest
X620 — 600, and the third perhaps from X583 — 567. With nitric acid
the solution became greenish and the five bands already referred
to were Been distinctly.         No other pigments were detected.         With
magnesium and acetic acid a negative result was obtained.
   Liver of Purpura lapillus. —The golden-yellow rectified spirit extract
of the liver gave three bands in a deep layer coincident with the
bands of the above alcohol extracts, thus that in red extended from
X678 — 656. And the colour changed to greenish with nitric acid, the
usual series of five bands becoming developed at the same time.
Owing to the presence of the purpurogenous glands* in this mollnsc,

contained apparently only enterochlorophyll.

was a yellow colour, and gave three bands in a deep layer and a
fourth in a shallow depth, which are the same bands seen in other
cases.     The following measurements apply to the spectrum of the
above-mentioned solution : —

    Liver of Helix aspersa. — When the liver and bile of any Pulmonate
Mollusc is examined, except that of Planorbis — so far at least as I
know — a striking difference between them and those of other Molluscs
is apparent, since now for the first time reduced haematin is met
with both in the bile and in the alcohol extract of the liver, accom
panied in most, and probably in all cases, by enterochlorophyll. Dr.

     Colouring-matters          of the so-called Bile of Invertebrates,       fyc.   377
Sorby* was the first who found reduced h<ematin in the bile of Helix
aspersa, as well as in that of Limnaa, Zonites, Limax and Cyclostoma,
he was donbtful as to its occurrence in Testicella, Pupa, and Clausilia.
He also found it in Planorbis corneus in the liver.                I  have found it in
all Pnlmonate molluscan bile which I examined except that of Planorbis,
and as     I  shall have to show further on in the bile of the crayfish. In
fact its presence seems to be dependent on aerial respiration. T)r.
Sorby although he was led to believe that at least two coloured
bodies are present, did not notice the chlorophyll pigment which
accompanies in most, if not in all cases, the hasmochromogen.                        The
spectrum         of  haemochromogen         is    so  peculiar that   it  is not   easily
mistaken for anything else, especially after some practice in this line
of research.           It is interesting that molluscan bile should so closely
 resemble that of Vertebrates in this particular.
     On dissecting fasting specimens of Helix aspersa the intestine in the
 region of the liver is always distended with reddish-brown bile, which
 invariably gives the reduced hsematin bands with ammonium sulphide ;
 even before its addition — if the bile be examined sufficiently quickly —
 they can also be seen.            This bile does not give a play of colours with
  nitric acid, nor does it reduce a solution of cupric hydrate, even after
  previous treatment (boiling) with acetic acid ; it also failed to give
  Pettenkofer's reaction with sugar and sulphuric acid. In some cases
  the chlorophyll band in the red can also bo detected in the bile itself,
  but then its position is modified by the nature of the solvent, for
  instance, in one case, it extended from X690 — 666.                 On treating such
  bile with an aqueous solution of H3S, this band persists and two new
  ones come into viewf if not previously visible, the first from \56845 —
   555, and the second from X539 — 523.                  Caustic soda narrows these
   bands, so also does ammonia.              An acid, such as acetic, causes their
   disappearance, while the band in red still persists.               Before treatment
   with ammonium sulphide, when the haematin bands are visible, they
   are nearer the red end of the spectrum ; thus in one instance the
   first band extended from \576 — 561.                 The bile contains a proteid
   coagulable by. heat; this is interesting when we compare it with hoomo-
    globin.     The bands of reduced haematin in the bile are not always in
    the same position,         for instance,       I  found a specimen of Helix in
    February      which    had  been   fasting     to my knowledge for more than a
    month.       The colour of its bile was almost that of O-hromoglobin, and
    without any treatment whatever             it  showed the bands   : —

 band of enterochlorophyll in other Mollusca, but the colouring-matter
is present in smaller quantity than in those examined supra, and
therefore it is most difficult to measure the bands produc-d by the
action of nitric acid, but they are L believe the same as those already
described.
   Some specimens of Helix asperea kept fasting for six months still
showed in their bile the reduced hxematin bands, and in one specimen
the band in red was still present.        I have now specimens in my
laboratory which have been fasting nine months, and they appear as
vigorous as ever, and a specimen recently examined still contained
reduced haematin. The drawing of the spectrum of the alcoholic
extract of the liver of Helix pomatia will represent that of Helix
aspersa.
   Helix pomatia. — The reddish-brown bile from the intestine close to
the liver showed the presence of reduced haematiu with and without
sulphide of ammonium, of which (with sulphide) the first extended
from X567 — 555, and the second from X536 — 523. The yellow alcohol
extract of two livers showed only the bands of reduced hsematin
with sulphide of ammonium, but in the extract of a third liver the
chlorophyll band in red was discernible (see sp. 91, extending from
X678 — 661.     But the last-named pigment is small in amount, as
denoted by the action of nitric acid, which, although it caused the
hoematin bands to disappear and left that in red, yet did not se-m to
cause the appearance of any others.     The chemical characters of this
bile were the same as those in the case of Helix aspersa.
   Helix citrina. — The yellow alcohol extract of the liver showed the

   Arion ater : Liver and Bile. — Like all the Pulmonate Molluscs
already referred to, the specimens of Arion ater examined were kept
fasting some days, until they ceased to discharge their intestinal
 contents, in order to avoid the source of error arising from the fact
that the intestine ramifies through the liver, and hence an alcohol
extract might contain intestinal chlorophyll from the food.    The bile
is brownish-yellow, and gives generally, without any treatment, the
spectrum of reduced heamatin, which is much more distinct with
ammonium sulphide, the bands reading as follows : —

     The alcohol extract of the liver showed              the presence of reduced
haematin and enterochlorophyll, the bands of the former disappearing
with nitric acid, and that of the lattor remaining, being, however,
brought slightly nearer the violet, as in all other cases.
    In the bile of other specimens the band of enterochlorophyll could
generally be seen, but always those of reduced haematin.
    Li max flavus and other Slugs: Bile and Liver. — In the first speci
men examined the bile contained reduced haematin ; but the alcohol
extract of the liver did not seem to contain much, if any, haematin or
enterochlorophyll, but in other cases it contained both colouring-
matters.          In a specimen of Limax of a dark olive colour on dorsal
surface, with the margin of the foot tinged with orange, the bile gave
the band in red from X681 — 656, and, on adding sulphide of ammo
nium, the bands of reduced haematin, the first from X570 — 558, the
second X539 — 526.              The alcohol extract of the liver also contained
both pigments.                                                      I

one part of the liver only enterochlorophyll, in another part only
reduced haematin was present.               Nitric acid changed the colour of the
extract to greenish, and two of the usual series of bands could be
seen.        In another specimen of the same colour the greenish-yellow
 alcohol filtrate of the liver showed four bands, of which the first two
 belong to chlorophyll, the third to haematin.

     Liver of Planorbis. — The specimens had been kept in clean water,
  free from vegetable matter, for a week previous to the examination.
 The livers of five specimens were removed, and, after crushing,
  digested in rectified spirit ; the yellow filtrate gave a band in red
  from X678 — 65845 ; and three others, of which that before D belongs
  to chlorophyll, while the other two were found to be due to traces of
  haemoglobin.         In a thin layer there was a fourth band at F. In the
  united alcohol extracts of ten livers no reduced hssmatin could be
   detected ; but that is no matter for surprise, since Planorbis contains

    Bile of Romans vulgaris. — Only one specimen has been examined.
The brownish bile of neutral reaction, which got darker on exposure
to air, gave a band in red, and an ill-defined band between D and E,

placed in the position of that of Moseley's
former extended from X681— 658 5. The occurrence of th- second
band is interesting, as the same is seen on examining some of the
undissolved pigments in the membrane lining the shell.              There was
also in an aqueous solution of the bile a third band between green
and blue from X507 — 484 (sp. 11).
    When an extract was made of the liver by means of rectified spirit,
the last-mentioned band from X507 — 484 was well seen, and there
 was also a feeble one in red.     Sulphide of ammonium hardly affected
the spectrum ; caustic soda caused the appearance of a band cover
ing D, while that at F seemed to be less distinct; the form-r was
ill-defined, but probably extended from X600 — 576.             When treated
with nitric acid the band at F became better marked, and read
X505 — 484.     Ammonia seemed to cause the disappearance of the same
band ; and that covering D — which was also produced by caustic
soda — again appeared.      Magnesium and acetic acid did not affect the
 band at F, nor did peroxide of hydrogen.
    Cancer pagurus : Liver and Bile. — The yellow bile became orange
 after standing exposed to the air. An aqueous solution gave a
 shading from X516 — 484. No other bands were visible.            An absolute
 alcohol solution of a yellow colour gave a faint band from X509—
 484.    Treated with nitric acid it became greenish, and a shading
 from \.ri09 — 484 was still visible. Caustic potash did not remove
 the latter.   When the liver was allowed to stand twenty-four hours,
 and had become a deeper yellow than before, it yielded its colour
 more readily to absolute alcohol, and this solution gave a band from
 X500 — 480. A chloroformic solution was reddish-yellow, and in this
 two bands were seen, one from X509 — 488, the second X474 — 459,
 the latter fainter than the former ; on evaporation of the chloroform
 an orange-coloured residue was left, which contained oily matter, and
 could not be purified.

       Colouring-matters    of the so-called Bile of  Invertebrates,  $c.    381
     An ether solution was pale yellow and showed two bands, the
first from X498— 480, the second from X466— 450.
     A bisulphide of carbon extract of an orange colonr gave two bands,
the first from X530— 507, the second from X496— 476 (?)              Petroleum
also extracted a little colouring-matter, giving a band from X505 —
434.       Hence the principal colouring-matter present                evidently
belonged to the class of luteins, of which I believe there are more
than one.
     Carcinus maenas : Liver and Bile. — Several specimens of this
Crustacean were examined.           The bile itself, in most cases, only gave
an ill-defined band, between green and blue.           The presence of entero-
chlorophyll was found to be exceptional, and that of lutein or a lutein
pigment constant.          The colour of the liver in different specimens
varies remarkably, thus in some it was yellowish-white, in others,
orange, orange-yellow, &o.          It became almost black on exposure
to the air.       In all of the specimens alcohol, ether, chloroform, and
bisulphide of carbon extracted the colouring-matter, giving bands in
the blue end of the spectrum, which seemed to be due to lutein as
already stated, and I believe a similar pigment occurs in the coloured
 membrane lining the shell, while in some cases tetronerythrin was
 also present.
     In some alcohol solutions two enterochlorophyll bands were visible,
 the first from X670— 651, the second from XG12— 592 ; with a little
 nitric acid the colonr became slightly greenish.             In most cases a
 band was visible in the same solution from X505 — 484.
      Ether solutions showed the presence of two well-marked bands,
 the first from X498— 480, the second            X463— 448.      A bisulphide
 solution was orange-red, and gave two bands ; the first from X530 —
 507, the second from X496— 476.
      Pagurus bernhardus. — The brown-yellow bile of three specimens
  gave the band of enterochlorophyll in red, and a shading including
  li and P.     The pale-yellow alcohol extract gave the same bands. The
  solution was too dilute to give a satisfactory result with nitric acid.
   (Sp. 12.)
      Aslacus fluviatilis. — While none of the above Crustaceans showed
   the slightest evidence of the presence of haematin in their bile, or in
   t ie alcoholic extracts of their livers, the crayfish contains it in con
   siderable amount.       So far as  I know this has not been discovered
   before.    The brownish-yellow liquid which exudes from the liver
   gave a faint band between D and E, and a dark one between 6 and F,
   measuring X515 —488, and on adding sulphide of ammonium                   two
   bands appeared which are those of reduced haematin.            In the bile of
    some specimens examined the first reduced haematin band appeared
   without any treatment whatever ; both were strongly intensified by
    caustic soda, as was found to be the case in the Pulmonate Mollusca.

It  was difficult to get the reading of the second haematin band, but the
first extended from \56845 — 559"5 ;* the band at F after dilution with
water seemed to extend from X509 — 484. On exposure to the air
the haematin bands faded away, but were again brought bach with
sulphide of ammonium, more distinctly than before.                  (Sp. 13.) An
alcohol extract      of  the  liver  showed    only   some  shading    at F, and no
band could be seen       in red, either before or after the addition of nitric
acid.
                                 ECHINODEbMATA.
   In this sub-kingdom         I have as yet only examined starfishes and
specimens      of Echinus.
    Uraster rubeus. — The radial, pyloric, or arborescent coeca of starfishes
are supposed, I believe, by some to function as a " liver," whil- others
suppose they are of respiratory significance.                  According to the
following observations they do function as the so-called liver of other
invertebrate animals, i.e., they — in addition to their probable use in
preparing a digestive ferment — serve as organs for the storing, and
probably the actual production, of pigments for surface coloration.
This at least is the conclusion which spectroscopic study of their
colouring-matters suggests.
   In different specimens pigments of a different character occur which
seem to have a close connexion with those of the integument.
   The alcohol extract of the radial coeca of one specimen (the int-gu
ment of which had a red colour, and which was found to be due mainly
to tetronerythrin with probably a small amount of a pigment giving
the spectrum and having the negative insoluble characters of Moseley's
actiniochrome) was after filtrati6n a fine orange colour, and showed
the peculiar absorptive property of tetronerythrin.f
    Another specimen had brown radial coeca interspersed with green,
the alcohol extract was yellow and gave a band in red and one just
 before D ; the first extended from X666 — 639, and therefore was
slightly nearer the violet end of the spectrum than in the case of the
enterochlorophyll of other invertebrate animals already referr-d to.
The whole of the violet end of the spectrum was shaded up to three-
fourths the distance from D to E. The latter shading was cleared up
by nitric acid which did not remove the other bands.J                 In a shallow

by means of the chemical spectroscope it was well seen in the microspectroscope.

 depth       of alcoholic solution    a band became detached      at F, which on
 adding caustic soda was slightly         narrowed,  and read from X509 —490.
The ether solution gave similar bands, but in addition it appeared to
contain a lutein pigment, as two bands could be seen in the blue and
violet, the       first from X498 — 480, the second from X466 — 450. Of
course in this and other cases the possibility of the presence of a
xanthophyll must not be lost sight of, but in the present stage of the
inquiry        I  believe these bands are due to lutein. A chloroform
solution showed the chlorophyll bands like the other solutions, and
also two others, of which one extended from X509 — 488, the other
X474        456 (?)      Another brown specimen of Uraster contained green
ececa, and the alcoholic extract of these gave the chlorophyll bands
 (see 14th sp.), four in number,              of which the following are the
measurements          : —

      Caustic soda changed the spectrum of an alcoholic solution in a
  remarkable manner, for while the band in red remained as before,
  that before D became replaced by two narrow bands.                  They gave
  the following readings : —

      Only one of the feeble bands referred to above is accounted for, as
   the other faded away.         The solution assumed a yellow colour at the
   same   time.
      An alcoholic solution of orange-coloured cceca gave a band in red
   from X670 — 656, and a similar solution of green-brown cceca gave
   the same band,         the latter also formed an orange solution with
    chloroform which gave two bands, one from X507 — 486, the other
    from X474 —456.         In both cases a considerable portion of the blue

end of the      spectrum     was absorbed,      probably from the presence        of
tetronerythrin.

yellow colour, which showed a band from X678 — 651 (which readin?
approaches nearer to that of the enterochlorophyll of Mollnsca and
Crustacea.) When an alcoholic solution of green caeca was evaporated
on the water bath, a sap-green residue was left, which was oak
partially soluble in chloroform, a dirty green-brown residne hem?
left still undissolved.       The chloroform solution gave four bands : —

    On adding nitric acid the nsual five-banded spectrum of acid
 enterochlorophyll appeared.           The orange colour of this solution was
 no doubt due to the presence of tetronerythrin, to which the integu
 ment seems to owe its colour.
    Echinus esculent us. f — The brown colouring-matter adhering to the
 outside of the intestine and madreporic canal yielded its colouring-

 band in red and also that before D, and a third feeble one before E.
 In a specimen of Echinus which had greenish- white spines, th- peri
 visceral cavity contained a large quantity of a brownish mass which
 when dissolved in alcohol formed a brownish-yellow solution, which
 presented a well-marked enterochlorophyll spectrum with the following

     Nitric acid turned this extract greenish and the usual five-banded
  spectrum was seen.
     The alcoholic solution fluoresced red. There is reason to suppose
 that a similar colouring-matter exists on the outside of the shell,
 which can be extracted with chloroform.                        There is also another
 colouring-matter          in the perivisceral fluid, which I have described
 in a paper read before the Birmingham Philosophical Society, and to
 which    I  have given the name " Echivochrome."*
     Summary and Remarks. — It is evident that the livers of Mollusca
 and Crustacea, the pyloric cceca of starfishes, and intestinal appen
 dages of Echinus, all contain in greater or less amount a pig
 ment which is undoubtedly chlorophyll.                        If this chlorophyll is
 derived directly from their food, it is strange that it should present
similar characters in animals which feed on plants containing different
 colouring-matters,         and that it should still be found in the bile of
Helix after a six months' fast.
    A microscopic examination of a slug's or suail's liver shows the
presence of a pigment of a yellowish colour, which within the liver-
cells is generally deposited in granules; but there are also bodies
which remind one strongly of unicellular alges, the exact nature
of which        I    have not yet determined.             Whether this chlorophyll
is built up by the animal itself, or whether it is derived                           from
the food directly, still remains doubtful, but its universal distribu
tion and the large amount present in different livers, teach that it
plays an important part in the life of the animal containing it.
Although       I   have failed to change enterochlorophyll into other pig
ments by oxidising and reducing agents, one cannot help supposing
that it does give origin, perhaps under the influence of a ferment, in
the animal's body (liver, &c.), to some other colouring-matter.                      This
view being supported by the fact that one can extract from the
liver colouring-matters which are present with the enterochlorophyll.
Moreover, these colouring-matters are closely related to those of the
integument ;t for instance, in crabs one finds lutein in the "bile"
and lutein in the hypoderm, tetronerythrin in the liver and in the
fy'poderm and shell, and the same pigment in the pyloric coeca of
starfishes and in the integuments                 of the same starfishes ; again,
haematin in the bile of slugs, and h aern at in derivatives in their integu-
   *  In that paper   several integumental and other colouring-matters are described,
which   I  met  with during an examination of the above and other animals. See
"Proc. Birm. Philos. SoO," vol. iii, p. 351, et seq.
   t In the integument of Crustacea (exoskeleton and hypoderm)            I found tetron
erythrin, lutein, and a pigment like Moseley's " actiniochrome ;" in that of slugs a
peculiar haematin derivative ; in that of starfishes   tetronerythrin, a pigment like ac
tiniochrome, and a peculiar haematin      derivative : these  are described in the paper
abore referred   to.   " Proc. Birm. Philos. SoO," vol. iii, 1883.

  ment,    and so   on.     Hence the conclusion follows that the intepa-
 mental colouring-matter          is prepared by the liver, or organ answering
 to the liver.     The next question which suggests itself is this : from
 what constituent in the liver are the pigments built up ?                     I  aa
  inclined to think that tetronerythrin is probably built up from t
 lutein pigment, as they are respectively soluble in the same media.
 and concentrated solutions of both, of sufficient depths, have the same
 peculiar absorptive powers for the violet end of the spectra*.
 Tetronerythrin occurs in abundance, both in the coloured hypodena
 and exoskeleton of Homarus and Cancer pagurus, and lutein it
 present abundantly in their livers ; in Carcmus mamas lutein is present
 in both situations.       Preyer* called attention long ago to the fact that
 the larva of Chirotwmus contains haemoglobin, and yet lives on purely
 vegetable substances ; so also does a sheep, a cow, or any other pureiy
 herbivorous Vertebrate, and yet haemoglobin is manufactured in larp
 quantity in their bodies.f It is likely that the radicals which furnish
 the colouring-matters in the plant would be made use of by the animal,
in the synthetical production of such bodies as haematin or haemo
globin for instance, and just as there is a close relationship between
lutein and tetronerythrin, so there is certainly a close relationship
between lutein and haemoglobin. For instance, in an egg the only
pigment present is lutein, and therefore, if one colouring-matter is
derived from another, the haemoglobin of the chick must be in the
first instance derived from the lutein of the yolk.                Again haemo
globin when extravasated into the ovary, gives rise to a pigment
presenting a close relationship with that of egg-yolk, so much so that
                                                    I
it has been called lutein. For the present may call attention to the
fact that in some cases the simultaneous presence of baemochromogen
and chlorophyll has been demonstrated in the livers of Pulmonate
Mollnsca, and the amount of one seems to depend on tha8 of tbt
other, for instance, when there was much haematin present there was
little chlorophyll, and vice versa ; this would seem to show that the
possibility of the construction of haematin from chlorophyll suggest*
itself, and must not be forgotten.
     Bilirubin is an undoubted haemoglobin derivative (as I shall show
further on), and according to GautierJ its formula approaches that of
chlorophyll very closely ; the body chlorophyllan obtained in crysta8
from an alcoholic solution of chlorophyll gave numbers which led
Gautier to the formula CjgH^NgC^, which is not far removed from thai
of bilirubin, C16H8N2Os.

      Colouring-matters    of the so-called Bile of Invertebrates,         fyc.    387
     The haemochromogen in the crayfish and in Pnlmonate Mollusca is
  beyond   doubt a respiratory pigment, and it seems to me that in
 addition to the respiration in the branchiae of the former and in tlie
 pulmonary chamber of the latter, this pigment enables the animal to
 carry on intestinal respiration, as in certain crabs and Cobitis fossilis.
 Semper* refers    in   a note to  intestinal respiration in Mollusca, which
 from the facts      above narrated I believe to be carried on in the
 intestine of Pulmonates by means of haemochromogen.
     Dr. Sorbyt refers to the importance of the presence of haematin
 from the standpoint of the evolutionist, so that this question need
 not be here discussed.
    In addition to the classes of chlorophyll containing animals men
 tioned by Geddes,    J  namely, those which vegetate by their own intrinsic
                                              " by proxy," so to speak, or by
 chlorophyll and those which vegetate
 means of parasitic algae, a third class must now be added : those
 which   contain enterochlorophyll in their livers, or other appendages
 of the enteron.
                                    Conclusions.
    (1.)  The   existence     of enterochlorophyll in the liver, or other
 appendages of the enteron in Invertebrata, is definitely established.
    (2.) This pigment occurs in greatest abundance in Mollusca, it
occurs less frequently in Arthropoda, and its presence among Vermes
is not proved.
    (3.) The pyloric cceca of starfishes contain it in abundance, also
the intestinal appendage of Echinus, which fact shows that the former
function like the so-called liver of other Invertebrates.
    (4.) The bile of the crayfish and that of Pnlmonate Mollusca con
tains haemochromogen ; in the latter it is generally accompanied by

synthetically formed in the animal's body, but any conclusion of this

support this view.

        II. A     few Observations on Vertebrate            Bile    Pigments.
   In spite of the labours of physiological chemists some erroneous ideas
still prevail as to the colouring-matters of the bile and their spectra.
For instance, one sometimes sees bilirubin described as a greea
pigment ! And in a recently published medical book the author nabs
the strange statement that human bile owes its colour to biliverdis!
Again, the statement is frequently met with that the bile colouring-
matters have no absorption spectra.              So far is this from being tk
case, that the spectroscope is capable of detecting the smallest
quantity of the biliary pigments in pathological liquids; and I hire
repeatedly been able to detect bilirubin and biliverdin in pus, urine,
and other liquids, by its help.
                           I
   In former papers* endeavoured to show how the urinary colour-
 ing-matters can be prepared artificially from those of the bile Ma
from haematin; and          I   demonstrated     the presence of a colourinj-
matter indistinguishable from urobilin in mammalian bile.                   But, like
others, I failed to prepare either bilirubin or biliverdin from htemo-
glol in or its decomposition products, although the presence of haemo-
chromngen could be detected in human and sheep bile.                    I have sines
been helped in the matter by an experiment which took place under
pathological conditions, and which proves beyond donbt that the
transformation may yet be accomplished out of the body.
   I  have also to call attention to the fact that in sheep and ox bile the
principal colouring-matter is not biliverdin ; for although I have
already shown that the body giving the peculiar series of bands i;
probably, in fact undoubtedly, a partly haematin derivative,              I  had not
studied fully its spectrum nor the best method of procuring it for spec
troscopic study.       I have also made a few observations on stercobilin
and on urobilin, prepared by sodium amalgam from bilirubin, whieb
show that the conclusion is rather premature that the pigment knoTt
as febrile urobilin is identical with either, as I had already inferred.
    Spectra of Bilirubin, Biliverdin, Bilifuscin, Bilihumin,              and Bili-
prasin.  —   Bilirubin  possesses   a peculiar  absorptive    power   for the violet
end of the spectrum, and in concentrated solution it absorbs all this
end up to D. Dr. Quinlanf proposes that this property should be
made use of for the detection of bilirubin in urine.               The very abrupt
character of the edge of the shading is quite peculiar.                        It re
sembles in this respect solutions of tetronerythrin and concentrated
 solutions of lutein, especially of egg-yolk. The red coloration pro-

duced  in urine by boiling with hydrochloric acid has a similar absorp
tive power for the violet and blue.   It is certainly worthy of remark
that chlorophyll in plants, and haemoglobin, tetronerythrin, lutein,
and    bilirubin in animals, should have this property.
    Biliverdin has mnch the same optical characters as bilirubin, except
 that more green is transmitted.
    The brownish-green alcoholic solution of biliprasin was found to
 absorb in a deep layer the spectrum up to three-fourths the distance
 from D to E, but the edge of the shading was not abrupt, bnt
 gradually shaded off towards red.          It gave the spectrum of Gmelin's
 reaction when treated with nitric acid ; and with caustic soda a
 peculiar shading or feeble band became detached, placed midway
 between D and E.         The yellow-brown alcoholic solution of bilifuscin
 gave a similar spectrum, and behaved similarly as regards spectrum
 with nitric acid and with caustic soda.
    Bilihumin when dissolved in alcohol formed a dirty brownish-green
 solution, which had the same optical properties as the last two
 colouring- matters.      It became yellow-brown with caustic soda, and
 gave   the  band  already described.    It also gave Gmelin's reaction.
    Bite Spectra of various Animals.    —  I have already drawn attention to
 the peculiar series of bands seen in the bile of certain animals, and
 shown that they are probably due to the presence of altered haematins.*
 I have examined since then the bile of the tortoise, mud turtle,
 common ringed suake, and cormorant, but could detect no bands.
 During hibernation no urobilin could be detected in the bite of the reptiles.
 I have succeeded in detecting this colouring- matter in the alcoholic
 extract of the liver of Salamandra maculata in greater quantity than
 can be accounted for on the supposition that it was present in the
 blood-vessels of the liver, and this indicates that urobilin is probably
formed in that organ.        I shall show further on there are reasons for
 supposing    that   the  hydrobilirubin in the intestine differs somewhat
 from the urobilins of urine.        In the liver of the toad, frog, newt,
 tortoise, ringed suake, and mud turtle, as well as in that of the pig,
 cat. guinea-pig, rabbit, and man, I can find no urobilin in the alcohol
 extract, probably for the same reasons that other chemical compounds
 which are known to be formed in that organ cannot be detected in its
 extract, namely, that they are removed as soon as formed.f              The
 alcohol extract of the above-mentioned          livers generally showed the
 lutein spectrum.       In the alcohol extract of the liver of a little fish,
 which I believe was Blennius phohs, abundance of tetronerytherin was

It is a very interesting fact that the bile of Pulmonale Mollusca and of Antaeus f.

                    as
and other fishes,   it is not impossible that in some fishes the liver may
function in a similar manner to that of Invertebrates, and serve as a
 pigment-storing organ for surface coloration.
    Detection of Bilirubin, $•<;., in Exudations. — The peculiar series of
 bands, and the way in which they appear and disappear when sols-
 tions of the bile-pigments are treated with nitric acid, serve as accu
 rately for their detection as can be wished.               In a former paper I
 showed the effect of chlorine       in  traces on such a solution, and                  tie
 description of the spectrum thereby produced applies to GmebYs
 reaction.   A band appears before D, then one after D, and one                     at   F;
the second one fades away first, followed by that before D, and that                     at
F    isleft. This finally also disappears.          No other animal co/oxnW
matter behaves in this manner, hence thio test          isconclusive. In apply
ing   itthe colouring-matters should,        ifpossible, be got into solutionis
alcohol or chloroform, and the nitric acid added to the solution.            Care
is  necessary  in  the case  of  the   alcoholic    solution,  and  it should             be
diluted sufficiently with water before adding the acid.

statements of physiological chemists as to the identity of haematoidin
and bilirubin probably arose from the fact that deposits of blood
colouring-matter, undergoing all stages of decomposition, have been
included under that name.         The evidence for the identity         given is          by

have already shown that the same pigments can be formed from haemo-
globin and bilirubin, but an actual proof of the transformation                           of
haemoglobin into biliverdin has not, 8so far as         I   know, been brought
forward until now.
    The liquid* in which the biliverdin was detected had been removed
 by tapping from the tunica vaginalis             testis of a case of chronic
 epididymitis.    Six  months   before    the  specimen was removed the ¦(

 the albumen without altering the colouring-matter, and then extract
 the latter.   The liquid showed, however, without any treatment, the
 presence of a haemoglobin derivative, which was proved by appropriate
tests to be a body intermediate between methaemoglobin and haematin;
it also absorbed strongly the violet end of the spectrum. The albumen

and the spectrum of Gmelin's reaction could be made out easily. It                          is
a  well-known fact that nitric acid will lead to erroneous conclusions
when added to an alcoholic solution of bile-pigments, but the spectro
scope always shows whether the colour reaction           due to bile-pigment

that the pigment present conld have been nothing else but biliverdin.
     In this case no jaundice was present and the only source from
which the biliverdin could have been derived was haemoglobin, which
was first converted into metheamoglobin, then into the pigment inter
mediate between that and haematin, and finally into biliverdin.          This
transformation was probably one of gradual oxidation, assisted by the
action of a ferment, which         doubtless present in hydrocele liquid.

the same bands, but in an alcoholic solution of febrile urobilin tkey art

     I have isolated febrile urobilin several times, and find its spectra
 coincide with those previously described,* and that the two bands De&r
 D are as much part of the spectrum as that at F. So-called indigo-

 green sbeep bile in a thickness of 18 millims. was placed before the
 slit of the spectroscope (one-prism chemical), the spectrum was
absorbed at one end at \744 completely, at the other at X534 ; the
 shading was continued for some slight distance over the visible spec
 trum ; between these points three bands were visible, viz. : —

which had the same position.f              Absolute alcohol was now added to
both specimens of bile, and they were then filtered.
    The ox bile filtrate appeared to have a slightly red fluorescence ; it
had a red colour (by gaslight it was dichroic, vide ivfra), and gave
four bands     as follows : —

    Colouring-matters         of  the   so-called Bile     of Invertebrates,   fyc.  393
   This solution looked greenish on a white dish, and after evaporation
over the water-bath left a residue of a peculiar colour, a kind of
mixture of green, brown, and red.                   It was soluble in alcohol, giving
the spectrum already described (and the dichroism) ; but a portion
remained undissolved, which had a lavender colour and dissolved in
chloroform, forming a rose-red solution (gaslight, green by daylight),
giving the same spectrum as the former chloroformic solution.                       Both
nitric and hydrochloric acid developed bands in this chloroformic
solution, somewhat like those of sulphate of cruentine or acid hremato-
porphyrin, but having different measurements and peculiarities of
shading.      The colouring-matter of ox bile is also soluble in ether, and
this gives the same series of bands as an alcohol or chloroform
solution.
   A chloroformic solution of             sheep bile showed in addition the band
of  urobilin from X502 — 482.
   Several experiments were made on these colouring-matters, but as
my object is merely to show that : (1) chlorophyll as such cannot be
present in sheep bile, since the band in red is in an entirely different
position ; and (2) to compare the spectrum of sheep and ox bile with
that of Gmelin's reaction,            I  will not here give further details, espe
cially as   I hope to study the relationship of these colouring-matters to
thoso of various decomposition                products of haemoglobin and chloro
phyll at some future time.
   If chlorophyll were present, not only would the band mentioned
above have been nearer the red, but the spectrum of acid chlorophyll
should have been got with nitric acid, which was not the case.                      With
regard to the spectrum of ox bile, Hoppe-Seyler* makes a statement
which cannot now be accepted.                     After describing the spectrum of
ox bile, he says that the same body can be got by the oxidation of
bilirubin, biliverdin, or bilifuscin, with nitric acid or bromine- water,
when these are made to act on chloroformic solutions.                     According to
 my   observations,      a  body   of   totally   different   spectrum appearances is
 produced under these circumstances.                      Thus, if the bilicijanin of
 Heynsius      and   Campbellt (which according to Hoppe is identical
 with the sheep bile pigment, and which gives the bands before
 and after D) be prepared according to the following method, which
 I find answers for the purpose, a different conclusion is arrived at.
 An aqueous alkaline solution of bilirubin was treated with nitric
 acid until the black band was seen at F ; it was then quickly poured
 into a separating funnel, diluted with water and shaken with chloro-

 and ox bile is partly a haematin derivative, and it does present some likeness to
 chlorophyll. It may possibly be a mixture of derivatives of both.           I hope to in
 vestigate this shortly.

dissolved in alcohol, formed a fine blue solution, giving a band before

   If these measurements are compared with those of the bands of a
similar solution of ox or sheep bile colouring-matter a wide difference
is apparent.      Hence the pigments of sheep or ox bile and that pro
duced from bilirubin by oxidising agents are not the same.
   Another spectrum can be got by acting on bilirubin in alkaline
aqueous solution with potassium permanganate ; by cautions addition
of this reagent a band appears in the space between D and E, and
touching the latter line ; but on adding more permanganate it dis
appears and a green solution is formed, which is merely due to the
action of the caustic soda, used in dissolving the bilirubin, on the
permanganate.
              III.    On  some    Unusual     Urine Pigments,    <fec.
   In former     papers    I  have described four pigments, namely, febrUt
urobilin, normal urobilin, urohcematin, and urolutein.           I  have here to
refer to the spectroscopic detection of indiean in urine, to uroerythrin,
and to a peculiar colouring-matter met with in pale urine.             I am more
convinced than ever that only by the use of the spectroscope can
these pigments be distinguished from each other; and the condition
of the first three furnishes one with an exact test of the amount of the
metabolism of haemoglobin, and of the oxidation or reduction going
on in the organism.         I  have first to refer to some matters bearing on
former results.
    The Spectrum of Febrile Urobilin. — I have made measurements of
the bands of solutions of this pigment, as those in my first paperf
were not made with the help of the more exact method of measuring
now at my disposal.       J    The pigment was obtained by means of the
method described in former papers.

   This with caustic soda gave two bands           : the first from X583 — 561,
and second, X521 — 507.
   In   a deep     layer of an aqueous solution a faint shadow could be
seen   covering D ; by treatment of this aqueous solution with perman
ganate of potassium, this shadow could be made to disappear ; that at
F was narrowed, became hazy, and finally disappeared.                So that just
as normal urobilin can be reduced back to febrile urobilin, as I formerly
Bhowed, so can febrile be oxidised into normal urobilin.
   By acting on an alcoholic solution with caustic soda no bands at C and
D in the "position of those obtained in a similar solution of hydrobilirubin
artificially prepared, or in a similar solution of stercobilin, could be seen.
Hence febrile urobilin is not identical, as previously stated (supra),
with hydrobilirubin or with stercobilin. If it is derived from sterco
bilin, it has undergone some change before its excretion in the urine.
   Dr. Harley's TJrohmmatin. — I have repeated Dr. Harley's experi
ments on
                " urohaematin "* and find not only is his pigment totally
different from any that I have described, but a mixture of several
decomposition products of chromogens, produced by the action of heat
and mineral acids on them ; nor by following out his directions could
anything approaching a pure residue be obtained.                 Hoppe-Seyler's
 conclusion that his results are only of historical value may therefore
be accepted.        I mention this, as I had omitted in former papers to say
 that Dr. Harley had inferred, long before the spectroscope was used in
 such investigations,      that the colouring-matter of urine was derived
 from that of blood, but the resemblance between his

matism and once in the urine of a case of so-called                            idiopathic
pericarditis. Its occurrence in the urine in the former disease appears
to be pretty constant, and this is interesting when its artificial produc
tion is borne in mind, since it is produced by the action of nascent
hydrogen on acid haematin.                It would seem to indicate that an acid
fermentation,     attended by the destruction of considerable quantities of
haemoglobin,     is present in that disease, and this agrees with the well-
known fact that a product of such fermentation is present in the
blood of acute rheumatism,              namely, lactic acid.*         Since tbis acid is
produced from glycogen (as well as in the muscles), and since haemo
globin is broken down in the spleen and sent into the liver (being
helped there by the rhythmical contraction of the spleen, which Roy
has discovered),      to be changed into the colouring-matters of bile and
urine, it   would appear that the liver is the principal seat of this pecu
liar fermentation.        The presence of urohaematin in the urine at all
events indicates that the normal oxidation of haemoglobin down into
urobilin is not taking place, and that probably the bodies with which
urohaematin is associated are also insufficiently oxidised.                       Hence its
occurrence is of great pathological importance. I find that when
present in sufficient quantity it can be detected without isolation, as its
bands are easily seen in the urine itself.             In this liquid it can be made
to show two spectra which are equally characteristic, namely, that of
acid and neutral urohaimatin, and these can be distinguished from those
of methaemoglobin or of haematin, by the use of sulphide of ammo
 nium, as this has no effect on urohaematin.
    It occurs in the urine in the condition of neutral or slightly alkaline
 urohaematin, and this shows four bands — a feeble one between C and
 D, two between D and B, and a third close to F (see sp. 16);
 the second and third bands might easily be mistaken for acid
 methaemoglobin, but sulphide of ammonium, as stated above, serves to
 distinguish them. Moreover, when it is present, Day's test fails to
 give a blue coloration.            The bands just referred to gave in the urine
 the following measurements             : —

porphyrin, but they are different.             To prove this     I  adapted an inter
polation     curve   to the  drawing    of the  spectrum     of that   body figured by
Hoppe-Seyler and found the following measurements for acid                      haemato-

     I  have also prepared haematoporphyrin in different ways, and find
that nrohaematin, although closely resembling it, is not the same body,
nor is      it identical with Banmstark's*           urorv.brohoem.atin     or urofusco-
hoematin, as the solubility of these bodies is different.                    The other
characters of the isolated pigment are described in my last paper.t
    Spectrosc-pic Detection of Indican in Urine. — In cases where Jaffe's
test fails to detect indican in urine the spectroscope is able to detect
it.J The best method, and one which, after repeated trials, I find easily
applied, is somewhat like that of Stockvis, but while he used nitric I
 use hydrochloric acid.         The urine is mixed with about its own bulk of
 hydrochloric acid and boiled ; after cooling, it is agitated with chloro
 form, not violently shaken, and left to rest for some time.                  When the
 urine contains indican the chloroform-layer is more or less violet and
 shows a band before D.           The latter corresponds in position with that
 of the so-called " omicholin."           In applying the test the urine always
 gets more or less red, and there is a strong absorption of the violet
 end of the spectrum ; now           I  find that in cases where no indican is
 present this reddening takes place.              Some authorities say that this
 reddening is due to urrhodin, others that it is due to indigo-red, while
 others maintain that these two colouring-matters are the same.                     But

neither view is quite correct. The reddening produced by boiling with
hydrochloric acid in normal urine is certainly not due to the oxidation
of indican, since I can detect no indigo-blue nnder these circumstances,
but it is partly due to the oxidation of the chromogen of urobilin,
since the latter goes into the chloroform when the mixture is shaken
with  it,and can be detected by means of the spectroscope.          At the
same time the oxidation of the urobilin chromogen does not account
for all the red coloration produced in normal urine and for tte
presence of the colouring matter, which then possesses an absorptm
power for the violet end of the spectrum.             Hence the so-called
"indigo-red" in urine     isnot due to the presence of indican, as      it   is
present in quite normal urine, while indigo-blue cannot be obtained
from the same urine in all cases.     Ihave, therefore, to agree with these
who maintain that the above-described absorption of the violet end           of
the spectrum    is  due to "urrhodin," and who also maintain that
urrhodin and indigo-red are different colouring-matters.
   In most cases where have detected indican by this method have
                         I                                          I
noticed band in the urine which seems to be connected in some way
         a
with its presence.     Thus, in the urine of a case of aphasia, due          to
embolism from mitral disease, the addition of hydrochloric acid to
the urine (which was a reddish colour) made          redder in colour, and
                                                     it
a band   became developed, beginning about half way between              D
and  E, and extending nearly to E. It probably extended from
\558 — 534.   The urobilin band was also visible. On boiling the
urine with hydrochloric acid, cooling, and agitating with chloroform,
the latter became a faint purple-red colour this showed two hands
                                                 ;
with their centres at \608 and \571*5.   On evaporating the chloro
form, alcohol took up the pigment from the residue, and gave two
similar bands.   In this case the band before D was less shaded than
that after D, but in other cases the reverse was the case this teaches
                                                            ;
that not one, but two distinct colouring-matters are indicated by the
presence of these bands, for      only one colouring-matter was indi
                                 if
cated by them then they should possess the same relative degree              of
shading when dissolved in the same medium in different cases. Another
specimen of urine gave* the band referred to above, namely, extend
ing from half-way between D and         to near E, and on treating, as
                                          E
before, with hydrochloric acid and chloroform, the indigo-blne band
before D was well seen, the band after D uncertain.       The urobilin
band was also visible. In a specimen of urine (from             case
                                                                a        of

 the latter case the       addition of nitric acid would cause the disappear
 ance of    the   bands   near   D, while in the case of indigo-blue no effect

 solutions of bile-pigment and on bilicyanin, and find that they behave
quite differently from indican.           When febrile urobilin, or urohaematin,

decidedly in spectrum from that figured by Dr. Thudichum ;* instead
of showing the three well-defined bands figured by him, it always
gives a hazy double band or shading in the position described.                      The
uroerythrin which          I examined always answered to the description, as
regards      chemical     character,   given in books on physiological che
mistry, which.       I   need not repeat.     I have figured this spectrum in
sp.  19,  for  comparison.        I cannot  trace   any connexion between uro
erythrin and indican or urobilin, but it often accompanies uro
haematin ; and it will be found probably derived from a radical
belonging to the aromatic group of carbon compounds.

was taking copaiba and sandal-wood oil for chronic blenorrhcaa.                  I may
here state that the urine of other patients taking these drugs failed to
show any sign of the presence of the pigment.                 The first specimen of
urine only amounted to about an ounce, and owing to an accident half
of it was lost.        It had a pale straw colour, was faintly acid, and gave
the band of normal urobilin.
   When treated with nitric acid in the cold it changed to a splendid
ruby-red colour and gave a very feeble band at D, and a very dark
one between D and E and touching E, the latter from X558— 534 ; the
feeble shading perhaps from X612 — 589 ? ; but on boiling with nitric
acid this red colour was destroyed, it became yellow, and the bands
were no longer seen.           On adding hydrochloric acid the same feeble
band appeared at D, and in a deep layer the whole spectrum up to

near      D was absorbed, in a thinner layer three other            bands were
visible, the colour of the solution changing to      a fine carmine-red.        The
three bands read as follows : —
                 1st Band                    X558— 534
                 2nd    „                    X516— 496

   On boiling this solution the colour was not destroyed, but the
band in violet disappeared.     When agitated with chloroform or ether
no pigment went into solution. When the red liquid got by adding
hydrochloric acid to the urine was treated with caustic potash in
excess the colour disappeared, but again reappeared on adding hydro
chloric acid in excess.
   But in the second specimen obtained three weeks after the abort
examination, from the same patient, the chemical and spectroscopic
characters differed slightly from those of the first specimen, but were
essentially the same.      On adding about one quarter of its on
volume of nitric acid the liquid assumed a splendid red colour, and
when agitated with chloroform, the latter removed the colouring-ma8er
forming a lake-red solution ; by means of daylight the spectrum was
seen to consist of one broad band across the middle of the spectrum-
from near D to half way between F and G, and on dilation this band
could not be divided into two.    After evaporation of this solution a pale
yellow residue was left, the change of colour being due probably to
the action of the heat, and a little of the acid left in the chloroform.
on the pigment.     If too much nitric acid was added it also lost                its
red colour.   With   nitric acid alone, a band could be seen between             D
and   E and touching the latter line.
   On treating the urine with hydrochloric acid and shaking witt
chloroform, the latter assumed a fine carmine colour, and after filter
ing gave the same kind of absorption as the nitric acid treated
liquid, the broad band extending from between D and             to beyoad
                                                                  E
F.   Ammonia    at once  discharged the red colour of this   solution, but
it reappeared on acidifying afresh       caustic potash and caustic sods

acted similarly.    On adding alcohol to        chloroformic solution the
                                                 a
colour changed to orange, and then only the violet end                  theof
spectrum was absorbed.
   The red colour produced by nitric acid, or hydrochloric acid, was
also taken up by agitating with bisulphide of carbon, and this gave
the same kind of spectrum as the chloroform solution.
     It
      was interesting to find out whether indican was here present               ;
the urine was therefore boiled with hydrochloric acid, and after
cooling shaken with chloroform,     then gave the indigo-blue band

a purple solution which gave two bands : 1st, from A.630 — 589 ;
2nd, about X573 — 555. Hence this urine did contain indican.
    Although the spectroscopic characters of the second specimen did
somewhat resemble those of urrhodin, yet those of the first were quite
different, and hence 1 have concluded that the colouring-matter was
not urrhodin. It also differs from the pigment described by PIosz,*
and Seems from the description of " Urorosein " of Nencki and Siebert
t-   resemble that pigment, which showed in amylic alcohol a band
between D and E with its maximum of shading at X557. It is at all
events closely related to nrrhodin. Unfortunately                I   had not material
enough for further study.
    In the urine of progressive pernicious anaemia a peculiar colouring-
matter was noticed, which after boiling the urine with hydrochloric
acid and shaking with chloroform, imparted to the latter extract a
fine red colour, giving a band between D and E, but hope to study    I
the pigments of the urine of that disease more fully at some future
time.

     5. The same solution with nitric acid. The slight difference of position of
           the bands in this and spectra 1 and 3 is due probably to a little more, or

 " Experimental Determinations of Magnetic Susceptibility and
       of Maximum Magnetisation in Absolute Measure." By
       R. Shida, Thomson Experimental Scholar, University.
       Glasgow.         Communicated        by Sir W. Thomson, F.R.S.
       Received October 10, 1882. Read November 23, 1882.
                                   [Pla8es 9—16.]
    The fact that there exists a limit to the magnetisation of a soft iron
 bar was first demonstrated by Joule, who, in 1840,* made a number
 of experiments on the sustaining power of an electro-magnet- and
showed that when the current in the exciting coil is made stronger
and stronger, that power tends to a certain definite value, or in other
words, the magnetisation of the iron core attains a maximum.
    In 1861, an interesting research on the magnetic properties of iron
was made by Thalen, who determined,                 among other things, the
magnetic susceptibilityt of different specimens of soft iron in absolute
measure for the first time.            The units of length, mass, and time
employed by Thalen were respectively a millimetre, a milligramme,
and a second.
   Joule and Thalen were followed by several, most of whom,                however,
made experiments without giving the results in absolute units ; but
amongst the few who have not overlooked the importance of such a
system of units, Rowland made by far the most important investiga
tions upon the subject.           He determined not only the magnetic
permeability or susceptibility of certain so-called magnetic bodies,
but also the maximum magnetisation of those bodies in absolute units,
using the metre, the gramme, and the second as the units of length,
mass, and time.
    The method of Thalen and that of Rowland are essentially the same,
inasmuch as they depend upon the same electrodynamic principle,
that an electric current induced in a closed circuit due to sudden
creation or disappearance of magnetic lines of force, is proportional
to the number of lines of force thus introduced or withdrawn, cutting
the circuit.     But one notable difference of the two methods lies in the
fact that the one used ellipsoids or cylindrical rods of great length,
while the other chiefly used rings or endless rods to experiment upon.
The chief advantage of an electromagnetic method such as the above,
is, as has been remarked by Sir William Thomson in his paper on the
"
   Electrodynamic Qualities of Metals, Part VI,            the ease and rapidity

      .with which    the results can be obtained ; while its disadvantage is
      revealed  in the  fact that it does not show either slow changes of mag
     netisation or the distribution of magnetism.
        The following results of the experiments which have been made at
     the Physical Laboratory of the University of Glasgow, are given in abso
     lute measure in which a centimetre, a gramme, and a second are taken
     as the units of length, mass, and time respectively, and were arrived
     at by means of the direct magnetometric       method given to me by Sir
     William Thomson (who described and explained the method at the
    recent meeting of the British Association at Southampton in the
    Section A), as founded upon a method originated by Coulomb and
    discussed mathematically by Green.           This method possesses some
    important advantages over the electromagnetic method ; for instance,
    it shows at any moment any change of magnetisation of the body
    experimented on (which is of great practical utility in investigations
   of this kind) ; it affords an excellent means of illustrating the distri
   bution of magnetism in the body, and it enables us to experiment
   upon a long thin bar, subjecting it to different strengths of magnetising
   forces, and to various amounts of longitudinal stress, and at the same
   time to determine in absolute measure, the magnetisation and magnetic
   susceptibility of the bar under these varied circumstances, which is an
   original feature of the investigations      I am going to describe.    These
  advantages, however, do not exist without disadvantages.             That the
  execution of careful investigations involves a considerable amount of
  time, is a serious disadvantage of this method.        After some preliminary
  studies, the orderly experiments were commenced about the middle of
  February last, and have since been carried on from day to day without
  intermission up to the end of May.
       A number of thin wires and of thick bars of iron and steel were
 experimented upon.            The accompanying sketch (Plate 9) shows the
 arrangement of the apparatus employed in experimenting on thin wires.
 A reflecting magnetometer, M, which consists of a mirror carrying at
 its back three small magnets and suspended by a single silk fibre
 about 5 centims.           long, was placed on a convenient stand nearly
 2 metres above the floor of the laboratory.         S is a white paper screen
 divided into half millimetres, and bent into a circular arc of a metre
 radius.       It is fixed at a distance of exactly 1 metre from the
magnetometer, and was used to observe the deflections of the
magnetometer needle, which were read by the image of a fine wire
fixed vertically in front of a paraffin lamp, L, secured just behind the
3cale as in a Thomson reflecting           galvanometer.    N is a magnet of
semicircular shape meant to control the strength of the field at the
point where the magnetometer needle is suspended.              It was mounted
on a suitable         stem in front of the magnetometer needle, with its
length in the plane of the magnetic meridian, and at a certain distance
                                                                 2 i 2

from    the needle in such a way that the plane of the needle is
unaltered by the magnet being removed or replaced when desired.
   The wire to be experimented upon is represented by AA'. It is
hung vertically at a distance of 10 centims. from, and due magnetic
 east of the magnetometer needle, by means of an arrangement oi
pulleys,  P, P', P", and weights, W, W, each weighing about half a
kilogramme and attached to one end of the cords, T, T', respectively as
shown.     In order that    the wire may easily be detached from the
cords, the other end of each cord, instead of being fastened directly to
the end of the wire, is merely hooked, by a small brass hook which it
carries, on to a loop of cord fastened to the end of the wire. The
mode of fastening the loop of cord to the wire was as follows:— A
cord 20 to 30 centims. long was made into a loop in such a way as to
bring its ends together, and this latter part of the loop, after having
been untwisted, was put over the end of the wire so as to enclose
about 5 centims. of it in the untwisted portion, over which portion i
thin string was tightly coiled a great number of times. This mode
of fastening the cord to the wire allowed a heavy weight to be pw
on the wire without twisting or bending the latter in the slightest
degree.
   BB' is the magnetising coil hung in such a manner from the string
T that both its centre and axis coincide with those of the wire AA'.
The coil used iu the first part of the experiments was composed of
only one layer of silk-covered copper wire wound on a straight brass
tube of about 6 millims. in its internal diameter ; the length of the
 coil was 108 centims., its radius was -34 of a centimetre, and the
number of turns of wire on the coil was 1,795, and the resistance of
the coil including the electrodes was, at 14° C, 3494 ohms.    By means
of this coil were obtained the results given in the columns headed
1 to 5 of the Table I.    It was soon found that the coil just described
was quite unsuitable for producing high magnetising forces, and that
a modification was necessary.       The coil, when modified, was 110
centims. long, and consisted of five layers of silk-covered copper wire
laid on one above another; the radius of the innermost layer was
"340 of a centimetre,     and that of the outermost was "660 of a
centimetre, and, therefore, the mean radius of the coil was -50, and the
mean distance between any two adjacent layers "08 of a centimetre;
the resistance of the coil, the electrodes included, was 30"8 ohms- at
 14° C.   The ends of the electrodes of the coil were permanently con
nected to the two terminals of a reversing key, K, the other two
terminals of which were in connexion with the two electrodes of a
Thomson tray battery so disposed that any desired number of cells,
from 1 to 60 inclusive, could be placed in the circuit. A tangent
galvanometer, G, was inserted in one of the connecting wires as
shown in the sketch, so that whenever a current is passed through the

               Determinations      of Magnetic Susceptibility.             407
 coil it was read and measured by this galvanometer.          The weight   W"
 was simply used to balance the weight of the coil.
    It will easily  be seen  from the arrangements of cords, pulleys, &c,
that the wire, besides being kept straight, can be raised or lowered
through any desired distance within a range of about 4 metres ;
and further, that when the wire is moved up or down the coil follows
the movements, keeping its position with reference to the former un
altered.    For the purpose of observing the position of the wire or the
coil with great facility at any instant with reference to the line on a
level with the magnetometer needle, there is provided, alongside the
wire and coil, a scale divided into centimetres, and fixed to a wooden
upright.
    The orderly    and systematic way in which the experiments were
performed may be described generally thus : — A weight, the amount
of which was different for different specimens of the wire as will
be   presently stated, was put on and taken off the wire, whilst the
magnetising    force was in action, about ten times in succession (this
operation of successive application and removals of a weight will be
hereafter called, for brevity, " ons and offs "), half a kilogramme being
always on ; then the wire, having been first placed so high up that its
effect and that of the coil on the magnetometer was scarcely visible,
was lowered 2 centims. by 2 centims., until it was so low down
that little or no effect of the wire and coil was observable on the
magnetometer, while the deflections of the magnetometer needle were
noted for all the positions of the wire and coil.           This process was
followed in the case of all the wires, except the hard-tempered wire,
and all the magnetising forces used, unless otherwise stated.           It will
be needless to enter into the discussion of the details of the object of
                                               "
subjecting the wire to the operations of ons and offs," as they will
be, I hope, shortly communicated        to the Royal Society or elsewhere ;
suffice it to point out here that on commencing               the preliminary
experiments, it    was  soon  discovered  that in the first instance  the wire
was very irregularly magnetised, but that the effect of subjecting the
wire, while under the influence of the vertical force, to the applica
tion and removal of a pull a certain number of times in succession,
was to remove all the irregularities as to magnetisation, besides pro
ducing an enormous augmentation of its magnetism.
    The results are given in the Tables I to IV.       The general explana
 tion of these and other accompanying tables is, that the " Distances "
 mean the distances of the centre of the wire from the level of the
 magnetometer needle, those distances measured from their level up
 wards being reckoned positive, and those measured downwards nega
 tive; while the "Deflections" mean the corresponding deflections of
 the needle in the scale-divisions — those deflections        indicating the
  repulsion of the north-seeking pole, or red end of the needle, being

408                              Mr. R. Shida.
reckoned positive, and those indicating the attraction negative. Tie
                              " Deflections," are not only to show the
headings 1, 2, 3, Sue., under
order in which the experiments were performed, but to distinguish tie
results for one magnetising force from those for another; the exact
4value of the magnetising force in each case will be shown presently.
   The first wire tried was a very soft iron (pure) wire,* supplied by
Johnson and Nephew, Manchester, and is named in the table " Dark
Wire," from its appearance.       It was of No. 10 B.W.G., its breaking
stress being about 15 kilogs. The piece experimented on was a metre
long ; its radius, when carefully calculated from its weight and specific
gravity, was "0374 of a centimetre, and therefore its sectional area
was -00439 square centim.         The weight which was used for the
operation of
               " Ons and Offs
                               " was 8 kilogs., only with this exception,
that at the beginning, while the force magnetising the wire was that
due to the vertical component of the earth's magnetism alone, a weight
of 10 kilogs. was put on once or twice. The wire underwent an
elongation of 2"9 per cent- of its original length, so that it was no*
10249 centims., and its sectional area "00425 square centim.; the
elongation was permanent and constant, that is, the subsequent appli
cation of 8 kilogs. produced no more effect as to elongation.          The
results for this wire are shown in the Table I. In this table, the
results under the heading numbered 1, which are those for the
Glasgow vertical force, it must be mentioned, were obtained after the
wire had been treated in the following manner : — The operation of
" Ons and Offs," of a weight of 8 kilogs., having been performed
while the wire was hanging one way, say, with the end A up, its
magnetisation was observed in the manner explained before; the
wire was then inverted, and the operation of "Ons and Offs" was
again performed while it was hanging with the end A' up, that is
while the vertical force was acting in the opposite direction with
respect to the wire, and its magnetisation was again observed; this
process was repeated until the magnetisation of the wire in the two
cases was equal, or nearly so, in intensity, but opposite in polarity.
The first and second columns under any of the headings numbered
1 to 8 give the result obtained in the two cases respectively:                   (1)

largely used in Sir William Thomson's sounding machines.                   The

section was "004452 square centim.             A weight of 16 kilogs. was
always used for

 steel wire, the results of which are exhibited in the Table IV. The mode
 of tempering which was adopted          perhaps worthy of a passing notice.

 wire (pianoforte wire)  ; and while held horizontally by means of  pliers
 over a tray containing cold water, it was raised to a bright red heat
 by passing throngh it a strong current from a Faure battery, and
 suddenly plunged into the tray. This plan proved a complete success.
 the heat being equally distributed throughout the whole mass of tie
 wire ; the tempering was, of course, as uniform as it could be all oyer
 the length of the wire, perhaps, with the exception of the ends where
 it was held. When short pieces were cut off from the extremities,
 the wire was 78"42 centims. long ; the area of its cross-section was now
4004320 square centim., the wire having lost nearly 2 per cent- of its
 weight by the process of tempering. This wire was, of course, so exceed

ingly brittle that the operation of Ons and Offs of a heavy weight
was an impossibility, and consequently no weight was put on the wire at
all, except those used to keep it vertically straight. With reference to
the explanation of the Table IV, the first column in 1, 2, 3, &c, refers
to the result arrived at when the magnetising force was kept acting
on the wire ; and the second column, if there be one, refers to the
result arrived at directly after the withdrawal of all magnetising force,
except that due to the vertical component of the earth magnetism.
   Somewhat thick bars of cast iron, hard-tempered steel, and soft
iron, were then procured and experimented upon, with a view to
determine approximately the law of magnetisation of those bars, and
to compare the results with each other and with those for the wires.
The bars were nearly equal in their dimensions ; they were all 61
centims. in length and very nearly square in section ; the sectional
area of the cast-iron bar, when calculated from its weight and specific
gravity, was approximately -950 square centim., that of the steel
bar "948 square centim., and that of the soft iron bar "901 square
centim.
   With regard to the mode of experimenting in the case of these
bars, though it remained the same in principle as before, it necessarily
differed in details, which   I  proceed to describe thus : — In the first
place, the coil employed for magnetising the bars was 68 centims.
long, and consisted of three layers of insulated copper wire wonnd on
a tnbe of copper nearly square, each layer containing 620 turns ; the
whole area inclosed by all the turns of wire per unit length was
89 sq. centims. approximately, though not very accurately on account
of the difficulty of measuring exactly the dimensions of the coil, as it
was not specially made for the purpose ; and the resistance of the coil
was abont 34 78 ohms when cool.      The bar to be experimented on wis
placed inside the coil, with  its centre and axis coincident with those
of the latter; and the whole arrangement thus fitted up was hung
vertically in the same way as before by means of cords, pull-ys, Sx.,
with the common axis of the coil and the bar at a distance of 22 cen
tims. from, and due magnetic east of, the magnetometer ; the con-

 nexions    of the electrodes of the coil, the galvanometer,       &c., being
 precisely the same as before.
    The same procedure in experimenting as before was followed as far
 as possible ; that is to say, the bar and the coil, having been placed high
up to begin     with, were lowered 2 centims. by 2 centims. until they
were low down, while the deflections of the magnetometer needle were
read for all the positions of the bar or the coil.     In the case, however,
where this procedure        was hardly possible, or, at any rate, hardly
worth going through, on account of the rapid variation of the current
in the coil, arising partly from the heating up of the coil and partly from
the polarisation of the battery (which consisted either of the Thomson
tray, Daniell's, or of the Faure accumulators, the latter being chiefly
used to obtain very high magnetising forces), the experiment              was
made in the following manner : — A point of the bar, 28 centims. dis
tant from its centre, having been placed on a level with the magneto
meter needle (as this position of the bar was such as to give the
needle a maximum deflection for a high magnetising force), a strong
current was allowed to pass through the coil, and as soon as the
deflection of the needle was readable with a tolerable accuracy it was
read off at a certain moment by one observer, while the strength of
the current was measured by taking the reading of the galvanometer
at the same moment by another observer on word of command from
the former;       the data thus obtained will, as we shall see, afford
the means of determining approximately the magnetisation               of the
bar.
    The results of experiments on the bar of cast iron, steel, and malle
able iron, are given in the Tables V, VI,     VII   respectively, the general
explanation of which has been already given in dealing with the other
tables.     The first colnmn under any of the headings 1, 2, 3, &c, in
each of the Tables V, VI, VII, contains the results obtained while
the magnetising       force was in action ; while the second column, if
there be one, contains the result obtained directly after the with
 drawal of the force.
    Now the best way to study the results given in all the Tables           I
 to VII, is to plot curves in such a manner that the ordinates represent
 the " Distances
                    " of the centre of the wire or bar from the datum line,
 the level  of the magnetometer needle, and the abscissae represent the
 "              "
    Deflections    of the needle in the scale divisions. To illustrate this,
 the results shown in the second and third columns under 7, Table I,
 are exhibited by the curves 1 and 2 respectively,        Plate 10, in which
 those distances measured upward from the datum line are reckoned
 positive and those measured downwards negative ; while those deflec
 tions indicating the repulsion of the red end of the needle are reckoned
  positive, and those indicating the attraction negative, according to
  the convention already    adopted.

   Let—
   (a + a') = the area contained by the curve 1, the axis OY or OY', and
the line YW or the line Y'W.
   o'=the area contained by the curve 2, the axis OY or OY', and the
line YV or the line TV.
   Z=half the length of the wire or bar.
   Z'= half the length of the coil.
   r=the distance of the middle line of the wire or bar from the
magnetometer needle.
   m = the sum of all the magnetic matter, northern        or southern,   on
either side of the centre of the wire or bar.
   m'=the strength of the solenoid or coil.
   S=the strength of the field at the point where the magnetometer
needle hangs.
   0=the angle of deflection of the needle, in radian measure, corre
sponding to the division of the scale.
   I=the intensity of the magnetisation of the wire at any cross-
section, or intensity of magnetisation of the bar at its centre.
   F = the magnetising force.
   fi=the magnetising susceptibility.
   ci=the area of the cross-section of the wire or bar.
   Then it can easily be proved, provided that the angles of deflections
are so small as to be proportional to their tangents, as in the case we
are considering, that 2m . S . 0 . a is the integral sum of all the normal
components of forces over the whole surface of a cylinder whose
height is the length of the wire or bar, and whose radius is r, due to
the magnetic matter m, situated at the centre of the cylind-r, pro
vided the length of the wire or bar be infinitely great ; the correction

 experiments the value of k was so very small and the magnetising
force at any point of the wire or bar was so very slightly different
from that at the centre, that the error which would arise from using
the equation (8) will be very insignificant, and consequently this
approximate    equation was always used to evaluate F.
    The current strength c was always measured on a Thomson tangent
galvanometer, G, except when it was so weak that a small error in
the galvanometer reading will produce a considerable         error in the
result, in which case the current was estimated from the electromotive
force of the battery and the resistance of this circuit.
    The strength, S, of the field was calculated in terms of H, the
horizontal component of the terrestrial magnetism, simply by comparing
the deflections of the magnetometer needle acted upon by a magnet
 (placed behind and at a convenient distance from the needle, and
with its length in the line at right angles to the plane of the magnetic
meridian) in the two cases : (1) When the field was due to the
horizontal component H alone ; and (2) , when it was due to both the
controlling magnet N and the horizontal force H. Since evidently the
value of H seriously affects the results, it was thought desirable to
make a fresh experiment to determine H at the very spot where the
magnetometer needle is suspended.        This was effected indirectly by
counting the periods of a magnetic needle at the point in question,
and at another point where the exact value of H was known from a
direct experimental determination made after the manner described in
my paper on
                 " The Number of Electrostatic Units in the Electro
magnetic Unit" (" Phil. Mag." for December, 1880), or mor- fully
explained    in Mr. Thomas Gray's paper on " The Experimental
                                                                "
Determination of Magnetic Moments in Absolute Measure              (" Phil.
Mag."    for November,    1878) ; the  value  of  H  at the  point   where
the magnetometer hangs was found to be -1590.            The value of V,
the earth's vertical force, is of by far the less moment, considering
that the only results the accuracy of which depends greatly upon that
of the value of V, are those for /x for that particular magnetising force
only; so that it was deemed unnecessary to find V by a new
experiment, and Consequently it was deduced from the value of H and
that of the dip, 73° 45' being taken for the latter according to the
determination   made some three years ago.
   The final results tabulated at the end of the paper, namely, in the
Tables A, B, C, D, &c, were derived from the mathematical con
siderations   above discussed- and from the results given in the
corresponding Tables     of Deflection I, II, III, IV, &c, with the
exception of the results given in 7, 8, 9, and 10 of the Table E, and 2,
3, and 4 of the Table F.    The intensity, I, in these exceptional cases
was obtained by assuming that the deflections of the magnetometer
needle due to the magnetism of the bar alone (that is to say, the

               Determination*       of Magnetic Susceptibility.               437
deflections due to the coil being taken into consideration), corre
sponding to the distance 28 centims. (a distance approximately
corresponding to a maximum deflection for high magnetising forces)
are proportional to the intensity I. The deflections due to the coil
alone were calculated from the strength of the current in the coil after
a manner to be discussed later on.
   Just a few words are perhaps necessary to explain the details of the
 Tables A, B, C, &c. In the first place the results given in the first,
second, third, &c, horizontal lines along with the numbers 1, 2, 3, &c., in
the Tables A, B, C, Ac., correspond to the first, second, third, &c., vertical
columns under the headings 1, 2, 3, Ac, in the corresponding Tables of
Deflection I, II, III, &c. No sign or a negative one is prefixed to the
numbers, according as the polarities of the wire or bar or coil were
similar or dissimilar to those induced in the wire by the earth's
vertical force alone, if the numbers refer to the quantities indicating
the magnetisation ; or according as the magnetising forces were in a
similar or dissimilar direction to the vertical force, if the numbers
refer to the quantities representing the magnetising forces either
directly or indirectly. Again, it will be observed that in 7 and 8 of
the Table A, and of the Table C, there were obtained two values for
     one calculated    and the other observed     ;  the object of this was two
fold  :  (1) To insure that the calculated value was within the errors of
observations in the measurements of the current strengths, the
dimensions of the coil, &c. ; and (2), to render the results for this
maximum magnetisation of the wires corresponding to these tables
independent of the accuracy or inaccuracy of the measurement of the
current strengths    ;  the observed value for Q-m' was used, in these cases,
to evaluate the quantities      I,  ft, &c.
   The rest of what is given in the Tables A, B, C, &c, will,             I hope,
explain itself. But by far the readiest mode of studying the whole
results, is to refer to the graphical representation shown in the Plates
11, 12, 13, 14, 15, the first three and the fourth of which contain the
curves representing the " intensity of magnetisation

drawn that the ordinate at every point of it is half the algebraical
difference of the ordinates of the curves (6) and (c), and hence
exhibits approximately       a curve which should have been obtained
had the wire been experimented             on without being subjected to
the action of a poll.     Had   it not  been   for the sake of convenience

former representing the result obtained when the magnetising force
was in action, and the latter that obtained immediately after it was
withdrawn.
   Glancing at the curves in the Diagram I, we see something very
striking.     In the first place, we cannot help being struck with the
                                            "
remarkable effect of " Ons and Offs            on the magnetisation of the
dark wire, when we compare the curve (a) or (6) with the curve (J).
But a still more remarkable result is revealed in the fact that there is
a surprising difference, as the curves (a) and (6) show, between the
                                                              "
intensity of magnetisation of this wire in the case of On," and that
                       "
in the case of " Off for low magnetising forces ; and that the differ
ence gets less and less remarkable as the magnetising force is more
and more increased, becoming nothing at 15 units of the force, then
changing into a negative quantity for still higher magnetising forces,
and ultimately attaining a constant negative value.          In other words,
the intensity of magnetisation of the wire is greater or less while it is
actually under the action of a constant pull than while it is free from

    according as the magnetising force to which the wire             is

   below or above a certain value — a value which might, therefore, be
called critical.*   The fact that the two pairs of curves (d) and              (e)

and (a) and (6) are symmetrically placed with respect to the hori
8ontal axis, each to each, shows that the ultimate effect of " Ons and
Offs." is to magnetise the wire to the same degree of intensity, under
the same circumstances, whether the magnetising force be in one or
in the opposite direction. On the other hand, the curve (c) shows
that when the magnetising force is so high as 60 units or so the wire
seems to lose its retentiveness, so much so, that the reversal of the
polarities of the wire by the reversal of the force is so complete that
the operation of " Ons and Offs produced no permanent effect ; but
                                     "
that when the magnetising force is below that value the simple reversal
of the force is not so effective as to annul the permanent effects of
 " Ons and Offs," or even to reverse the polarities of the wire. It is
obvious that the excess of the intensity of magnetisation represented
by the curve (6) over that represented by the curve (/), correspond
ing to any magnetising force, is a measure of the retentiveness of
the wire for that magnetising force.
    Remarks so very similar to those made on the curves in the
 Diagram I apply to the corresponding curves in the Diagram          II that
 it is quite unnecessary to mention them. The comparison of the two
 sets of curves in the two diagrams, however, presents many points of
 interest. The curves (a) and (fe) in these diagrams show that for
some low magnetising forces the intensity of magnetisation of the
 "Bright Wire" is greater than that of the "Dark Wire;" this is,
 perhaps, not because the former is more susceptible of magnetisation
 than the latter, but chiefly because of the fact that there is for each
 wire a certain amount of pull (used for " Ons and Offs ") which would
 give a maximum effect on the magnetisation of the wire, and that a
 weight of 12 kilogs. is nearer that value for the bright wire than a
 weight of 8 kilogs. is for the dark wire. As regards the critical point,
 we see that it is about 15 units in the case of the dark wire, while it
is about 10 units in the case of the bright wire ; but this point is no
 doubt different, not only for different kinds of wire but also for
 different amounts of the pull. But it is in the curve (c) that the
 chief interest lies. The comparison of the curves (c) and (e) in the
 two diagrams shows that the effect of reversing the magnetising force
 on the change or reversal of magnetisation is considerably less in the
 case of the bright wire than in the case of the dark wire, both which
 must doubtless be accounted for by supposing that the one (tolerably
 soft iron) has a greater coercive force than the other (exceedingly
 soft iron), as might be expected.
    The comparison of the curves in the Diagram          III  with those in
 the Diagram I or     II is also interesting. The most striking point is
 that, unlike the case of soft iron wires, there is no such thing as
 critical point in the case of steel wire, as the curves (a) and (6) in the
 Diagram    III  point oat; for every magnetising force the intensity of

440                                       Mr. R. Skida.
magnetisation       is greater in the case of " Off" than it is in the case of
" On."        Comparing the curves (a) and (o) in the Diagrams I, II,
and    III,   we notice a vast difference for low magnetising forces between
the intensity of magnetisation     of the pianoforte wire and that of the
sift iron wire ; but seeing that when the magnetising force is so high
a; 30 units or so                                                    "
                  (when the permanent effect of "Ons and Offs          begins
to be insignificant, that           is,
                               when retentiveness gets inconsiderable).
the intensity of magnetisation of the steel wire        very much the same
                                                                 is
as that of the   soft  iron wires,     think I    probable that the above
                                                       it
difference is, in      great measure, due to the fact that a weight
                          a
of 16 kilogs. (less than one-sixth of the breaking weight of the
                                                 "                " is far too
pianoforte wire) used for the operation of Ons and Offs
small to produce anything like full effect on the magnetisation of the
steel wire, and that this difference can be greatly diminished by using
a heavier weight (perhaps 40 or 50 kilogs.) to operate
                                                             " Ons and Offs."
The difference that exists between the intensity of magnetisation                   of
the steel pianoforte wire and that of the glass-hard-temp-red steel
wire, corresponding to low magnetising forces,             greatly due to
                                                                  is                a
similar cause   but ;observing  that  there  subsists a  considerable differ
ence in the intensity of magnetisation of these two wires even for so
high a magnetising force as 50 or 60 units,             seems probable that
                                                             it
the intensity of magnetisation of the glass-hard-tempered        steel wire         is
really smaller  for  every magnetising     force   than   that of the iron-
tempered steel wire, oven when the effect of stress is taken into
account.
     As regards the limit of the magnetisation               of these wires, on   com
paring the curves (a) and (6) in these diagrams,   will be seen that  it
that limit    attained at so low magnetising force as 80 units or so,
                is
both in the case of the soft iron wires and the non-tempered st-el wire,
and that the maximum magnetisation of the pianoforte wir- is not
lower than that of the soft iron wires in the ordinary cases — results
certainly unexpected.          On the other hand, the comparison of the
curves (&)   and  (c)   in  the Diagram          III
                                               requires a careful study.            It
shows that at about 80 or even 100 units of the magnetising force
there   isa notable difference between the magnetisation          of the non-
tempered and glass-hard-tempered steel wires; but whether this
difference     due to the fact that the maximum magnetisation of the
               is
latter   isnot yet reached at the above-stated magnetising forc-, or                it
represents the actual difference in the maximum magnetisation of the
two wires,      it  difficult to decide. In whichever way this difference
                     is
is accounted   for,       itnot unfair to say that the maximum magnetisa

    The curve       (a) in the Diagram         III  shows that the maximum
residual magnetism of the tempered steel wire is considerably greater
than three-fourths of the total magnetism of which it is a residue ;
whereas in the case of the soft iron wires the maximum residual
magnetism is only a small fraction of the total magnetism.
    Passing now on to the curves in the Plate 14, no more words are
perhaps necessary to explain them, because the explanations given of the
curves in the Plates 11, 12, 13 will exactly apply to the corresponding
curves in the Plate 14, if we substitute the words "Magnetic Suscep
tibility" for "Intensity of Magnetisation."               By the corresponding
carves is     meant    the  curves    which  are  marked   by the same letters,
such as (a), (6), &O, in the diagrams designated by the same numbers,
such as    I, II,  &c.
    With regard to the results for the magnetic susceptibility, it may          be
remarked that the results of the preliminary experiments not given in
the paper, showed that the susceptibility of any one of the wires is
different according to different circumstances under which it is placed,
that is to say, that there is, for each magnetising force, an infinite
number of values for the susceptibility corresponding to an infinite
number of amounts of pull to the applications and removals of which
the wire might have been subjected (though this appears to cease to be
the case when the magnetising force exceeds a certain value, that is,
when the wire begins to lose its retentiveness) , not to speak at all of
the different values for the susceptibility the wire has at any given
stage of its history, according to the different amounts of a permanent
pull to which the wire may be subjected.             Hence it is evident that we
should have       a precise knowledge      of  the history, past and present, of
the body whose susceptibility we wish to determine ; and this is the
very reason why the experiments were made on the wires under
definite circumstances.         The two sets of the values for the suscepti
bility  of   each   wire, one  for the case " On," and the other for " Off,"
given in the corresponding table and represented by the curves, are,
therefore, those corresponding to that particular circumstance under
which the wire was experimented on. The magnetic susceptibility of

442                            Mr. R. Sbida.
the soft iron wires when retentiveness     is disregarded, can be calcu
lated, if required, from the magnetisation represented by the curves
(/), Plates 11, 12, 13.
   The greatest value for the magnetic susceptibility   I  obtained of soft
iron wire is about 730, the corresponding magnetising force being the
Glasgow vertical force, and it is probably still greater for smaller
magnetising forces; while the magnetic susceptibility of the same
wire for so high a magnetising force as 100 units, is only about 13,
and still smaller, no doubt, for higher magnetising forces.          These
results are truly surprising, and will dispel any doubt as to the old
view that the value of /i is constant or nearly so for all or a certain
range of the magnetising force.
   I will now proceed to explain the curves in the Plate 15 which
represent the results for the bars.     The " direct curves " show the
results obtained by commencing with a small magnetising force which
was gradually increased until it is so high as to magnetise the bars
very strongly, if not to saturation; while the "return curves8'
represent the results obtained by coming down from a high mag
netising force to lower and lower magnetising forces, passing through
the zero and going up gradually to a high magnetising force on the
negative side of the zero. It may be mentioned that the reason why
for the steel bar the direct curve was not obtained is because 8he bar,
which was one of those originally intended to be used for Sir William
Thomson's new Siphon Recorder, was previously magnetised strongly,
and, therefore, the experiment on it was commenced by using a high
magnetising force to start with ; and that there is every reason to
believe that the direct curve for the steel bar is something lik- that
for the cast-iron bar.
   On comparing the " direct curves
                                        " in the Plate 15, we see that
                                                                        the
magnetisation of the cast-iron     bar is  somewhat less for high mag
netising forces than that of the steel bar, and is much less for every
magnetising force than that of the soft iron bar ; and that the
 maximum magnetisation of the soft iron bar is about 1340, that
 of the steel bar is about 860, and that of the cast-iron bar is only
about 770, while the corresponding least magnetising force in the case
 of the first is only about 190 units, and in the case of the second and
third, it is roughly 450 and 400 units or more. Of course, it is not
quite right to assume that the above results represent accurate
comparisons of the magnetisable qualities of those different kinds of
iron and steel, because the bars are not the same in dimensions, which
have very considerable effects on the intensity of magnetisation.
Still considering that the difference in dimensions between the soft
iron bar and the other bars is very small, while in both the maximum
intensity of magnetisation       and the minimum magnetising force
corresponding    to it they differ greatly from each other, it is certain

                  Determinations    of Magnetic Susceptibil8y.          443
that both the cast-iron bar and the steel bar are greatly inferior to the
soft iron bar in respect to magnetisability. This is indeed unexpected,
and in some measure astonishing, remembering that the steel pianoforte
wire was not at all inferior in this respect to the soft iron wires, at
least for higher magnetising forces.   The difference that is found in
the  maximum intensity of magnetisation and the minimum mag
netising force corresponding to that magnetisation   between the soft
iron bar and the wires     is,
                          however, no doubt, chiefly due to the effects
of the dimensions     of the bar.
   Another point of interest lies in the "return curves."* They show
that in the case of each bar the magnetisation of the bar did not
reverse until the magnetising force exceeded a certain value on the
negative side of the zero, and that this value     considerable even in
                                                     is
the case of the soft iron bar, considerably greater in the case
of the cast iron, and still greater — greater by   vast amount — in the
                                                     a
case of the steel bar.      A complete curve for the residual mag
netism was only obtained, or at least only shown, for the cast
iron but the fact that those points in the return curves corresponding
      ;
to the zero magnetising force represent         the maximum     residual
magnetism of the corresponding bars, will give us a rough indica
tion of what might be the residual magnetism curves for the other
bnrs.
I       have now given the general explanations and discussions of all
the results   of the experiments, and as fear space does not permit me
                                            1
to enter   into fuller discussion of all the details of the results and of
                  a
the inferences   that can be drawn from them,       I am obliged to leave
them untouched.       There         is,
                                  however, one very interesting and
important conclusion which can be derived from the results and which
I  cannot help noting specially, as        illustrates the beauty of this
                                           it
magnetometric method, and that is, in regard to the change in the
distribution of magnetism of the wires or bars due to the corresponding
change in the magnetising force to which they are subjected.        It has
already been said that one way to study the results given in the
Tables     II, &O, to trace curves in the manner explained. Now,
          I,          is                                                  it
is easy to get two such curves as (1) and (2) of the Plate 10 for each
set of the results, one representingthe effect due to both the magnetism
of the wire or bar, and the coil carrying a current, and the other
representing the same due to the coil alone.         If we draw another
curve such that its abscissa at every point  of    it the difference of the
                                                        is
abscissae at the same   point of the two curves, we obtain a curve
representing the effect due to the magnetism of the wire or bar alone.
The curve representing the effect of the coil alone can be easily
     Compare these curves with those given in Sir William Thomson's paper re

These curves form the true comparisons of the magnetisations               the         of
wire in the different cases, because they are all reduced to the same
standard, that      to say, they are all so drawn that their absciss*

have been obtained had the field         been one and the same, namely.

   The comparisons of the curves (1), (2), (3), and (4) show that tie
greater the magnetising force the greater            the distance from the

centre or origin of the points of the ordinates corresponding to the
maximum deflections of the magnetometer needle, while the com
parison of the curves (4) and (5) shows that these points in the case
of the curve (4) are almost,     not exactly, coinciding with those
                                      if                                  the          in
case of (5) showing quite distinctly that the magnetisation of the wire
            ;
for a low magnetising force       far from being solenoidal, but stronger
                                      is
at the central parts of the wire than in the other parts; bnt thatss
this force  ismade stronger and stronger, the magnetism of the wire
becomes more and more equally distributed to the ends until the dis-

                Determinations     of Magnetic Susceptibility.           445
 tribntion becomes nearly, if not altogether, solenoidal, when the force
is made so     high as to give the wire the maximum magnetisation.
More or less similar facts can be arrived at from the results for other
wires, and also those for the bars.
    These facts are truly interesting, seeing that they entirely agree
with theoretical considerations.         Indeed they have been pointed out
theoretically by Sir William Thomson,* and indicated experimentally
by Rowland. + But        I  believe my experiments are the first, the results
of which have brought out those facts so clearly as not only to leave
no room for doubt, but also to enable us to see the law by which the
change in the distribution of magnetism in a cylindrical rod due to
the change of magnetising force to which it is subjected, is governed ;
and   I  hope they will be of service in guiding the future investigators
of electro-magnetism or otherwise.
    It is impossible for me to conclude this paper without expressing
my most grateful thanks to Sir William Thomson for the very kind
guidance and instruction be has given me in the course of those
experiments.

        and its Modification by Heat, Cold, and the Action of
        Drugs."      By T. Lauder         Brunton, M.D., F.R.S., and
        Theodore Cash, M.D. Received May                 16,  1881.  Read
        June 16, 1881. Revised June 13, 1883.
    In  the following research we have examined the effect of electrical
stimuli applied to the different cavities of a frog's heart, and the
modifications of their effect hy heat, cold, and the action of strychnia.
The effect of electrical stimuli upon the ventricle, and the alterations
occasioned in it by the application of heat, have already been studied
by Professor Marey. The time relations of excitation in the frog's
heart have also been very exactly determined by Dr. Burdon Sander
son and Mr. Page. But it seemed desirable to extend the scope of
the research, and instead of confining ourselves like previous observers
to the effect of stimulation applied to the ventricle alone, to observe
 also the effect of stimulation of the ventricle, auricle, and venous
sinus, both on the ventricular and the auricular contractions.        This
 we did with the hope that from such series of observations we might
 be able to arrive at some conclusions regarding the transmission of
 stimuli from one part of the heart to the other in the ordinary course
of the circulation. Professor Marey found that when an electrical
 stimulus was applied to the ventricle of a pulsating frog's heart the
¦effect differed according to the condition of contraction or relaxation
 in which the ventricle was at the time the stimulus was applied.
 During the first part of the contraction of the ventricle, from the
 commencement        of the contraction until nearly its maximum, stimu
 lation had no apparent effect at all, and this period Marey terms the
 " refractory period." Following this phase is a second one, to which
 we have given in the following paper the term of the " sensitive
 phase," lasting from the maximum of systole to its end. The refrac
 tory period varies in duration according to the intensity of the
 stimulus, and the conditions under which the heart is operated upon.
 The feebler the stimulus, the longer is the refractory period.      When
 the   stimulus  is  very slight the  refractory period may persist during
 the whole ventricular systole ; as the stimulus is increased, the refrac
 tory period becomes shorter, and finally, when it is very strong,
 disappears altogether.
    Heat applied to the heart shortens the refractory period or abolishes
 it altogether. Cold has an opposite effect, and lengthens the refrac
 tory period.     The contractions caused by artificial stimulation do not
  much alter the cardiac rhythm, for the accelerated beat is followed

456                Drs.  T. L. Brunton and T. Cash.
by a longer pause than usual, which compensates for the diminished
interval between the two first beats. Sometimes no ventricular con
traction is induced, and then instead of acceleration there is apparent
inhibition, the application of the stimulus being followed simply by
a longer diastolic pause than usual.
   Marey's observations were confined entirely to the movements of
the ventricle, but we have extended ours to the movement of the auricle
as well. We employed two levers : one resting upon the ventricle,
and the other upon the auricle, which recorded movements upon a
revolving cylinder covered with smoked paper.
   It is unnecessary to enter here into a fuller description of the
apparatus, which is given elsewhere.*
   By the method employed we are able to study the effects of maximal
and minimal stimulation applied to the ventricle, auricle, and venous
sinus upon the movements both of auricle and ventricle.
   By minimal stimulation we understand the smallest shock that pro
duces any visible effect that in any way modifies the course of con
traction or the rhythm of the organ ; and by maximal stimulation we
mean the electrical irritation of such a strength that its intensification
produces no visible increase in its effect.
   The apparatus for stimulation consisted of a bichromate battery
with two zinc (SJ inches by 2 inches) and three carbon plates, the
size of these being 8 inches by 2 inches.        This was connect-d with a
coil, and a key was interposed by which the primary circuit could be
made and broken at pleasure.        The moments of opening and closing
the circuit were registered      upon the same revolving cylinder as
that upon which the cardiac pulsations were noted, by means of an
electro-magnet, the marker of which was placed immediately under
the pens of the cardiac levers.      In all the tracings the upper curved
line shows the ventricular contractions, the lower curved line the
auricular contractions, and the broken straight line the moment of
excitation. The descent of the line indicates the opening, the ascent
the closing of the current.
   In the secondary circuit were placed the electrodes for stimulating
the various parts of the frog's heart, and this circuit also could b-
broken or changed at pleasure by means of an interposed double key.
   The heart was stimulated by a single induction shock.                   In
minimal stimulation only the breaking shock was effective, in
maximal stimulation both making and breaking shocks.                The appa
ratus, which is described in a separate note, admitted of the venous-
sinus, auricle, or ventricle being stimulated at will.
   When recording the effects of stimulation of the venous sinus we
speak only of changes in rhythm of auricle and ventricle.
   We shall examine seriatim the results of irritation of each of these.

             On Electrical Stimulation               of   the   Frog's Heart.          457
The temperature         of the room in which the experiments                    were   con
ducted was 67° to 70° F.           The frog employed was, on all occasions,
the Sana temporaria.
                   Stimulation of      the Ventricle       — Minimal.
   On stimulating the ventricle with a single induction shock of
minimal potency we find —
  (1.) That between the commencement of the ventricular systole up
to or nearly up to its maximum there is a refractory period (fig. 1,
                                         Fio.   1.

a and 6) during which stimulation applied to the ventricle has no
effect whatever on that beat of the heart, or the one succeeding        nor        it,
is the auricle in anywise affected.
   (2.) That after the refractory period has elapsed stimulation
causes a reduplication of the beat (fig.     c).     1,
   (3.) The   latency  of this   reduplicated    beat becomes distinctly
shorter as the systole passes into the diastole.     Thus supposing the
value of a  single cardiac systole to be l'-3, stimulation falling just at
the maximum of a beat will cause a reduplicated beat with a latency
of '33. When the stimulation occurs half way down the curve of
relaxation, the latency    *18^or '2, and when applied at the instant
                              is
before the abscissae would have been reached the latency        only '13. is

458                   Drs.  T. L. Brunton and T. Cash.
   (4.) Where acceleration or reduplication occurs, the subsequent
diastolic pause is prolonged, so that the time occupied by the two
beats, the interval between them longer or shorter, and the subse
quent pause, is nearly equal to the time which would be occupied by
two normal beats with their associated diastolic pauses (fig. 1, c).
   (5.) The ventricular reduplication is often associated with -
reduplication of the auricular beat, but in no case has the latter ita
commencement before the former. It is usually, in fact, distinctly
later (fig. 2, a).
   It is to be noted that, minimal stimulation applied to the ventricle
during its refractory period produces no effect on the auricle.

   We may divide each ventricular cycle into three parts, the first
 reaching from the commencement                   of systole nearly np to its
 maximum, the second from nearly the maximum of the systole to its
 end, and the third embracing the whole diastolic period from the end
 of one systole to the beginning of another (vide diagram A) except
                                            A.

               On Electrical Stimulation     of tlie Frog's Heart.          459
     Stimulation applied to the ventricle during the first period has no
effect whatever either in accelerating the occurrence of the second
beat, or altering the length of the subsequent pauses.            This consti
tutes the refractory period.
     Stimulation applied during the second period causes reduplication of
the systole, the next systole succeeding with a constantly diminishing
latency up to the end of the period. When the stimulation is applied
in this period, the two systoles being more or less united, there is no
distinct pause between them, but the diastolic pause succeeding the
second occupies very nearly the interval of time corresponding to two
normal diastolic pauses. In this second period the heart is more
sensitive to the action of minimal stimuli than in the first period. In
the third period, that of acceleration, stimulus applied to the ventricle
hastens the advent of the succeeding systole, and the latent period is
 very short, being nearly equal throughout its whole extent to the
 latency at the end of the second period.         The sensibility of the heart
 to stimuli is scarcely so great in this period as in the second.
     The length of the diastolic pause succeeding the accelerated systole
 is longer than normal, the increase in length being nearly equal to the
 amount of acceleration.
                     Stimulation of  the Ventricle — Maximal.
     When stimuli of maximal potency           are applied to the ventricle
 between the maximum auricular systole and the commencement of
 ventricular systole, the ventricular systole immediately following the
 stimulus is rarely slightly higher than normal, and the diastolic pause
  succeeding it is excessively long — so long, indeed, as to be nearly, if
  not quite, equal to the time which would, as a rule, be occupied by
  two diastoles, so that the time occupied by the systole and diastole
  after stimulation applied at this period of the heart's cycle, is equal
  to the time usually occupied by one systole and two diastolic pauses.
     In most cases this systole was apparently no higher than normal,
  and consequently we cannot with plausibility regard it as a case of
  superposition of two systoles.
     In some cases the time within which this pause may be produced is
  strictly limited to the point indicated ; in others, however, it may
  extend some little distance towards the maximum of systole, though
  it never reaches this. In other words, it may encroach upon the
  refractory    period which we have mentioned when speaking of
  minimal stimuli, although it never extends through the whole of it.
     This phase may occasionally, though rarely, be absent.         Its place is
  then taken by reduplication, or very rarely by insensibility to stimula
  tion, as in the refractory period.
     Reduplication with maximal stimuli occurs during all times of the
  «ycle, except at the very commencement of the systole.

   A very considerable latency is to be observed in cases where
stimulation falls early in the systole.            The latency, when this is the
position of the shock, is usually "5' or even more, and occasionally
where stimulation is coincident with the earliest possible attempt at
systole, nearly the whole beat may lapse before reduplication.
   The latency is greatest when the stimulus is applied at the com
mencement of the ventricular systole (with the exception of its very
beginning), and it gradually decreases towards the end of systole, at
which time it is at a minimum.                 During the diastole the latency
seems to remain constantly the same as at the end of systole. The
later in the phase of ventricular activity the reduplicated systole
commences the more perfect is it.
   In all the points already mentioned our results agree with those of
Marey.
   Stimulation of the ventricle falling before or at the maximum of
 ventricular systole, i.e., during the refractory period of a minimal
stimulation, frequently causes a reduplication of the auricular systole
which holds the same relation to the induced ventricular beat that the
 auricular contraction normally holds to the ventricular.

   Stimulation falling after the maximum of ventricular systole may
cause an induced auricular contraction, but this is nearly synchronous
with, or even subsequent to, the induced ventricular contraction
(fig. 4, a and   b,   and fig. 3, c).

                          Stimulation of Ventricle (maximal)          .
   Sometimes reduplication of the ventricular beat may occur without
reduplication of the ventricular (fig. 3, c).
   These results may be possibly due, in part at least, to direct stimu
lation of the auricle itself by the strong current used to stimulate
the ventricle.
                  Stimulation of the Auricle — Minimal.
   When minimal stimuli are applied to the auricle, there is occa
sionally a refractory period, extending from the beginning to the
maximum of auricular systole.      When the stimulus is applied at the
maximum of auricular systole, or just after                 it,
                                                    sometimes produces

after this point and occasionally on it, will cause     reduplication of  a
auricular and ventricular contractions to occur which may have a-
latency of as much as 1*25 seconds.

462                 Drs.  T. L. Brunton and T. Cash.
   No secondary contraction can usually be produced in the ventricle
till an induced auricular contraction has occurred ; and as the
auricular latency is considerable, the ventricular latency is also very
long.     Thus, should the stimulus producing contraction fell at the
commencement of ventricular systole, the auricle may have a latency
of one second and the ventricle of 1"4 seconds.
   The sensibility of the auricle to minimal stimulation may generally
be divided into three phases : —
    lstly. Stimulation may fall at such a stage of auricular activity that
it does not cause an instantaneous response, but allows the auricle to
pass through its diastole before it causes reduplication.
    2ndly. It falls at such a time that the auricle responds instan
taneously.
    3rdly. About or shortly after the period of auricular maximum,
stimulation may cause inhibition of the auricular and the ventricular
sequential beat.
    Stimulation at any period during the diastole of the auricle until
the abscissa is reached, causes a reduplication. The latency of this
reduplicated beat is shorter the further the diastole is advanced. It
is followed by an induced ventricular beat in ordinary rhythm.
    Stimulation during complete auricular diastole and before systole
commences causes a contraction with very short latency, succeeded by
an induced ventricular contraction.            But it is to be noted that occa
sionally stimulation at this period causes a normal auricular contrac
tion with an appreciable latency, and followed by a ventricular
contraction.
                   Stimulation of    the  Auricle — Maximal.
    Maximal stimulation of the auricle almost always produces some
4effect both on the ventricular and auricular beat : this effect is usually
 one of stimulation, but it may be of apparent inhibition.

              On Electrical Stimulation         of the Frog's Heart.              463
    Maximal stimulation usually induces a ventricular beat whenever it
is applied (fig.   6, a), excepting when it falls just after the summit of
the auricular contraction.
    Stimulation at this point may cause no auricular contraction, but
-n the contrary may induce omission of the subsequent auricular
and ventricnlar beat (fig. 6, 6 2).
    When an auricular beat has been induced by stimulation, it is
f-llowed in the ordinary way by a beat of the ventricle, excepting
when the stimulus is applied to the auricle just at the commencement
of the ventricular systole. In this case an auricular beat may be
induced, which instead of being followed by a corresponding ventri
cular one, is followed, on the contrary, by an omission of the ventri
Oular beat (fig. 6, a 1).
    At this point the latent period may be looked upon as indefinitely
long, as stimulation produces no contraction at all.
    The more closely after this point stimulation is applied the longer is
the ventricular latency.
                   Stimulation of  Venous      Sinus — Minimal.
    The venous sinus appears to be more sensitive to stimulation than
either auricle or ventricle, so that stimuli applied to it produce an
eflect, although they are much slighter than the minimal stimuli of
either auricle or ventricle.
    Stimulation of the venous sinus by a minimal shock is usually
potent to produce some effect or other at every stage of ventricular
activity (fig.  7,  b).
                                     Fig.    7-

usually causes omission of the following sequential beat of both anricle
and ventricle.
    This period may occasionally be slightly prolonged into systole.
    Stimulation of the sinus at all other periods of ventricular activity
causes a reduplication of the systole. This induced ventricular systole
is preceded by an induced auricular systole, and therefore has the
prolonged latency before referred to.
    Stimulation falling at the commencement of ventricular systole may
cause auricular reduplication with ventricular omission (fig. 7, a).
    In consequence of the long latency, we find all ventricular curves
separated by a distinct interval from (their) reduplications.
                  Stimulation of Venous Sinus — Maximal.
    The period during which stimulation causes ventricular omission is
well marked, and in some cases extends into the ventricular systole as
it advances towards its maximum, though the effect is never produced
at the maximum.
    This omission of ventricular beat is most usually associated with a
reduplication of the auricular beat, the second auricular contraction
occurring within that ventricular systole at the commencement of
¦which the shock was communicated (fig. 8, 6).

     Reduplication occurs in all phases except at the period when stimu

 usually short, as in the case of a ventricle stimulated directly,

induced ventricular, except when stimulation falls before the maximum
of ventricular systole, in which case there is usually a regular sequence
of auricular and ventricular contraction (fig. 8, c).
    Usually after the maximum of ventricular systole stimulation
causes a reduplicated beat with short latency, inside of which curve
falls that of the induced auricular contraction ; however, gennine
sequential      reduplication of auricle and ventricle with long latency
 is not uncommon.           Not unfrequently, after repeated stimulation of
 the sinus, the heart assumes a new rhythm, which may be twice as
rapid as it was originally, and though omission of the alternate beat may
 still be produced by stimulation at the time already indicated, the organ
 returns again to its accelerated pace. In time, if stimulation be with
 held, the rhythm lapses again into the normal. The auricle shares in
 the ventricular excitement (fig. 9).

  movements had become slow and torpid it was killed, without loss of
  blood, and placed on the cardiograph, already descr ibed, the tempe

  on the metal bars supporting            the animal.        The apparatus was
  employed in the same manner as in our observations on the effect of
  electrical stimuli on the normal heart, and the same order was observed

     Effects of Electrical Stimulation of the Ventricle
      The contraction of the chilled frog's heart, as is well known, lasts
  for longer time than in the ordinary condition.                  When minimal
   stimuli are applied to the ventricle (fig. 10) it is found that there is
   a distinct refractory period, extending from the beginning of systole up

to the last third         of the summit       of the curve in             the accompanying

  It   is,
        therefore, always longer than in the normal heart. After the
refractory period has passed, stimulation causes reduplication    tie                  of
ventricular beat. The later on in the diastole that the stimulus falls
the shorter       is   the latency.
                           Ventricular   Stimulation — Maximal.
   Stimulation sometimes causes omission when applied at the very
commencement of systole.      All stimulation thereafter applied causes
a reduplication of the ventricular systole, with a latency that becomes
shorter the later the stimulation  applied. If auricular
                                             is                                reduplication

                      Auricular Stimulation — Minimal.
    A  refractory period is obviously present, but it is not of so great
length as in the case of ventricular stimulation. It may be said to
extend usually through the maximum of auricular systole (fig. 12),
and even up to near the maximum of ventricular systole ; occa
sionally it exists only just at its commencement.

                        Stimulation   of Auricle (minimal)  .
    As regards the reduplication, we find that as in the case of the
normal heart, a long latency prevails, because an induced auricular
systole must occur before the ventricle contracts again.              But if the
stimulation fall just    at  the    time    when    the  abscissa is reached, or
rather before this point, a ventricular contraction may exceptionally
be produced with a short latency, and the auricular induced contrac
tion succeeds it.
                      Auricular Stimulation — Maximal.
    The same features are to be observed as in the last section, except
that there is no refractory period (fig. 13).
    Stimulation in all phases of the ventricular cycle usually causes a
reduplicated auricular and ventricular beat. Should the stimulation
fall before the ventricular maximum is attained, the auricular re
duplication precedes the ventricular in the ordinary way, but should
the stimulation fall, after the ventricular maximum, the auricular
reduplication is exceptionally synchronous with, or subsequent to,
the ventricular : usually, however, the induced ventricular beat pre
cedes in ordinary rhythm the induced ventricular.

    A  refractory period may be present on minimal stimulation, nearly
 up  to  the maximum of ventricular systole.            Thereafter reduplication

  the ventricular reduplication is preceded by the auricular induced
  contraction (fig. 14). Thus stimulation applied just before the ven
  tricular relaxation is completed, instead of having an instantaneous
  ventricular and auricular response resulting from stimulation of
  auricle or ventricle, has a long latency, -wherein the auricle redupli
  cates.    The further on in the systole the stimulation is applied, the
  shorter is the latent period, and the more perfect the reduplicated
 contraction.
                   Stimulation of  the Venous Sinus —Maximal.
     Omission may be caused by stimulation applied at the commence
 ment of systole, or reduplication may occur in all phases (fig. 15).
     Reduplication has the longest latency at the commencement of
 systole, and there is true auricular precedence up to or beyond the
 maximum in this phase. In the decline of systole, after the maximum
 is passed, and the abscissa has been nearly reached, there is occasion
 ally reduplication with short latency, the auricular and ventricular
 contractions being synchronous.
                        Action of Heat on the Heart.
     In  this series of experiments the pithed frog in which the brain and
 spinal cord had been destroyed, was laid upon a metal plate, the tempe
 rature of which was gradually raised by means of a flame beneath it.
                       Ventricular Stimulation — Minimal.
     The refractory phase is generally wanting in the ventricular systole,
 but it may be present in exceptional cases, not unfrequently in tho
 same tracing in which stimulation most generally produces reduplica
 tion (fig. 16).
    It may be noted that irregularity of response to stimulation is one
of the characteristics of the heated condition. Stimulation usually
causes reduplication.       Should stimulation fall at the commencement of
ventricular systole, no effect is produced till the whole cycle of the systole
has been passed through, when reduplication by a very perfect systole
occurs. Latencies diminish in proportion as the stimulation occurs
later in the systole of the heart. Reduplication occurring in response
to stimulation falling at the maximum is often demonstrated by a
beat originating when the relaxation after systole is completed, and
therefore distinct from the original beat : this is due to the fact that
the curve of the heated heart is much shorter in duration, and
therefore the reduplication falls outside the systole during which
stimulation occurs, the latency being actually shorter, however, than
in  the unheated heart.

                 Ventricular Stimulation — Maximal stimuli.
    When stimuli of maximal intensity are applied to the ventricle of
tlie heated heart, we notice (fig. 17) : —
    (1) That there is no refractory period ; (2) Stimuli at the com
mencement of the ventricular systole may cause omission of the
succeeding heat ; (3) Reduplication occurs at all phases, and has the

the same rule as in minimal stimulation ; (5J The reduplicated beat

      The value of any beat and its reduplication, with the time inter
 vening and of the succeeding pause, was about equal to two normal
 cardiac cycles.     Occasionally a double reduplication, or a series of
 contractions, resulted from a single stimulation.
                   Auricular Stimulation — Minimal Stimuli.
    There is apparently no refractory period.             All stimuli cause
 reduplication, and in all cases induced auricular systole precedes an
 induced ventricular systole.        This occurs even in advanced auricular
 diastole, when occasionally        in the normal heart a simultaneous
 auricular  and   ventricular  systole results.
                  Auricular Stimulation — Maximal Stimuli.
     There is no refractory period. Stimulation just after the auricular
 maximum has been passed frequently causes an apparent omission of
 the following beat.
     Stimulation before the maximum of the ventricular systole causes
  an induced ventricular beat preceded by an auricular contraction.
     After the maximum, stimulation usually has the same effect, but
  occasionally causes an instantaneous reduplication of both auricular
  and ventricular beats.
     A reduplicated ventricular beat is of the character already described.
             Stimulation of   the Venous   Sinus — Minimal Stimuli.
      The venous     sinus  in its general absence of a refractory phase
  shows a resemblance      to the ventricle, but it may manifest the same
  exception in exhibiting it.
      When this occasional refractory period is present it may exist
   during active systole, and up to its maximum. It is exceptionally
   present in cases which as a rule show no refractory period.
      Stimulation falling before the maximum of systole (fig. 18, a ventri

the end of systole.
                    Venous Sinus — Maximal Stimulation.
    Occasionally  a  stimulation of maximum strength falling at the
•commencement of the ventricular systole causes an apparent omission
of the following pulsation ; but this result is not so frequent as in the
case of the normal heart.       Usually a distinct reduplication occurs at
•whatever time in the cycle stimulation falls (fig. 19).

    The reduplication is at all times, except in the last stage of systole,
 preceded by an auricular contraction.
    The auricnlar induced contraction appears to follow stimulation
more rapidly than in the case of the normal heart.              Therefore the
induced ventricular contraction (fig. 19, ventricular tracing alone
given) which follows the auricular has a shorter latency than is
 normally the case. The heating process having been carried so far
 8hat a rapid cardiac rhythm with imperfect systole has resulted, it is
 often found that there is an indifference to stimulation in the so-called
refractory period, or even in all phases of the cardiac cycle alternating

          On the  Effect of Strychnia          uvox the Frog's  Heart.
    The apparatus used in this series of experiments was identical with
 that employed in the investigation of stimuli applied to the frog's
 heart. The frog was killed by the brain being destroyed, and a small

dose  of strychnia -was then    introduced into the dorsal lymph sac. As
soon as the effect of the drug upon the spinal cord was evidenced by
distinct spasm, the heart was rapidly exposed, placed on the car
diograph, and stimulation applied.           The same order will be observed
as in the description of the experiments on the normal heart.
                  Stimulation of     the Ventricle  — Minimal.
   On applying a minimal stimulus to the strychnia heart (fig.              20)

refractory period. Stimulation has usually no effect, not only when
applied before the maximum of the systole as in the normal heart,
but also in the maximum, and often far into relaxation. After the
phase has passed the stage of reduplication ensues.              Reduplication
is very complete ; its latency becomes diminished as diastole advances.
The reduplicated ventricular beat is succeeded by an auricnlar
pnlsation. After the customary pause, the heart resumes its wonted
rhythm. It is rarely that stimulation falling at the commencement of
ventricular systole causes inhibition.          If the auricle is unstimulated
and its rhythm is unaltered, there is short latency for the ventricular
reduplication. If the auricle is stimulated and contracts before the
ventricle, there is long latency, but the latter is rarely seen when a
refractory phase is present.
               Ventricular Stimulation — Maximal Stimuli.
   In this case no refractory period exists. An inhibitory period exists
occasionally but with this exception, all stimulation produces redupli-

cation (fig. 21).    Should stimulation fall at the commencement of
systole, the latency is long, nearly equal to the length of the beat ;
and the reduplication is very complete.
   Stimulation at the maximum of systole has a latency of about
two-fifths of a second, and thereafter during the subsidence of the
ventricle, the period of latency rapidly diminishes. The most perfect
beat of reduplication is produced by stimulation at the commencement
of systole, or after relaxation of the ventricle.
                    Stimulation of   the  Auricle — Minimal.
   It  is but rarely that we      see a   refractory period whilst applying
minimal stimuli to the auricle.           Usually, stimulation at all times
causes a reduplicated beat, the auricular reduplication preceding that

of the ventricle in the usual rhythm. On stimulation, an auricular

 usual point does the ventricle commence its systole (fig. 22).
                   Stimulation of    the  Auricle — Maximal.
    There is no refractory period.       Occasionally the stimulus falling at
 the very commencement of the ventricular systole will cause inhibition
 or coincidence of the following beat, or it may cause a reduplication
 with a latency of about one second (fig. 23).

           Stimulation of the Venous Sinus — Minimal Stimuli-
   With minimal stimulation of the venous sinus there is no refractory
period except occasionally for an instant at the maximum of auricular
systole.    Reduplication occurs at all phases of the ventricular systole.
Length of latency depends upon whether the stimulation induces an
auricular contraction or not.         If the auricular systole follows the
stimulus, then the ventricular latency must be long (fig. 24).

                     Stimulation of Venous Sinus (minimal).
   It is longer if stimulation falls at the commencement of ventricular
systole, because at that phase, until the auricle has contracted, no
ventricular reduplication occurs.         Occasionally, though rarely, and
that after the maximum of ventricular contraction, auricular redupli
cation follows, or is synchronous with the ventricular systole, and then
latency is invariably short. Reduplication with prolonged latency-
probably from auricular reduplication, is well seen in the appended
tracing (fig. 25).

    The stimulation at the end of relaxation in one case causes redupli
cation of auricle, coinciding with that of the ventricle.
    Tho tracing illustrates the rule that when the sinus is stimulated
no refractory period is observed as regards the ventricular redupli
 cation.

   Should the exciting shock fall at such a time as to cause an
instantaneous auricular systole, we find this systole is nearly syn
chronous with that of the ventricle, and that the latter has a short
latency, but should the shock fall so that the auricle responds by a
gennine contraction, the ventricular reduplication follows with a long
latency.
   Inhibition of the ventricular with reduplication of the auricular
beat may result occasionally from stimulation of the venous sinus.

   The construction of a simple piece of apparatus has enabled us to
obtain curves much more striking than those which appeared in the
foregoing paper,   as  they represent   a  far greater variation of tempe

   Instead of the gutta-percha support for the heart already described,
a  hollow copper pan of similar shape was employed.         It was provided
 with influx and efflux tubes, and insulated below by a plate of ivory in
 which ran also the electrodes destined for the stimulation of the sinus.
 This was connected with the usual support passing over the body.
 Upon minimal stimulation of the ventricle itself the succession of
 auricular and ventricular contraction is illustrated in the charts A 1--4
 here inserted.  It is seen that the action of cold modifies considerably
 the relation between the ventricular contraction and the succeeding
 auricular beat. In A2 we find a reduplicated ventricular beat suc
 ceeded by a normal auricular contraction.
    In At cooled through about 2-5° C, the ventricle responds to the
 same stimulation, and the wave does not pass upward to the auricle ;
 and in A4, in which the contraction and relaxation of the heart had
 become very slow from a further reduction of 2°, we find the auricular
 rhythm is regular in spite of ventricular reduplication.        There is in

                                             Auricular Stimulation.
   Many additional experiments upon cooled hearts have tended to
show that  it is very rarely that stimulation of considerable strength
calls forth a ventricnlar beat, preceding or coexistent with the
auricular.   Usually at all phases of stimulation which cause a re
duplication of the auricular beat, the ventricular succeeds in normal
relationship (B 1 and 2). There is an exception to this, however,
which is frequently demonstrated ; this is, that whilst the auricular
beat is reduplicated the ventricular is not, but is succeeded by a long
diastolic pause (Bt), after which the auricle takes up its old rhythm.
Still more rarely stimulation just before commencement of ventricular
systole causes omission of both succeeding auricular and ventricnlar
beats (B4) .
   The latency of reduplication varies considerably in minimal stimu
lation of the auricle, but this variation is not so mnch owing to loss
of time in the auricular as in the ventricular reduplication.  Thus in
Cj stimulation at the end of auricular relaxation, ventricular latency

   On the other hand, more powerful stimulation of the auricle causes

    The reduplication of the ventricular beat varies in regard to the

 stimulation falls near the commencement of systole, auricular redupli

    In some cases, heating a frog's heart through 40-5 C. may fail to
 obliterate entirely the period of resistance to stimulation.                   Heat,
however, in the same experiment may be shown to shorten the refractory
period much, and to limit it to the very commencement of ventricular
systole (in stimulation applied to the ventricle). The series of tracings
given were taken from a large specimen of Rana esculenta, which had
 been kept at a low temperature            for a considerable time before the
 experiment.       The   tracing  obtained  at room temperature (K) is there
fore that of a cold heart, and the refractory period extends up to the
 commencement of relaxation after systole.            After hot water had been
ran through the support for 5', and the temperature raised about
 2° C, we find diastole increased and systole much shortened ; at the
same time there. is a refractory period as extensive as in the cold
heart, that is to say, extending to the commencement of relaxation K2.
    In K3 after heat had been applied 10', and the temperature raised
another degree, stimulation at an earlier phase produces redupli
cation.     Heated still further, K4, there is reduplication at systolic
maximum, and at K5 everywhere except at the very commencement
of systole.     After heating through about 5° we still have a refractory
period, whilst the curve has been reduced from l"-4 to 44'8.               In many
cases, however, the same extent of heat may obliterate the refractory
period completely.         The heart which yielded these curves passed into
rigor without showing the abolition.            In the heated heart, of which
the ventricle is stimulated, we may find that the auricle does not in
any way participate in the ventricular excitement, but continues to
beat in its usual rhythm.           Thus, when the heated heart yields a
series of contractions in answer to a single stimulation — a result not
unfrequently obtained — the auricle does not reduplicate, but may

 observed on the part of the auricle, but the counterpart may be occa

    There is thus a disturbance of both muscle-wave and nervous

only after there has been a reduplication of its beat, and does not
often occur, so far as we have seen, when stimulation, applied
to the auricle itself (M), originates a systole there, for then the

ventricle follows in due course ; we should therefore regard the
exhaustion of the ventricle after its unusual activity as the cause of
its quiescence after the normal auricular beat. Should stimulation be
applied to the auricle during ventricular diastole, a reduplicated
auricular beat succeeded by a ventricular at once occurs.                  In all
phases this natural sequence is maintained, though sometimes at the
end of its systole the auricular reduplication may be -5". Whilst
a long pause follows this reduplication, it is very rarely that a
stimulation of the auricle produces omission of the succeeding
auricular and ventricular reduplication.
    In stimulating the venous sinus, however, omission of the following
ventricular beat is frequently produced when the shock falls at the
commencement of ventricular systole (Nj), but we may find that there
 is an impulse propagated to the auricle, for this may reduplicate
 whilst the ventricle remains quiescent (No).

 reduplication is succeeded by a ventricular (N2), and after the
 maximum, and during the diastole of the ventricle, the induced
auricular beat may occur synchronously with the ventricular, or it
 may precede it in regular course.
    Both of the charts Nj and N3 are taken from a heart warmed
 through about 5° C, and Nt gives a tracing of the same, in which
 stimulation does not occur.
    In the stronger tendency to cause omission of a ventricular beat-
 as well as in the frequent occurrence of an auricular contraction
 coincident with or succeeding the ventricular, when stimulation fails
 after ventricular maximum or in diastole, we see a marked contrast
 in the reaction of the venous sinus and the auricle to stimulation.
    From the charts 0^ 02, 0t we see that the latency of the auricular
 beat varies.   Thus stimulation occurring just at the end of auricular
 relaxation (Oi) causes an instantaneous reduplication, whilst durin?
 diastole proper it has a reduplication with a latency of -2". In the
 former case auricular induced systole precedes the veutricular, in the
 latter they occur at the same moment (03, Os).

   In order to test the correctness of the conclusion               that strychnia
lengthens the refractory period, we placed frogs in which the medulla
and cord only existed on the cardiograph. The effects of stimulation
were then observed, and subsequently a small dose of strychnia was
injected into the dorsal lymph sac ; as soon as the resulting spasm was
well developed, stimulation was again applied, the strength of stimu
lation and the position of the electrodes remaining constant.
   Thus, in fig. P2, a frog's heart, in which active circulation was

     It  may happen that stronger stimulation before the maximum
 of systole is reached, causes an auricular beat, which precedes
in normal rhythm the induced ventricular contraction.                         This is
observed when the electrodes are placed near the base of the ventricle,
or when stimulation is passed through the same portion of the heart
from the float to an electrode placed beneath the h-art upon the
supporting shelf.          After the maximum of systole, however, the
auricular contraction succeeds the induced ventricular.                   Both these
facts are demonstrated in fig. Q, in which this occasional increased
 auricular excitability is shown.
                              Auricular Stimulation.
     Occasionally maximal stimulation applied to the auricle produces at
 all times an auricular contraction succeeded by a ventricular ; more
 usually, however, this relationship exists only up to the maximum of
 systole     (ventricular), and thereafter the induced auricular beat
 succeeds the ventricular.
     Should stimulation cause an instantaneous               auricular  systole,   then
 the ventricular reduplication has a latency of nearly equal value at all
 times at which it may occur, but should there be, as in fig. Bj, a
 considerable auricular latency (about 1") then the ventricular latency
 is liable to great variations.
      At the maximum of auricular systole, fig. R3, we have an imme
 diate auricular response, and a ventricular latency of "4"; and in
 tig. R (3) there is an almost instantaneous ventricular systole, with an
 auricular latency of about 15". The diastolic pause is the longer the
  later stimulation falls.      In   fig.  Rj it  is "9" ; in fig. R2 it is   1"49  ; in
  fig. R3  it is 2"-3.
      Stimulation falling just after maximum of auricular systole,               and  at
  the commencement of ventricular systole, may cause in addition to the
  results enumerated, omission of the succeeding auricular and ventri
  cular contractions, or reduplication of the auricular, but omission of
  the succeeding ventricular (fig. S).

             On Electrical Stimulation  of the Frog's Heart.         489
   Thus the induced auricular contraction in this instance, instead of
passing    a motor impulse downwards to the ventricle, appears not
only to check the reduplication, but greatly to prolong the
diastole.
   It is easily recognised from the auricular tracing that the induced
contraction is one of the unfilled cavities (fig. S), but though little
or no blood passes into the ventricle, a positive effect upon the latter
is still produced.

   As regards the relationship of the auricular reduplication to           the
time of stimulation, we find the latency of the auricle occasionally
varying in length, but usually it has very nearly equal values, except
when the shock, falling during ventricular relaxation, calls forth a
simultaneous auricular and ventricular contraction, and in this cast;
latency is reduced.       It is to be noted that this induced auricular
contraction does not cause another induced ventricular systole : its
further effects seem to be lost or dissipated.
   At two points in Chart T, ventricular systole being advanced half
way and -6 of the way to its maximum, the auricular latency is equal,
and when at the end of ventricular relaxation the auricle contracts at
the same time as the ventricle, the latency is still about the same.
The time lost, therefore, in this case is in ventricular reduplication :
either the impulse from the auricle is transmitted at different speeds
at different time3, or it meets at different times with variation in the
excitability of the ventricle.      The later in the systole the stimulation
falls the less  is the  resistance    to the transmission of the impulse or
the greater the excitability of the ventricle.
   The whole subject of the rhythmical contraction of the frog's heart
and its stimulation and inhibition is a very complex and difficult one.
The points upon which our present research seems to ns to throw
some light are the nature and mode of transmission of the stimuli
which one cavity transmits to another in the ordinary process of
rhythmical contraction. Marey's researches have 8hown that in the
ventricle itself there is a time when stimulation applied to it has no
apparent action ; this time is, however, in many cases of very short
duration and limited to the commencement of ventricular systole.
At the commencement of ventricular systole stimulation without
provoking contraction causes often a positive effect, namely, a greatly
prolonged diastolic pause, which we have been inclined to regard as
due to omission of a ventricular contraction.

On Electrical Stimulation of the frog's Heart. 41U
492                  Drs. T. L. Brunton and T. Cash.
   It   Beemed    of interest to ascertain whether a similar condition
occurred    in the other cavities of the frog's heart. We find that in the
anricnlar stimulation about or shortly after the period of maximum
contraction of the auricle may cause inhibition of the next auricular
beat.
   We have not yet succeeded in registering the         contractions of the
venous sinus with sufficient accuracy to enable us       positively to deter
mine the occurrence of a similar refractory period      in the venous sinus
itself, but the results we have obtained lead us to      hope  that we shall
soon be able to do so.
    Another interesting consideration is, whether the stimulus which
each cavity of the heart transmits to the succeeding one, consists in the
propagation of an actual muscular wave, or in the propagation of an
impulse along the nerves.        The observations of Gaskell have given
very great importance to the muscular wave occurring in each cavity
of the heart of cold-blooded animals as a stimulus to the contraction
of the next succeeding cavity. Our observations appear to us to
show that while this is an important factor, it is not the only one in
the transmission of stimuli.       We have observed that stimulation of
the auricle rarely or never causes contraction of the ventricle unless the
auricle also contracts. When stimulation of the auricle causes both
itself and the ventricle to contract, the auricular contraction precedes
the ventricular one in such a way that we might be justified in
regarding the ventricular contraction as due to the propagation of
the contractile wave from the auricle to the ventricle.        It would also
appear    that  a contractile wave  may  be  propagated   backwards,   for on
stimulation of the ventricle we have observed the contraction of the
ventricle produced by stimulation has been succeeded by an auricular
contraction such as might be supposed to be due to propagation of
the contractile wave back from the ventricle to the auricle.           While
 these observations appear to show that the propagation of the con
 tractile wave from one cavity of the heart to another is of importance
 in keeping up the rhythmical sequence, we consider that stimuli are
also propagated from one chamber of the heart to another through
 nervous channels : — thus we find that irritation of the venous sinus
 will sometimes produce simultaneous contractions of the auricle and
 ventricle, instead of the ventricular beat succeeding the anricnlar in
 the usual way. This we think is hardly consistent Vith the hypothesis
 that a stimulus consists of the propagation of a muscular wave only
 from the auricle to the ventricle.
    As additional evidence we may notice the occurrence of an auricular
 beat followed by absence or inhibition of a ventricular beat as the
 result of stimulation of the auricle, or venous sinus. Moreover, we
 have noticed in the heated heart the occurrence of groups of regular

 toit, while the auricle has continued to heat with its ordinary un
 altered rhythm undisturbed by the ventricular excitement.
    It not however our purpose to do more in this paper than state
         is
 the results we have hitherto obtained, and we shall therefore reserve
 to
  a   future communication the consideration of this and some other
 questions of importance closely allied to it.
    Another question      the nature of the inhibitory influence exerted
                         is
by one cavity of the heart upon another.            Marey had shown that
 stimulation of the ventricle during        great part of the refractory
                                                     a
 period exercises an inhibitory instead of a motor action upon the
ventricle itself. It might be supposed then that a stimulus of either
kind, whether proceeding from -the auricle in the form of a contractile
wave, or a nervous impulse, might produce inhibition of the ventricle,
provided the stimulus reached it during that part of the refractory
period in which stimulation usually causes inhibition.           From our
observations     itseems that the inhibition of the ventricle which may
follow stimulation of the auricle         not due to the muscular wave
                                            is
propagated from the auricle and striking the ventricle during
the refractory period.       In fig.     we notice that the auricular
                                            6,
contraction succeeded by ventricular inhibition occurs after the
refractory period of the ventricle has passed; we must, therefore,
look upon the inhibition as due to the propagation of a nervous
impulse from one cavity to another.          In the auricle we find tbat
stimulation may produce inhibition of the auricular and ventricular
beats, or of the ventricular beats alone.     We may, therefore, suppose
that the stimulus applied to the auricle acts upon two different
nervous mechanisms seeing that
                        ;                enabled to inhibit the ventricular
                                           it   is
beats without affecting the auricular ones, we are unable to say
precisely what the effect of single stimulus applied to the venous
                                       a
sinus     upon the sinus itself, but here we note that the same result
         is
will follow stimulation of the sinus, as of the auricle, viz., inhibition
of the ventricular without inhibition of the anricnlar beat, or in
hibition of both together.
    As has been already pointed out by Professor Marey, the refractory
period      increased when the heart
           is                               artificially cooled.
                                                 is               We hav-
also found that there         isprolongation of the time during which
                                   a
stimulation causes an inhibition or omission of the following systole.
    It very seldom that stimulation of the auricles or of the venous
      is
sinus causes a ventricular contraction without auricular systole pre
ceding    itin the ordinary rhythm. In this respect the action of the
heart offers     acontrast to the normal. Though the muscular wave
started in the auricle      usually succeeded by a ventricular contrac
                            is
tion, it  may occasionally be succeeded by        ventricular inhibition, or
                                                         a
auricular stimulation may be followed by inhibition of both auricl-
 and ventricle.

494                   Drs.  T. L. Brunton and T. Cash.
   The propagation of the wave in an upward direction, viz., from
ventricle to auricle, is not so regular as in the normal heart, the time
elapsing, when it does occur between the ventricular and auricular
systole, bearing a relationship to the degree of cold produced. Whilst
the ventricle is reduplicating in response to direct stimulation, the
auricle may maintain its regular rhythm.            Stimulation of the venous
sinus almost invariably gives an auricular contraction at all times
preceding the ventricular. It has been already shown that in the
case of the normal heart stimulation in advanced diastole frequently
causes a spontaneous auricular and ventricular contraction, cr a
ventricular beat preceding the auricular.
   In the heated heart we have noticed, in addition to the -xcessive
diminution or abolition of the refractory period in the ventricle
already observed by Marey, that usually the refractory period in the
auricle entirely disappears.         A single stimulation of the ventricle
sometimes gives rise to a series of contractions with incomplete
relaxation intervening. After this has occurred, or after a simple
reduplication has been caused, it often happens that the auricular
beat occurring in normal sequence is not followed by ventricular,
which seems to show a temporary state of exhaustion of the ventricle.
In the heated heart the duration of a systole is so short that two beats
immediately succeeding one another may be perfectly distinct, while,
in the normal heart, the second one would have fallen within the
time of the systole of the first, so that it could only have appeared, if
it were possible at all, as an increase either of the height or length of
the first systole.      Inhibition occurs in the heated heart as well as in
the normal, which is most frequently observed upon stimulation of
the venous sinus, and it is frequently at this time associated with a
reduplicated auricular contraction.          The effect of strychnia is to pro
long the refractory period of the ventricle. Stimulation of the ventricle
is frequently succeeded by contraction of the auricle.                 There is an
increased tendency for stimulation of the ventricle to induce a beat of
the auricle preceding the ventricular systole.           There is less tendency
for the stimulation of the venous sinus or auricle to induce a beat of
the ventricle succeeded by one of the auricle ; and, indeed, this only
occurs when the stimulus falls just at the end of the ventricular
systole, i.e., when the ventricle itself is most sensitive.             These facts
seem to indicate that the nervous channels are more active in trans
mitting stimuli, both downwards from the venous sinus to the auricle
and ventricle, and from the ventricle back to the auricle.
   In its effect upon the refractory period, and in the tendency it
produces to maintain the regular rhythm, the action of strychnia
agrees with that of cold, as shown in the present series of experiments ;
but, as we have already shown in a former paper,* its effect in causing

   There are many other points on which we think that a fuller con
sideration of our experiments will throw light, but to take them up at
present would involve too lengthy a discussion of doubtful points in
the physiology of the frog's heart, and so we must reserve them for a
future time.

     OBITUARY NOTICES OF FELLOWS DECEASED.
   In  the decease of Professor William Stan8ey Jevons, science and
philosophy, both, have suffered a great loss. Since the departure of
Boole and De Morgan —names which are ever on the tongne of
philosophical mathematicians — no one has taken a more prominent
part in the cultivation of symbolical logic than the accomplished
man whose untimely death we have now to deplore.          To the general
public Professor Jevons was best known, perhaps, by his researches
on our coal supply, his works on political economy, and his papers
on various social questions of the day.     His text-books for beginners
have had an extensive circulation, and have proved highly serviceable
to the class for which they were intended.       His essays on currency
and finance, on capital and labour, and on questions affecting the
social life of the people, are also well known.    But his reputation as
a thinker and writer may be permitted to rest on his investigations
into the principles of science and his contributions to a calculus
of deductive reasoning.      Bringing to his studies and researches not
only a well furnished mind, but also a rare faculty for experiment
and a taste for mechanical contrivances, he was enabled to embody
the results of his intellectual labours in forms at once original and
attractive. The instrument which he invented for the mechanical
performance of logical inference, an account of which is given in the
Transactions of our Society, could never have been devised by a man
who was only a pure mathematician, or a pure logician. It is the
" fruit of the grafting of an
                                  experimental genius on a philosophical
genius."    This peculiarity gave to his writings a special interest and
value, and secured for them a wide circle of readers.
   William Stanley Jevons was born at Liverpool on the 1st of
September, 1835.      His father, Thomas Jevons, was an iron merchant
in that city, and his mother who wrote some poems, and edited the
" Sacred Offering," was the eldest daughter of William Roscoe, the
anthor of the well-known biographies of Lorenzo de Medici and Leo X.
His earlier education was received at the High School of the Me
chanics' Institution, and at a private school in his native city. After
wards he was sent to London, where for twelve months he attended
the classes of University College School.      At the age of sixteen he
entered University College and commenced the usual course of study
in arts and sciences, matricnlating in 1852 in London University
with honours in botany and chemistry. In 1853 he received, through
Mr. Graham, of the Mint, the appointment of Assayer to the Australian
   vo8. xxxv.                                                  b

                                         11
 Royal Mint, at Sydney. He had just before won the gold medal is
 chemistry, at his College, and was working at the time, along with
 his cousin, Dr. Roscoe, in the Chemical Laboratory of Professor
 A. W. Williamson.        On receiving the appointment he at once threw
 himself into the intricate processes of gold and silver assay, and by a
 diligent course of study in London, under Mr. Graham, and at Paris,
 under the authorities of the mint there, quickly qualified himself for
 the duties of an office which he filled with conspicuous ability and
 success for five years.    His leisure at Sydney was devoted to scienti6c
 pursuits, more particularly to the study of the meteorology of the
 district, a subject which up to that time had been very little cultivated.
 The results of his observations, extending over the whole period of
 his residence in the colony, were embodied in a pamphlet entitled—
 " Some Data concerning the Climate of Australia and New Zealand."
 During this period he published also a paper,
                                                             " On the Cirrous
 Forms of Cloud, with remarks on other Forms of Cloud" ("PhiL
                                "
 Mag.," 1857), and another On the Geological Origin of Australia and
 Earthquakes in New South Wales" (" Sydney Mag.," 1858).
    But his tastes and powers fitted him for higher pursuits than those
 which chiefly occupied his time at Sydney, and in 1858 he resolved to
 relinquish his post there, and to return to England that he might
 resume and complete his University course.            It was a bold step for
 him to take, for it involved the surrender of a career full of promise
as to material advantages : but Jevons throughout life was animated
 by a pure and simple-hearted love for4 scientific labour.            Writing to
his cousin in January, 1859, he says:          "I   feel an utter distaste for
money making-       but on  the  contrary   ever  become   more devoted to my
favourite subjects of study. Perhaps you think             I am too varied and
desultory in my employments, which is partly true, but you know I
am yet in a transition state.       I told you long since that I intended
exchanging     the  physical for  the moral    and logical sciences, in which
my forte will really be found to lie.        I like and respect most of the
physical   sciences  well enough,   but they   never  really had my affections.
I should be glad indeed to follow out my subject of the Clouds and
the movements of the atmosphere, because I feel sure              I  could place
it in a new position altogether; perhaps         I may spare time for this in
England, but I shall make it a secondary thing.                 I   have almost
determined to spend a year at College before looking out for any

    Returning to England, he went on with his studies at University
 College, won various distinctions in his classes, and in 1860 proceeded
 to the degree of B.A. at London University.                Two years later he
graduated as Master of Arts with the Gold Medal in the branch
 of Logic, Philosophy, and Political Economy. Shortly after taking his
 B.A. degree he began to write for Watts's Chemical Dictionary. His
 articles, eight in number, relate to Clouds, Gold Assay, and Instruments
 employed in Chemical Analysis ; they occupy altogether nearly sixty
 closely printed pages of the work. To the National Review (1861) he
 contributed an article on " Light and Sunlight
                                                        " and
                                                         ;       to the London
              Review              article          "
 Quarterly             (1862) an           on the    Spectrum." Meanwhile
 his thoughts seem to have been turning from the physical to the
 mental sciences, and to questions in economics.
    At the Cambridge Meetiug of the British Association in 1862, Mr.
 Jevons communicated to the Statistical Section two papers, abstracts
 of which were printed in the Report, one entitled " On the Study of
 Periodical Commercial Fluctuations," and the other, " Notice of a
 General Mathematical Theory of Political Economy." About the
 same time he prepared two charts or diagrams published by Stanford,
 showing — (1.) The weekly accounts of the Bank of England, the
 quantity of notes in circulation, and the minimum rate of discount
 since 1844; and (2.) The price of the funds, the price of wheat, and
 the rate of discount since 1731. The diagrams represent to the eye
 and to the mind all the useful results of tables containing no fewer
 than 125,000 figures, which Mr. Jevons had compiled with great care
 and labour. . When engaged on this work he was much struck with
 the enormous rise of prices about the year 1853, and was in con
 sequence led to suspect a serious depreciation of the standard of value.
 Grappling with the difficulties of the inquiry, he examined with care
 the various causes of fluctuation in prices, seeking to distinguish
 between the temporary and the permanent.            His views on the subject
 were embodied in an essay entitled
                                           " A serious Fall in the Value of
 Gold ascertained, and its social Effects set forth." In these papers will
 be found the germs of ideas and methods more fully developed in some
 of his later writings.
    In 1863 Mr. Jevons received an appointment in connexion with
 Owens College, Manchester.            That institution was then in its
 infancy, but full of vigorous life, and growing rapidly in strength and
stature.      Increasing demands were made upon the time of the
                                                                    I2

 Professors,   who had     to perform, in addition          to their   own    proper
 dnties, those which are now assigned to lecturers and assistants. It
 became necessary, therefore, to extend the teaching powers of tk
 College, and it was resolved as a first step to appoint a college tutor
 to assist the students in their various studies. This office Mr. Jevons
 was prevailed       upon to accept. Few men could have been found so
 competent to      fill
                     it,    his fulness of knowledge and versatility         of
                                                                          mind
   qualifying him for the work in a very remarkable degree. "The
   multiplicity of the London University system," writes one                  of
                                                                             his
                " had at nt< time
  colleagues,                        any terrors for him, and   I  have known
  very few men so admirably endowed as he was with the            continuation
  of force and elasticity necessary for confronting it." For three year<
  he served the College in this capacity with distinguished ability and
  success.     In 1866 some changes occurred in the personnel                  of
                                                                             the
  teaching staff, and Mr. Jevons was elected to         a professorship.    The
  chairs of Logic and Political Economy being united, were intrusted                   to
  him, and in this new position he found employment entirely adapted
  to his gifts and tastes.         Logic had become his favourite but not
  exclusive study. Meteorology and the physical sciences had lost much
  of their hold upon him but the theory of economics and problems
                            ;
 connected therewith still continued to engage part of his attention.
 The influences that mainly contributed to mould the form and direct
 the progress of his logical investigations may here be noticed.
    While residing in Australia he had read with care Mr. Mill's great
 work on Logic, and the interest then awakened in his mind was
 revived and strengthened on his return to England by listening to the
 lectures and reading the works of Professor De Morgan, that prince
 of teachers, to whom he often and warmly acknowledged his great                    in
 debtedness, as having inspired him with a deep love for logical method,
 and taught him to acquire those habits of exact thought and reasoning
 which are a better mental possession than any amount of mere know
 ledge.     From De Morgan, also, he probably derived his tendency                  to
 look at logic on its mathematical side. But the man whose writings
 more, perhaps, than any other influenced the course of his logical
 speculations was Professor Boole.          With the " Investigations of the
                        "
 Laws of Thought          Jevons first became acquainted in 1860, and from
that date, throughout the remainder of his life, the science of logic
occupied   a   prominent place in his studies.     The boldness, originality,
and beauty of Boole's system captivated him. As             ageneralisation         of
reasoning, he regarded     it     as vastly superior to anything previously
known but there were some portions of
       ;                                        it  that seemed to him dark
and mysterious, and these he sought to separate from what he con
sidered clear and unassailable.         The calculus of 0 and     which plays
                                                                 1,
so important a part in Boole's method, Jevons rejected on the ground
that it   represents other operations than those of common thought.

                                       V
 J3e attached to the sign + , as a logical sign, a somewhat different
 ineaning from that which it bears in the works of Boole.            He dis
 pensed altogether with the indefinite class symbol v or              and he
 imposed such restrictions as served to make the symbolical operations
  always interpretable in ordinary language.         Thus, in place of the
  logical equation x=vy, he employed its equivalent x=xy, and so on.
   By means of these and other minor modifications he succeeded in pro
  ducing a system by which logical problems may be worked out accord
  ing to the general laws developed by Boole, but in such a way as to
  make all intermediate as well as final results interpretable.   His earliest
  work on the subject is entitled   " Pure Logic, or the Logic of Quality
  apart from Quantity: with Remarks on Boole's System, and on the
  R«lationof Logic and Mathematics" (1864). This was followed by a
  paper in the " Proceedings of the Literary and Philosophical Society
  of Manchester " (vol. v, pp. 161-5, Session 1865-66), giving a brief
  account of his logical Abacus — a contrivance for reducing the pro
 cesses of logical inference to a mechanical form.         " The purpose of
                               "
  this contrivance," he says, is to show the simple truth, and the per
 fect generality of a new system of pure qualitative logic closely analo
 gous to, and suggested by, the mathematical system of logic of the
 late Professor Boole, bnt strongly distinguished from the latter by
 the rejection of all considerations of quantity.        This logical abacus
 leads naturally to the construction of a simple machine which shall
 be capable of giving with absolute certainty all possible logical con
 clusions from any sets of propositions or premises read off upon the
 keys of the instrument.      The possibility of such a contrivance is
 practically ascertained ; when completed, it will furnish a more signal
 proof of the truth of the system of logic embodied in it. Still, the
 more rudimentary contrivance called the Abacus will remain the most
 convenient for explaining the nature and working of formal inference,
 and may be usefully employed in the lecture-room for exhibiting the
 complete analysis of arguments and logical conditions and the expo
 sure of fallacies."
    In a little book published in 1869, entitled " The Substitution of
 Similars," Professor Jevons simplified and extended his theory of
 reasoning.    When logical propositions are expressed in the form of
 equations, the old distinction of subject and predicate is abolished,
and the dictum de omni et nullo of Aristotle ceases to be applicable.
Jevons therefore proposed to modify the ancient dictum and to replace
it by the following: — Whatever is known of a term may be stated of
its equal or equivalent.  Or, in other words, whatever is true of a thing
is true of its like.  He held that all reasoning can be reduced to this
fundamental principle. But the novelty in his views was most strik
ingly exhibited in his logical analytical engine, the construction of
which was completed about this time.

                                      VI
     Boole has shown that " the ultimate laws of logic, those alone upon
which it is possible to construct a science of logic- are mathematical
in their form and expression, although not belonging to the mathe
matics of quantity."       Jevons advanced a step further, and showed
that the processes of logic, like those of arithmetic or algebra, are
purely mechanical, and can be not only exemplified but performed by
a logical engine.     A full description of this curious contrivance is
given in a paper read before the Royal Society, in January, 1870,
and printed in the " Philosophical Transactions," vol. 160, pp. 497-
518.     Other papers and treatises on Logic proceeded from his pen :
" On a General System of Numerically Definite Reasoning"
                                                                       (Man
chester Memoirs, 1872").        "Primer of Logic" (1876). "The Prin
ciples of Science" (first edition, 2 vols., 1874 ; second edition, 1 vol.,
1877).
     The last-named work is a comprehensive treatise on Formal Logic
and Scientific Method     : it contains the matured    results of Professor
 Jevons' researches on the subject,       and  is  distinguished by great
wealth and freshness of illustration.        Almost every department of
science is made to contribute examples in support or elucidation of
the author's views on the theory of reasoning and the nature and
 limits of scientific inquiry. Perhaps the most original part of the
 work is that which treats of the " inverse logical problem."         Jevons
held that deductive reasoning gives the true type of      all reasoning, and
 that induction in an inverse process bearing to deduction much the
 same relation that arithmetical division bears to multiplication. or
 evolution to involution.      The direct or deductive problem is, Given
 certain relations among terms or notions, to determine by the applica
 tion of the fundamental laws of thought, all the possible combinations
 which are consistent with these relations.      The indirect or indnctive
 problem is, Given the combinations, to determine all the possible
 relations from which these can be logically inferred. In other words,
 induction is a reasoning back from conclusions to possible premises.
 Whatever may be thought of this as a theory of induction, there can
  be no doubt that the inverse problem suggested by it is highly
 important. The solution of that problem in all its generality appears
 to be impracticable on account of the number and variety of combina
  tions involved ; but Jevons succeeded in obtaining a complete solution
  for two and for three classes ; and the late Professor Clifford made a
  valuable contribution to the subject by determining the number of
  types of compound statement involving four classes.         Clifford found
  the knowledge of the possible groupings of subdivisions of classes
  which he obtained by his inquiry, of servico in some of his researches
  on hyperelliptic functions ; and Professor Cayley subsequently sug
  gested that this line of investigation should be followed out, owing to
  the bearing of the theory of compound combinations upon the higher

                                     vii
 geometry.      Those combinations possess an interest for the mathema
 tician apart altogether from their logical significance. (" Manchester
 Proceedings," 1877, vol. xvi, pp. 89, 1 13.)
    In 1867 Professor Jevons married Harriet Ann, daughter of the
 late John Edward Taylor, the originator, proprietor, and editor of the
   Manchester Guardian." Three children were the fruit of the union,
 a son born in 1875, and two daughters, one born in 1877, the other in
 1880.    His domestic happiness, and the composure of mind resulting
 from it,  facilitated largely the execution of his intellectual work. He
 confessed toit    himself with his usual manly simplicity, and, as one of
 his friends says, "it    was as
                               if    his very powers as an observer had
 derived a fresh and lasting impulse from the new associations which
 had become part of his life."
    The question of the extent and the resources of the British coal
fields was brought under public notice by the debates in Parliament
 on the Commercial Treaty with France in 1859-60.             Attention was
 called to the importance of effecting a reduction in the National Debt,
while coal and iron, the main sources of British wealth, were
abundant. Hence arose the inquiry to what extent we might rely on
the future produce of our coalfields.      Professor Hull and others made
estimates of the total quantity of accessible coal in the United King
dom, and Sir William Armstrong, in his address at the British Asso
ciation in 1863, gave prominence to the subject, pointing out that the
problem to be solved     is    not how long our coal will endure before
there is  absolute exhaustion, but how long those particular seams will
last which yield coal of a quality and at a price to enable our country
to maintain her supremacy in manufacturing industry.                 Jevons
attacked this problem with all the advantage gained from long
experience in the collection and management of statistical details.
His results were embodied in treatise, entitled " The Coal Question
                               a                                         :
an Inquiry concerning the Progress of the Nation, and the Probable
Exhaustion of our Coal Mines."              (First edition, 1865; second
edition, 1866.) Written with clearness, tact and vigour, and pre
senting the matter in a new and interesting light, the work was
largely read Jevons' conclusions were keenly discussed by journalists
            ;
and reviewers, and attracted the attention not only of manufacturers
and men of business but of politicians and statesmen of the highest
order.    A Royal Commission was appointed to inquire into the whole
question, and Mr. Gladstone used Professor Jevons' calculations in
support of his suggestion that a certain portion of the national
revenue should be set aside as a reserve fund in payment of the
National Debt.
    Problems in applied economics had for Jevons a peculiar attrac
tiveness, because of their bearing on the material welfare of the com
munity. His devotion to abstract studies did not destroy his interest

                                    viii
in the progress of society, or in questions touching the practical life
of men.     While busied with researches on abstract principles, he
always kept a window open to the outer world : witness his wort
on Coals, his papers on Currency and Coinage, Variation of Prices,
the frequent Autumnal Pressure on ihe Money Market, and other
kindred subjects, and his articles and addresses on questions of the
day, published in the
                         '8                    "
                            Contemporary," the Fortnightly Review," and
elsewhere. Several of these scattered papers have lately been collected
and republished in a separate volume under the title of " Methods of
Social Reform;" and a glance at some of the headings will suffice to
show the width of Jevons' interest in whatever affects popular pro
gress — Amusements of the People, Free Public Libraries, Museum*,
" Cram," Trade Societies, Industial Partnerships, Married Women in
Factories, Cruelty to Animals, The United Kingdom Alliance, Experi
mental Legislation and the Drink Traffic, State- Parcel Post, &c.
   A pamphlet on the Match Tax, which he wrote in 1871, is memorable
as a skilful and courageous defence of a most uupopular measure.           In
his view the country had reached a critical point where " one great
and true policy bad been nearly if not quite accomplished;" and he
feared that " without any strong guiding principle like that of free
       "         it,
trade     before      the nation was in danger of drifting instead of
                                              " If one-half of the doctrines
carefully steering in its financial course.
and arguments which were brought against the Match Tax should be
accepted as really true and cogent, the balance of our financial system
would be in danger of complete derangement."            He therefore con
sidered  it  important to subject to calm and impartial investigation
the various opinions uttered during the heated discussion on the pro
posed new impost, and his pamphlet presents an admirable specimen
of the way in which the truths of economics should be applied to
questions of taxation.
   But in his "Theory of Political Economy" (1871, second edition
4enlarged   1879), Jevons dealt not with particular applications, but
with the general principles of the science he laboured at the founda
                                             ;
tions.    Dissatisfied with many of the views of Ricardo and Mill, he
                                                                         u
sought to construct the science on a new basis. Observing that             as
   deals with quantities       must be a mathematical science in matter
if it
                          it
   not in language," he endeavoured to express quantitatively such
notices as utility, value, labour, capital, &c, and he maintained that
the employment of mathematical forms         is conducive to clearness and
precision of expression.      It
                               is   curious to remark, however, that he
did not attempt to develope those forms as a working process, and
when    it was pointed out to him that a little manipulation of the
symbols in accordance with the rules of the differential calculus would
often have yielded results which he had laboriously argued out, he
contented himself with replying that he did not write for mathe

                                      IS
raaticians, nor as a mathematician, but as an economist, wishing to
convince other economists that their science can only be satisfactorily
treated on an explicitly mathematical basis.         One who is both a
mathematician and an economist bears the following testimony, as
discriminating as appreciative, to the value and importance of Jevons'
work in this branch of knowledge.
    "Mr. Jevons," writes Professor A. Marshall, "was an economist of
the highest order.     In his ' Theory of Political Economy ' he explains
the nature of economic quantities, and their relation to one another.
Work of this kind involves no startling discovery, but its effect is
much greater than appears at first sight. It makes us master of our
thoughts, and founds new empires in science. A small part of his
work, which was warped by his antipathy to Ricardo, will probably
die away.     A small part also will lose lustr- when Cournot's appli
cations of mathematics to economics are better known.         For indeed
 Jevons was, as he frankly confessed, not a skilled mathematician.
Truly mathematical as is the tone of his best work, he was not at his
ease when using mathematical        formula.   But the great body of his
work is unaffected by these blemishes ; the lapse of time will but add
to its lustre, and it will probably be found to have more truly con
structive force than any, save that of Ricardo, that has been done
during the last hundred years.       His contributions to statistics were
widely known. The pure honesty of his mind, combined with his
special intellectual fitness for the work, have made them models for all
time.    But it is in his essays on the applications of economics to the
theory of governmental action that his full greatness is best seen.
There is no other work of the kind which is to be compared to them
for originality, for suggestiveness, and for wisdom.    Almost every one
of them contains some great new practical truth which the world is
beginning to recognise, though but few persons know their obligations
to him."
   "Money and the Mechanism of Exchange" made its appearance in
1875, forming part of the International Scientific Series.         In this
work Jevons expounded the nature and functions of money, the
principles of circulation, the various forms of credit documents, and
the elaborate mechanism by which money exchanges are facilitated,
adding some important historical notes and a discussion of certain
technical points connected with the subjects treated of in the main
body of the volume.
   Jevons' connexion with Owens College extended over a period of
thirteen years, during which the Institution steadily advanced in
reputation and renown.       Much of its progress was due no doubt to
the liberality of its friends, but more perhaps to the genius and
labours of its professors, and among these Jevons held a conspicuous
place.   In its new buildings and with its new constitution, the College

gave a considerable share of its government to the distinguished ma
who constituted its teaching body, and largely increased the impor
tance of their corporate deliberation. Almost from the first Jeras
proved himself a valuable member of the Senate, and at a somewhit
critical period in the history of the College, he was chosen to servt
as a representative     on the College Council.     " There were many
qualities in him," writes one of his colleagues, " which more than
justified the confidence reposed in him, but there was none for which
he was more conspicuous       than a comprehensiv- large mindedne-
which enabled him to look on questions with a view to something
more than the immediate future.      .  . .  Towards one change now
actually effected, and in the opinion of many of us, deserving to be
called a progress, he at first maintained an attitude of extremely well
armed neutrality.      I liked to attribute his coldness towards onr
University project to his loyalty as a member of the University of
London ; but I confess to having spent a very bad half hour when I
made a final private attempt to argue him into a change of front At
the same time it is an instance of the sagacity which has marked his
treatment of so many public questions, that he from the first           (or
nearly so) declared that the adoption of    a constitution, such as that
now actually possessed by the Victoria University, would be the right
way towards the desired end.
   In 1868 Jevons was appointed an Examiner in Political Economy        in
the University of London in 1870 he was President of the Economic
                          ;
Section at the Meeting of the British Association in Liverpool;         in
1872 he was elected a Fellow of this Society    ; and in 1874 and 1875
he was an Examiner for the Moral Science Tripos in the University       of
Cambridge.      In the latter year the Senatus Academicns of the
University   of  Edinburgh conferred upon him the honorary degree       of
LL.D., and in the following year he was appointed Examiner of L8ic
and Moral Philosophy in the University of London.
    In 1876 he resigned his connexion with Owens College, and the  in
same year, on accepting the Professorship of Political Economy          in
 University College, London, he removed to Hampstead, hoping there
to have more leisure and greater facilities for the prosecntion    of his
 researches.    The duties of his new position were less onerous than
those to which he had been accustomed in Manchester       ; but academic
 work had never been very congenial to him, and lecturing, even on
his favourite subjects, had become of late years somewhat          of an
irksome task. In a letter to the writer about this time, he speaks      of
the duties of the class-room as a " millstone " upon his health and
spirits. Sometimes he had enjoyed lecturing, especially on logic, bnt
for years past he had " never entered the lecture-room withont          s
feeling, probably, like that of going to the pillory." " Now that       I
 have been able to get rid of the burden," he adds, " shall probably
                                                       I

b-     much better.    I  shall never lecture, speechify, or do anything
of that sort again if I can possibly help it." Apart from special
r-asons, too, he found that the pressure of literary work left him no
spare energy whatever.         Besides the logical exercises which he had
just finished and given to the world in a goodly volume, entitled
" Studies in Deductive Logic," he had a large treatise on practical
economy in full progress, a bibliography of logic in hand, and the
                "
 analysis of Mill's Philosophy
                                      " on his mind.     He was also pre
 paring a student's edition .of the " Wealth of Nations," a preface to
 the English translation of Cossa's " Guide to Political Economy,"
 and a volume on " The State in Relation to Labour " for Macmillan's
 English Citizen Series, besides new editions of some of his earlier
 treatises and various minor articles for the Reviews. Much of this
 work he actually accomplished before the waves closed over his
 vanished life. But much also remained unaccomplished.          The " Prin
 ciples of Economics," intended as a companion volume to the " Prin
 ciples of Science," he did not live to complete.
      In the summer of last year (1882) he went down with his wife and
 family to spend five or six weeks at Bexhill, a small village on the
 Snssex coast.      Here he wrote an article on " Reflected Rainbows,"
 which appeared in the " Field Naturalist." This was his last printed
 production. He had been accustomed in former years when visiting
 Bexhill to bathe in the sea, and being a good swimmer and familiar
 with the coast, he seems not to have apprehended        any danger.     But
 this season his wife had dissuaded     him from the exercise, for he was
 not in good bodily health.        The action of his heart was weak, and
 the close and continued intension of his mind on absorbing studies
 had much reduced his physical strength.             On the morning of
  Sunday the 13th of August, he was walking with his wife and
 children on the beach, not far from the cottage on the cliff where
  they were staying. A man of warm domestic afiTections, he loved to
  be with the little ones, watching their innocent ways and participating
  in their simple pleasures.    At length he turned to leave them, saying
  nothing of his intention to bathe ; perhaps he formed the intention on
  his way back to the cottage, or after he had reached it.         Taking a
  towel oat of the house, he descended the     cliff on the  other side, and
  entered the water.     No one else was bathing at the time, or within
  sight of the place ; and the exact circumstances of his death can only
  be conjectured.     It is believed that the sudden shock of the cold
   water, overstraining a weak heart, caused syncope, and that from the
   first plunge he was quite powerless.     Some boys passing along the
   beach saw the body a few yards out, floating on the sea, face down
   wards, and at once gave the alarm.     Among the persons attracted to
   the spot was a labourer residing on the hill who, twenty minutes
  before, had seen Jevons going down to the beach.          When the body

  was brought to land life was extinct. Within an hour and a-half of
  his leaving her, Mrs. Jevons' heard of her husband's death His
  clothes and the unused towel were found lying on the shore.
     Jevons was a man as remarkable for modesty of character            and
 generous    appreciation of Lthe labours of others as for unwearied
  industry, devotion to work of the highest and purest kind, and
  thorough independence and originality of thought. The Deques
 which he has left to the world is not represented solely by the results
 of his intellectual toil, widely as these are appreciated not only in
 England but also in America and on the Continent of Europe. A pore
 and lofty character is more precious than any achievements in the
 field of knowledge ; and though its influences are not so easy to trace,
 it is often more powerful in the inspiration which it breathes than
 the literary or scientific productions of the man.      " That Professor
 Jevons will be missed," writes the editor of the " Spectator," " as one
 of the profoundest thinkers of our time on the philosophy of science,
 no one who knows anything of his writings will doubt.        Yet he had
 other qualities, not always found in men of science, which made his
 character as unique as his intellect. At once shy and genial, and full
 of the appreciation of the humour of human life, eager as he was in
 his solitary studies, he enjoyed nothing so much as to find himself
 thawing in the lively companionship of intimate friends.       Something
 of a recluse in temperament, his generous and tender nature rebelled
 against the seclusion into which his studies and his not unfreqnent
 dyspepsia drove him. His hearty laugh was something unique in
 itself, and made every one the happier who heard it. His humble
 estimate of himself and his doubts of his power of inspiring affection-
 or even strong friendship, were singularly remarkable, when contrasted
 with the great courage which he had of his opinions ; nevertheless,
 his dependence on human ties for his happiness was as complete as
 the love he felt for his chosen friends was strong and faithful.    More
 over, there was a deep religious feeling at the bottom of his nature,
 which made the materialistic tone of the day as alien to him as
 all true -cience, whether on material, or on intellectual, or on spiritual
 themes, was unaffectedly dear to him."                           B. fl.
     Friedrich Wohler was born on July 31, 1800, in the village of
Escherheim, near Frankfort-on-the-Main, in the house of the pastor
of that place, a brother-in-law of his mother.      He received his first
instruction in reading, writing, and arithmetic from his father ; he
went afterwards to the ordinary school, and later on he took private
lessons in Latin and French, as well as in music.
    Wohler early showed a taste for experimenting and collecting, in
which he was helped and encouraged both by his father and by his
father's friend, Hofrath Wichterich,       who took great interest in

                                     xiii
 science.   Wichterich had some chemical and physical apparatus, with
 which he later on allowed the boy to experiment.         Yonng Wohler
 also collected all the stones which struck him as in any way remark
 able.   In 1814 he went to the Frankfort Gymnasium, which he con
tinued to attend until he went to the University.          Amongst his
 teachers at this period were several men who afterwards became
distinguished — F. Ch. Schlosser, Grotefend, C. Bitter, &c. He was
regular in his attendance at school, and was moved up to higher
classes at the usual rates ; but, as he himself used afterwards honestly
 to admit, he did not distinguish himself either by any marked industry
or progress in knowledge. This may have been partly due to the fact
of his having continued to occupy himself zealously with chemical
experiments and collecting minerals. He worked so little at mathe
matics, for which he had little taste and aptitude, that he was after
wards obliged to get private lessons in It. He kept up a continual
interchange of mineral specimens with several of his schoolfellows,
amongst whom were Hermann von Meyer and Menge, who afterwards
became a dealer in minerals, and who is well known for his travels in
Iceland and among the Oural mountains.        Wohler in after years took
to Menge at Hanover many a bag of hyaliths of his own collecting.
    During this period of Wohler's life Dr. Buch, a highly cultivated
and intelligent man who gave private lessons and worked at
chemistry, physics, and mineralogy, exercised a considerable influence
on his scientific development ; for years Dr. Buch let young Wohler
associate with him, and he it was who first incited the young man to
study nature serionsly. A kitchen in Buch's house served as a labora
tory, in which on specified days they made experiments together.
    Soon after the discovery of selenium, Wohler had noticed the
occurrence of this, at that time, rare substance in a sample of Bohe
mian sulphuric acid, and in consequence he sent for some of the ore
from which it had been prepared       The occurrence of selenium in this
substance was proved, but it was not until 1821 that the result was
made known to the world by Wohler and Gilbert's " Annalen."          The
interest of Buch and Wohler was also excited by the newly discovered
metal cadmium, and they succeeded in preparing a small quantity,
which Wohler afterwards, when on a pedestrian excursion to Cassel
and Gottingen, took with him to show to Stromeyer, the discoverer of
cadmium, and to get it verified by him.
                                                 " Handbook of Natural
   Wohler's reverence for Blumenbach, whose
          " he had studied
History                       assiduously, gave him courage to visit
Blumenbach on this occasion, and to take an opportunity of seeing his
cabinet of specimens.
   He became now more and more familiar with chemical processes,
and whereas in the beginning he had merely had Hagen's " Experi
mental Chemistry," the book from which his father had studied, to

                                    xiv
consult, he now had access to    Dr. Buch's rich library. His room to
gradually converted into a laboratory, full of glasses, r-torts, flasks-
stones, &c, all in the utmost disorder.     Experiments requiring he«t,
which he could not carry on in this room, he used to make in the
kitchen, where he pressed all the basins into his service.    He likewise
built up a small voltaic pile with some large  Russian   copper coins and
zinc plates, and became acquainted with their property of d-composing
water and causing shocks. This pile had not power enough to r-duce
potassium ; but his desire to see and possess this remarkable mewl,
which he only knew from description, was so great that he endea
voured to procure it chemically, according to the method followed by
Curandan, an operation which was not easy, but which, to his great
satisfaction, succeeded. By way of a stove he made use of a large old
tile of graphite, which Bnnsen, the Master of the Mint, had given
him.     Bunsen had also lent him a pair of bellows, which Wohler's
sister used to blow.
    Wohler had many other interests and occupations besides these
scientific experiments ; he took regular lessons in drawing, to which
his father, who was himself a good draughtsman, attached much
importance, and when making excursions in the neighbourhood, in the
Taunns, on the Rhine, &c, he always had his sketch-book with him.
He also painted in oils. One of his hobbies was collecting old coins,
of which he had a considerable number, as also of Roman urns, lamps,
 &c, which at that time were still frequently found in the old Roman
camps at Gaddersheim, Maintz, and Wiesbaden. He also began a
closer study of the German poets, under the guidance of the young
painter from whom he learnt drawing.
    Wohler was as yet too young to have a clear insight into the great
political events of that time, but as a boy he saw the triumphant
 entrance of Napoleon into Frankfort, and later on the entrance of the
 allied armies, and of the Cossacks, <fec.
    His father paid special attention to his physical development, to the
 strengthening and invigorating of his rather weakly frame by regular
 physical exercises such as riding, gymnastics, fencing, swimming, &c.,
 and by shooting, both in winter and summer.
    At Easter, 1820, he being then nearly twenty years of age, young
 Wohler was sent to the University as prima. It had been previously
 settled by a family conclave that he should study medicine, not only
 because he wished it himself, but also because for several reasons this
 profession seemed to offer him the best prospects.    He passed his first
 year of studentship in Marburg, where his father had studied before
 him, and where there were old family friends residing who could look
 after and advise the inexperienced student. He attended Ullmann's
 lectures on mineralogy, those on botany by Windewitz, Gerling's
 lectures on physics and mathematics, Bunger's lectures on anatomy,

                                      XV
as well as his dissection class. On chemistry, his favourite subject,
there were no lectures during the first term, and in the second term he
did. not attend     them,  because Professor Wurzer had wounded his
youthful feelings     of ambition. To the very great annoyance of the
mistress of the house where he lived, he had again turned his room
into a laboratory, and had begun to make experiments on sulpho-
cyanides and other compounds.        He discovered iodide of cyanogen, at
least it was to him a discovery, as he was not aware that Davy had
already found it. In the joy of his heart he told Professor Wurzer of
it, but the latter, instead of studying this substance, as new to him as
it was to young Wohler, reproached the youth bitterly that he, a
student, should be on the look-out for discoveries, instead of attending
 to his medical studies. Through Dr. Buch these little researches were
 afterwards published in Gilbert's " Annalen."
     At the end of a year Wohler went to the University of Heidelberg,
 full of enthusiasm, even in anticipation, for Leopold Gmelin, who from
 this time forth was his favourite teacher as well as kindest friend and
 counsellor.      Wohler wished above all to hear Gmelin's chemical
 lectures, but Gmelin thought this would be a waste of time, and thus
 it came about that Wohler never attended any course of chemical
 lectures.    He gained, however, all the more by personal intercourse
 with Gmelin and the opportunity of working in his laboratory.          He
  devoted to chemistry nearly all the time which his medical studies
  left him, and even towards the end of these studies, when practical
  medical work took up nearly the whole of his time, it seemed quite a
  necessity to him to go daily to the laboratory at least once. It was
  here that he had begun his investigation of cyanic acid, of which the
  earliest account had been published in Gilbert's "Annalen."        It was
 to him a great gain that at this period Gmelin and Tiedemann were
 working at their joint chemical and physiological researches. Wohler
 also enjoyed the special favour of Tiedemann, and owed to this excel
 lent man his lively interest in physiology. It may have been partly
  due to the influence of Tiedemann that Wohler undertook to write an
  essay, in competition for a prize offered by the medical faculty, on
  the passage of substances into the urine, for which purpose he per
  formed numerous experiments, partly on himself, but mostly on dogs.
  He was so fortunate as to gain the prize.       Though he might have
  made use of this treatise for a dissertation, he preferred that it should
  be published in Tiedemann's " Zeitschrift fur Physiologie," 1824.
     However, Wohler's primary object was still to become a medical
  man, and latterly his inclination to this profession was increased by
  the closer acquaintance4 with its practical side which he gained in the
  clinical visits. He was more especially attracted by the midwifery
  cases, for which Nagele had a gift of interesting his pupils. Assuming
  that they would prefer this branch of practice to all others, Nagele

                                     xvi
  selected  Wohler and his friend and fellow-student, 6. Spiess, to       be
 present at every birth in the institution he attended     during their last
 year of medical stndy.
     In September Wohler and Spiess went through their sanitats
 examination and received the degree of Doctor in Medicine, Surgery,
 and Midwifery.      Wohler was now to begin travelling in order to visit
 larger hospitals, when Graelin suddenly gave an entirely new direc
 tion to his life by earnestly advising him to give up the practice of
 medicine and to devote himself entirely to chemistry. Without taking
 much time to reflect, and certain of his father's consent, Wohler
 gladly agreed to Gmelin's proposal.     By Gmelin's advice, and encou
 raged by the favourable      manner in which Berzelius had noticed
 Wohler's earliest researches in his " Jahresherichte," yonng Wohler
 applied to Berzelius for permission to work in his laboratory, which
 application was received in the most flattering manner.
    Wohler decided to travel to Stockholm by way of Liibeck.              At
 Liibeck he took a passage in a small sailing-vessel bound for Stock
 holm ; but the departure of the vessel was deferred from week to
 week, and he was actually detained in Liibeck for six weeks.        He did
 not, however, find this altogether a waste of   time,  for he got an intro
 duction through Menge, the dealer in minerals, to the scientific apothe
 cary Kind, and in Kind's laboratory he worked at the preparation of
larger quantities of the metal potassium. At length Wohler sailed for
 Stockholm. After a very stormy passage he reached the Swedish
coast at Dalaro, and on arriving at Stockholm a few days later
received the warmest welcome from Berzelius.
    A University laboratory is now a very different thing from what it
was in those days.     Wohler was the only student in the laboratory of
Berzelius. The laboratory consisted of two ordinary rooms, in which
 the chemists worked at deal tables. In a kitchen close by where their
meals were prepared, and where the servant had to clean their chemical
apparatus, stood a little furnace and a heated sand-bath.
    Here Wohler worked out some experiments on minerals, selecting
chiefly those containing elements unknown to him, such as compounds
of lithium and tungsten.      Later on he returned to his experiments on
cyanic   acid.  In these Berzelius took a special interest, as they seemed
likely to cast a new light on the constitution of chemical compounds.
    Besides working at these experiments, Wohler assisted Berzelius
in his beautiful research on hydrofluoric acid, his discovery of silicon,
of boron, and of zirconium.
    Whilst engaged during the day on these researches Wohler used
to work during his evenings at the Swedish language, translating
B8rzelius' papers into German for " Poggendorff's Annalen." In after
                                                      " Jahresbericht," as
years he used regularly to translate Berzelius'
              "
well as his Lehrbuch."

                                  XVII
   Wohler fimshed up his stay in the north by a scientific journey
through Scandinavia in company with Berzelins and the two Brong-
niarts. The most interesting part of this excursion was a visit paid
to the copper and silver mines of Fahlun, rich in mineral and geological
treasures, and remarkable for the deep chasms which were formed
centuries ago by the falling in of immense vaults.         During this
journey Wohler was fortunate enough to get acquainted with several
distinguished men of science, among them Sir Humphry Davy and
Hisinger, whose mineralogical geography he afterwards translated
into German.
   With much regret Wohler at last parted with his friend and teacher
Berzelins and returned to Frankfort.       His idea had been to settle
down in Heidelberg as Privat Docent, but he was at once appointed
lecturer in the newly established Gewerbeschule (Mechanics' Institute)
at Berlin, and there he remained from 1825 to 1832, when family
affairs decided him to move to Cassel.
   It was in this same year 1825 that Wohler became acquainted with
Liebig, who was about his own age, and henceforth they were in
constant intercourse.    Liebig had become Professor of Chemistry at
Giessen at the age of twenty-one, in the year 1824, and he followed
Wohler's work with all the greater interest because his own lay very
much in the same direction.
   These two investigators had each discovered a substance which
according to minute analysis were composed of precisely equal quantities
of the same elements.     At that time it seemed like a paradox to say
that two such different bodies as cyanic acid discovered by Wohler,
and fulminic acid which Liebig had examined, could have the same
composition, for identity of composition in conjunction with difference
of property was at that time quite unintelligible.    Another research
of far greater importance to the theory of organic compounds was an
investigation made in the year 1832 of oil of bitter almonds and of
benzoic acid.   From these analytical experiments resulted a series of
new compounds which were connected together by the fact of their all
containing one particular group of atoms to which was given the name
of benzoyl radical.   Thus by one stroke was the connexion between
all the members of this series of compounds made clear. The impres
sion made by this research on contemporary chemists is plain from a
letter written by Berzelins to the two investigators, in which he
proposes for benzoyl the fanciful name
                                        " proin "
                                                  (daybreak), or other
wise   " dawn," because with the discovery of this radical a new day
seemed to dawn for chemical science.
   A new day had indeed dawned for chemistry, and after fifty years
the noon of this day shows us a vast number of substances with the
most beautiful properties, some with the most brilliant colours, others
of great value in medicine and surgery, all of which have been dis-
   vol. xxxv.                                                c

                                   XY111
covered    by methods of investigation similar to those pursued by
Wohler and Liebig.
   We must not, however, omit to mention other researches carried
out during Wohler's stay in Berlin and Cassel, and which are no less
important than the work he did with Liebig. His researches extended
into every department of chemistry.      In 1826 he succeeded in finding
a method for obtaining nickel and cobalt from their ores free from
arsenic, and thereby laid the foundation of an extensive industry.
His appointment as teacher of the new manufacturing school gave
him opportunities of helping industries connected with chemistry, and
he became more conversant with such industries through a visit he
paid to France in 1833, and to England in 1835.
   In inorganic chemistry we owe to him the discovery of three new
elements, that of aluminium (in 1827) of beryllium and of yttrium,
besides various other beautiful discoveries.
   We have mentioned that in 1823 Wohler had gained a prize for
a research in physiological chemistry on excretions        from animal
organisms.     We must also mention his interesting discoveries in
chemical physics.     While examining the crystallisation of arsenions
acid and of oxide of antimony, he noticed the remarkable fact that
each of these bodies appears in two distinct crystalline forms.
   But in organic chemistry we have yet to mention a discovery made
by Wohler in the year 1828, which, were it his only discovery, would
entitle him to a place of honour in the history of that branch of the
science, namely, the artificial formation of urea.     In the previous
century, as chemists became more and more occupied with animal
and vegetable compounds, they had begun to classify chemical sub
stances under the three headings of mineral, vegetable, and animal,
but on account of the similarity between the two latter categories
 Lavoisier placed them in one class, which he called organic in contra
 distinction to the mineral or inorganic bodies.
   Rouelle had found when examining urine in 1773 a beautiful
 crystalline organic substance.   This was more minutely examined in
 1779 by Fourcroy and Vauquelin and named urea.         In 1828 Wohler
obtained these same long, white, glistening, needle-like crystals with
out the aid of any animal organism by gently heating the ammonia
salt of cyanic acid.
   This artificial production of an organic body at once abolished the
doctrine of a distinct boundary line between organic and inorganic
chemistry, together with the doctrine of vital force.
   Shortly after this discovery Wohler was appointed Professor of
Chemistry to the Medical Faculty in the University of Gottingen,
and about the same time he became Inspector- General of Pharmacies
in the Kingdom of Hanover.
   Wohler now began a long and useful career of teaching.            The

                                    xix
 celebrated Gottingen Laboratory was built under his directions, and
 here he continued to work assiduously at his science. Some hundreds
 of researches testify to the diligence with which he worked during
 these years. Up to the year 1862 " Poggendorff's Annalen " already
 contained 225 papers by Wohler.       Students flocked from all parts of
 the world to study under his guidance.
     Wohler's work " Der Gundriss der Chemie," of which new editions
 have appeared from time to time until quite recently, has been trans
 lated into English, French, Dutch, Swedish, and Danish. His book
 " Mineralanalyse in Beijnelen" also passed through several editions.
 From 1838 Wohler was Liebig's colleague in editing the "Annalen
 der Chemie und Pharmacie," and he published in conjunction with
 Liebig and others the " Handworterbuch der Chemie " (Dictionary of
 Chemistry).
     It is hardly necessary to mention that Wohler received numerous
 honours and distinctions.      Scientific societies were glad to number
 him among their members.         The German Chemical Society elected
 him President. He was Knight of the Order " Pour le Merite."           He
 was elected a foreign member of the Royal Society in 1854, and
 received the Copley Medal in 1872.         On his eightieth birthday his
 friends, pupils, and colleagues presented to him a beautifully executed
 relief in marble of himself, together with a gold medal struck in his
 honour.
    Of late years Wohler had ceased to work at research, although he
 continued to teach and occasionally to publish short papers. A letter
 written in 1878 to Dr. Victor Meyer gives a good idea of the spirit
 of quiet contemplation in which the old man rested from his labours.
 A few words are necessary to explain the occasion of this letter. In
 the summer of 1878 Victor Meyer had been giving to his students a
 somewhat detailed account of the discovery of urea, when it suddenly
 occurred to him that it was just fifty years since this synthesis had
 been accomplished by Wohler, which fact he mentioned to his class.
 The consequence was that after the lecture the students sent Wohler a
 telegram of congratulation, to which was appended a large number
of signatures.      The following letter came shortly afterwards in
 reply —
                                              Gottingen, 26. Juni 1878.

meinen wiirmsten Dank ausdriicken zu wollen nnd ihnen zu sagen,
dass sie mich doppelt erfreut hat als ein Zeichen, dass ein alter
Chemiker, dessen Krafte nicht mehr gestatten, sich an dem weiteren
Anfbau der Wissenschaft selbst noch zu betheiligen, von der jiingeren
Generation nicht ganz vergessen ist, deren raschen Fortschritten nnd
wundervollen Erfolgen aber immer noch seine Freude hat, gleieh
dem alten Fuhrmann, der selbst nicht mehr fahren kann, aber das
lustige Peitschenknallen der jiingeren noch gerne horen mag.
                           Mit vorziiglicher Hochachtnng,
                                          Ihr ganz ergebenster,
                                                              Wohlee.
    Wohler   passed  the eighty-second    anniversary of his birth last
summer in good health, surrounded by his children, grandchildren,
and great grandchildren, and in the course of the day received visits
from various friends, colleagues, and pupils. He kept well through
the month of August, and enjoyed sitting out in his garden during the
warm summer weather.       On the 18th September he did not go out
on account of the coldness of the weather, and in the course of the
evening was seized with a shivering fit.    Fever soon came on, and on
the 23rd September he breathed his last.
    In accordance with his express wish his funeral was simple.      The
service was conducted in the house by the University preacher. A
long procession of mourners followed the body to the cemetery.
    Wohler was twice married. His first wife, Franziska, daughter of
Staatsrath "Wohler, whom he married in 1830, died in 1832, leaving
him a son and a daughter.    In 1834 he married Julie Pfeiffer, daughter
of a banker in Cassel, by whom he had four daughters, and who
survives him.      Two daughters remain unmarried — one of whom,"
Fraulein Emilie "Wohler, long acted as her father's secretary.
    A charming account of "Wohler's stay with Berzelius in Sweden,
written by himself, is to be found in No. 12 of the " Berichte der
Deutschen Chemischen Gesellschaft," 1875, under the title " Jugend-
erinnerungen eines Chemikers."
    Francis Maitland Balfour, the sixth child and third son of James
Maitland Balfour, of Whittinghame, Haddingtonshire, and Lady
Blanche, daughter of the second Marquis of Salisbury, was born
 in Edinburgh on the 10th November, 1851.           His father died of
 phthisis in 1856, at the early age of 36, and his own health was for
 several years far from being stroDg, so that at times his friends were
 not withont anxiety lest he too should be attacked with the same
malady.
    The beginnings of Balfour's scientific career may be traced to   the
 influence of his mother, who endeavoured to cultivate in all        her

                                       xxi
  children some taste for natural science or natural history. Under
  her guidance the children early formed a geological collection, begin-
• ning with fossils picked from the gravel in front of the house ; in
  this collection, little Frank, as yet only seven or eight years old, inte
  rested himself greatly, and when offered the choice of a birthday
  present, begged for a large box, with trays and divisions, for hold
  ing fossils. The love for geology thus started grew strong in him
  during his boyhood ; and, indeed, this continued to be his favourite
  study until he went to Cambridge.         At the same time he was also
  drawn to natural history, making a collection not only of butterflies,
  as most boys do, but also of birds, having learnt how to prepare
   and preserve skins.
      After spending some little time at Hoddesdon, in Hertfordshire, at
  the preparatory school of the Rev. C. B. Chittenden, he entered at
   Harrow in 1865. His love of science was daily growing stronger, but
   the ordinary school studies awakened very little interest in him ; and
   at Harrow, as at Hoddesdon, he was not very successful in the routine
   class work.     He was left-handed, and in his early days somewhat
   awkward in muscular exercises, though later on he overcame his defi
   ciencies in this respect, and not only acquired great skill in anatomical
   and microscopical manipulation, but became an expert Alpine climber.
   A similar inaptitude to learn by mere imitation followed him into
   his school work; writing was a trouble to him, and, indeed, spelling
   no less so ; hence his school career gave no promise of the achievements
   which were to come. Happily, even at that time, science was cared
   for at Harrow, and, in the scientific teaching of Mr. G. Griffith,
   Balfour found a satisfaction which he failed to get from his class
   work. Though these science studies were, so to speak, extra acade
   mical, he threw himself into them with great enthusiasm, and his
   future life was perhaps foreshadowed by the delight he showed when
   the Rev. A. E. Eaton, on a visit to Harrow, taught him the art of
   dissecting under water.
       Geology still, however, remained his favourite study. In 1868, he
   sent up, in competition for a prize, an essay on the geology and
   natural history of East Lothian. This and another essay, by Mr. A.
   Evans, son of Mr. J. Evans, F.R.S., were considered to be of such
   unusual worth that Professor Huxley was specially requested to
   adjudicate on them ; the two essays received equal prizes.       The sub
   stance of his essay, Balfour, in conjunction with his brother, Mr. Gerald
   Balfour (afterwards with Francis a Fellow of Trinity College), sub
                                         " On some
   sequently elaborated into a paper                points in the Geology of
   the East Lothian Coast," which was published in the
                                                                 " Geological
               " for 1872.

      In 1870 he left Harrow for Cambridge with the reputation of a boy
   not likely to distinguish himself greatly in ordinary University

                                    xxii
studies,   but still  as one who by his great natural abilities- and
especially by the force of his strong character, bade fair to make his
mark somewhere.                                                           ,
    In the October term of that year he went into residence at Trinity
College, Cambridge, his college tutor being Mr. J. Prior. He early
placed himself under the private tuition of Mr. Marlborough Pryor
 (who had just been elected the first Natural Science Fellow at Trinity
                                                     " Previous Examina
College), and after passing, at Christmas, the
tion," devoted himself entirely to natural science. In Mr. Marl
borough Pryor he found a friend of remarkably wide knowledge and
sound judgment, who not only so well directed his pupil's studies,
that at Easter, Balfour was, without hesitation, elected Natural
Science Scholar at his college, but carefully matured thos- higher
scientific qualities which are rarely tested in any examination.
    After Christmas Balfour attended the lectures of Dr. Michael
Foster, who had been called to Trinity College, Cambridge, as Prse-
lector, at the same time that Balfour entered as a student. In a
course of lectures on embryology, given by the latter in the following
Easter term, Balfour was especially interested, and he soon after
definitely made up his mind to devote himself to the study of animal
morphology.
    Before long he was invited by Dr. Foster to join hint in pre
paring for publication the lectures on embryology, which the latter
 had given, and with that end in view began original inquiry by
attempting to investigate certain obscure points in the history of the
 chick. The results of these studies were subsequently published in
 the " Quarterly Journal of Microscopical Science " (July, 1873), as
 three papers " On the Development and Growth of the Layers of
 the Blastoderm," " On the Disappearance of the Primitive Groove in
 the Embryo Chick," and " On the Development of the Blood-vessels
 of the Chick."     Some of the views enunciated in these early papers
 were naturally modified by later experience, but the observations on
 the primitive streak are interesting as forming the starting point of
 views which Balfour developed more fully afterwards.
     These investigations, and others not recorded in any special papers,
 but made use of in the little work "Elements of Embryology"
 (1874), by Dr. Foster and himself, occupied so much of Balfour's
  time and energy, that ho was unable to do much in the way of
 formal preparation for his degree.        Nevertheless,   he nearly suc
  ceeded in obtaining the first place in the Natural Sciences Tripos
 in December, 1873; this fell to Mr. H. Newell-Martin,               now
 Professor at Baltimore, United States, America, Balfour being placed
 second.    Immediately after his degree he started, in company with
 his friend Mr. A. Dew-Smith, for Naples, to occupy at the Statione
 Zoologica of Dr. Anton Dohrn one of the tables at the disposal of

                                    xxiii
the University of Cambridge,        and began   those researches   on  the
development of Elasmobranchs with which his name will be ever
associated. Before leaving Naples in the following summer he had
not only obtained some striking results as to the development of the
layers of the blastoderm, but had in reality solved the difficult
 problem of the nature and origin of the urogenital system of
 vertebrates. The work done in Naples showed talents of so high an
 -rder that in the following October (1874) Balfour was on account of
 it unhesitatingly elected a Fellow of his College. The following
 winter he spent in a visit to South America with his friend Marl
 borough Prjor, but returning in the spring of 1875 resumed his
 investigations at Naples.
     He had, at the meeting of the British Association at Belfast, in
 August, 1874, made a brief statement of his researches, and in
 October of the same year published a preliminary account in the
 "Quarterly Journal of Microscopical Science." In the course of
  1875 he contributed to the "Journal of Anatomy and Physiology" a
  paper on the Urogenital Organs of Elasmobranchs, and laid before
  the Boyal Society an account of the development of the spinal nerves
  in those animals, which was subsequently published in the " Philoso
 phical Transactions."       He now commenced in the "Journal of
  Anatomy    and  Physiology" a series of papers (the first of which was
  published in January, 1876), giving a complete account of the deve
  lopment of the Elasmobranchs.         These were afterwards (1878)
  republished as a monograph.
     In the course of the summer of 1875, arrangements were made for
  him to deliver at Cambridge a course of lectures on animal morpho
  logy. These he began in the following October, and soon after his
  position was secured by his being appointed as lecturer to his College,
  though his lectures as before continued to be delivered in the Univer
  sity buildings, and to be open to all students of the University.
  Beginning with a very small audience, he rapidly drew students to
  him by the powerful way in which he taught as well as by the
  interest which he showed in the progress of each individual pupil.
     In spite of the time and energy taken up in organising and carrying
  on these lectures, he himself always assisting in the accompanying
  practical exercises, he pursued with unflagging ardour his original
  investigations. No sooner had he finished the monograph on the
   Elasmobranchs, than he set himself to write a complete treatise on
   Comparative Embryology.      The value of this work, the first volume
  of which, treating of invertebrates, appeared in 1880, and the second,
  of vertebrates, in 1881, cannot easily be exaggerated.    It is not only
  a masterly digest, in which the enormous number of observations made
   during the last quarter of a century, and especially during the last
  decenninm, are marshalled in proper order, and their nature and

                                      xxiv
significance   clearly and acutely explained ; it also contains, one might
say   in  almost   every page of the two thick volumes, the record of
original, often laborious inquiries, to which the author was stimulated
-ometimes for the sake of verifying the statements of other observers,
but more frequently for the purpose of solving morphological
problems which presented themselves to him as the work went on.
Some of the larger results, which thus sprang out of the work,
elaborated as inquiries carried out by himself, or through him by his
pupils, were published as separate papers ; but even when these are
accounted for, there still remains imbedded so to speak in the work,
an enormous amount of original work, in the form both of new facts
observed by himself and of luminous interpretations of the facts which
others had recorded, but whose true meaning others had failed to see.
    Parts of his vacations were spent in trips or longer voyages, for the
sake of health and amusement.          In this way he twice visited Finland,
and spent    a Christmas  in  Greece ; but he always contrived, even in the
midst of his pleasures, to make his holidays help in his work. He
paid repeated visits to Naples, and indeed he was from the beginning
one of the staunchest        and most valuable friends of Dr. Dobrn
and of the Statione Zoologica.            He was on a visit to his friend
Prof. Kleinenberg, at Messina, in the Christmas of 1881, buoyant
with the feeling of relief at having completed the Comparative Em
bryology, when, staying at Naples on his way, he found a pupil who
had been sent by the University of Cambridge to study at the Statione
Zoologica, lying sick of typhoid fever at Capri.         With characteristic
unselfish tenderness,    Balfour  set   himself to nurse his pupil until the
young man's friends could arrive. There can be no doubt that he
thus caught the malady, for in January (1882), soon after his return
to Cambridge, he himself was laid up with an attack of typhoid fever,
which threatened to be severe, but happily passed off well.
    Some time before this great endeavours had been made to induce
 him to become a candidate for the chair at Oxford left vacant by the
 lamented death of Professor G. Rolleston, and afterwards he was
 even more vigorously urged to accept a nomination to succeed the
 late Sir Wyville Thomson in the chair of Natural History at Edin
 burgh, perhaps the best endowed and most conspicuous biological
 chair in the United Kingdom.         He refused, however, to leave his own
 University, though     his  position there was simply that of a college
 lecturer and he had no post in the University itself. Moved by the
 peril of thus losing one of the brightest and most promising of its
 alumni, the University, at the instigation of Balfour's friends, took a
 most unusual step, and the Council, with the approval of the whole
 University, instituted a new chair for Balfour himself, and in March,
  1882, he was elected Professor of Animal Morphology.
    On his return from a visit to Naples in the summer of 1876, he

                                         XXV
-tayed for some little time in Switzerland, and apparently then was first
taken with the love of Alpine climbing, though it was not till the
-ummer of 1880 that he made any difficult ascents. The fondness for
this     exercise, the beneficial  effects of which on his health were most
 -triking    and encouraging, grew upon him in the following years. In the
 -ummer      of 1881 he passed some weeks in Switzerland, in company with
 his brother, Mr. Gerald Balfour,      and by his feats on that occasion placed
 himself at once in the front rank of Alpine climbers.          In the summer
  of   1882 he thought, and even the most cautious of his friends thought
  with him, that the Alpine air and mode of life would remove the last
  traces of weakness       which the typhoid fever had left behind, and in
  June he started, full of spirits, for Switzerland.    After some two or three
  weeks or so of climbing, during which he felt his strength quite come
  back, the old remedy acting with its usual charm, he set off from
  Courmayeur, with his guide, Johann Petrus, on Tuesday, July 18, to
  ascend the neighbouring Aiguille Blanche, a hitherto virgin peak.
  But he never came back alive. On the following Sunday an exploring
  party found his remains and those of his guide lying high up on the
  mountains at the foot of a couloir. The exact time and manner of his
  death will never be known, but it is probable that the fatal fall took
  place on Wednesday, the 19th ; it is almost certain that death was
  instantaneous, and it is the opinion of some that in the accident the
  guide fell first and carried Balfour with him. The body was brought
  home to England and buried at Whittinghame.
       To describe in a few words Balfour's contributions to biological
   science is a difficult or rather an impossible task, for brief as was his
   life, his active brain had traversed a large and varied area of thought
   and observation.      The leading idea which guided him in all his work
   was to use the facts of embryology to explain the development of
   animal life, to make the evolution of the individual throw light on the
   evolution of races and kinds. This idea was of course no new one ;
   indeed it has guided nearly all morphological inquiries since Darwin's
   labours, as, in a way, it did some before. But it was Balfour's distin
   guishing feature and merit that while his lively imagination opened
   up to him all manner of bold views and striking hypotheses, a strict
   logical sense forbade him to confound a mere possible or likely sug
   gestion with a proven truth.        The value of his work lay in this, that
   when he had conceived an idea he left no means untried to test its
   worth, and the charm of his writings consists as well in the clear
    and strong way in which he lays down proofs of the things which he
    considered proven, as in the frank candour with which he sets forth
    the difficulties of a probable, but as yet uncertain, opinion.
       Perhaps the most striking and complete of his works is that in
    which in a masterly way he furnished adequate proof of the view
    (which had occurred to others as well as himself) that the urogenital

                                    xxvi
 organs   of vertebrates are the derivatives of the segmental organs of
 Vermes, thus forging a strong link in the chain which holds together
 all animal life. Of still wider import, and perhaps still greater value.
 -was his elaboration of views, begun in his apprentice work on the
 Primitive Streak, and continued even into those last investigations
 which his sad death left unfinished, on what may be spoken of as the
 general formation of the complex animal bodies, and especially on
 the relation of the alimentary canal to other parts. Balfour early saw
 that certain vanishing grooves and holes and burrows in the embryos
 of higher vertebrates were the traces of the ways in which th-se
 higher forms had been evolved from lower ones, and all his work
 through he left no stone unturned, i.e., no specimen or section ud-
 searched, in his efforts to fill up gaps of evidence, and thus to make
 the whole story clear.
    The same guiding principle, the same logical method, the same
 clear distinction between the proven and the probable are also seen
 in his remarkable memoir on the Spinal Nerves of Elasmobranchg
 (which threw almost as much light on th. genesis of the vertebrate
nervous system as his earlier work did on the urogenital organs), and,
 indeed, are conspicuous in every one of his separate papers, including
 the unfinished fragments on Peripatns, as well as in every page of the
                 "                              He was unwearied in his
 incomparable      Comparative Embryology."
 labours, sitting for hours together preparing and examining section
after section; but others have been as unwearied as he. To him
 belonged that part of genius, which kept him from being buried
 beneath accumulated facts, and gave him the power to seize at once
upon the new salient fact as soon as it appeared, to develop* its
meaning, and to carry its teaching home to others by solid irre
fragable reasoning.
    Balfour will be known hereafter as a brilliant morphologist, as one
who busied himself with high qnestions of theoretic import ; but there
was also another side to even his biologic character.   Much of the pro
gress of biology has been due to the labours of men to whom perhaps
more rightly belongs the title of naturalist ; men who often do not vex
themselves with the more abstract problems of morphology, but born
with an innate love of living things, quietly gather facts and work
out truths, putting together their results in the guise for the most
part of some taxonomic inquiry.          Naturalists of this stamp are
generally born such, not made, whereas a man of adequate mental
strength may become an accomplished morphologist without feeling
any real sympathy with concrete animal life ; he may be carried on
by the mere interest of purely intellectual questions.    Now Balfour,
like his master, Darwin, was a born naturalist ; his knowledge and
appreciation of the concrete characters of the individual were as
striking as the power which he displayed in dealing with abstract

                                    xxvii
theories. He ,! knew his British birds" as few others did; nor was his
knowledge of species limited to these ; and, indeed, had he lived to
c-mplete the monograph on Thysanoura, for which he had been long
collecting materials, this would probably have placed him in the very
f-remost rank of British taxonomists.
     He was, as we have said, a geologist who became a biologist, but
his sympathies with all science remained wide and deep. His know
 ledge of physics, as far as it went, was singularly clear and sound ;
 his judgment     on intricate physiological questions was often of the
 greatest use to his friends at Cambridge. He was an ardent politician,
  he possessed great sympathy with art, and in the business of his
  College and University, as well as in other matters, showed adminis
 trative abilities of the very highest order.
     He had in him all the making of a great man, and his greatness
  -would have been felt whatever had been the things to which he
  turned his hand ; and no small part of the power with which, even in
  his few years, he had already begun to influence others, sprang from
  those qualities which, by p common but misleading analysis, we call
  moral as distinguished irom intellectnal. According to the degree
  to which their intimacy with him grew, those who got to know him
  were charmed with his kindly courteousness, fascinated with his bril
  liant, cheerful, often playful, companionship, held fast by his warm
  hearted, steadfast friendship. The feeble found him a patient helper ;
  meanness, untruthfuluess, and conceited stupidity were alone able
  to provoke him to anger, and to show what powers of scorn and
  sarcasm lay hidden in him.
     Though he died so young, his great merits were already rapidly
   gaining due recognition. He became a Fellow of the Society in
   June, 1878 ; on him, in November, 1881, was bestowed one of the
   Boyal medals, and at the same time he was elected member of Council.
   In the spring of 1881 he received the honorary LL.D. of Glasgow,
   and at the time of his death he was President of the Cambridge
   Philosophical Society, having been elected to that position in October,
   1881.
     We have already spoken of the eagerness shown both at Oxford
   and Edinburgh to gain him, and of the steps taken at his own Uni
  versity to keep him. For one brief term only was he professor, and
   even during that term, owing to his previous illuess, he gave no
  lectures ; now, instead of his bright presence, there is left at Cam
  bridge only his memory and the wish to carry on the work he left
  undone.
