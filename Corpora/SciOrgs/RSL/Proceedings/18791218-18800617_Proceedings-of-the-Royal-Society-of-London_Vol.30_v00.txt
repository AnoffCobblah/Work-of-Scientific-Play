   This memoir is a continuation of four previous            papers on similar
subjects.*
   As the investigation is entirely analytical, and is rather long and
complicated, it seems useless to attempt a detailed abstract, and               I
shall therefore confine myself to giving an outline of the results, and
a few   remarks on the method employed.            I also here partially replace
the analytical treatment of the paper itself by general reasoning, so as
to give some idea of the physical causes which underlie the definite
results of analysis.      These general considerations are not, however,

strictly appropriate to an abstract, since they do not occur in the
paper, and merely serve as a rough substitute for analysis.
    In this and the previous papers it is supposed that tides are raised
in a planet by its satellites, and the problem is to determine the
various effects which result from the friction of those tides.
    The hypothesis generally adopted in these papers is that the planet
is a viscous body, and that the tides are a bodily distortion of the
 whole mass of the planet, but nearly all the results would also follow
from the friction of oceanic tides upon a rigid nucleus.
    The investigation is principally directed towards the case of the
earth, sun, and moon, and the phraseology of the paper is taken from
our own planet and satellite ; but the methods may be extended to the
other planets.
    The subject will be most easily explained by inverting the order of
the paper, and by beginning with the sketch of the results.
                               Sketch of Results.
     A.t the present time the moon revolves    round the earth in 27-3 days.
The orbit has an eccentricity of y^, and is inclined at an angle of
 5° 9' to a certain plane, which is said to be
                                                    " proper to the orbit."
This proper plane is inclined to the ecliptic at an angle of about 8",
and intersects the ecliptic in the equinoctial line ; it lies on the same
 side of the ecliptic as the earth's equator.
    In this statement the " periodic inequalities " of the moon's motion
are neglected.
     In this and the previous papers it is proved that fractional tides in
 the earth are causing, and must have caused, changes in the configu
 ration of the system. The changes in the past may be summarised as
 follows : —
     1. The lunar period must have been shorter in the past, and may
 be traced back from the present 27'3 days, until initially the moon
 revolved round the earth in from 2 to 4 hours.
     2. The inclination of the orbit to the proper        plane must have
 been larger in the past, and may be traced back from the present
 5° 9' until it was 6° or 7°.   This 6° or 7° was a maximum inclination,
 and in the more remote past the inclination was less, and initially was
 very small, or zero.
     3. The inclination of the proper plane to the ecliptic must have
 been greater in the past, and may be traced back from the present 8",
 until it was in very early times about 11° 45'. It is possible that
 initially this inclination was less, and that the 11° 45' of inclination
  was a maximum value.
     4.  The eccentricity of the orbit must have been smaller in the past.
  Either at one time it had a minimum value, before which it had a.

   1879.]        On Secular Changes in   the Orbit  of a Satellite.         3
  maximum value, and again earlier it was very small, or zero ; or else
  the maximum value never occurred, and the eccentricity has always
  been increasing.      The history of the eccentricity depends on the
  nature of the tides in the earth, but the former of these alternatives
  seems the more probable.
     We will now consider the earth.
     At the   present time the earth rotates in 24 hours, its equator is in
  clined at an angle of about 9" to a plane, which is called in this paper
  " the
         proper plane of the earth." This proper plane is inclined at an
  angle of 23° 28' to the ecliptic, and its intersection with the ecliptic is
  the equinoctial line.
     (In the ordinary mode of statement the proper plane is called the
  mean equator, and the true equator is described as nutating about the
  mean equator with a period of 19 years, and an amplitude of 9".)
     It is here proved that the frictional tides in the earth have caused
  changes, which may be summarised as follows : —
       5. The earth's period of rotation, or the day, must have been
 shorter in the past, and it may be traced back from the present value
 of 24 hours, until initially it was from 2 to 4 hours in length.    It was
 then identical with the moon's period of revolution as described in (1).
     6. The inclination of the equator to " the earth's proper plane," must
 have been larger in the past, and may be traced back from the present
 value of 9",    until it was about 2° 45'. This 2° 45' was a maximum
 inclination, and in the more remote past the inclination was less, and
 initially it was very small, or zero.
     7. The inclination    of " the earth's proper plane
                                                           " to the
                                                                    ecliptic
 must have been smaller in the past, and may be traced back from its
 present value of 23° 28', until initially it was 11° 45', or perhaps
 somewhat less.      It was then identical with the proper plane of the
 lunar orbit ; and this is true whether or not 11° 45' was a maximum
 inclination of the lunar proper plane to the ecliptic, as described

     The preceding statements may be subject to varieties of detail,
-according to the nature of the tides raised in the earth, but the above
 is a summary of what appears to be the most probable course of
 evolution.
     The hypothesis     which is suggested as most probable is, that the
 more     recent  changes   in the system have been principally due to
 oceanic tidal friction, and that the more ancient changes were pro
 duced by bodily tidal friction.
     These seven statements, when taken together, exhibit the earth and
 moon initially nearly in contact; the moon always opposite the same
 face of the earth, or moving very slowly relatively to the earth's sur
 face ; the whole system rotating in from 2 to 4 hours, about an axi3
 inclined to the normal to the ecliptic at an angle of 11° 45', or some

what less ; and the moon moving in a circular orbit, the plane of
which is nearly coincident with the earth's equator.
    This initial configuration suggests that the moon was produced by
the rupture, in consequence of rapid rotation or other causes, of a
primeval planet, whose mass was made up of the present earth and
moon.     The coincidence is noted in the paper, that the shortest period
of revolution of a fluid mass of the same mean density as the earth,
which is consistent with an ellipsoidal form of equilibrium, is 2 hours
24 minutes ; and that if the moon were to revolve about the earth
with this periodic time, the surfaces of the two bodies would be
almost in contact with one another.
    Tidal friction is a vera causa, and the only postulates of this theory
of the evolution of our system are lapse of time, and the non-existence
of sufficient diffused matter to materially affect the motions of the
moon and earth through space.
    The systems of the other planets of the solar system are reviewed
from the point of view of this tidal theory of evolution, and it is found
that there are many confirmatory circumstances, and none which
appear condemnatory.         But as the present investigation only treats-
of a planet with a single satellite, it necessarily leaves many points
untouched.      In relation to this theory, the most interesting points are
the satellites of Mars, and the inclinations of the orbits of Jupiter's
satellites to their proper planes.

    The application of the method of the disturbing          function to the
present problem has certain peculiarities. The attraction of the tides
raised in the planet by a satellite is the cause of the perturbation of
the satellite's motion.       Now the state of tidal disturbance of the

planet depends npon the position of the satellite, therefore the
elements of the satellite's orbit will appear in the disturbing function,
as representing the state of tidal disturbance in the planet ; but these
elements also appear as representing the position of the satellite as a
body whose motion is pertnrbed.         In order to apply the method of
the  disturbing function they ought only to enter in the latter capacity.
This difficulty is overcome by supposing the earth to have two
satellites; one the tide-raising 'satellite (called Diana in the memoir),
and the other the perturbed satellite or moon.        Then, after the appli
cation of the method of the disturbing function, the tide-raising
satellite is made identical with the moon; and thus the effect of the
lunar tides on the moon's motion is determined.            Or else the tide-
raising   satellite is made  identical   with  the  sun,   so  as to find the
effect of the solar tides on the moon.       The method of the disturbing
function is also applied to determine the perturbations of the earth's
rotation, and a similar artifice has to be used, because the earth has
to be treated in two capacities, first as a body in which tides are
raised, and secondly, as a body whose rotation is perturbed.
   The problem is divided into the two following cases : —
   1st. Where the lunar orbit is circular, but inclined to the ecliptic.
   2nd. Where the orbit is elliptic, but coincident with the ecliptic.
   The previous paper on " Precession," dealt with the mean distance
of the moon, and with the rotation of the earth and the obliquity of
the ecliptic ; therefore, in the present paper the inclination and eccen
tricity afford the principal topics.
   The first of these problems occupies the larger part of the paper.
If the satellite and planet be the only bodies in existence, the problem
of the inclination is not very complicated.
   The following considerations       (in substitution for the analytical
treatment of the paper) will throw some light on the general effects of
tidal friction : —
   Suppose the motions of the planet and of its solitary satellite to be
referred to the invariable plane of the system.        The axis of resultant
moment of momentum is normal to this plane, and the component
rotations are that of the planet's rotation about its axis of figure, and that
of the orbital motion of the planet and satellite round their common
centre of inertia ; the axis of this latter rotation is clearly the normal
to the satellite's orbit.  Hence the normal to the orbit, the axis of
resultant m. of m., and the planet's axis of rotation, must always lie in
one plane.    From this it follows that the orbit and the planet's equator
must necessarily have a common node on the invariable plane.
   If either of the component rotations alters in amount or direction, a
corresponding change must take place in the other, such as will keep
the resultant m. of m. constant in direction and magnitude.
   It appears from the previous papers that the effect of tidal friction

t;                          Mr. G. H. Darwin.                    [Dec. 18r
is to increase the distance of the satellite from the planet, and to
transfer m. of m. from that of planetary rotation to that of orbital
motion.
   If then the direction of the planet's axis of rotation does not
change, it follows that the normal to the lunar orbit must approach
the axis of resultant m. of m.      By drawing a series of parallelograms
on the same diameter and keeping one side constant in direction, this
 may be easily seen to be true.
   The above statement is equivalent to saying that the inclination of
the satellite's orbit will decrease.
   But this decrease of inclination does not always necessarily take
place, for the previous investigations show that another effect
                                                                   of tidal
friction may be to increase the obliquity of the planet's equator to the
invariable plane, or in other words to increase the inclination of the
planet's axis to the axis of resultant m. of m.
   Now if a parallelogram be drawn with a constant diameter, it will
easily be seen that by increasing the inclination of one of the sides
to the diameter (and even decreasing its length), the inclination of
the other side to the diameter may also be increased.
   The most favourable case for such a change is when the side whose
inclination is increased is nearly as long as the diameter.     From this
it follows that the inclination of the satellite's orbit to the invariable
plane may increase, and also that the case when it is most likely to-
increase is when the m. of m. of planetary rotation is largo compared
with that of the orbital motion.          The analytical solution of the
problem agrees with these results, for it shows that if the viscosity of
the planet be small the inclination of the orbit always diminishes, but
if the viscosity be large, and if the satellite moves with a short periodic
time (as estimated in rotations of the planet), then the inclination of
the orbit will increase.
   These results serve to give some idea of the physical causes which,
according to the memoir, gave rise to the present inclination of the
lunar orbit to the ecliptic. For the analytical investigation shows
that the inclination of the lunar orbit to its proper plane (which
replaces the invariable plane when the solar attraction is introduced)
was initially small, that it then increased to a maximum, and finally
diminished, and that it is still diminishing.
   But the laws above referred to would, by themselves, afford a very
unsatisfactory explanation of the inclination of the lunar orbit,
because the sun's attraction was found to be a matter of much
importance.
   It was stated above, that if the viscosity of the planet be small, the
inclination of the orbit of the solitary satellite to the invariable plane
will always diminish ; but when solar influence is introduced, the
corresponding statement is not true with regard to the inclination of

1879.]       On Secular Changes     in the Orbit of a Satellite.         7
the lunar orbit to the proper plane, for during one part of the moon's
history, the inclination to the proper plane would have increased, even
if the viscosity of   the earth had been small.
   It does, however,    follow, from the analytical investigation, that  if
the lunar orbit was primitively coincident with the earth's equator,
then the present amount of inclination of the lunar orbit to the
ecliptic (viz., 5° 9') is not explicable on the hypothesis of small
viscosity of the earth, but is explicable if we suppose that the viscosity
of the earth has always been large, as it certainly is at present. The
theory which gives the most perfect account of the present amount of
inclination of the lunar orbit is, that the more recent changes in the
system have been principally due to oceanic tidal friction, and the more
ancient principally to bodily tidal friction, with a large degree of
viscosity of the earth's mass.
   The presence of the sun rendered it expedient to divide the problem
of the inclination into three cases : —
   1st. When the solar influence is large, as it is at present.
   2nd. When the solar influence is small, or nil.    This is the case to
which the above general considerations apply.
   And the third case is intermediate between the first and second
cases.
   For the third   case the theory of the proper planes of the moon and
earth had to be investigated, and the problem resolved itself into the
determination of the secular changes of the positions of the two
proper planes, and of the inclinations of the planes of motion of the
two parts of the system to their respective proper planes.
   The questions involved in these three cases are, however, so com
plex that it does not seem advisable to enter on them in this abstract.
   The second of the two problems, that of the eccentricity of the
orbit, is also treated by the method of the disturbing function.
   The result, for a viscous planet, shows that in general the eccen
tricity of orbit will increase; but if the obliquity of the planet's
equator be nearly 90°, or if the viscosity be so great as to approach
perfect rigidity, or if the periodic time of the satellite (measured
in rotations of the planet) be short, the eccentricity will slowly
diminish.
   When the viscosity is small the law of variation of eccentricity is
very simple, and it appears that if eleven periods of the satellite
occupy a longer time than eighteen rotations of the planet, the eccen
tricity increases, and vice versa. Hence, in the case of small viscosity,
a circular orbit is only dynamically stable if the eleven periods are
shorter than the eighteen rotations.
   In the history of a single satellite revolving about a planet of small

viscosity, the periods of rotation and revolution start from identity
and end with identity ; hence the eccentricity rises from zero to a
maximum,       and ultimately decreases to zero again.
    It is also proved, that in the history of a single satellite revolving
about a planet of large viscosity, the eccentricity rises very rapidly to
a maximum,        decreases slowly to a minimum, and then increases again ;
but the actual degree of viscosity has an important influence on the
results.
    The following considerations           (in substitution for the analytical
treatment of the paper) throw some light on the physical causes of
these results.
    Consider a satellite revolving about a planet in an elliptic orbit,
with a periodic time which is long compared with the period of
rotation of the planet ; and suppose that frictional tides are raised in
the planet.
    The major axis of the tidal spheroid              always points in advance      of
the satellite,     and exercises     a force    on the satellite which tends        to
accelerate its linear velocity.
    When the satellite is in perigee the tides are higher, and this dis
turbing force is greater than when the satellite is in apogee.
    The disturbing force may, therefore, be represented as a constant
force, always tending to accelerate the motion of the satellite, and a
periodic force which accelerates in perigee and retards in apogee.
The constant force causes a secular increase of the satellite's mean
distance and a retardation of its mean motion.
    The accelerating force in perigee causes the satellite to swing out
further than it would otherwise have done, so that when it comes
round to apogee it is more remote from the planet. The retarding
force in apogee acts exactly inversely, and diminishes the perigeean
distance.      Thus, the apogeean distance increases and the perigeean
 distance diminishes, or in other words, the eccentricity of the orbit
 increases.
     Now consider another case, and suppose the satellite's periodic
 time to be identical with that of the planet's rotation.                Then when
 the satellite is in perigee it is moving faster than the planet rotates,
 and when in apogee it is moving slower ; hence at apogee the tides
 lag, and at perigee they are accelerated.            Now the lagging apogeean
 tides give rise to an accelerating force, on the satellite, and increase
 the perigeean distance, whilst the accelerated perigeean tides give rise
 to a retarding force, and decrease the apogeean distance.                  Hence in
 this  case the   eccentricity of the orbit will diminish.
     It follows from these two results that there must be some inter
 mediate periodic time of the satellite, for which the eccentricity does
not tend to vary.*
    * The  substance  of the preceding general explanation was suggested to me in con-

1879.]        On Secular Changes in the Orbit     of a Satellite.             9
   But the preceding general explanations are in reality somewhat less
satisfactory than they seem, because they do not make clear the
existence of certain antagonistic influences.
   Imagine a satellite revolving about a planet, and subject to a con
stant accelerating force, which we saw above would result from tidal
reaction.
   In a circular orbit a constant tangential force makes the satellite's
distance increase, but the larger the orbit the less does the given force
increase the mean distance. Now the satellite, moving in the eccentric
orbit, is in the apogeean part of its orbit like a satellite moving in a
circular orbit at a certain mean distance, but in the perigeean part of
the orbit it is like a satellite moving in a circular orbit but at a
smaller mean distance ; in both parts of the orbit it is subject to the
same tangential force.     Then the distance at the perigeean part of the
orbit increases more rapidly than the distance at the apogeean part.
Hence the constant tangential force on the satellite in the eccentric
orbit will make the eccentricity diminish. It is not clear from the
preceding general explanation, when this cause for decreasing eccen
tricity will be less important than the previous cause for increasing
eccentricity.
   The disturbing causes which tend to make the eccentricity diminish
are (i) the principal semi-diurnal tide, (ii) the "faster elliptic semi
diurnal tide," (iii) the " elliptic monthly tide." The increase of eccen
tricity depends entirely on (iv) the " slower elliptic semi-diurnal tide."
If the periodic time of the satellite be long, as measured in rotations
of the planet, the importance of the tides (i), (ii), and (iv) are as the
numbers 4, 1, and 49 respectively, and the importance of (iii) is very
small ; if the satellite were to move faster, the importance of (iv)
would decrease, and that of (i), (ii), and (iii) would increase.
    In the outline of results at the beginning of the abstract, it was
stated that the periodic times of revolution and rotation of the moon
and earth might be traced back to a common period of from 2 to
4 hours.      In the paper on " Precession " the common period was
 found to be a little over 5 hours in length ; but that result was
avowedly based on a partial neglect of the sun's attraction.            In this
 memoir certain further considerations are adduced, which show that,
 while the general principle remains intact, yet the common period of
revolution of the earth and moon must initially have been shorter than
5 hours to an amount, which is uncertain but is probably large.
The period of from 2 to 4 hours is here assigned, because it is me
chanically impossible for the moon to revolve about the earth in less
than 2 hours, and it is uncertain how the rupture of the primeval
planet took place.

applied to the two problems of the present paper, conld ever have
led to a discovery of the laws of change of the system.        This kind of

II. " On Buff s Experiments on the Diathermancy of Air."                By
      John Tyxdall, F.R.S. Received December 10, 1879.
   Two years ago, Dr. Hofmaun drew my attention to a forthcoming
paper by Professor Buff, to which he obviously and naturally attached
considerable importance.       The paper appeared in the " Philosophical
            " for December,
Magazine                       1877.    Being much occupied at the time
with other matters, I merely glanced at its conclusions, and then laid
                I
it aside until should be able to read it carefully, and, if necessary, to-
examine it experimentally.         Last summer, I, for the first time, read
the paper through, and      I have recently, more than once, repeated its
perusal  — reflecting  on its methods and conclusions, to the best of my
ability, wherever they appeared dark to me.
   The principal result of the paper is, that a stratum of dry air,
                      " absorbs from 50 to 60 per cent, of the
45 millims. thick,                                                  rays of
heat which it receives from a source heated to the temperature of
boiling water."      The experiments whereby I sought to show tbe-
absorption of radiant heat, by a stratum of dry air more than thirty
times the thickness of that employed by Professor Buff, to be sensibly
niJ, are, at the same time, pronounced " unreliable."
   I once ventured te express the opinion that 10 per cent, of the-
radiation from the earth is absorbed by the aqueous vapour contained
in the first 10 feet of air. The late Professor Magnus urged against
me at the time, that were so much heat lodged in so thin a stratum,
the deposition of dew would be impossible.          Urged against the con
clusion that not 10 per cent., but GO per cent, of the earth's radiation is-
absorbed, not within 120 inches, but within 2 inches of the earth's
surface, the argument of Professor Magnus would have serious force-
Under the covering assigned to it by Professor Buff, our planet ought
never to suffer from rapid nocturnal chill.
   Professor Buff's intention, at starting, was to investigate the con
duction of heat by gases, and he employed for this purpose an-
apparatus similar to that of Professor Magnus, the dangers attending
the use of which      I  have frequently pointed out.     A glass cylinder,
with its lower edge ground level, was mounted on the plate of an air-
pump.     Cemented on to the open top of the cylinder was a brass
vessel with a polished horizontal bottom, which was heated by the

  1879.]       Buff's Experiments on          the Diathermancy       of Air.        11
 pouring of hot water into the vessel. From this source the heat pro
ceeded through air or any other gas introduced into the cylinder
 underneath.       To measure the heat transmitted, a flattened thermo
electric couple was fixed, in the first experiment, at a distance of
 '23 millims. below the polished surface ; two wires being carried from
 the couple through the plate of the air-pump to a suitable galvano
 meter.
     It immediately appeared that the experiments were vitiated by the
 heat conducted from the source down the glass cylinder. Below the
level of the thermo-electric couple this heat was even sensible to the-
touch. Currents, Professor Buff rightly inferred, would, under the
circumstances,        be unavoidable.         He would have free convectionT
whereas      his  object    was  to   investigate conduction. He further con
cluded, also rightly, that such currents were present in the experi
ments of Magnus,* although through the disposition of his apparatus,
" he probably failed to appreciate the importance" of this source of
error.
     Thus warned, Professor Buff changed his mode of experiment, and
the change will be best described and illustrated in his own words : —

time, assumed a maximum deflection, indicating a state of equilibrium

    I interpret thus the method here pursued :- —Suppose, for the sake
of simplicity, the thermometric zero at the bottom of the brass vessel
to correspond, at starting, with the galvanometric zero, and supposing
the temperature of the bottom of the brass vessel to augment within
 certain limits ; then, so long as the differences remained small, the
Quantity of heat received by the soldered junction would be propor
tional to the difference of temperature between the junction and the
source.      When, under such conditions, the galvanometric degrees, or
their values, are divided by the thermometric degrees, a constant
quotient ought to be obtained.          If, on interposing any gas between
the source and the junction, the quotient referred to were observed to
.change, such change would express the action of the gas ; while the

1879.]       -BwjT * Experiments on the Diathermancy         of Air.        13
quotients obtained with different       gases would express their relative
actions.   It is,  I suppose,  on  considerations   such as these that Pro
fessor Buff has based his column of
                                            " comparable values," where the
galvanometric value is multiplied by 100 and divided by the thermo-
metric value.
   But the actual experiments of Professor Buff are by no means so
simple as the ideal ones here described.           He brings, first of all, his
needle to zero by the introduction of water of the proper temperature
into his brass vessel. Removing a portion of this he pours in hot
water, and has to wait for 22 minutes when air is in his cylinder, and
for 15 minutes when the cylinder is exhausted, before his needle attains
its maximum deflection.       Hero it remains stationary " for 30 minutes
and more."     Thus while the temperature of the polished brass bottom
is steadily sinking from 56° to 47°'7, the deflection is gradually
rising, obviously not through the action of what was intended to be
the source. Professor Buff then divides his maximum galvanometric
deflection, multiplied by 100, by the difference between his initial and
his final temperature, and obtains in this way his column of " com
parable values."
   Though begun with a view to conduction, no inference regarding
this subject is drawn from these experiments.        We pass, without notice,
from conduction to diathermancy, Professor Buff pointing out that his
result agrees with that of Magnus in making the denser hydrogen
" more diathermanous than the rarefied." Finding, however, in oppo
sition to Magnus, that air showed a similar deportment, being more
diathermanous at 760 millims. than at 15 millims., Professor Buff was
induced to seek the cause, and if possible avoid the occurrence of so
abnormal   a result.
   Round the cylinder containing his gases he placed a second and
wider one, and filled the space between them with cold water to
within 7 millims. of the bottom of his brass vessel. The deflection of
the needle fell considerably, and the anomaly of dense air being more
diathermanous than rarefied air disappeared.            Even here, however,
Professor   Buff    detected  currents,  or   a cause of currents, the heat
conducted down the interior cylinder rendering the water warm at
the top.    Lowering his junction to a depth of 45 millims. below
the source of heat, he allowed cold water to enter his annular space
below and to run off above. Here he halted, as if every source of error
had been removed.         By means of his water jacket he lessened his
radiating  zone   of  glass and diminished the area of the heated vertical
surface with which his gases came into contact.           It is obvious, how
ever, that no contact of the kind ought to have been at all permitted.
The brass plate, which he regarded as his source of heat, must have
accepted almost momentarily the temperature of the water above it ;
still, even in the improved experiments, 8 minutes were required to

¦enable   the needle to rise from 0° to 280-C, the temperature of the
presumptive  source falling at the same time from 46° to 39°-6. It is on
¦experiments conducted in this way that Professor Buff founds con
clusions which, were they correct, would leave eight or nine years of
diligent and careful work, on my part, in a very serious plight.
 Hydrogen gas he alleges to be as diathermanous as a vacuum, while
more than 50 per cent, of his radiation              is,
                                                as before stated, absorbed
 by 45 millims. of air.
   With the fact before him that the deflection of his galvanometer
needle was rising while the temperature of his brass plate was sinking,
it  must have occurred to Professor Buff that not the brass but the
glass was his really efficient source of heat.    The radiating zone was
chilled by his gases, currents were established, and that hydrogen
under such circumstances should transfer more heat to his junction
than air   isonly what might be expected from the mobility of the gas.
   Professor Buff next lowered his junction to a distance of 100
millims. below his source, and obtained an unexpected result.       Instead
of the absorption increasing,    as    ought
                                       it    to have done   when the  depth
of the absorbing layer was more than doubled,        fell from 50 to 15 per

brass surface with lampblack,

                                                             power of the
source of heat must have been six or seven times greater than previ
ously," there was hardly any increase of the deflection.      The junction
was here acted on simply by the chilled sides of the surrounding
vessel.   I have failed to extract a clear meaning from Professor Buff's
remarks on this point but, as a matter of fact, when the interior of
                          ;
his cylinder was covered with double cardboard, the absorptive energy
of dry air in great part reappeared. The only distinct impression here

surface of his glass cylinder, which ought to have been absolutely

 1879.]       Buff's Experiments on    the Diathermancy   of Air.         15
by dry and pellucid plates of rock-salt. The vacuous chamber was
clasped at one place by a water jacket, which cut off all conduction
from the source. At some distance beyond the end of the tube stood
tte thermo-pile, furnished with a double cone, with a view to the
application of the principle of compensation.      The experimenter who
does not shrink from the discipline necessary to master it will find
thia method powerful, exact, and under the most complete control.
By it was determined, for the first time, in 1859, the action of a con
siderable number of gases and vapours, one result of the inquiry being
that, while some transparent gases were more impervious than many
solids, the dry atmospheric air enveloping our earth was a practical
vacuum to the rays of heat.
    From this result the experiments of the late Professor Magnus led
him to dissent.     We once discussed our differences viva voce ; he urging
against me an objection which has been revived by Professor Buff.
I   had,, he said, sent my heat through a vacuous chamber into my
experimental tube ; but between that tube and my pile there existed
a space of air, in which, he asserted, the absorption which I had failed
to detect in the tube itself took place. He mentioned a series of
experiments which he was then on the point of publishing, and which,
he said, proved, not only that the absorption of radiant heat by air
was considerable, but also that a layer of air 12 inches thick sufficed
to intercept all the rays that air was capable of intercepting. A pub
lished account of these results    I have never been able to find, but they
must have closely resembled those now under discussion.
    I asked Professor Magnus whether he thought a stratum of air
-2Joth of an inch in thickness would exert any sensible absorptive
action.     He promptly replied in the negative.     I therefore made the
following experiment, which has been overlooked by Professor Buff.
Placing the anterior cone of my pile within the experimental tube, I
was able to bring its naked face within -^th of an inch of my terminal
plate of rock-salt. There was not the slightest alteration of the pre
viously obtained result.     Dry air, as before, behaved like a vacuum.
    Fig.  1 is a rough vertical section of one of the pieces of apparatus
recently arranged with a view of testing Professor Buff's conclusions.
F and P are two chambers formed of brass tubing 2| inches in diameter.
The chamber F is soldered to the cube C, one face of which consti
tutes the source of heat.         W is a jacket in which water of the
temperature      of the  surrounding atmosphere constantly circulates,
preventing the heat conducted from C from passing further. The
chamber F is separated from the chamber P by an intermediate
chamber i, bounded by the rock salt plates r, r'. Within the chamber P
 is the thermo-pile, from which wires pass through the tube to a sensi
 tive galvanometer.     S is a screen, and C a compensating cube. The

16                           Prof. J. Tyndall  on                 [Dec. 18,
chamber    P  is closed at its end by the rock-salt plate t, through which
the heat rays from     C can reach the posterior face of the pile.
    Adjusting the screen S so that the rays impinging on both sides of
the pile accurately neutralise each other, the rock-salt plates r, r', being
first in contact, by means of a screw d, one of the plates r' is withdrawal
from the other, dry air being introduced into the space between them.
The layer of air could be gradually augmented in thickness from zero
to 3 inches, which exceeds by more than 50 per cent, the thickness of
the layer to which Professor Buff ascribes an absorption of 50 or 60
per cent.
    The apparatus is delicately constructed, and to avoid the strain upon
the plates of rock-salt r, r , which would occur if the chambers F and
P were exhausted, each of these chambers was filled with dry hydro
gen.    This, according to Professor Buff, is tantamount to a vacuum,
exercising no action whatever on the rays of heat.
    Repeated experiments with this apparatus proved the absorption of
the layer of dry air in the chamber i to be nil.
    But here another question arises. The rays of heat in these experi
ments had passed through plates of rock-salt.        Supposing, therefore,
that air and rock-salt absorb the same rays, the sifting of the rays by
the salt would cause the air within the experimental tube to behave as
a vacuum.       Professor Buff endeavours to prove that this is the case.
He first  finds  the transmission of radiant heat by a plate of clear rock-
salt 3 millims. in thickness to be less than 60 per cent, of the entire
radiation ; and then he finds that the thermal colours of rock-salt and
air are
          " sufficiently similar to explain the phenomena observed
                                                                           by
Tyndall."
   It is hardly credible that the skilled experimenters who preceded
Professor Buff should have failed to detect the high absorption which
he ascribes to rock-salt, if it were a fact.       Melloni's determination

which makes the transmission of a plate of rock-salt 2"6 millims. thick
92'3 per cent, of the total radiation is, in my opinion, much nearer the
truth than that of Professor Buff.       Be that as it may, I can affirm
that in my case the transmission through plates of rock-salt of five
 times the thickness of that employed by Professor Buff amounts to
80 per cent, of the entire radiation.    Subtracting from the 20 per cent,
 intercepted, 8 per cent, due to reflection at the two surfaces of the salt,
 we have 12 per cent, remaining for absorption.*
    Were tbe thermal colours of air wholly, instead of partially, as
affirmed by Professor Buff, identical with those of rock-salt, the
coincidence would fail to account for the high absorption which he
ascribes to air.   But let us examine whether the alleged coincidence
exists at all.   To treat this question exhaustively, we must be able
to compare the transmission of rock-salt in vacuo with its transmission
in air.    The apparatus employed for this purpose is rendered in
telligible by the rough section, fig. 2.    From the cube C the experi-

Midway, a rectangular chamber B is introduced, large enough to
permit of ono of my plates of rock-salt « to be raised and lowered
within it.    It is soldered on to the experimental tube, being ex
hausted when the tube is exhausted.      The plate of salt « is clasped
by a ring attached to the rod R, which moves air-tight through a
stuffing-box in the bottom of the chamber B.       The plate of salt s is
'2J inches in diameter   while across the experimental tube, right and

  jacket  W   plays the part already assigned to it.                The method of
  experiment is now easy of comprehension.
     The whole space between C and t was, in the first place, rendered as
  empty as a good air-pump could make it. The radiation from the
  compensating cube C being cut off by the screen S, the total radiation
 from C was declared by the galvanometer.               The plate of salt was then
  pushed up, and the consequent fall of the deflection was repeatedly
  noted. Thus the absorption by rock-salt of radiant heat, which in no
  part of its course had been sifted by air, was determined.               Dry air
 was then permitted to slowly enter the experimental tube until it was
 filled. The length of air through which the rays had to pass before
 reaching the pile was ten times that in which Professor Buff had
 found his large absorption.       The sifting of the rays by the air, if
 Professor Buff be correct, ought here to reduce the absorption of the
 rock-salt to nothing. As in the former case, the experiment was
 repeated many times, and on different days. There was no difference
 between the transmission through the air and salt, and through the
 vacuum and salt. The air proved absolutely powerless to influence in
 any sensible degree the colour or quality of the heat.                 Here is a
 sample of the results obtained :    —

    The value of 39° 5 is 46 units ; that of 35 °0 is 36 5 units — hence the
transmission amounts, as in the vacuum, to 80 per cent, of the whole
radiation.
    The experiment was Checked, not only by repetition, but by the
following variation.
    By means of the adjusting screen S, the heat from the com
pensating tube C was caused to accurately neutralise that from C,

the needle   of the galvanometer pointing to zero. When this was done
with the experimental tnbe exhausted, the plate of salt was pushed
up.   A  moderate     deflection of the galvanometer was the consequence.
Repeated experiments made the heat intercepted by the salt 20 per
cent, of the whole radiation.       This was the fraction stopped whether the
tube teas exhausted or filled with air.      This stoppage of 20 per cent,
exactly corresponds with the transmission          of 80 per cent, resulting
from the previous experiments.
   I have  also taken the trouble to repeat Professor BufFs experiments
with an apparatus similar to his own ; taking care, however, to avoid
the  principal error into which I suppose him to have fallen. A glass
                                            J
cylinder, A, fig. 3, 12 inches long and 2 inches in diameter, is mounted
on the plate p, p, of an air-pump. On it is placed a tin vessel C, with a
brass bottom, intended to contain the water which warms the bottom,
or source of heat.     A thermo-pile, P, is mounted on the air-pump plate
on  which the cylinder stands, one of its faces being presented to
the bottom of the tin vessel.          The conical reflector is abandoned,
a piece of tubing blackened within, and intended              to cut off the
radiation from the sides of the vessel, being pushed over the pile.
Instead of bringing brass and glass into direct contact, as in the
apparatus of Professor Buff, a washer, w, w, of non-conducting india-
rubber, an inch and an eighth in thickness, separates the one from
the other.    There is no chilling by cold water, and the distance of

the pile from the source renders it difficult     for heat to pass by con
vection from the one to the other.
   Following the method pursued by Professor Buff, the radia
tion through hydrogen was compared with the radiation through
air. To make the experiments more strictly comparable, the tem
perature of the source was in all cases rendered the same. Instead
of having to wait 8 minutes for the needle to reach its maximum
deflection, it was steady there in less than a quarter of this time.
The result was very different from that obtained by Professor Buff.
Instead of the one gas absorbing from 50 to 60 per cent, of the
radiation, and the other none, no difference whatever was to be
detected between the deportment of hydrogen and that of air.             Both,
as before, proved practical vacua to the rays of heat.
   Professor Buff describes other experiments, to one only of which          I
need refer.   He makes " the diathermancy of defiant gas somewhat
higher than that of air." It mast have been a strangely defective
apparatus which could yield such a result.              Air differs as widely
from defiant gas as rock-salt differs from ice. Pursuing Professor
Buff's own method of experiment,* but insulating the glass cylinder
from the source of heat, the diathermancy of air was found to be
perfect, whereas 11 inches of defiant gas absorbed 33 per cent, of the
total radiation.
   Such is my examination of the paper to which my attention was
directed two years ago by Dr. Hofmann.

   The author presented, in December, 1876, a preliminary note on
 the subject of this paper, together with a diagram of the spectrum of
 Vega compared with that of the sun.
    The author refers to a paper by Dr. William Allen Miller and himself
 in 1864, in which they describe an early attempt to photograph the
 spectra of stars.
    Other investigations prevented the author from resuming this line
 of research until 1875, when a more perfect driving clock, by Grubb,
 enabled him to take up this work with greater prospect of success.
    The author describes the special apparatus and the methods of
 working which have been employed.
    The spectrum apparatus consists of one prism of Iceland spar and

lenses of quartz. It is so arranged in the telescope that the image of
the star can be brought with certainty npon any part of the slit, and
can be kept there daring the photographic exposures, by a method of
continuous supervision and control. The slit is provided with two
shutters, through one-half of which a solar or other spectrum may be
taken on the same plate for comparison and the determination of the
lines in position in the spectrum.
    The photographs were examined and the lines measured by means
of a micrometer attached to a microscope of low power.               These
measures were reduced to wave-lengths by the help of solar and
terrestrial spectra, use being made of M. Cornu's map of the ultra
violet part of the spectrum, and of M. Mascart's determination of the
wave-lengths of the lines of cadmium.
    Photographs have been obtained of the stars Sirius, Vega,
<x Cygni, a. Virginis, 7 Ursa Majoris, a Aquilffl, Arcturus, /3 Pegasi,
Betelgeux, Capella, a Herculis, and « Pegasi.         Also of the planets
Jupiter, Venus, and Mars, and of the different parts of the moon.
    The spectra of Sirius, Vega, a. Cygni, a. Virginis, 7 Ursre Majoris,
x Aquil®, and Arcturus are laid down in a map on the scale of
M. Cornu's map of the ultra-violet part of the solar spectrum.
    The stellar spectra extend from about G to O in the ultra-violet.
The stars of the white class are arranged so as to exhibit, first, the
remarkable spectrum typical of this class, and then some of the
modifications it appears to undergo.
    The typical spectrum of this region of this class consists of twelve
strong lines winged at the edges. The contiuuous spectrum extends
in the photographs beyond S, but no lines are seen more refrangible
than the twelfth line at 3699. Two of these lines agree in position
with the hydrogen line (7) 4340, and the other line at h. The third
line agrees with Hi. The remaining nine form a group, in which the
distance between any two adjacent lines is less as the refrangibility
increases, suggesting that they are connected with each other, and
represent, probably, one substance.
    A very suggestive modification presents itself in the difference of
character of the line H3. In these stars this line is either absent or very
thin as compared with its appearance in the solar spectrum.         In the
spectrum of Arcturus, which belongs to the solar type, this line exceeds
in breadth and intensity its condition in the solar spectrum. The white
stars may, therefore, be arranged in a series in which the line H3 passes
through different stages of thickness, at the same time that the typical
lines become narrower and more defined, and other finer lines present
themselves in increasing numbers.        Arcturus seems to present a
spectrum on the other side of that    of the sun in the order of change
 from the white-star group.
    The spectra of the planets were taken on the plan suggested by the

 negative as to any absorptive action of a lunar atmosphere.
IV. " On     a New Method of Spectrum Observation."                   By  J.  N.
       Lockyer, F.R.S.         Communicated          at the request of the
       Committee on Solar Physics. Received December 10, 1879.
    In anticipation of my report on the Methods of Mapping Spectra,
        I
which have been requested to prepare for the Solar Committee,              I beg
to present to them the following        account   of some recent   work which
has been suggested during the          preparation of that report.       In the
 " Phil. Trans." for 1873*   I         an historical account, showing how,
                                gave
when a light source, such as a        spark or an electric arc, is made to
throw its image on the slit of a spectroscope, the lines had been seen
                           I
of different lengths, and also showed, by means of photographs, how
 very definite these phenomena were.         It was afterwards demonstrated
that chemical combination or mechanical mixture gradually reduced
the spectrum by subtracting the shortest lines, and leaving only the
long ones.
    On the hypothesis that the elements were truly elementary, the
explanation generally given and accepted was that the short lines
 were produced by a more complex vibration imparted to the " atom" in
the region of greatest electrical excitement, and that these vibrations
were obliterated or prevented from arising by cooling or admixture
with dissimilar atoms.
    Subsequent work, however, has shownf that of these short lines
some are common to two or more spectra.               These lines  I have called
basic.    Among the short lines, then, we have some which are basic,
and some which are not.
    The different behaviour of these basic lines seemed, therefore, to
suggest that not all of the short lines of spectra were, in reality, true
products of high temperature.
    That some would be thus produced and would therefore be common
to two or more spectra we could understand by appealing to Newton's
rnle : " Causas rerum naturalium non plures admitti debere quam
quffl et versa sint et earum pheenomenis explicandis sufneiant," and

1879.]           On a New Method       of Spectrum       Observation.          23
imagining      a higher dissociation.    It became, however, necessary to see
if the   others would also be accounted for.
    I  have already given to the Royal Society a preliminary account
of the extraordinary, because unexpected, phenomena and changes
observed in the spectra of vapours of the elementary bodies when
volatilised at different temperatures in vacuum tubes. Many of the
lines thus seen alone and of surpassing brilliancy are those seen as
short and faint in ordinary methods of observation, and the circum
stances under -which they are seen suggest, if we again appeal to the
above rule, that many of them are produced by complex molecules.
   In this case the appeal lies to the phenomena produced when
organic bodies are distilled at varying temperatures ; the simplest
bodies in homologous series are those volatilised at the lowest tempera
tures ; so that on subjecting a mixture of two or more liquids to
distillation, at the beginning a large proportion of the more volatile
body comes over, and so on.
   At any particular heat-level, then, some of the short lines may be
due to the vibrations of molecular groupings produced with difficulty
with the temperature employed, while others represent the fading out
of the vibrations of other niolecular groupings produced on the first
application of the heat.
                                           I
   In the line of reasoning which advanced a year ago,* both these
results are anticipated, and are easily explained.               Slightly varying
fig. 2 of that paper, we may imagine furnace A to represent the
temperature of the jar spark, B that of the Bunsen burner, and C a
temperature lower than that of the Bunsen burner.
   Then in the light of the paper the lines 6 and c would be truly pro
duced by the action of the highest temperature, c would be short and
might be basic, while of the lines h and m, m would be short and
could not be basic, because it is a remnant of the spectrum of a lower
temperature.
   To make this reasoning valid we must show then that the spark, or
better   still the arc, provides us with a summation of the spectra of
various molecular groupings into which the solid metal which we use
as poles is successively broken up by the action of temperature.
   We are not limited to solid metals ; we may use their salts. In this
case it is shown in the paper before referred tof that in very many
cases the spectrum is one much less rich in lines.
   I  have therefore attempted to gain new evidence in the required
direction by adopting a method of work with a spark and a Bunsen
flame, which Colonel Donnelly suggested           I should use with a spark and
an electric arc.     This consists in volatilising those substances which

 give us flame spectra in a Bunsen flame and passing a strong spark
 through the flame, first during the process of volatilisation, and then
 after the temperature of the flame has produced all the simplification
 it is capable of producing.
    The results have been very striking; the puzzles which a com
 parison of flame spectra and the Fraunhofer lines has set us find, I
 think, a solution ; while the genesis of spectra is made much more
clear.*
    To take an instance, the flame spectrum of sodium gives us, as its
brightest, a yellow line, which is also of marked importance in the
solar spectrum.       The flame spectra of lithium and potassium give us,
as their brightest, lines in the red which have not any representatives
among the Fraunhofer lines, although other lines seen with higher
temperatures     are present.
    Whence arises this marked difference of behaviour ? From the
similarity of the flame spectrum to that of the sun in one case, and
from the dissimilarity in the other, we may imagine that in the former
case — that of sodium — we are dealing with a body easily broken up,
while lithium and potassium are more resistant ; in other words, in
the case of sodium, and dealing only with lines recognised generally
as sodium lines, the flame has done the work of dissociation as com
pletely as the sun itself. Now it is easy to test this point, for if this
be so then (1) the chief lines and flu tings of sodium should be seen in
the flame itself, and (2) the spark should pass through the vapour
after complete volatilisation lias been effected without any visible
effect.
    Observation and experiment have largely confirmed these predic
tions. Using two prisms of 60° and a high-power eyepiece to en
feeble the continuous spectrum of the densest vapour produced at a
high temperature, the green lines, the flutings recorded by Roscoe and
Schuster, and another coarser system of flutings, so far as I know not
yet described, are beautifully seen.           I say largely, and not completely,
because the double red line and the lines in the blue have not yet
been seen in the flame, either with one, two, or four prisms of 60°,
though the lines are seen during volatilisation if a spark be passed
through the flame. Subsequent inquiry may perhaps show that this is
due to the sharp boundary of the heated region, and to the fact that
they represent the vibrations of molecular groupings more complex than
those which give us the yellow and green lines. The visibility of the
green lines, which are short, in the flame, taken in connexion with
the fact that they have been seen alone in a vacuum tube, is enough for
my present purpose.
    • I allude more especially to the production of triplets, their change into quartets,
and in all probability into flutings, and to the vanishing of flutings into lines by in
creasing the rate of dissociation.

26                               Mr.  J.  N. Lockyer.                      [Dec. 18.
    With regard to the second point, the passage from the heat-level
of the flame to that of the spark, after volatilisation is complete, pro
duces     no visible effect ; indicating that in all probability the effects
heretofore ascribed to quantity have been due to the presence of the
molecular groupings of greater complexity.                   The more there is to
dissociate, the more time is required to run through the series, and the
better the first stages are seen.
    Let ns now turn to lithium.
    Seeing that the red line is absent while the violet lithium line is
strong among the Fraunhofer lines, we may imagine that the flame
has not done the work of dissociation in the case of lithium so
completely as the sun does it, so that (1) the other lines of lithium
should not be visible, even with the new precautions, in the flame
spectrum, and (2) a passage from the heat-level of the flame to that of
the spark after volatilisation should produce the other lines which we
know to exist in the spectrum of the metal in the orange, blue, and
violet.
    Experiment and observation have also confirmed this result, so far
as the yellow and blue lines go ; that in the violet is difficult of
observation.*
    We next come to potassium.
    The potassium lines usually recorded as not seen in a flame, but
¦which are observed with a spark, are not very brilliant ; nor are they
strong among the Fraunhofer lines.                 Seeing therefore that a high
temperature does not greatly develop them, we may expect to find
them in the flame.         They are almost all there when they are looked
for with proper precautions, but those in all probability present in the
sun are brightened on passing the spark, showing apparently that the
flame volatilises with some difficulty the molecule which gives the line
in the red.
    The flame spectrum of magnesium perhaps presents us best with
the beautiful effects produced by the passage from the lower to the
   * The way in which the lines ordinarily seen in the flame are unaffected by the
spark strikingly reminds me of the following remarks of Angstrdm and Thalen : —
" The Fraunhofer lines can in general be divided, according to their appearance,
into two classes : the one sharply defined and tolerably deep black, the other by no
means so decidedly marked either as to form or colour.       These two different kinds
of lines   are, as regards their appearance, very happily characterised by the opinion
expressed    on a former occasion,  that the former, especially when the illumination
is feeble, look as if they were situated considerably in front of the faint ground on
which the latter seem to lie. The most prominent lines of the former class almost
all proceed from iron : and those which remain, after the iron-lines are abstracted,
belong to the other metals: calcium, manganese, chromium, &c." — (" Angstrdm

 higher heat-level, and shows the important bearing on solar physics
 of the results obtained by this new method of work.
    In the flame the two least refrangible of the components of b are
 seen associated with a line less refrangible, so as to form a triplet.
 A series of flutings and a line in the blue are also seen.
    On passing the spark, all these but the two components of b are
 abolished.   We get the wide triplet replaced by a narrow one of the
same form, the two lines of b being common to both, thus —

                     Spark Spectrum
   When the line in the blue disappears on passing the spark, two new
lines are seen.     The spark lines are in the sun, but the less refran
gible member of the wide triplet and the blue line seen in the flame
are absent.
   The following are the details of some of the experiments which
have been made on the above points : —
   Experiment No. I. — Two pieces of platinum wire were supported in
a Bunsen flame at        a distance     from one another   of about  3 millims.
They were then connected with a Holtz machine, in order that the
spark might    be passed inside the flame.
   An   image  of  the platinums was then thrown on the slit of the spec
troscope by means of a lens. The spectroscope used had two dense
flint prisms of 60°.
   A piece of charcoal soaked in solution of sodic chloride was put
into the base of the flame first, and then just below the platinum, and
the spectrum observed ; it consisted simply of the yellow line D. The
spark was passed and the spectrum again observed ; it now consisted
of D plus the lines of hydrogen and some air lines, the red and green
Na lines and the green flutings being still absent.
   Experiment No. II. — Same arrangements, except that a large induc
tion coil was substituted for the Holtz machine.             The same results
were obtained     with  the sodic chloride.
   Experiment No. III. — Metallic sodium was next tried.          It was found
that when the metal was put into the flame just below the platinums
the green line and the flutings were seen without the spark, that is,
at the ordinary temperature of the flame.          On introducing the sodium

into the lower part of the flame, the green double (X 5687'2 and 5681 -4)
and the flutings were not seen, either with or without the spark.
    Experiment No. TV. — Same arrangements as No. II, with metallic
sodium, and with a small blowpipe instead of Bunsen.
    In this experiment the flame spectrum showed, besides the yellow
line (D), the green double (X 5687'2 and 5681*4), and also the flutings
in the green, those in the red being absent. As soon as the spark
was passed, the green double (X 5687-2 and 5681'4) became brighter,
while the flutings vanished.
    In these observations the sodium was put into the flame just beloir
the platinums.     When put into the bottom of the flame, the D line was
seen arlone.
    Experiment No. V. — A glass tube £ inch in diameter was prepared,
about 6 inches in length, having two platinums sealed into it at a
distance of 4 inches from each other.       A bulb was blown at each end,
so   that the spectrum might be examined with the tube end-on.           A
piece   of sodium  was   put into  the tube, and the latter exhausted with
a Sprengel pump.       An Argand burner was placed at one end of the
tube, in order that the absorption of the vapour, as well as its radiation,
might be observed.       The metal was then very gradually heated by a
Bunsen flame.
    After the heating had gone on for about twenty minutes the absorp
tion line of D appeared ; this gradually increased in intensity.
    On passing the spark along the tube, the bright lines of sodium
appeared, the green double (X 5687"2 and 5681"4), being distinguish
able after D had been seen for a little time alone.
    The temperature was now increased and the absorption spectrum
again examined.        The flutings in the green gradually made their
appearance, D increasing in intensity, the green line being invisible.
Afterwards the flutings in the red came in.
    On passing the spark the absorption spectrum, consisting of the red
and green flutings disappeared instantaneously, and the green double
was seen very bright ; after the passage of the spark D dark was much
increased    in breadth.
    The quantity of hydrogen given off during the change prevented
the passage of the spark, and the observations had to be discontinued.
As soon as some of this had been pumped out the same observations
were repeated with the same results.
    Experiment No. VI. — An experiment was made with lithic chloride
in Bunsen flame, with the same arrangement as in Experiment No. I.
    The flame spectrum with the dispersion employed showed no Li line
except the red one (X 6705 2).        On passing the spark from the Holtz
machine, the yellow line (X 6102"0) and the blue line (X 4602"7)
appeared as bright as the red line.         The same results were obtained
on repeating the experiment with the large induction-coil.

     Experiment No. VII. — Potassic nitrate was tried by the method pre
  viously described in Experiment No. I.
     The flame spectrnm consisted as usual of the red lines (\ 7697 ami
  7663) and the bine line (X 4045), very faint.
     The effect of the spark was to bring out the yellow lines (X about
 5800), those in the green (X about 5340), and the red double (X 6946
  and 6913), out of the flutings visible in the red, the double at 7697
 and 7663 not being affected.      The experiment was repeated with the
  induction-coil, and the same observations made, with the additional
 one that the spark also slightly intensified the blue line.
     Experiment No. VIII. — On repeating the experiment with metallic
 potassium, the same phenomena were more markedly observed, the lines
 about X 5800, and other lines more refrangible, were visible as very
 faint objects in the flame ; they were much strengthened, however, by
 the passage of the spark.
    Experiment No. IX. — Some potassium was volatilised by the spark
 in front of the slit of the sun-spectroscope and . comparison of the
 positions of the lines with the Faunhofer lines made. It is believed
that X 5829'0, 5802 0, 5782-5 are all reversed in the solar spectrum.
 The less refrangible member of the red double (X 6946) was next
compared, and was undoubtedly absent from the sun.           These observa
tions, however, are rendered extremely difficult on account of the
fluted appearance of the yellow lines, and must be repeated with a
stronger sun and the electric arc. The spectroscope employed had
three prisms, one of 60° and two of 45°.
    Experiment No. X. —The flame spectrum of magnesium was exa
mined, a green triplet was observed, which was at first sight taken for
b.     Measurements     of the lines, however, showed that the less
refrangible member was less refrangible than 6, and had a wave
length 5209-8, and that the other two members were b1 and b-
respectively.    A fresh charge of magnesium was put into the flame
and the spark passed ; the original triplet was now no longer visible, the
line at 5209'8 having vanished, but b* was now seen forming with
bl and b2 a triplet of similar form on a smaller scale.
    According to Thalen, there are three blue lines of magnesium at
wave-lengths 4481"0, 4586-5, and 4703'5.      These lines were looked for
in the flame with and without the spark.        Without the spark only
one line was visible in this region ; its position was found by com
parison with the solar spectrum to be at wave-length 4570'3, and
coincident with no Fraunhofer line.         The passage of the spark
abolished this line, at the same time bringing in the two lines given by
Thalen at wave-length 4481 "0 and 4703-5, both of which are reversed
in the solar spectrum.
    No line was seen at Thalen's wave-length 4586-5, the nearest
approach to which was the line seen at the temperature of the Bunsen

    I am now preparing maps showing the phenomena       observed at various
 heat-levels.    I think it is not too much to hope that a careful study of
 such maps, showing the results already obtained, or to be obtained,
 at varying temperatures, controlled by observations        of the condi
 tions under which changes are brought about, will, if we accept the
 idea that various dissociations of the molecules present in the solid
 are brought about by different stages of heat, and then reverse the
 process, enable us to determine the mode of evolution by which the
 molecules vibrating in the atmospheres of the hottest stars associate
 into those of which the solid metal is composed.    I pat this suggestion
 forward with the greater confidence, because      I see that help can be
got from various converging lines of work.            To some of these I
may briefly allude here :
    1. We have the lines present in the solar spectrum, and absent
 from it.                                                                 •
    Example.   — The red potassium line present in the flame is absent
from the sun ; some of the other lines are present.
    2. We have the varying thicknesses of the lines of any one element
in the sun to compare with the thicknesses produced at different
temperatures in the laboratory.
    Example. — The various lines of magnesium, notably b, the most
refrangible line given by Thalen, and the other blue line.
    3. We have the remarkable         behaviour of metals vaporised in a
vacuum at the lowest temperatures.
    Example. — Sodium gives us D, potassium gives us the triplet in the
green-yellow ; calcium gives us the line in the blue ; thus separating
those lines from all the others of those metals.
    4. We have the remarkable behaviour of the same vapours under
like circumstances, the temperature alone being changed ; when this
is increased lines visible under ordinary conditions are brought in,
and are seen in different parts of the tube, so that each line in turn
(and therefore, I presume, each molecule which produces it) is
separated from those with which it is generally seen in company.
    Example. — By increasing the temperature we get the green line of
sodium without D, and some of the magnesium lines have been seen
separated from the others.
    5. We have the power of determining the lower states by means of
absorption phenomena, and then of observing the radiation of the
vapours produced by the passage of a feeble current of electricity.
    Example. — The fluted spectrum of sodium described by Eoscoc and
Schuster is instantly abolished by this means, and a brightening of the
green and a considerable thickening of the dark yellow lines is seen.

    6. May we consider the existence of these molecular states as
 forming a true basis for Dalton's law of multiple proportions ? If so,
 then the metals in different chemical         combinations will exist in
 different molecular groupings, and we shall be able by spectrum ob
 servations to determine the particular heat-level to which the mole
 cular complexity of the solid metal, induced by chemical affinity, cor
 responds.
    Examples. — None of the lines of magnesium special to the flame
 spectrum are visible in the spectrum of the chloride either when a
 Same or a spark is employed.        The facts recorded in my papers,
 printed  in the " Phil. Trans." some years ago, on the spectra of salts
and    mixtures, seem all explained in this way.
    I think  then that the method of mapping, to be complete, should
not only    show the metallic lines as produced at various temperatures
compared with the Fraunhofer ones, but that for each metal investiga
tions should be made and recorded for as many heat-levels as possible,
and for various chemical groupings such as

we   can trace a molecular evolution  in each   case.
   Further, the "basic " lines recorded by Thalen will require special
study with a view to determine whether their existence in different
spectra can be explained or not on the supposition that they represent
the vibrations of forms, which, at a early stage of the planet's history,
entered into combination with other forms, differing in proximate

Frankland and myself, it was pointed out that in the tubes we then
employed the h line of hydrogen was only seen when the coil and
Leyden jar were so arranged as to produce those effects which are
generally supposed to be due to high temperatures.         The remark, as
we distinctly stated, was only made in connexion with the tubes we
then employed, which were of widish bore ; it is necessary to mention
this because in Germany the remark has been taken to apply to all

                       F.R.S. Received December                    6,   1879.
    The following research was commenced with the hope of being able
to make an exact measuring instrument of a modified form which                           I
had devised (see page 37) of the " Capillary Electroscope," and to
employ        for the determination of the different degrees of electro
               it
motive force of different metals in forming tables of electro-chemical
 series, with different electrolytic solutions.   With this object in view,
                                                          f
I   constructed and tried a considerable number of forms of the instru
ment and employed a number of liquids, acid, neutral, and alkaline,
          ;
as conducting media between the mercurial electrodes.        In every case,
however, an obstacle to uniform and accurate measurement sooner or
later arose, viz., unequal adhesion of the mercury to different parts of
the capillary tube.
     It has been noticed by other investigators that the motion of the
slender column of mercury in Lippmann's "Capillary Electrometer"
suddenly stops whilst under the electric influence, and this has been
 supposed to increase the value of the instrument by rendering its
indications sensibly instantaneous.          According to Lippmann also
 " when the circuit was closed" by a metallic conductor, "all irregu
 larities at once disappeared" ("Phil. Mag.," April, 1874, p. 284).
This sudden stoppage of the mercury, however, whilst under the in
 fluence of the current is,       believe, in every case due to a sudden
                                       I
 increase of mechanical resistance,             usually caused by unequal adhesion

 of the mercury to different parts of the tube, but sometimes by a
 minute trace of solid substance in the tube.          With a very feeble
 current this adhesion shows itself in several ways, usually by a more
 or less sudden retardation or stoppage of the motion of the mercurial
 column, by a delay in its commencement of motion, or by its non-
 movement.      The current I have employed has, in nearly all cases,
 been a very feeble one, obtained from two wires, one of copper, and
 the other of platinum, each about 1 millim. diameter, immersed about
 2 or 3 millims. deep in common drinking water. With a very sensitive
 instrument, and a capillary tube as free from obstruction as could be
 obtained, this power has been sufficient to move the meniscus 10 or
 20 millims.
    A common cause of obstruction consists of impurities (especially
oxide) in the mercury ; the metal therefore should be as pure as
 possible.   I have obtained it sufficiently pure by distilling the ordinary
metal twice, then shaking it violently with dilute nitric acid, washing
it with distilled water, shaking it again strongly with a dilute solution
of potassic cyanide (which very effectually removes oxide), washing it
again, and filtering it through a minute hole in the point of a paper
funnel.    The mercury should be kept in a closed bottle, and be fre
quently filtered to remove dust from its surface whilst being used,
because the most minute speck of solid matter, even that which is in
visible to the unassisted eye, is sufficient to stop the capillary tube.
The solution also should be kept perfectly clear by means of filtration.
Another cause of stoppage is the employment of glass tubing into
which dust has been allowed to enter ; this may be obviated by
employing newly-made tubing, sealed at its ends by wax ; with such
tubing I have obtained no manifest advantage by washing it with
acids, alkalies, ether, &c, nor by allowing a stream of clean mercury
to run through it. After having taken all these precautions, there
remains a very common cause of stoppage of the motion of the
mercury, viz., portions of air or gas adhering to the tube ; these con
sist either of minute films of air, or if the current is too strong, also
bubbles of gas liberated from the electrolyte.
    One of the most effectual modes of removing the air or gas is to
repeatedly cause by mechanical means (such as compression of the
pressure-chamber, or by change of position of the instrument from
horizontal to vertical and ince versa) the mercury and conducting
solution to move freely to and fro through the whole of the fine part
of the tube whilst the circuit is closed, and expelling occasionally a
few drops of mercury from the end of the tube ; employing also an
electric current in a suitable direction to assist the motion.      If there
remain any adhering portions which are not removable by these
means, diminished pressure, combined with an electric current from
the point of the capillary towards its larger part, and the simultaneous

application of a hot plate of metal to the locality of the adhesion,
rarely fails to remove them. Notwithstanding, however, all these
precautions, the meniscus often subsequently sticks at a particular
place without any apparent cause, and without the presence of any
body visible by the aid of a microscope magnifying from 30 to 50
diameters.       Free use of    the instrument   reduces many of these ad
hesions   ; it also gives rise to fresh ones.    Immovable adhesions of the
mercury frequently occur, or are subsequently produced by use of the
instrument which interfere with the accurate measurement of so
feeble an electric power as that mentioned above, and appear to be
due to irregularities of smoothness in the glass it self ; the best precaution
to take in such cases consists in selecting as the sphere of the move
ment of the meniscus a portion of the capillary tube known to be free
from such a source of error ; but even such a space does not perma
nently remain free.
    By employing a suitable tube, dilute sulphuric acid as the liquid,
 and taking all the above precautions, I have constantly found that the
mercurial column, instead of moving from point to point with a jerk
and stopping suddenly, moved with a gradually diminishing speed
 until it stopped. The momentary movement and sudden stoppage
occurs more readily with a short capillary tube and currents of greater
 power than that above mentioned, but with a long tube, as free as ob
 tainable from irregular adhesion, a movement of from 10 to 20millims.
 not unfrequently occurs, requiring in some cases as much as 80 millims.
 variation of height of mercury pressure to bring the meniscus back to
 its original point.     If the tube happens to be one of parallel bore, and
 especially   if  its lower part enlarges towards its lower extremity, such
 a current as the one mentioned will cause the meniscus to descend as
 much even as 5 or 6 centims., and the mercury to run out at the end
 of the tube. The influence of gravity no donbt operates in all these
 cases, but with the same electric power, and whilst using a tube the
 diameter of which does not diminish too rapidly towards its point,
 the column usually moves more readily towards the end of the
 capillary than the reverse, whether the instrument be in a vertical or
 horizontal position.      The mercury in all cases tends also to pass from
 the form of a cylinder to that of a sphere, and if it once gets beyond
 the end of the tube, it forms a globule which draws the narrower part
 rapidly into itself by its great cohesion.       Similarly if the tube is too
 taper the mercury tends to draw itself upwards towards the wider
 cavity.
    A good capillary tube is essential ; the only way       I know of obtain
 ing it is to make a number        of tubes and try them   until a suitable one
 is found.      Glass tubing, of an external diameter of about 6 to 8
 millims., and having a bore of about one-third or one-fourth of a milli
 metre, is of a very convenient size for making the capillary, because

 it may be drawn out to a sufficient degree of fineness at one [heating ;
 that having a circular bore it is less likely to become clogged by use
 than that which is oval ; and it is an advantage to employ that which
 has white enamel at the back.         Success in making the capillary
 depends largely upon careful manipulation and the employment of a
 name of suitable size ; I have used a Bunsen flame about an inch in
 height and half an inch in diameter, for drawing long capillaries by a
 single heating, or a very minute flame of a small spirit-lamp for draw
 ing out a short one by a second heating.        Within certain limits, 1
 have found that the finer the. capillary tube the greater is the move
 ment in it of the meniscus by a given electromotive force, and the
greater the pressure required to balance that force ; but if the bore of
the tube be extremely fine, say '01 millim., the instrument becomes
less sensitive, probably owing to increased adhesion or to increased
conduction-resistance   of the minute column of solution. A convenient
bore is about "03 to '04 millim., and an external diameter of '3 to '4
millim.     Under uniform pressure, the meniscus moves not only
through a much greater length, but also at a much faster rate, in the
finer portion of a tube of moderate diameter, than it does in the
coarser part, and this occurs even in tubes the internal diameter of
which diminishes to their very extremity.      Tubes of parallel bore are
not usually suitable for the instrument (especially if the latter is used
in a vertical position), because, instead of presenting a resistance
gradually increasing downwards, as they should do, they offer the
reverse.   The best form of capillary is one which becomes narrower
at a sufficiently increasingdegree towards its free end. I have em
ployed capillaries varying in length from 5 to 15 centims. with eqnal
advantage.
  Considerable pressure is often requisite for filling the capillary tube,
and for overcoming obstructions ; to produce        it,
                                                     a compressible pres
sure-chamber   ismuch more convenient than a tall column of mercury.
An excellent chamber may be formed of a piece of vulcanized india-
rubber tubing, about or centims. long, millims. bore, and 15 millims.

external diameter, such as       employed as
                                is            " engine-packing." It     is
more convenient to have the platinum wire (for connexion with the
column of mercury) inserted through the side of this tube than through
that of the glass one, because the former does not so readily cause the
wire to be broken. To insert the wire, one end of the tube   isstretched
open by means of    a small pair of pliers a needle, wet with glycerine,
                                            ;
is then forced very obliquely through the india-rubber close to the end
of the tube, and after its removal a fine wire may be readily forced
through the minute stretched hole and the pliers then withdrawn.
After the capillary tube has been fixed in this chamber (which must
be previously made scrupulously clean), the end of the chamber
adjacent to the terminal and capillary must be securely bound round

with wire     to prevent leakage.       As it often requires considerable
pressure  to force  the mercury through the tube, especially when there
exists both a mechanical obstacle and a stoppage of the electric
current, a strong pressure screw, with its clamp capable of grasping at
least an inch in length of the chamber, is absolutely necessaiy.
   I have tried several plans of mechanically compensating the electro-
capillary effect, the most convenient of which is to surmount the
pressure- chamber by a vertical glass tube about 30 or 40 centims.
high, and 1 millim. bore, with its lower end opening into the chamber,
and its upper end also open, but capable of being closed by means of
a glass cock, having an open cup at its upper extremity.                This
arrangement admits of great pressure being applied to the chamber,
by means of the screw and clamp, and also of crudely measuring in
millimetres height of mercury the compensating pressure necessary to
depress the mercury to the neutral point whilst the current is passing.
This upper tube also, like the capillary one, has the disadvantage of
offering unequal resistance to the passage of the mercury by unequal
adhesion, so that a small movement of the screw of the pressure-
chamber is not often at once attended by a simultaneous movement of
the mercury at the top and bottom of the column.
   The voltaic current was very conveniently manipulated         by the aid
of a small moveable apparatus, so constructed that by turning its
handle the first quarter of a revolution, the two wires of the electro
scope were connected metallically together, and the current insulated
from them ; by turning it a second quarter, the current was sent in
one direction through the electroscope ; by turning it a third, the
wires of the electroscope were disconnected and perfectly insulated
(the base of the instrument being of ebonite) ; and by turning it the
fourth quarter, the current was sent through the electroscope in a
reverse direction.     This apparatus may be easily made by prolonging
the axis of a common electric        reverser, fixing two projecting metal
studs on opposite sides of the prolonged part (but not opposite to etich
other), and attaching two vertical springs to two binding-screws fixed
on the base, so that when the studs pressed against the upper ends of
these springs, the circuit was closed between the ends of the wires
attached to the two electrodes.

to a moveable wooden stand.         The dotted lines show the directions of

of the tube to form a white background, and the instrument requires
to be used in a good light.

mercury moves in an opposite direction to the electric current, I am
now engaged in examining that fact, and in completing an investi
 gation of the causes and conditions of the movements.

 capillary electrometer, the quantitative differences of electromotive
 force between each two consecutive metals, and thus to construct a
 series of tables of electromotive forces of the particular solids and liquids
 employed. But as after making many attempts I was unable to construct
 such a form of that electrometer as might be relied upon as an accu
 rate measuring instrument, I abandoned the object of measuring the
electromotive differences, and proceeded no farther than simply deter
 mining the order of such differences in each particular solution.
Although I have not been able to carry out the examination as far as
 I intended, I venture to submit the results to the Royal Society, in
the hope that if published they may be of use to other investigators,
as similar tables upon a less extensive scale have already proved.
    As the true electrical relations of metals in liquids depends largely
upon the purity of the substances, I beg to state that the metals and
salts employed were, in nearly all cases, the purest obtainable.           The
tellurium, mercury, and antimony were very highly purified by me ;
the silicon was prepared by fusing some fine crystals, which I had
previously digested with pure hydrofluoric acid, hydrochloric acid,
and nitric acid separately.         The gold, silver, platinum, palladium,
iridium, rhodium, cobalt, tin, and cadmium, were obtained from
Messrs. Matthey and Co., and were the purest they prepare.                 The
nickel was refined by Sir J. Mason, and was of a high degree of
purity ; it had been rolled into a thin strip. The carbon was a rod of
a JablochkofFs       candle.     The indium was a portion of one of the
ingots exhibited at the Paris Exhibition by its discoverers.               The
gallium was presented to me by M. Lecoq de Boisbaudran, and
                "                                           The thallium was
said to be        nearly pure except traces of zinc."
supplied     to  me  by  Messrs.   Hopkin   and  Williams.    The magnesium
was probably very pure, and was obtained from the Magnesium Metal
                                                                      "
Company, from whom I also obtained the bismuth, said to be              highly
purified." The aluminium, copper,          load, iron, and zinc wires  were  of
the ordinary qualities.
    The salts employed were of considerable purity, and in every case
were dissolved in distilled water.        To remove any trace of free iodine
or acid from the solutions of potassic iodide, or any trace of soluble
sulphide contained in those of cyanide of potassium, they were pre
viously well stirred with a rod of aluminium or magnesium.
    Every investigator who has made experiments of the present kind
is aware that temporary reversals of the current frequently occur in
such cases.       When the reversals took place immediately upon immer
sion, the first current was not regarded, because it was probably due
to a momentary change of surface tension or of temperature, caused
 by the physical contact of the solid and liquid prior to chemical action.
    A sufficient number of different strengths of solution of each salt
 were employed to supply a large number of determinations,             so as to

 40              Dr. G. Gore.     Chemico-Electric Relations    of [Doc.    18,
 enable curves to be drawn showing the variation         of relative electric
 positions of different metals with the variations       of strength of the
 liquid.     Such curves      were drawn,   compared with each other, and
 conclusions inferred respecting similar metals or groups of metals.
     In the following tables the numbers at the top of each column
 represent the numbers of grains of the particular salt dissolved in the
 quantity of water stated. The amount of water employed in the solu
 tions of the first six tables was 50 cub. centims., and in Tables        VII
 and     VIII  it was 800 grains.
     The specimen of gallium not having been obtained in sufficient time
 for the whole of the experiments, it was not employed in Tables I and
 VII and part of Table III. Being also easily fusible it could not be
 used in hot solutions.

 5 and 120   ;   Co and Sb in 320 and 400 ; Co and Tl in 360 and 400 ;
 Co and   Hg    in 320, 360, and 500 ; Pt and Si in 10 ; and C and Rh in
 the 5 grs. solution.
               Table No.  IX. — In Fused  Cyanide of Potassium.
    The following was the order obtained by immersing the various
 elementary substances in cyanide of potassium in a fused state ; the
 first substance being the most positive : magnesium, zinc, aluminium
 and platinum, nickel, iron, silver, iridium, gold, rhodium, carbon,
 palladium, cobalt, antimony.
    From the notes appended to the foregoing tables, it may be ob
 served — 1st, that by far the greatest number of momentary reversals
 of current took place in the cyanide solutions, especially in the cold
 ones ; 2nd, that the proportions      of such reversals to the number of
 solutions employed were not greatly different in the chloride, bromide,
and iodide of potassium ; and 3rd, the reversals were not confined to
 the more electro-positive metals.      The most numerous reversals in the
 cold solutions of potassic cyanide took place with nickel (2G), alumi
nium (21), silver (18), platinum (16), magnesium (15), and zinc (14) :
and in the hot solutions, with aluminium (16), magnesium (14), and
zinc (11) ; whilst in the cold iodide solutions the most frequent one~
were nickel (7), iron (6), silicon (4), and cobalt (4) ; and in the hot
liquids, nickel (10), silicon (8), iron (7), and cobalt (8) ; most of these
occurred in the strong solutions.        With the cold bromide mixtures
reversals occurred with aluminium (6), iron (5), gold (5), and palla
dium (4) ; with the same liquids hot, indium (6), aluminium (5).
and iron (4).       And with the chloride solutions cold, iron (3) ; and
hot, aluminium (3), and cadmium (3).          The behaviour of particular
pairs of metals in different liquids with regard to reversals may be
ascertained by inspection of the notes.
    Certain other general effects were also observed in the results. 1st.
 Gas carbon was electro-negative to all other bodies in all the solutions
employed, whether cold or hot ; concentrated or dilute. 2nd. Rho
dium was electro-negative to all substances except carbon, in all solu
tions of either iodide or cyanide of potassium, of all degrees of con
centration, and at each temperature. 3rd. Either rhodium or platinum
was negative to all bodies except carbon in all the solutions of chloride
or bromide of potassium, whether cold or hot.         4th. Magnesium was
positive to all the other substances in all the solutions of potassic
chloride, bromide, or iodide, at each temperature.        5th. Either mag
nesium, aluminium, or zinc, was positive to all other metals in solu
tions of potassic cyanide, whether cold or hot.         Thallium appeared
to be the most quickly corroded of any metal in all the solutions, and
was most manifestly affected in those of potassic iodide; lead was also
acted upon, but to a less extent, in that class of liquids.

1879.]       Spontaneous   Segmentation  of a Liquid Annulus.           4!)
    By drawing lines through all the positions of each particular metal
in the tables of solutions of different strengths of either of the salts
employed, it was found that the position of pairs of metals of like
properties, such as magnesium and zinc, nickel and cobalt, rhodium
and iridium or platinum, lead and tin, &c, often varied together, and
described similar curves or lines of variation.
    A much greater number of variations of relative electric position of
the metals occurred in the cold and hot solutions of potassic cyanide
than in either those of the chloride, bromide, or iodide, whether cold
or hot, and the amounts of such variations were also much greater in
the cyanide solutions.
    Agitation of the immersed metals is well known to influence the
current.     Shaking one of the metals reversed occasionally the direc
tion of the current ; palladium was the metal which most frequently
manifested this effect.     The agitation of that metal rendered it either
more negative or less positive in a considerable degree, especially in
solutions of potassic chloride and cyanide.      In those of the bromide,
antimony was the metal the current from which was most affected by
shaking.      The effect of shaking was less in the iodide solutions than
in those of the bromide.
VIII.     " On the Spontaneous Segmentation of a Liquid Annu
       lus." By A. M. Worthington, M.A. Communicated by
        Balfour Stewart, F.R.S., Professor of Natural Philosophy
       in Owens College, Manchester.            Received December 6,
        1879.
    In  seeking an explanation of the appearance of a definite number of
lobes in the liquid annulus which is formed at a certain stage of the
splash of a drop that has fallen vertically on to a horizontal plate, I
was led to make some experiments on the spontaneous segmentation
of such an annulus lying on a plate with a view to ascertaining
whether the relation that exists between the dimensions of the annulus
and the number of drops into which it will spontaneously split, is the
 same as for a straight cylinder of liquid under similar conditions.
 Finding that the relation was the same, it then occurred to me that
by liberating an annulus in air without contact with any solid, a
 direct experimental proof might be obtained of the law of segmentation
 of a free cylinder.
     It has been shown mathematically in various ways, and experi
 mentally by M. Plateau, that the equilibrium of a free cylinder of any
 liqnid, under the influence of surface tension only, becomes unstable
 as soon as the length exceeds jt times the diameter ; and it has been
 regarded as a necessary consequence of this that such a cylinder, if

once realised, -will spontaneously split into as many eqnal and equi
distant spheres as «- times the diameter is contained in the length.
     Thus,   if   n be the number of drops,
                  I the length,
                          or thickness of the cylinder, the law of
         and d the diameter
segmentation is expressed by the formula
  M. Plateau has endeavoured to supply an experimental proof of
this by liberating a cylinder of mercury, extended between two
amalgamated wires, on a glass plate, but he found that the frictional
contact with the plane surface along the length of the cylinder
diminished the number of drops, probably because the limits of
stability are extended by friction : thus, when the cylinder of mer
cury rested on a glass plate, the limit of stability appeared to be
extended to 61 times the diameter, this being the average distance
apart at which the drops were formed.       So that the law became
»»=—__ _, and it was only by observing the effect of simultaneous
contact with a vertical as well as a horizontal plate that a rongh
estimate could be made of the influence of friction on the number of
drops.
   By the method of liberation in air that is described in the latter
half of this paper all friction is avoided, and the results show a close
accordance with theory.
   I will first describe experiments with reference to an annulus lying
on a plate.    It may be well at the outset to remark that an annnlus is
not, like a cylinder, a figure of equilibrium for a liquid, there being
excess of pressure on the outside; this excess, however, will diminish
as the radius of the annulus increases, — as, in fact, it approximates to
a cylinder.    The excess, moreover, will not be a large fraction of the
                              as in the case we have to deal with, the
                               is if,

and    -(R-r).

    It may, therefore, well happen, as we shall see in the sequel that it
does, that the annulus will split spontaneously hefore any appreciable
alteration of its form can be caused by this inequality of pressures ; and
this is the more to be expected if the annulus be lying on a horizontal
plate, friction with which impedes the motion of the liquid as a mass.
    The method that I have adopted to discover the law of splitting has
been to liberate suddenly an annulus of mercury on a horizontal
surface of glass or iron.
    The apparatus consisted of a circular plate of iron 15 millims. thick
and 60 millims. in diameter, the lower surface of which was truly
plane, and in it were cut various annular grooves, whose cross section
was an exact semicircle.
    This plate is placed face downwards on a plane horizontal surface of
iron or glass, and mercury is poured into one of the grooves through
one of two small vertical holes bored through the plate, the second
hole allowing the imprisoned            air to escape.      After removing any
excess of mercury that may remain in the holes, the plate is suddenly
lifted by a central handle, and a circle of regularly disposed drops is
found lying on the lower plate.
    The following is a table of results obtained in this way, which are
recorded without any omissions. The size of the grooves was obtained
by direct measurement and by weighing the mercury they contained.
    A fourth groove of '7 millim. thickness was found to be too small
to use, being very difficult to fill with mercury.

    When  a guiding cylinder of cardboard, in which the iron plate could
be moved like a piston, was used in order to ensure the plate being
lifted vertically, the friction against the cylinder prevented the plate
being lifted so quickly, and this at once influenced the number of
drops, as will be seen in the following table : —

   Before discussing these results, I may remark that                   the number of
drops was practically the same, whether on iron or                       glass,   unless,
indeed, the iron was very well rubbed with a dry clean                   cloth between
each experiment.           When this was done the number                of drops was
slightly increased.        On one occasion 21 were obtained              from the first
groove.
   In many instances subordinate secondary drops, due to the splitting
of the long necks joining the drops before their complete separation,
were formed with great regularity ; but sometimes these secondary
drops were so large as to bo easily mistaken for primary drops.                         In
the case of the third groove, it required practice to lift the plate
quickly enough to secure the maximum number of drops.

while the form in which the liquid that has filled a groove is left
on the lower plate may be called a semi-cylindrical annulus.
    It seems reasonable to suppose that the first thing that will happen
to the liquid when liberated will be that it will spring from a semi-
cylindrical into a more or less cylindrical annulus, for there is a sharp
curvature of the surface at the edges bounding the flat and curved
portions, which will at once exert a pressure on the liquid, while the
force which causes it to split into drops being due to an unstable
equilibrium* must begin with a value equal to zero, and will therefore
be behindhand in its action.
    Since the cylindrical annulus must have the same volume as the
semi-cylindrical, its diameter must          be       X diameter     of the semi-
                                                -^7=

    Hence,   if we apply Plateau's formula for the cylinder, we have —
                                           I    —

    The only notable deviation from the number actually observed, is
 in the case of the third groove, but even here 10-14 is within the
limits of observation, and a very possible value, since the plate, as has
 been explained, could not be lifted up quickly enough to avoid all
 friction.
    The observations, therefore, prove that at least for an annulus of
 mercury lying on a glass plate, the law of splitting is practically the
 same as that of a straight cylinder of the same thickness, being ex
 pressed by the formula w=        — — ¦.

     In order to effect the liberation of a free annulus in air, the ap
  paratus shown in fig. 1 was used.
     A is a circular disk of hard wood, in which two annular grooves
  were cut, whose cross section was of the form shown in fig. 2, the
  lower part being circular. The width of the inner groove at the

 top was   'i  centim.,  and   of the outer     -625  centim. ;  the principal
 diameters being 5"35 centims. and 7-475 centims. respectively.          B is a
sort of catapult to project the disk vertically downwards, and consists
of a  short brass tube 3 centims. long, clamped vertically, in which an
inner tube c slides loosely,    bat is kept thrust out as far as the slots in
the   outer tube permit, by the action of a strong spiral spring inside.
By looping a     string, s, over a small central hook in the disk, the latter
can    be  drawn up tight against the end of the outer tube, and
held firmly in a horizontal position, and then, after a known weight
of mercury has been poured into either groove, the end of the
string is let go, and the disk is shot downwards, leaving the mer
cury annulus in the air.         A tray of fine wet sand is placed below
the annulus to catch and preserve the impressions              of the circle of
drops formed, while the disk is steered out of the way by striking
with its two projecting arms against the slanting brass rods, as shown
in the figure.
   The inclination of these rods should be such as to get the disk out
of the way as soon as possible, and will depend on the strength of
the spring used ; the stronger the better.
   The object of slanting the sides of the grooves is to prevent the
annulus being carried downwards         by any friction with the disk.

 the best consistence is easily found by practice, and depends a little
 on the  depth of fall.     If too soft, the impressions     of separate drops

mingle,   if too hard, drops are liable to rebound from their shallow
impressions, and to mingle with the neighbouring drops.
   If the tray of sand be placed at any considerable distance below the
starting point of the annulus, it will be found that the impression
made is a single small irregular pit with three or four lobe-like projec
tions,  showing that the annulus has contracted as it fell into a
single not perfectly symmetrical mass.
   This is the natural consequence of the excess of pressure on the out
side circumference,   which is no longer hindered by any friction, as in
the preceding experiments ; it is interesting to observe, that as the
depth of fall is diminished, the diameter of the whole impression
increases, while the number of separate drop-impressions           likewise
increases, showing that the contraction continues, by reason of impetus,
after complete segmentation has taken place, and causes the re-fusion of
drops that     have at one time    been   separate ; this re- fusion being
generally so conducted that the symmetrical arrangement of the drops
is tolerably well preserved.
   This will be seen from an inspection of the following tables of
observations, which are recorded without omissions.        A few remarks
on the tables are necessary.    It  often happened that the annulus had
not remained circular, but had assumed a more or less elliptical form,
as shown by the impressions ; the tables contain the measures of the
greatest and least diameters in such cases, as well as their mean.
These measurements were made with a pair of compasses, and the
diameters mentioned joined what were judged to be the middle points
of the drop marks on either side of the centre ; the measures may be
taken as correct to 1 millim., but not beyond.
   In most cases the impressions were not equally distinct round the
whole of the circumference, but were most distinct and well divided
about one end of a diameter, and least so about the other end of the
same.    When the mark was elliptical this diameter was generally the
shortest.
   Owing to the fact that each drop did not always remain in the hole
it had made in the sand, and that the partitions between neighbouring
drop-impressions were often cut through by the neck of liquid that
remains till segmentation is complete, it could not be positively
asserted in all cases (though it could in some) that the annulus had
split into such and such number of drops when it reached the sand at
any given depth, but rather that it consisted of a certain countable
number of distinct masses of mercury, some of which appeared to
consist of two, or in some cases, of three drops, still united by necks
of liquid, while the remaining majority consisted of a countable
number of separate apparently equal and regularly disposed drops.
Then there was in many cases a slight uncertainty as to the exact
number, to the extent of one drop more or less, and this could only be

  eliminated by many observations.        As the observations were made
  before the theoretical number had been calculated, the judgment in
  estimating doubtful impressions could not have been biassed more than
  by the inclination to recognise a constantly recurring number of
  drops.
    The re-fusion  of the drops, owing to contraction, makes it neces
 sary to  take the impression before the annnlus has fallen far, if we
 wish to ascertain the maximum number of drops into which it has
 originally divided. In the case of the smaller annulus, 9 centims.,
 and in that of the larger, 12 centims., was the least depth of fall that
 the apparatus permitted, i.e., that was consistent with getting the
 disk out of the way. The weight of mercury in the first annulus was
 26-525 grams, and in the second, 53'05 grams. Assuming that the an
nulus at once becomes cylindrical on its reloase, the thickness           (d)
would be '3844 centim., and "4599 centim. in each case respectively,

    It will be observed      that,   in the case of the smaller annulus, the
average experimental         value    of n is nearly a whole drop below the
theoretical value.      This points to the possibility of contraction before
the   segmentations were        determined.        Such contraction       would cause
a  diminution in the value of the ratio               -, both by diminishing          the
                                                      d
numerator and increasing the denominator of the fraction, and would
produce a    corresponding diminution in the number of drops.
    Since the force of contraction is inversely proportional to the princi
pal  radius of the annulus, its effect will be more rapid in the smaller
annulus, both on this account and because of the smaller mass of
liquid to be set in motion.*
    That the annulus sometimes becomes elliptical, is probably due to an
uneven distribution of the liquid at starting.              When the disk was not
quite   horizontal  the thickest    and  thinnest    portions of the annulus would
be opposite to each other, and the segmentation of the latter will be
complete before that of the former.               This accords with the previous
observation that the well and ill-divided parts are always at opposite
ends of the same diameter.
    To account for the fact that this diameter is the shortest,                it would
   * It should be remembered       that the contractive force ceases to act on drops
which hare assumed the spherical form.          Hence the total amount of contraction
that is found to hare taken place at any time after complete segmentation will depend
on the Telocity acquired while the force acted, and therefore upon the time required
for the process of segmentation.     This time will evidently be less in the case of a
thinner annulus.

 60       Spontaneous    Segmentation of a Liquid Annulus.    [Dec. 18,
be necessary to evaluate the average centripetal velocities during
the fall of the portions of the annulus at the positions of maximum,
mean, and minimum thickness, for a given distribution of the liquid,
which can only be done when the connexion between time of segmen
tation and thickness is known.
    The very fact of segmentation taking place sooner in one portion of
the annulus than another is itself a source of asymmetry, as was
shown by the experiment of liberating a portion of an annulus, which
was found to contract in length and straighten itself with great
rapidity.
   Thus after a fall of 12 centime., a portion of annulus No. 1, repre
sented in fig. 3, gave on the sand the impression represented in fig. 4.
   The sharp curvatnre of the free ends is of course the cause of the
shortening.    Its influence was often noticed in the case of elliptical
marks, inasmuch as the extremities of the row of ill-divided impres
sions were separated from the extremities of the well-divided portion
by spaces rather greater than the average distance between neigh
bouring drops elsewhere.
   It is evident that the method of liberation adopted in these experi
ments is not applicable to a straight cylinder, which will immediately
begin to contract and shorten under the influence of the pressure of
the curved ends, unless it be prevented from doing so by being kept
stretched between metallic terminals to which it adheres ; such termi
nals would, unless of relatively great mass, require to be fixed to a
frame which of course must       fall with the cylinder.  The impurity
introduced by using an amalgamated metal would be a Bource of error,
as M. Plateau has pointed out in his own experiments, which how
ever, might be avoided by adopting the plan mentioned by Professor
Guthrie, " I'roc. Roy. Soc," vol. xiii, p. 458, of using platinum, to
which, when once rubbed with an amalgam of sodium, mercury will
udhere closely and without amalgamation.
   The experiment would, in this manner, be probably quite feasible.
   I have endeavoured by smoking the wooden disk, to render it nn-
wetable by water, and so to liberate an annulus of that liquid, but so
far without success ; the water always finds its way here and there

    The few observations     I have  to offer on this mnch-discussed    subject
are partly confirmatory of, partly supplementary to, those of Kleinen-
berg,* they present a certain agreement with those of F. E. Schu]ze,t
while they are, in great measure, distinctly contradictory of the later
resparches of Korotneff.

    1. The Ectoderm and the Muscular Layer. — The layer of longitudinal
fibres between the ectoderm and the endoderm was discovered by
Kolliker, who believed that each fibre was in direct connexion with an
endoderm cell.       Kleinenberg, in teased specimens, saw that the ecto
derm cells tapered towards their inner ends, and that each was con
tinued into a simple or branched process, of precisely the same
character as the fibres seen in sections : from this observation the
important conclusion was arrived at, that the fibres were in direct
continuity with the ectoderm cells, thus forming a sort of nascent
mesoderm.
    Schulze figures the elements of the middle layer as fusiform fibres,
with somewhat jagged edges.             Korotneff, following Kleinenberg's
directions as to methods of preparation, came to the conclusion that
the ectoderm cells were expanded (elargie) at their inner ends, and
that each carried a fusiform refringent fibre, attached by its middle to
the enlarged base of the cell, and projecting beyond it in either direc
tion, so that the cell appeared as a lateral appendage (annexe) of the
fibre, rather than the fibre as a prolongation of the cell.
    How M. Korotneff can have come to this conclusion as to the shape
of the ectoderm cells, it is rather difficult to imagine ; by any ordinary
method of preparation it is perfectly easy to satisfy oneself that the
ectoderm cells of the body are, as a rule, markedly distinguished from
those of the endoderm by the tapering of their inner ends ; and, in
good specimens, that these ends are continued into longer or shorter
filaments.
    The question of the exact relations of the fibres is by no means
so easy to decide.        Anyone working at Hydra for        a week    or two,

62                               Mr. T.     J.  Parker.                        [Dec. 18,
and    using various methods of preparation, might readily frame a
dozen different theories on this point, all equally supported by ap
pearances.        But the matter seems to me to be entirely set at rest by
thin longitudinal sections of specimens preserved in ammonic bi
chromate, which reagent usually has the effect of causing a certain
amount of separation between the layers.                    In such sections (fig. 1)
the ectoderm cells (ec.) are distinctly seen to taper off towards
their inner ends ; the fibres (m.p.) to pass from them, at a sharp angle,
towards       the endoderm,     or,  more correctly, towards the supporting
lamella   ;   and,   in some   cases   (e.g., the fibre to which the line from
m.p.   points), the fibres can       be    distinctly traced into the attenuated
extremities of the cells.
   As to the true nature and functions of these structures, Dr.                   Kleiu-
enberg calls the ectoderm cell with its filamentous process, a neuro-
muscle cell ; M. Korotneff prefers to name it an epithelio-muscle cell ;
                                                          " are
Prosessor Huxley* considers that the fibres                      solely internuncial in
function, and therefore the primary form of nerves." This last view is
rendered, to say the least, decidedly improbable, by the great number
and the regular disposition of the fibres.                It seems, a priori, unlikely
that an animal devoid of all muscular tissue should have a layer of
close-set longitudinal nerve-fibres throughout its whole body, while
such an arrangement is perfectly intelligible in a set of specially
contractile filaments, developed as a means of rapid retraction of the
body.
   The term         " nenro-muscular " implies,            as  Kleinenberg      explains,
that the process only is contractile ; the function of the cell itself being
merely to receive and transmit impressions.                  But, as Professor Huxley
points out, it is absolutely necessary to assume contractility in the
 cell proper, to account for the lengthening of the body.                     The fibres
 merely have a special degree of contractility assigned to them, in
 correspondence with the obvious advantage accruing to the animal
from the power of instantaneous shortening, the general contractility
of the cells serving for extension ; this movement being, as observa
tion of     a  living Hydra shows, a comparatively slow one. The fibres
                                                     "            "
must also be of use in the characteristic               looping movements of the
animal.
   The simplest and most reasonable way of looking at these structures
is that adopted by Dr. Michael Foster, and illustrated in the diagram
                                                               " Text-book of

ology." These          show  clearly enough      that  the   ectoderm    cell of Hydra,
with its muscular process, is the equivalent of what, in the higher
animals, becomes sensory cell, sensory nerve, nerve cell, motor nerve,
and muscle cell.          So that a fairly logical term might be made by

  combining     Kleinenberg's and Korotneff's, and speaking of epithelio-
 nenro-mnacle       cell ; bnt, fortunately, it is unnecessary to employ any
 snch   cumbersome term, and quite sufficient             to speak of ectoderm cell
 with contractile     process.
    The interstitial tissue, discovered          by Kleinenberg, is quite readily
 made    out  in all parts of the body except the proximal end, where
 oematocysts      are also absent.       It  is not mentioned by Korotneff, and,
 indeed,   its existence would be impossible           if the large ectoderm cells
 had   the shape described by him.
    I have found     no interstitial cells in the tentacles (fig. 5) ; this would
seem    to show    that the ordinary ectoderm cells may also be the mother
cells of the nematocysts.           The ectoderm cells of the tentacles also
differ from those of the body from the fact that their nuclei are non-
nncleolate, resembling indeed the nncleoli of the body cells, rather
than their nuclei (fig. 5).
   2.    The Supporting Lamella.          This structure is clearly distinguished
by Schulze and by Korotneff, the latter of whom, however, figures it*
as almost equal        in thickness to the diameter of an ectoderm cell !
Kleinenberg       states   that the muscular processes are imbedded in a
structureless cementing substance, and that this, continued beyond the
muscular layer on the endoderm side, forms a layer— the " Stiitz-
           "
lamelle      of Keichert — which can sometimes be obtained as a separate
structure.
   This description by no means expresses the distinctness of the sup
porting lamella.         In specimens preserved in osmic acid, or ammonium
bichromate,       without subsequent treatment with alcohol, it is easy,
by   teasing with fine needles, to detach shreds of considerable extent,
more or less free from attached muscular fibrils and from cells of the
interstitial tissue (fig. 2).
    3. The Endoderm. — The           ciliation   of the endoderm is a question
about which there has been a good deal of discussion.                       Schulze
figures a single flagellum to each cell, as seen in optical section of the
tentacle.       Kleinenberg was unable to demonstrate the existence of
flagella in the uninjured animal, or in preserved specimens, but in trans
verse sections of the living animal, he observed one or two cilia, in
connexion with more or fewer of the cells, and noticed that they were
not fixed structures, but were occasionally retracted, and then protruded
 again, the cells at the same time sending out pseudopodial             processes.
    It is qnite easy to confirm this observation                ; the slow lashing
 movement        of the flagelliform cilia, their continual disappearance
 and reappearance in fresh places can be made out without difficulty.
 But the best, notion of the characters and relation of the cilia is
 obtained by teasing out, or still better, by cutting thin sections of
                                 • Loc.  dt, PI. 15, fig. 8.

64                             Mr. T. J.  Parker.                   [Dec. 18,
osmic acid specimens.         Such preparations quite lead one to think
that the endoderm is ciliated throughout ; in the sections particularly,
(fig. 3), cell after cell is seen bearing one, two, or three cilia.     These
latter are of great length, in fact nearly or quite as long as the cells to
which they are attached ; in some cases indeed, they are longer, as,
for instance in the cell to the right in fig. 6. I have never seen any
               "
thing like a collar" at the base of any of the cilia.
    The amoeboid character of the endoderm cells, as seen in sections
or teased fragments of the living animal, is a well-known fact ; but
the extent and activity of the amoeboid movements during life has
not been sufficiently insisted on. In sections of picric acid or
amnionic   bichromate    specimens, large rounded pseudopodia are seen
to be given off from the cells into the digestive cavity, sometimes to
such an extent as completely to obliterate the latter.        The length of
the cells may, therefore, vary almost indefinitely ; they may be but little
longer than the ectoderm cells (fig. 3), or may be two or three times
as long (fig. 1).   This variation in the size of the endoderm cells, and
the consequent variation in the diameter of the digestive cavity, is
very marked in my series of sections, nearly all of which are taken from
large specimens,* killed in a state of half-extension.      When the endo
derm cells are fully extended, it is almost impossible to obtain them
complete by teasing.      They nearly always break across, and can only
be obtained in a fragmentary condition.
   A very noticeable point about the endoderm cells is the presence
in their protoplasm, especially towards the far end, of dark-coloured
irregular granules, of various sizes.      It has been suggested that these
are products of excretion; Kleinenberg makes the important observa
tion that their number varies with the state of nutrition of the animal.
    I am convinced that these bodies are food particles, taken into the
protoplasm of the cells, from the partially disintegrated bodies of
the Entomostraca in the digestive cavity.            They are of quite the
same nature as the contents of the alimentary canal in many of the
common Cladocera and Copepoda; they occur chiefly in the free
end of the cell, and in some cases they have all the appearance
of being half in and half out of the protoplasm.          (See fig. 5.)   The
particles of the  more  transparent parts of the body of the Crustaceans
will naturally not be so evident in the cell protoplasm ; even these,
however, can be made out in a Hydra in full digestion, when the
endoderm cells of the distal or gastric region are completely crammed
with transparent spheroids.
   The clearest case of ingestion of solid particles is that shown in
fig. 1, d, when a diatom is seen to be completely imbedded in the
protoplasm of a cell.
   If this explanation    of the dark granules is the correct one, Hydra

  will have been shown to exhibit a process of alimentation identical
  with that described by Metschinkoff, in the lower Turbellaria and in
  sponges.*      The Russian observer describes the complete obliteration,
  during digestion, of the digestive cavity in the Turbellarians, and of
  the canals in the sponges ; and, in the former as well as the latter, he
  has undoubted evidence of the actual ingestion of solid particles by
  the endoderm cells.
      It would seem, therefore, that Hydra adds another instance to the
  two already bronght forward by Metschnikoff, of a Metazoon exhibit
  ing what is nsnally considered to be a distinctively Protozoan mode of
  digestion. It is quite possible that a preliminary disintegration of the
 animals taken in is performed by juices secreted by the endoderm cells,
 but the final digestion seems to take place in the actual protoplasm of
 the cells, into which the food articles are taken in the solid form.
      The endoderm cells of the tentacles resemble those of the proximal
 and of the body in possessing larger vacuoles (fig. 5). Their nuclei
 are in some instances, although not constantly, simple and non-nucleo-
 late like those of the ectoderm cells for the same region (fig. 5).
      Finally, I have been able fully to confirm Professor Huxley's state-
 mentf as to the presence of nematocysts in the endoderm (fig. 1, n),
 a statement which, as far as          I  am aware, has not been made, with
 regard to Hydra, by any other writer on the snbject. This fact is, like
 the absence of interstitial tissue in the tentacles, an argument against
 Kleinenberg's view that the tissue is the sole source of the nema
 tocysts.
     4. Methods.  — For sections, the Hydras were either killed with hot
water, and placed in Kleinenberg's picric acid for two honrs, or were
placed alive in ammonic bichromate, 1 per cent. — which always kills
them in the half extended condition — and kept in it for two or three
days.      In either  case  they were afterwards transferred to 50 per cent,
alcohol, and then placed successively in 75 per cent., 90 per cent., and
absolute alcohol.         The specimens were stained either with carmine or
picrocarmine,      and   imbedded   in cacao butter, after soaking for a short
time first in oil of cloves and then in melted cacao butter. By this
means they became so thoroughly permeated with the imbedding
material that they could bo cut without the loss of a single section ;
even longitudinal sections of the tentacles could be made with ease.
     For  teasing   I  employed   ammonic      bichromate,    acetic acid (0'5 per
cent.), or osmic acid (1 per cent.), and for this purpose the specimens
were not transferred to alcohol, but to weak glycerine (equal parts of
glycerine and water ), in which they were teased ont.

       Mapping the Least Refrangible End of the Solar Spectrum

      " On Chemical
   I.                     Repulsion." By Edmund J. Mills, D.Sc,
                   F.R.S. Received January 8, 1880.
   While engaged in     some researches     on the propagation of chemical
change,   I have   incidentally encountered a new order of phenomena,
which the     title " chemical repulsion " may serve provisionally to
designate.    A brief outline of   the experiments     is given in the  follow
ing paragraphs.
   Upon a glass plate, laid in a horizontal position, is poured enough
solution of baric chloride to cover it completely to a considerable
depth.    On this solution is placed another glass plate, provided with a
small central perforation ; when the two plates are firmly pressed
together with the hands, most of the solntion is extruded, and only
a very thin layer of it left between the plates.            All excess of the
solution having been removed from the outer surfaces of the plates
as well as from the perforation, some dilute hydric sulphate is now
introduced into the perforation.           This reagent attacks the baric
chloride, throwing down a white precipitate of sulphate ; and, pro-
ceeding partly by diffusion, partly by flow, does not cease to widen in
every direction its figure of advance, until the edges of the plates
are attained.     If the perforation is circular, the figure of advance is
circular ; in other words, the chemical development of a circle is a
circle.
   Let us now suppose the two plates to be square and equal, and let
the upper one have two circular perforations, equidistant from the
centre of the square, and situated upon its diagonal.            Let also two
circular developments     of baric sulphate  be  caused  to proceed, as before,
from the two perforations simultaneously.          At first, nothing remark
able is observed ; but in a short time, the two growing circles begin to
 exercise a visible retardation on each other's progress ; so that the figure
 of advance is no longer circular, but oval. [This retardation is of
 course observed only between the perforations ; and not outside them,
 where the motion is entirely free.]      As the development of the figures

   1880.]            Dr. E.  J. Mills.   On Chemical Repulsion.               69
  continues,     so also does the retardation at their neighbouring edges
  increase ;  the final result being (however long the experiment may be
  prolonged), that the other diagonal of the square is completely and
  permanently traced out in a line of no chemical action.
     The above experiments are of fundamental importance, and they
  obviously admit of endless variety          Of this, a few illustrations may
  suffice.
     If  the upper plate have three perforations, situated       on the points
  of a central equilateral triangle, there are three repulsion lines ; these
  end at the centre of the triangle, where they form a trilocular point,
  and traverse its sides midway at right angles.
     When the upper plate has four perforations, situated on the points
  of a central square, there are four repulsion lines ; these end at the
  centre of the square, where they form a quadrilocular point, and
  traverse its sides midway at right angles.
     A very beautiful modification of       the preceding experiment consists
 in simultaneously developing a circle from a (fifth) central perforation.
 This last circle has no means of escape from the surrounding four.
 The result       is, that it eventually forms a square figure bounded by
 repulsion     lines, and having four symmetrically situated repulsion
 lines at its corners.
    It is easy to demonstrate        that the chemical repulsion in these ex
 periments does not depend upon flow.           Two superimposed triangular
 plates for instance, in neither of which is any perforation, give three
 repulsion lines on immersion in dilute hydric sulphate.             From each
 corner a line proceeds midway (if the triangle be equilateral) to the
centre.      In this effect, diffusion is alone concerned.
    In addition to hydric sulphate and baric chloride, other pairs of
reagents may be used with success ; and            I anticipate no difficulty in
obtaining results in which precipitation is not concerned. A beginning
has also been made with experiments in tridimensional development.
    The complete explanation of what              I  have termed " chemical
repulsion," will probably demand a varied and considerable amount of
experimental work. From some incidents of the investigation, so far
as it has hitherto proceeded, I am disposed to believe that the motion
in any plane chemical figure is not along the radius, but at right
angles to the radius ; and this supposition will, if verified, explain the
repulsion. The existing results afford proof of the following pro
positions, viz. : — (1.) Chemical action can take place at a distance ; and
(2.) Two or more chemical actions identical except in position, completely
exclude one another.

II. "Results    of an Inquiry into the Periodicity of Rainfall."
        By G. M. Whipple, B.Sc, F.R.A.S., Superintendent of the
        Kew Observatory. Communicated by Robert H. Scott,
        F.R.S. Received January 8, 1880.
   The exceptionally heavy rainfall of the past spring and summer
directed a large amount of attention to the records of rainfall in this
country, and more than one investigator stated that he had found a
certain periodicity existing in the quantity of rain annually collected.
   Dr. Meldrum, Professor Balfour Stewart, Mr. Hennessey, Professor
Stanley Jevons, Dr. Hunter, and others, have also widely published
theories based upon the assumption that the variation in the yearly
amounts of fall depends in some manner upon solar phenomena as
exhibited by the changes in the appearance of the sun's surface, thereby
indicating a cycle of approximately ten or eleven years' duration ; bnt
even among the supporters of this so-termed
                                                  " sun-spot " theory of
rainfall there are differences of opinion as to the exact nature of the
influence an increase of sun-spots would exert upon the rainfall of any
locality.
     Mr. G. J. Symons, in " Nature," vol. vii, p. 143, has partially in
vestigated these theories,       and shown    the     ten-year   period does not
obtain universally.
  After reading a paper by Professor Stewart, in the " Proc. Roy.
Soc," vol. xxix, p. 106, " On a Method of detecting the unknown
Inequalities of a Series of Observations," it occurred to me to try the
method he employed upon terrestrial magnetic changes, upon the
annual values of the rainfall, in order to deduce from the observations
themselves the true periodicity, if one existed.
     With a view of dealing with the largest mass of material possible,             I
took the long series of rainfall observations made at Paris from 1689
to 1875, published by M. Marie' Davy, in the
                                              " Annuaire de rObserva-
toire   de   Montsouris."
     These   I proceeded   to discuss on Professor Stewart's plan, but finding
it   entailed   great   labour, and held out little prospect of eventually
giving    a goodresult,     I
                            soon abandoned      it,and after several experi
ments, adopted the following method, which would detect at once the
presence of a cycle of an integral number of years in duration.
   Starting with an assumption of a period, which            I first made five
years in length, and subsequently extended,      I  grouped all the observa
tions together, first in five-year groups,   then  in six-year, then in seven-
year, and so on, year by year, until       I   reached thirteen years.    The
means   of these furnished    a set of curves,  showing    the variation from
the mean in the amount of annual rainfall for each of the years com

  posing the series under consideration. Perhaps shall make the opera
  tion clearer by explaining in detail the actual method of working finally
 adopted.
     Taking the table of yearly totals, the dates were written down on
 paper side by side, in horizontal rows, in red chromographic ink, and
 then the corresponding rainfalls in blue. From this sheet a number
 of impressions were worked off, each of which was cut into slips,
 afterwards gummed together, so as to form a long strip, exhibiting in
 a straight line the whole table of rainfall.
     The strips were next divided into short lengths corresponding to the
 period to be investigated (e.g., for a five-year period, each piece con
 tained the values for five consecutive years), and then gummed on
 a sheet of paper one beneath the other, so that eventually we had five
 columns of figures, the means of which represented the average
 rainfall for each of the years represented by
            (1 + 5)       (1 + 2-5)        (1 + 35)        (l+«5)
            (2 + 5)       (2 + 2-5)        (2 + 35)        (2+n5)
            (3 + 5)       (3 + 2-5)        (3+3-5)         (3 + »5)
            (4+5)         (4+2-5)          (4+35)          (4+n5)
            (5 + 5)       (5 + 2-5)        (5+3-5)         (5 + »5)
    The mean of the whole series also being known, it became possible
to form    a curve, showing the variation in the amount of rainfall upon
the assumption of a five-year period.
    By applying the same process to other copies, curves were finally
drawn for cycles extending respectively over six, seven, eight, nine,
ten, eleven, twelve, and thirteen years, and the points of maximum
and minimum noted for each curve.
    Tables   I to IX, and figs. 1 and 2, exhibit the result of this process
as applied to the whole series of observations discussed, including the
Paris results.
    Next, the whole of the observations were plotted down, and       a long
curve was drawn through them ; from this the maximum years of fall
were determined and noted. The dates of these maxima and minima
were then compared with the dates of corresponding maxima and
minima of a curve based upon the five-year cycle, as determined
above, and the number of coincidences and non-coincidences noted.
    The same operation was performed with each of the cycles, and
finally the ratio existing between the number of coincidences and non-
coincidences was calculated.       The results are given in Table X.
    This table shows that in no one case is there any indication of a
period of any integral number of years from five to thirteen inclusive
running through them.
    Hence, whatever period of variation in rainfall there may be, coin
cident with fluctuations in the spotted surface of the sun, either of ten,

 eleven,   or twelve years, this method of treatment shows it to be com-
  pletely masked (in a long series of observation) by other variations.
    The discrepancies exhibited in the first tables obtained made it very
 desirable to extend the field of inquiry, by including as many obser
 vations in the discussion as possible ; but having fixed upon the
 arbitrary limit of fifty years as the least number of years of observa
 tions suitable for dealing with after my method, the materials for
 doing so were not very abundant.              Eventually       I was able to collect

    To these added an eleventh one, forming a series by combining
together the annual rainfall for 1822 to 1875 at London, Paris, and
Edinburgh. This increased the total number of years of observations
used in the discussion to 978.
    The result of the extended investigation in no way affected the con
clusion pointed out by the observations previously treated, viz., that
taking the series of annual totals directly as they stand, there is no
marked indication of the presence of a short cycle to be found.
There are a few exceptions, notably in the case of the nine-year period
for New Bedford and Philadelphia, the eleven-year cycle for Madras,
and the ten-year cycle for London, Paris, and Edinburgh combined,
in all of which cases the coincidences but slightly preponderate over
the non-coincidences.
    Again on consideration of the differences in Tables I to IX, it will
be seen that for the same epoch the curves of variation differ widely
for localities comparatively close together.               For example, taking the
eleven-year cycle       for  Padua    and  Milan,   stations   only about 130 miles
apart, both well situated for observing rain, and no mountain range
intervening, the variation curves are as follows : —

   Further inspection of the tables will show numerous other instances
of incongruity to be found in every one of the cycles, leading forcibly
to the conclusion that either no short term of exactly five, six, seven,
eight, nine, ten, eleven, twelve, or thirteen years exists in the annual
amount of rainfall at any of the stations whose observations have
been here discussed, or that the effect of abnormal falls is so great that
it cannot be eliminated by upwards of a hundred years' observations.
                   I
   In any case, think it may now be stated with certainty that all
predictions as to rainy or dry years, based upon existing materials,
must in future be considered as utterly valueless.

III.  " Studies on the Electric Arc."      By Professor James Dewar,
       M.A., F.R.S., Fullerian Professor of Chemistry at the Royal
       Institution. Received January 8, 1880.
   In    a former    communication   on the   formation of     hydrocyanic
acid in the electric arc, a more complete examination       of the various
reactions taking place in the arc with poles of various kinds, and in
presence of different gaseous media, was promised.
   Various difficulties have impeded the satisfactory progress of the
investigation.     During the course, however, of numerous experi
ments, facts of interest have been recorded, which appear worthy of
embodiment in     a short paper.
                     Formation of Cyanogen Compounds.
   The influence of impurities in the carbon on the production of
hydrocyanic acid was first examined.           For this purpose, some
drilled Siemens' carbons were placed in a porcelain tube, and treated
for several days at a white heat with a rapid stream of chlorine, until
the greater part of the silica, oxide of iron, alumina, &c, were
volatilised in the form of chlorides.     Sometimes the carbons had a
subsequent treatment with hydrogen, or were directly treated with a
current of chlorine while the arc was in operation.
   Carbons treated in this way continued to yield hydrocyanic acid,
when a steady current of air was drawn through the positive pole as
formerly described, even when the same pole had several successive
treatments with chlorine during the discharge. Natural graphite poles
gave the same result.
   As it was evident from the foregoing experiments, that the elimina
tion of a large portion of the impurities had little influence on the pro
duction of the hydrocyanic acid, the only other explanation of its
formation appeared to be the presence of aqueous vapour, and organic
impurities in the air, or a direct formation of cyanogen from carbon
and nitrogen.     An attempt was made to obtain a pure and dry atmo
sphere   in which  such experiments conld be carried out. The following
apparatus was devised for the purpose.
   A tin vessel, fig. 1, about two feet high and one foot in diameter,
had an annular space, through which a constant stream of water was
kept flowing. This cylinder was placed upon a porcelain stand, having
a narrow groove filled with mercury, so as to make an air-tight joint.
The lamp was placed inside this vessel, the wires connecting it with
the machine being brought through the bottom of the stand.         A tube
passed through the porcelain base, which allowed a current of dry air
to be forced through the vessel. A small aperture in the top of the tin

vessel allowed the glass tube coming from the positive pole to pass
with little friction, through which the products from the arc were
drawn.    This annular vessel was very convenient, not only for exa
mining the products formed in the arc, but also those formed outside
of   it,
       and the water flowing round     served the double purpose of
                                               it
keeping     cool
           it    and  enabling determination of the amount of total
                                     a
radiation in heat units to be made.

           containing sulphuric acid and phosphoric anhydride were
     Vessels
placed inside the cylinder in order to dry the interior as completely as
possible.
  Numerous    experiments made by forcing perfectly dry air into the
vessel through the tube A, and drawing     out by the tube
                                                    it        through   B
a weighed sulphuric acid bulb, gave after an hour   few milligrams of
                                                              a
water, owing no doubt to some slight defect in the soldering of the tin,
which allowed a capillary film of water to diffuse into the interior
space.
  When the ordinary Siemens' carbons were burnt in this almost
dry atmosphere, the yield of hydrocyanic acid was still very marked,
purified carbons yielding the same results.

    As the yield of cyanogen compounds did not appear to             be diminished,
and it appeared almost impossible to get the large volume of air in the
tin vessel perfectly dry, another plan was adopted. The poles were en
closed in an egg-shaped glass globe about eight inches long and six inches
 in diameter, thus diminishing the volume of air to be dried and dis
 pensing with the water covering.           The globe, balanced by a system of
pulleys, was firmly attached to the lower or negative pole, with which
it moved without impeding the action of the lamp.
    Dry air was sometimes forced through the negative carbon itself, at
other times through a glass tube passing up the side of it into the
globe, the products being drawn through the positive pole as before.
   As the globe soon became intensely heated, and as a far larger supply
of. dry air was forced in than was drawn out, it is inconceivable that
any moisture could remain near the arc after it had been burning for
a few minutes.
    Seven consecutive experiments, each of ten minutes' duration, made
with the same purified carbon poles, did not show any diminution in
the quantity of hydrocyanic acid, unless in one of the experiments,
when the arc would not be drawn into the interior of the carbon tube,
but persisted in rotating round it.*
   The inference drawn from these experiments was, that the drilled
carbons, even after prolonged treatment with chlorine, still con
tained a quantity of combined hydrogen, and a few organic analyses
showed that the amount of ash and combined hydrogen in the various
samples was never less than about 0'75 of the former and as much
as O'l of the latter.       Poles made with especially purified carbon by
Messrs. Siemens for these experiments proved to be no better in respect
to the quantity of hydrogen and ash they contained.
   The well-nigh impossible problem of eliminating hydrogen from
masses of carbon such as can be employed in experiments of this kind,
proves conclusively that the inference drawn by Mr. Lockyer,f as to
the elementary character of the so-called carbon spectrum from an
examination of the arc in dry chlorine, cannot be regarded as satis
factory, seeing that undoubtedly hydrogen was present in the carbon,
and in all probability nitrogen in the chlorine.
                        Experiments with Carbon Tubes.
   In order    to ascertain whether the formation of hydrocyanic acid and
acetylene in the arc was really due to transformations induced by some
   * Cyanogen is difficult to   recognise in presence of prussic acid when in small
quantity, especially when impurities from the carbons complicate the tests.        In
speaking generally of the formation of this acid in the arc, I do not mean to exclude
the possibility of cyanogen being formed as well.

occult power located in the arc, or was simply the result of the high
temperature attained by the carbons, a series of experiments was made
in carbon tubes, the arc being merely used as a means of heating. The
following is the method of arranging the arc for this experiment.
   A block of limestone about five inches long by three inches thick
was drilled horizontally as shown in the drawing, another hole being
drilled so as to meet it in the centre of the mass.
                                   Fio. i
   A. drilled purified carbon was placed in the horizontal channel and
made the positive pole, the negative pole being a solid rod of carbon
passing through the vertical aperture.       Gases were passed through
the positive carbon, and were thus subjected to the intense heat of the
walls of the tube, the arc passing outside.
   The walls of the positive carbon burnt through with great rapidity,
not lasting as a rule more than fifteen minutes.        This action could
only be prevented by using much thicker carbons, and consequently
reducing considerably the intensity of the heat.
   The porosity of the carbons, which allowed a constant diffusion of
gases throngh their walls, was another source of difficulty, which has
now been overcome.
   On passing a mixture of three volumes hydrogen and one volume
nitrogen thoroughly dried through the positive pole, a large yield of
hydrocyanic acid was always obtained, and on using equal volumes of
hydrogen and nitrogen the quantity was if anything increased.
   Pure dry hydrogen by itself gave a trace of hydrocyanic acid, and
a considerable quantity of acetylene.
   Pure dry air gave no hydrocyanic acid or acetylene ; moist air, on

latter.
   The yield in all these experiments altered considerably with the rate
at which the gases were passed, a quick stream always producing
more than a slow one, unless when oxygen was present.

the  lamp was allowed to work automatically, often for an hoar or two
together. A continuous stream of dry air was kept circulating through
the interior, being afterwards      passed through a series of wash bottles
containing dilute caustic soda, or directly through strong sulphuric
acid, to absorb the oxides of nitrogen.        The nitrous acid was estimated
in the former case by titration with permanganate of potash, and the
total combined nitrogen by the mercury process.
   In this way many experiments were made with a Siemens lamp, both
with a long and short arc ; Jablochkoff 's candles without any insulating
material were also employed with the highest intensity current of
a De Meritens machine, in order to have the greatest variety in the
character of the discharge.
   The stream of dry air was forced           through at varying degrees of
speed, and was found to have a decided effect on the quantity of
nitrites produced, the more rapid stream giving the largest yield of
nitrites.
   The following tables give the quantity produced             in a number of
different experiments.

   In a report   to the  British Association* on the determination of high
temperatures in the year 1873, it was experimentally proved that the
law of Dulong and Petit could not be used for the estimation of high
                                   " gives a far too rapid increase for the

thermo-electric current strength when the same substance radiates at
different temperatures, plotted in terms of the temperature, was a

 "parabolic curve."       Assuming the general accuracy of this law for
 high temperatures,     the total radiation may be taken as nearly propor
tional to the square of the temperature.           From this law the hypo
thetical temperature of the sun was "estimated as at least 11,000 C."
 Rosetti has recently made a more elaborate investigation on the sub
ject, and has arrived independently at a formula of a parabolic order.
 Rosetti * represents his results by the equation
                           /»=aT»(T-0)-&(T-0),
where fi is the total radiation measured by thermo-electric current,
T° the absolute temperature         of the source, 6° that of the medium
surrounding the pile, and a and b constants.               However well this
formula may represent the complete series of the experiments,
it is certain that his results for temperatures above 150° may be
expressed within the limits of probable error as proportional to the
square of the temperature.        To be convinced of this, it is sufficient to
plot the logarithm of the respective values of the radiation and tem
perature, when it will be found the results arrange themselves in a
straight line, the tangent of which may be 1'9 or 2 for the observa
tions above 150°. Experiments made with the thermopile, surrounded
with an annular vessel, through which a continuous current of water
at constant temperature is caused to circulate, as represented in fig. 3,

screen, on the same plan, each having a narrow opening, about half an
inch in diameter, through which the radiant heat passed to the pile,
have confirmed the earlier results. The vessel for holding the mercury
or other substance to be heated to different temperatures has a radia
ting face, which was made of the sheet iron used in the construction of
telephone    plates, and the thermometer        must be placed      close to the
back of the front surface, and the face guarded with a screen, FG.
The tube, CE, is connected with a condenser, when substances at their
boiling point are employed for giving fixed points. The form of the
apparatus is shown in fig. 4.
   This arrangement of the apparatus is necessary in order to get
anything like comparable results.          The two following tables give the
records of two series of experiments, without any correction being
made in the numbers representing the deviations of the Thomson
galvanometer.

   If  the differences    in the galvanometer readings for every ten
degrees in the first table be tabulated, it will be observed the second
difference  may be regarded as constant, considering the errors of
observation, so that a parabolic formula can represent the results
with sufficient accuracy.       These second differences are far more
constant than     similar  numbers deduced from Rosetti's observations,
and his more complete formula in terms of the absolute temperature
is too extensive, considering the range of the experiments where tem
perature was accurately known. The results of Table            II  extend to the
boiling points   of  mercury  and   sulphur,   and the  numbers       are in near
accord with the simple square of the temperature.            The alteration in
the condition of the radiating surface at high temperatures causes

great complications, and until this difficulty is overcome, experiments
at higher temperatures must remain uncertain.         All the experiments
show that for an approach to a knowledge of temperatures beyond
the range of our actual thermometric scale, the law given in 1873 is a
sufficiently correct reproduction of the facts, considering the limited
data at our disposal.
    The intensity of the radiation of the positive pole of the Siemens'
arc, as compared with the same surface heated with a large oxy-
hydrogen blowpipe, was determined by employing a hollow negative
carbon which allowed the intensely heated surface to radiate directly
on to the pile, as shown in fig. 3. A large number of observations have
been made by this method at different times, and with slight modifica
tions in the order of the experiments, leading to the average result
that the intensity of the total radiation of the positive pole of the
 Siemens' arc is ten times that of the same substance at the tempera
ture of the oxyhydrogen flame. If we take an average result of nine
to one, then we may infer that the temperature of the limiting posi
tive pole is about 6,000° C, seeing that the mean temperature of the
oxhydrogen may be taken as 2,000° C.         The mean value of the total
radiation of the Siemens'    arc was determined by observing the rate of
flow of the water through the annular vessel, represented in fig. 1,
together with the mean increment of temperature.        This gave on the
average 34,000 gram-units per minute, or a little more than three
horse-power.

    In  a former communication     (" Proc. Roy. Soc," vol. xxvii, p. 350)
we described our observations on the absorption spectrum of magne
sium, and of magnesium with potassium and sodium, as seen in iron
tubes in an atmosphere of hydrogen. These absorptions consisted of —
    "
      (1.) Two sharp lines in the green, of which one, which is broader
than the other, and appears to broaden as the temperature increases,
coincides in position with the least refrangible of the b group, while
the other is less refrangible and has a wave-longth very nearly 5210.
These lines are the first and the last to be seen and very constant, and
we at first took them for the extreme lines of the 6 group.

than the 6 group                      The less refrangible edge of this band
is sharply defined, and has a wave-length about 5140, and it fades away
towards the blue.
     " These absorptions are all seen both when potassium and when
sodium are used along with magnesium, and may be fairly ascribed to
magnesium, or to magnesium together with hydrogen.                         •
     "
         (4). When sodium and magnesium are used together, a dark line
with ill-defined edges is seen in the green, with a wave-length about
5300.
     "
         (5.) When potassium and magnesium are used together, a pair of
dark lines are seen in the red. The less refrangible of these sometimes
broadens into a band with ill-defined edges, and has a mean wave
length of about 6580. The other is always a fine sharp line with a
wave-length       about 6475.
     "
         (6.) On one occasion, with a mixture of potassium and magnesium,
another dark line was seen in the blue, with a wave-length nearly
 4820."
     We then described the emission spectrum seen when sparks are
taken between electrodes of magnesium with a small induction coil
 without a Leyden jar as consisting of lines with the wave-lengths
 4481, 4590, 4570, 4797, 4930, 4945, 4957, 4969, 4980, 4990, 5000, the
 well-known b group, and 5528.
     As the absorption lines above described correspond to no known
¦emission lines of magnesium, we could only ascribe their origin to the
 mixtures employed as distinct from the separate elements, and we were
 led to investigate the conditions under which corresponding emission
 lines could be produced.
      Shortly afterwards (" Proc. Roy. Soc," vol. xxvii, p. 494) we de
 scribed the emission spectrum of sparks from an induction coil taken
 between magnesium points in an atmosphere of hydrogen, as follows : —
         " A bright line
                          regularly appeared with a wave-length about 5210.
  .    .    . This  line does not usually extend across the whole interval
 between the electrodes, and is sometimes seen only at the negative
 electrode. Its presence seems to depend on the temperature, as it is not
 seen continuously when a large Leyden jar is employed, until the pres
 sure of the hydrogen, and its resistance, is very much reduced. When
 well-dried nitrogen or carbonic oxide is substituted for hydrogen, this
 line disappears entirely; but if any hydrogen or traces of moisture
  be present, it comes out when the pressure is much reduced.         In such
  cases the hydrogen lines C and F are always visible as well.         Some
  times several fine lines appear on the more refrangible side of this line
  between it and the b group, which give it the appearance of being a
  narrow band shaded on that side."          " In addition to the above-men
  tioned line, we observed that there is also produced a series of fine
  lines, commencing close to the most refrangible line of the b group, and

    These observations, though very briefly described, were the result of
much labour and many experiments.                    Mr. Lockyer, in a recent com
 munication to the Society, has made this particular emission spectrum
the basis of a theory of his own, which we regard as being without
any foundation in fact ; and as he makes no allusion whatever to our
observations, although tho abstract of our paper appeared in various
scientific journals,* or to the grounds on which we have ascribed the
spectrum to a mixture of magnesium with hydrogen, we give now some
further details of onr former experiments, as well as the observations

                      and Carbonic Oxide at Various Pressures.
    The points were           pieces of magnesium wire. Round one end of
each a platinum wire was tightly coiled and fused into the side of a
glass tube.         This tube was attached by fusion at one end to another
tube      filled with phosphoric anhydride, which in turn was connected
with a Sprengel pump.                The other end of the tube was connected
by a thick rubber tube, capable of being closed by a pinchcock, with
a gas holder containing nitrogen over strong sulphuric acid.                         The
tube, having been exhausted and filled with nitrogen two or three
times, it was found that no line at 5210 was visible in the spark.
 The tube was now gradually exhausted, and the spark watched as
the exhaustion proceeded.              No line at 5210 was seen, although the
exhaustion was carried nearly as far as the pump would carry it ; nor
was any hydrogen line (C or F) visible, either with or without the
use of a jar.          The communication with the gas holder was now
opened, and the tube refilled with nitrogen at the atmospheric
pressure, a communication was then made with another vessel con
taining hydrogen, which was allowed to diffuse into the tube for a
very short time.         On now passing the spark, the line at 5210 at once
appeared, although the quantity of hydrogen diffused into the nitrogen
must have been very small.                   The experiments with nitrogen at
reduced pressure were repeated several times, with the same result.
It was found necessary to have the phosphoric anhydride, as without
it traces of moisture were left or found their way through the pump
into the tube, and then, when the exhaustion was carried far enough,
both the line at 5210 and the hydrogen lines, C and F, made their
appearance.          We have never, however, been able to detect the line

at 5210, in nitrogen, without being able to detect C or F either at the
same time or by merely varying the discharge by means of a Leyden
jar.
   Experiments made in the same way with carbonic oxide instead of
nitrogen led to precisely similar results.
2.   Observations on the Spark between Magnesium Points in Hydrogen at
                               reduced Pressures.
   A  tube, similar to those employed with nitrogen and carbonic oxide,
was attached at one end to a Sprengel pump and mercury gauge, and at
the other to an apparatus for generating hydrogen.       Dry hydrogen was
passed    through for some time, and the connexion with the hydrogen
apparatus closed. On sparking with the hydrogen at the atmospheric
pressure, the line at 5210 and its attendant series were visible, and were
still visible when a small Leyden jar was used with the induction coil, but
disappeared almost entirely when a large Leyden jar was used. When
the pressure of the hydrogen was reduced to half an atmosphere, the
line at 5210 was seen faintly when a largo Leyden jar was used, but
not the series of fine lines.         When the pressure was reduced to
180   millims., the series of fine lines began to show when the large jar
was used.      By still further reducing the pressure the whole series was
permanently visible when the large jar was used ; but when the
exhaustion was carried still further they grew fainter, and almost dis
appeared.      On gradually readmitting hydrogen, the same phenomena
recurred in the reverse order.
         3. Observations on the  Arc with Magnesium and Hydrogen.
   The line at 5210 is not    seen in the arc in a lime or carbon crucible
when magnesium       is  dropped in without the introduction of hydrogen.
If, however, a gentle stream of hydrogen or of coal gas be led in
through a perforation in one of the electrodes, the line at 5210 im
mediately makes its appearance, and, by varying the current, it may
be made to appear either bright or reversed.           However small the
current of hydrogen be made, the line can be detected as long as the
current and the supply of magnesium continues, and disappears very
quickly when the current ceases.
            4. Observations on the  Flame of Burning Magnesium.
   The line at 5210 may often be seen in the flame of magnesium
burning in air, but both it and the series of fine lines which accom
pany it come out with greatly increased brilliance if the burning
magnesium be held in a jet of hydrogen, of coal gas, or of steam.
   The experiments above described, with nitrogen and carbonic oxide
at reduced pressures, are almost if not quite conclusive against the
supposition that the line at 5210 is due merely to the lower tempera

   1880.]         Chi the Spectra  of Magnesium and Lithium.             97
  tare  of the spark in hydrogen.      From De La Rue and Miiller'a obser
  vations   it would appear that nitrogen at a pressure of 400 millims.
  should produce much the same effect on the spark as hydrogen at
   "60 millims.     Now the pressures of the nitrogen and carbonic oxide
  were reduced far below this without any trace of the line in question
  being visible.     Moreover, the magnesium line at 4481, which is not
  seen in the arc, and may be reasonably ascribed to the higher tem
  perature of the spark, may be seen in the spark at the same time
  as the line at 5210 when        hydrogen is present.    Nevertheless tem
  perature does seem to affect the result in some degree, for when a
  Urge Leyden jar is used, and the gas is at the atmospheric pressure,
  the line almost disappears       from the spark, to re-appear when the
  pressure is reduced ; but by no variation of temperature have we
  been able to see the line when hydrogen was carefully excluded.
     A line of the same wave-length has been seen by Young in the
  chromosphere once.       Its absence from the Fraunhofer lines leads to
 the inference that the temperature of the sun is too high (unless at
 special times and places) for its production.        If it be not due to a
 compound of magnesium with hydrogen, at any rate it occurs with
 special facility in the presence of hydrogen, and ought to occur in the
 sun if the temperature were not too high.
     We have been careful to ascribe this line and its attendant series
 to a mixture of magnesium and hydrogen rather than to a chemical
 compound, because this expresses the facts, and we have not yet
 obtained any independent evidence of the existence of any chemical
 compound of those elements.           We have independent evidence that
 mixtures which are not probably chemical compounds favour the pro
 duction of certain vibrations which are not so strong or are not seen
 at all when the elements of those mixtures are taken separately.      The
 remarkable absorptions produced by mixtures of magnesium with
 potassium and sodium above-mentioned belong to this class. We have
not been able to obtain the emission spectra corresponding to these
absorptions, but in the course of our observations on the arc we have
frequently noticed that certain lines of metals present in the crucible
are only seen or come out with especial brilliance when some other
metal is introduced. This is the case with some groups of calcium
lines which are not seen, or barely visible, in the arc in a lime
crucible, and come out with great brilliance on the introduction of a
fragment of iron, but are not developed by other metals such as tin.
    The spectrum of magnesium, as seen in the arc, contains several
lines     besides  those   heretofore  described.  These   lines  come  out
brightly, generally considerably expanded, when a fragment of mag
nesium is dropped into the crncible through which the arc is passing,
but rapidly contract and gradually become very faint or disappear
entirely.

    (1.) A line in the greenish-yellow, wave-length 5710-7. This line
is seen not only in the arc but also when sparks are taken from a
solution of magnesium chloride. It is a faint line in the latter case,
but is seen in carefully purified samples of the chloride, so that we
have no doubt that it belongs to magnesium.
    (2.) A line, wave-length 435T2, very close to a chromium line. It
is easily distinguished from the latter by its expansion when fresh
magnesium is introduced, while the chromium lines show no expan
sion ; it is moreover slightly more refrangible than the chromium line,
and as it dies out it is sharply defined on the less refrangible side,
diffuse on the other side. This line frequently appears to be accom
panied by another weaker line at wave-length 4355, but we have not
been able to assure ourselves that the latter is due to magnesium alone.
It is certainly developed when magnesiuni is introduced, and we do
not know of any other element to which it can be ascribed ; but it
behaves very much as some lines of other elements, e.g., the violet lines
of lithium mentioned below, coming out brightly when magnesium
is freshly put in, and then nearly dying away.
    (3.) A violet line, wave-length 4166, identical in position with the
sharp edge of one of the so-called carbon bands in that region.
    (4.) Another violet line, wave-length 4057'3, easily recognised by
its position between two strong iron lines.
    These last three lines are conspicuous in Capron's photograph of
magnesium in arc.       The last (4) may be seen in the spark between
magnesium points, and was formerly mistaken by us for the potassium
line which is near it. The lines (3) and (4) are so nearly identical
in position with two well-known lines of lead, that a suspicion naturally
 arises that they may be due to the presence of that metal.       We can
 never be sure that the carbons or even the limestone crucibles we
 have used may not contain traces of lead ; but if that be so, and these
 lines are the consequence, it is certain that these two lines are
 strengthened in an extraordinary degree by the presence of mag
 nesium, while the other lines of lead are not seen at all.  Photographs
 of the arc taken when a fragment of magnesium is introduced show
 these lines strongly, while no trace is discernible of other lead lines
4062, 4246, or 4386. Until we get some other evidence of the pre
 sence of lead, we must ascribe these lines to magnesium.
    There are lines in the " normal solar spectrum " corresponding to
 all these lines except that at 4166. That at 5710' 7 is ascribed to iron
 by Angstrom, but neither Thalen, Kirchhoff, Huggins, nor Bois-
 baudran give any iron line at this place ; and we have not succeeded
 in seeing any such iron line, but there is an air-line very nearly in
 that position.   Rutherford's photograph of the solar spectrum shows
a line very nearly at 4166.
    This makes the spectrum of magnesium in the arc consist of lines

 and the triplet beyond      H.
                          On the Spectrum of Lithium.
     In the spectrum of lithium      we have not heretofore been able to
 obtain the ware-length of the violet line (at about 4130, Boisbaudran)
 by reason of its very diffuse character, but we have recently found
 that by a slight modification of our apparatus we could obtain this
 line more sharply defined and even reversed.       This modification con
 sists in making the opening in the lime small, 5 or 6 millims. in
diameter,     using small carbons as electrodes, and the current from a
 De Meritens machine.         The line can then be seen close to but on the
less refrangible side of the barium line in that region.       We make its
wave-length 4131-7.
     Besides this line we find that lithium gives another line in the arc
at 4273.      This line comes out conspicuously nearly midway between
one of the brightest chromium lines and an iron line when a fragment
 of lithium is dropped into the crucible.        The same line may also be
detected in the spark taken between points of fused lithium carbonate ;
and as a sample of the carbonate very carefully purified shows this
line, we have no doubt that it really belongs to lithium.
     Both these lines are remarkably strengthened when a fragment of
 magnesium is dropped into the crucible.
     On taking a photograph of the arc when a fragment of lithium is
introduced, two more lines come out on either side of H and K. These
are generally diffuse, and barely discernible by the eye in the arc when
glass prisms are used, but easily seen with a calcite prism and qnartz
 lenses.    In the powerful arc of a Siemens machine they are enormously
expanded and reversed. From measurements of the photographs the
wave-lengths appear to be 3913 and 3984. A yet more refrangible
diffuse line appears in the photographs at about 3799.
     The lithium lines form a progression not unlike that of the sodium
lines, the alternate lines at 4603, 4131-5, 3913 are much more diffuse
than the lines at 4972, 4273, and 3984, and approach nearer together
as they become more refrangible.          There is probably another narrow
 line at about 3838, amongst the magnesinm triplet, which we have not
yet made out with certainty, and we may expect to find fainter lines
still more refrangible, but as our photographs have been taken with a
train of glass prisms they do not show out.
     There is a line in the " normal solar spectrum

hence we obtain at once p + r, and q + s, which will render the solution
ofthe equations easy, at all events, in all possible cases.
  I would moreover remark that the validity of the process depends
on V(j> + qz+rx3 + 8x?) expanding in a converging series, bo that the
method         of evaluation here, a of course in (109), (110), depends on
certain       conditions, to which the constants in the integrals must bo
subject.

 III.  •'
          On the Construction of a Glj'cerine Barometer." By
      James B. Jobdax, Communicated by Professor Stokes.
      Sec. B.S.      Received January 8, 1880.
   Various attempts have beeu made from time to time to construct
barometers with fluids of lower density than mercury, with the view
of increasing the range of movement of the column by the direct
action of the atmosphere, thereby rendering the variations of pressure
more   easily visible, without the intervention of mechanical appliances.
I  have been induced      to give the subject attention in the belief that if
precise   instruments   of this class could be made they would prove of
scientific value in showing the character of the more minute vibrations
of atmospheric       pressure, and of practical use at storm stations,
collieries, and other situations where it is of importance for the un
 practised eye to notice frequently the movements of the column with
out the careful observation necessary in the reading of an ordinary
mercurial barometer.
    Water is apparently the most convenient liquid for a long range
barometric column, and many water barometers have been constructed,
notably that made for the Royal Society in 1830, by Professor Daniell.
A water column is, however, of little use for indicating variations of
 pressure,  owing to the effect of changes of temperature on the water
 vapour    existing in the Torricellian vacuum, which often masks the
effects which would otherwise be prodnced by changes of pressure.
 Having successfully constructed several water barometers, and finding
 this conflicting action caused by variations of temperature so detri
mental to their value,    I was induced to experiment with other liquids,
and among those tried pure glycerine appeared to me to answer the
purpose best.      Glycerine from its high boiling point has a very low
tension of vapour at the ordinary temperatures of the atmosphere ;
the length of the column is therefore only altered from changes of
temperature by expansion and contraction of the liquid itself, and
that in a very small degree, the mean coefficient of absolute expansion
between 0" and 100° C. being -0005455.          The specific gravity of the
purest glycerine as manufactured       by Messrs. Price and Co. is 1*26, or
less than one-tenth that of mercury ; the mean height of the column
is 27 feet at sea level, and a variation of a tenth of an inch in the
height of the mercurial column is shown by a change of more than
an inch in the gljcerine ; the boiling point is 440° F., and a very low
temperature is required to solidify it. As glycerine absorbs moisture
freely if exposed to the atmosphere,          the action is prevented    by
covering the surface of the liquid in the cistern with a shallow layer
of heavy petroleum oil, prepared especially for the purpose.
   In order to give the method a fair trial, application was made to
the Committee of the Government Fund for aiding scientific research,

1880.]       On  the Construction  of a Glycerine Barometer.           107
and on their recommendation a grant of £30 was made by the Trea
sury for the purpose.     This sum has been expended in the construc
tion of an experimental barometer of this nature, which has been
erected at Kew Observatory by the permission of the Kew Committee,
who have also sanctioned the taking of a series of observations to
extend over a period of twelve months.
   The tube forming the body of the instrument is an ordinary com
position metal gas-pipe, £ ths of an inch internal diameter, and furnished
at the top with a gun-metal socket, into which is cemented a glass
tube, 4 feet long, and having an inside diameter of one inch ; the upper
end is formed in the shape of an open cnp and fitted at its neck with
an india-rubber stopper.      In this tube the fluctuations of the posi
tion of the top of the column are observed, and the height read off
on brass scales placed on either side of the tube and fitted with
indices and verniers, which are moved by means of milled heads
placed at the bottom of the scales as shown in the drawing at A A. The
scale on the right hand side is divided into inches and tenths of
absolute measure, numbering from the level of the liquid in the
cistern, while that on the left shows equivalent values reduced to a
column of mercury and divided into tenths and hundredths, each
hundredth being equal to about one-tenth of an actual inch. The
whole of the top fittings, or observing portion of the barometer, is
attached to a conveniently constructed back, made of oak and fixed
to the wall of an upper room in the observatory building, the main
tube being carried down in a direct line through the entrance hall
into the barograph room, a distance of 27 feet. This distance was
accurately determined by means of a tape measure, the error of which
was found by close comparisons with the standard yard preserved at
the Observatory. A suitable bracket is here fixed, on the north wall,
on which is placed the barometer cistern.
    The cistern is a cylindrical vessel of copper tinned inside, 5 inches
 deep and 10 inches diameter ; it is fitted with a screwed cover, as
shown at B in the drawing, the air having access only through a
small hole in the cap C attached to the cover, which has a recess
in it to hold cotton wool for filtering out dust. The main tube is
 connected with the cistern by attachment (with a soldered joint) to
 a projecting piece of tube D, which enters the cistern through the
 bottom and is fitted at its opening with a screwed plug E.
    The operation of filling the barometer was performed in the follow
 ing way : —The quantity of glycerine (coloured red by aniline) having
 been previously determined, it was heated to a temperature of 100° F.,
 to render it more limpid, thereby enabling the contained air to dis
 engage itself more freely; the- whole quantity, about three-fourths of a
 gallon, was then transferred to the cistern, the plug E removed, and
 by means of an air-pump connected with the top of the glass tube, the

108                   Prof. J. Clerk Maxwell    on a             [Jan. 22,
air was exhausted and the liquid forced up the tube by the pressure of
the atmosphere, to a height of 323 571 inches, being equivalent to 30
inches of mercury, the Kew standard at the time reading 30'3 inches.
The plug in the cistern was now screwed in its place, to support the
column, while the air was admitted at the top and the air-pump con
nexions removed ; a sufficient quantity of glycerine to fill the tube
was then poured in and the india-rubber stopper inserted.        The screw
plug being removed for a few seconds to allow the column to fall an
inch or two and then replaced, the instrument was allowed to remain
until the liquid in it was completely exhausted of its air, which rose
slowly to the surface into the Torricellian vacuum above : then the
india-rubber stopper was again withdrawn and the tnbe finally filled
up with glycerine, which had been previously exhausted of air under
the air-pump receiver : the stopper was now replaced and the cistern
plug finally removed, when the column gradually fell until balanced
by the pressure of the atmosphere, leaving a small quantity of
glycerine in the cup above the stopper, a plate glass cover being'
placed on the top to keep out dust.   The barometer was now complete
and it has since continued in operation.    Whether it is to be of anv
scientific or practical value will be proved by the observations which
are now being regularly taken under the superintendence of Mr. Whip
ple, the Superintendent of the Kew Observatory, to whom        I am under
many obligations for his kind and courteous assistance during the
progress of the work.      When the observations are completed I shall
ask the honour of submitting them to the Royal Society.
IV. "    On a Possible Mode of Detecting a Motion of the Solar
      System through the Luminiferous Ether." By the late Pro
      fessor J. Clerk Maxwell, F.R.S.         In a Letter to Mr. D. P.
      Todd, of the Nautical Almanac Office, Washington, U.S.
      Communicated      by Professor STOKES, Sec. R.S.           Received
      January    7, 1880.
   Mr. Todd has been so good as to communicate to me a copy of the
subjoined letter, and has kindly permitted me to make any use of it.
   As the notice referred to by Maxwell in the " Encyclopaedia
Britannica " is very brief, being confined to a single sentence, and as
the subject is one of great interest, I have thought it best to com
municate the letter to the Royal Society.
   From the researches of Mr. Huggins on the radial component of
the relative velocity of our sun and certain stars, the coefficient of the
inequality which we might expect as not unlikely would be only some
thing comparable with half a second of time. This, no doubt, would
be a very delicate matter to determine.    Still, for anything we know

18^0.]        Mode   of Detecting    a Motion     of the  Solar Sustetn.        10!)
a  priori to the contrary, the motion might he very much greater than
what would correspond to this; and the idea has a value of its own,
irrespective of the possibility of actually making the determination.
    In his letter to me Mr. Todd remarks, " I regard the communica
tion as one of extraordinary importance, although (as you will notice
if you have access to the reply which I made) it is like to be a long
time before we shall have tables of the satellites of Jupiter suffi
ciently accurate to put the matter to a practical test."
    I have not thought it expedient to delay the publication of the
letter on the chance that something bearing on the subject might be
found among Maxwell's papers.
                                                                   G. G. Stokes.

Sie,
    I have received with much pleasure the tables of the satellites of
Jupiter which you have teen so kind as to send me, and                       I   am
encouraged by your        interest  in  the  Jovial   system to ask you if you
have made any         special    study   of  the apparent retardation       of the
eclipses   as affected by the geocentric      position of Jupiter.
    I am told that observations of this kind have been somewhat put
out of fashion by other methods of determining quantities related to
the velocity of light, but they afford the only method, so far as                  I
know, of getting any estimate of the direction and magnitude of the
 velocity of the    Run  with respect to the luminiferous medium.             Even
if we were sure of the theory of aberration, we can only get differences
of position of stars, and in the terrestrial methods of determining the
velocity of light, the light comes back along the same path again, so
that the velocity of the earth with respect to the ether would alter
the time of the double passage by a quantity depending on the square
of the ratio of the earth's velocity to that of light, and this is quite
too small to be observed.
    But if JE is the distance of Jupiter from the earth and I the
geocentric longitude, and if V is the longitude and                  \ the latitude
of the     direction   in   which   the   sun is moving through ether with
velocity v, and if V is the velocity of light and t the time of transit
from   J  to E,
                          JE=[V-«cos\cos (l—l')]             t.
 By   a comparison      of   the   values   of t  when     Jupiter is in different
 signs of the zodiac, it would be possible to determine V and v cos \.
    I do not see how to determine X, unless we had a planet with an
 orbit very much inclined to the ecliptic.               It may be noticed that
 whereas the determination of V, the velocity of light, by this method

depends on the differences of JE, that                   is,
                                         on the diameter of the earth's
orbit, the determination of t; cos depends on   A,
                                                                   JE
                                                   itself, much larger      a
quantity.
     But no method can                     without good tables of the
                                be made available
motion of the satellites, and as  am not an astronomer,
                                        I                  do not know      I
whether, in comparing the observations with the tables of De Damoi-
seau, any attempt has been made to consider the term in v cos X.
I   have, therefore, taken the liberty of writing to you, as the matter
isbeyond the reach of anyone who has not made a special study of
the satellites.
  In the article    [ether] in the ninth edition of the "Encyclopaedia
                       E
Britannica,"   I                               know about the relative
                       have collected all the facts            I
motion of the ether and the bodies which move in it, and have shown
that nothing can be inferred about this relative motion from any
phenomena hitherto observed, except the eclipses, &c, of the satellites
of a planet, the more distant the better.
   If you know of any work done in this direction, either by yourself
or others, should esteem
           I                    favour to be told of it.

the fundamental                    and Py are taken, and

    The offspring (soboles) are derived from Norwegian statistics of
the number of children born to married and unmarried women of the
several ages, snch facts for England not being available.
    As the Life Table represents a population, continuing the same in
constitution from year to year, the columns sy, s'y, and s"y, show the
annual number of children born to women of the several ages and
classes ; and the total births of live-born children in a year are
I,450,910, of which 55,381 are of illegitimate children.
    By means of simple formulas, the nnmber of children born in or
out of wedlock, to any given number of women at a specified age, can
 be deduced.      1,000 wives aged 20 bear 401 children, while 1,000
unmarried women of this age bear 11 children ; at age 30, 1,000
women of each class bear 337 and 29 children ; at age 40, 210 and 10
children respectively are born of married and unmarried women.
II. - A    Note on Protagon." By ARTHUR Gamgee, M.D., F.R.S.,
       Brackenbury Professor of Physiology in Owens College,
       Manchester.        Received      January  19, 1880.
    In 1879, in conjunction with Dr. Ernst Blankenhorn, communi    I
cated to the Royal Society a paper entitled " On the Existence of
Liebreich's Protagon in the Brain." *
    In that paper we sought to establish the existence of the body
 which had been described by Dr. Liebreich, but which had by several
writers been considered to be a mixture of lecithin and cerebrin.           We
gave many analyses of several samples of protagon, and pointed out
the constancy in the composition of the body when subjected to re
 peated crystallization from alcohol.         I  have since the date of the
above paper, in conjunction with Herr Adolf Spiegel and Mr. Leopold
 Larmuth, continued my examination of protagon, and of certain
bodies which accompany it. Our researches, which are not yet in a
sufficiently advanced state for publication, have in the fullest degree
confirmed the conclusions arrived at by the research of which the
results have already been submitted to the Society.
    The object of the present communication is to notice certain of the
statements which have lately been published by J. L. W". Thudichum,
M.D.,t to the effect that protagon is an impure body consisting of a
mixture of many organic substances, and containing in particular
considerable quantities of potassium.

 searches,    " were already several years ago extended to the product
t2rmed 'protagon'; and this, too, was found to contain inorganic
 constituents      irremovable by recrystallization from alcohol, however
 frequently repeated.        It was found more particularly that ' protagon '
 and the bodies into which it can be separated, according to my re
 searches, always retain considerable quantities of potassium in com
 bination.      As the quantity of inorganic ingredients in ' protagon '
had never been estimated, I prepared a specimen of this matter, and
on analysis found it to contain the better part of 1 per cent, of in
organic incombustible matter, phosphoric acid not included, and in this
no less than 0'7b' per cent, of the ''protagon of potassium." *

     Having described various experiments in which the above impure
lx)dy is supposed to have been resolved into bodies which Dr.
Thudichum has elsewhere described as proximate principles of the
brain, he proceeds : " The foregoing data enable us to attribute their
proper value to the series of operations by which the advocates of
 1            '
   protagon      have brought about the concordance of their analyses.
The potassium, which, though present in such quantity that if ' pro
         '
tagon were a unitary body its atomic weight would thereby be fixed,
they have not found, is calculated as oxygen ; the phosphate of lime
which they have not extracted, is made to increase the protagoual
phosphorus ; the mixture of the myelins, which they have not extracted,
and which they are unable to diagnose, is adjusted by solvents to a
convenient quantity, and made to represent the constituent phosphorus
of protagon                                   The uniform chemical composition
of the brain greatly favours the obtaining from it, by the aid of
processes nearly akin to trimming, of extracts of uniform composi
tion ; this uniformity can be greatly aided by limitations of the
quantities of materials operated upon, and of the quantities and
strengths of the solvents ; and by careful observance of these limita
tions, preparations are obtained which present a delusive appearance
of definiteness.        But this delusion could only be persevered in bv
persons who are not in the habit of subjecting their products to
tests of purity, and who are not acquainted with the necessity, which
is imposed upon every conscientious inquirer, of questioning his pro
ducts and conclusions in a sense adverse to his hypotheses."
    After reading the above remarks,            I determined upon placing in the

might be supposed that by "076 per cent, of the 'protagon' of potassium" he did
not mean 076 per cent, of potassium, but much smaller quantities.             Lest there
should be any doubt on this point it is necessary to quote the following passage, in
which the statement iB repeated in plainer terms : — " The remuining 30 grms. of
protagon once retry stalliscd (product N 12) contained 1-057 per cent, of phosphorus

   The object of the present paper is to determine the currents which
are induced in an infinite plate of uniform conductivity and finite
thickness, and in a sphere or spherical shell of any thickness when in
the presence of a varying magnetic system : and in any of these
bodies when rotating near a constant magnetic system, round an axis
which is normal to the faces of the plate or passes through the centre

been made the subject of a paper by the late ProfessorClerk Maxwell,
in the "Proceedings of the Royal Society," vol. ix (1872), and
JochmaDn has also treated the case of a rotating sphere when the
inducing magnetism is symmetrical about the axis of rotation, and
that of a rotating plate when the mntual induction of the currents
is neglected.  In the present paper the problems are dealt with
generally.
   Maxwell's equations of the field are adopted, and the peculiar view
which he takes of the electric current renders it necessary to enter
with some detail into the general boundary conditions.         These are
given, first of all, for two substances at rest, which possess both con
ductivity and specific dielectric capacity : we can then deduce the
conditions to be satisfied at the common surface of a conductor                                            and     a
dielectric.
      Let F, G, H be the components, at any point just inside the
surface of the conductor, of the vector potential due to all the currents
and magnets in the field, JF the component along the normal (N)
to the surface, measured outward from the conductor, ^ the electric
potential ; and let F', G', H' be the components of the vector potential
just outside, the boundary conditions are

      When dF=0,       as   in the      in the paper, it is shown that

  110     Induction   of Electric Currents in Infinite Plates.          [Jan.   29,
    When the shell is infinitely thin, the action of the induced          currents
 is expressed by the following statement, which, it will be seen, is an
 extension of Maxwell's result for a plane sheet. Divide the time into
 an infinite number of equal intervals, and at the commencement of
 any of these let a positive image of the external system be formed at
the place occupied by its electric image at the surface.             Let the parts
of this image move towards the centre            in   straight lines, so that the
logarithmic decrement of their distances from the centre is constant
and equal to     -R—    (R being the resistance of the shell and a its
radius), and let the intensity of the image increase at each point with
                                 R
a constant logarithmic rate              At the end of the interval let an
                                4-n-a
exactly equal but negative image be formed in the place of the former
and move toward the centre in the same manner, and let these opera
tions be repeated at the beginning and end of every interval: the
action of the sheet on external points will be that due to the above
train of images.

    When the oonductor rotates uniformly about an axis of symmetry
the currents will become, after a time, steady.             In the case of an infi
nite plate of finite thickness, the vector potential and currents will have
the same general forms as before, but the electric potential will not be
ssero.  The solution is now expressed by taking

IV. "     On the Physical Constants                  of Liquid Hydrochloric Acid."
         By Gerrard Ansdell, F.C.S., Chemical Assistant at the
         Royal Institution. Communicated by Professor Dewar,
         F.R.S.   Received           January        22, 1880.
    In  paper read before the Royal Society, on June 18th, 1879,
         a                                                                                     I
described the results of some experiments made with liquid acetylene,
obtained     by compressing           the gas in one of M. Cailletet's ingenious

  118                      Mr. G. Ansdell on       the               [Jan. 29,
 pumps for the liquefaction of gases.        The tensions of the saturated
 vapour    then  obtained  were   so  entirely  different from M. Cailletet's
 results, that it appeared to me to be possibly due to a slight impurity
 in the  gas, probably a trace of mono-bromethylene       which always occurs
 in the red copper      compound     of acetylene, and is very difficult to
 completely eliminate.
    I  therefore prepared a quantity of the silver compound (which can
 be obtained entirely free from mono-bromethylene)           by passing acety
 lene prepared in the same way as formerly, viz., by the action of
 alcoholic potash on di-bromethylene, into an ammoniacal solution of
 nitrate of silver.
    On filling several tubes with acetylene generated by the action of
 hydrochloric acid on this compound, the tensions were found to be
 exactly the same as those obtained with the acetylene made from the
 copper compound, thus proving the correctness of the former experi
 ments.
    As the Cailletet pump is so well adapted to the examination of
 gases in their liquid state, and is at the same time so easily managed,
it appeared interesting     to determine the physical constants of some
other gases, and Professor Dewar suggested an examination of the
 halogen acids, with regard to their physical relations to each other,
 more especially as wo have absolutely no reliable knowledge as to
these numbers.
    Faraday was the first to liquefy hydrochloric acid gas in 1823, and
he subsequently,    in 1848, made a series of determinations of the vapour
tensions of the liquid at different temperatures.            He also liquefied
hydrobromic      and  hydriodic  acids, but   gives   no account of their pro
perties in a liquid state.         Gore (" Proc. Roy. Soc," vol. xiv),
examined very carefully the chemical properties of liquid hydrochloric
acid, its solvent action, &c, but made no determinations                of its
physical constants.
    Hydrochloric acid is the only one    I have as   yet had time to examine,
with the following results : —
    The gas was made by the action of strong sulphuric acid on dry
chloride of ammonium, being afterwards freed from sulphuric acid
and dried before entering the tubes.         It was found of no advantage
to continue the stream of gas for more than six hours, as a constant
minimum of air always remained in the tube at the end of this time
(about 5a()-th of the total volume of the tube) which it appeared utterly
impossible to remove.
   The pump was used in the same           way as described in my former
paper, two' iron reservoirs     being used, one containing the air mano
meter, and the other the tube with the gas to be liquefied.
   Apart from the mere determination of the vapour tensions, densi
ties, &c, the ratio of the volume of saturated vapour to that of the

1880.]     Physical Constants      of Liquid Hydrochloric Acid.       119
liquid was considered of the highest importance, as from these num
bers the latent heat of transformation       and other important data can
be easily  calculatpd.      For these reasons the gas was examined in
rather  a different  way to the acetylene, the volume to which it had
been compressed at the point of liquefaction (or the volume of the
saturated vapour) at any given temperature being first accurately
determined, and then the pressure increased until the condensed
liquid entirely filled the upper part of the tube. The volume of this
liquid column was then measured, so that a comparison between the
volume of the saturated vapour and the volume of the total condensed
liquid was obtained at each temperature.
   This fractional volume of the gas at the point of liquefaction was
determined by observing when the air manometer ceased to show an
increase of pressure on compressing the gas ; the volume of the gas
at this point being then measured, and the pressure being then
gradually released until the air manometer showed a slight decrease
of pressure, — the volume of the gas was then again measured at this
point, and the mean taken       as the  point of liquefaction.
   The results of the whole series of experiments are recorded in        a
condensed form in the following table : —

    In this table
    A = temperature of gas.
    B= volume of the saturated   vapour at point of liquefaction.
    C=fractional volume of the gas at point of liquefaction iu relation
 to the initial volume under one atmosphere of pressure.
    D=volume of the condensed liquid.
    E= ratio of volume of gas to that of the liquid.
    F= pressure in atmosphere.
The critical point was found to be hV'^h C.
   It will be seen from this table, that the volumes of the saturated
vapours and liquid gradually approach each other as the temperature
nears the critical point, and would undoubtedly become identical, if
the experiments could be carried on up to the critical point. The
following curves, the first of which represents the change of volume
of the saturated vapour and liquid, in relation to the temperature ;
and the second the ratio between these volumes in relation to the
temperature (column B in the table) show these results in a graphical
form.
                                   Curves.
   The ratio between the volume of the saturated vapour and the
volume of the liquid at different temperatures decreases very regularly
until within about three degrees of the critical point, where a singular
point in the curve occurs, and the ratio approaches unity with great
rapidity. The volume of the liquid increases very regularly up to a
 temperature of about 48° C, and at 51° C, or within 0*25 of a degree
of the critical point, the distinction between the saturated vapour and
the liquid vanishes, as although liquid is plainly seen to condense on
the surface of the mercury, on increasing the pressure the line of
 demarcation immediately disappears, and it is impossible to say whether
the tube is filled with the saturated vapour or the liquid itself; there
fore no results could be obtained nearer the critical point than about
a fourth of a degree.
    Avenarius, in a paper intitled    " The Causes which determine the
 Critical Point" ("Mem. Acad. Sci. St. Petersbourg," 1876-77), made
 a number    of experiments on ether, and came to the conclusion that the
 volumes of the saturated vapour and of the condensed liquid at the
critical point were not identical.    He was under the disadvantage of
working at a very high temperature, the critical point of ether being
192°'6 C., which must have been very difficult to keep fixed within
half a degree.
   My own experiments, which were carried out at a very much lower
temperature, and were consequently capable of greater accuracy, on
account of the facility with which the temperature could be kept con
stant to within j^th of a degree, appear to confirm his results, in so far

 as  it is evidently impossible to measure the relative volume of fluid
 and gas within less than a fourth of a degree of the critical point,
 and at this place the volumes are certainly unequal.                   This, however,
 does not disprove their identity as the critical point.
    The density of the liquid at different temperatures was determined
in the same way as described in my former paper, and gave the
following numbers : —
               Temperature.                                     Density.

                  22-7                                            -808

    This liquid has therefore not quite such a high density as liquid car
bonic acid, which is 0 95 at 0° C, and is about twice as high as acety
lene, which is 0'450 at the same temperature.              It is interesting to note
that acetylene is the lightest known fluid substance.                 On referring to
the density of liquid, hydrochloric acid given by other authors, Pro
fessors Roscoe and Schorlemmer, in their recent treatise on chemistry,
describe    it  as a colourless      liquid having a specific gravity of about
l-27.    As this value is     so   much higher than that obtained by myself,
and as    I  feel confident of the accuracy of my results, it seems evident
that a mistake has in some way arisen, and that the value given by
them refers to the density of the gaseous acid with reference to air,
and not to the liquefied        gas.    Unfortunately Faraday does not seem to
have    determined     its density.
    Experiments made to determine the coefficients of compressibility of
the fluid at different temperatures were carried on in the same way as
formerly detailed.        The following     are the chief results : —
  Mean coefficients of compression at different temperatures.                 Range

" A Magnetic Survey of the Fortieth Parallel in North America
       between the Atlantic Ocean and the Great Salt Lake,
       Utah."     By T. E. Thorpe, Ph.D., F.R.S.                 Received
       March 25 : Read May 1, 1879.
    A glance at the maps which accompany Sir Edward Sabine's
" Contributions to Terrestrial Magnetism," published at various times
in the " Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society," is sufficient
to show that considerable as is our knowledge of the magnetic history
of our globe, there are still very large areas of the earth's surface
about which we have practically no information.          A remarkable in
stance of this fact is afforded by the case of the North American Con
tinent, more especially by that portion belonging to the United States.
Magnetic observations have been made, with more or less assiduity, at
different places in the Eastern States, for many years past ; but over
the immense tract of country lying between the Mississippi and the
Pacific Ocean — a tract comprising upwards of 200,000 square miles,
there is only a single determination of one of the three magnetic ele
ments indicated on Sir E. Sabine's maps, viz., a determination           of
declination at Salt Lake City. A series of observations was made
some years since by United States officers along the Mexican frontier,
and a similar series was carried out by the English and American
officers employed on the North American Boundary Commission.
But the latter observations,    I believe, have not yet been published.
    My attention  was  first drawn  to this matter by my friend Mr. G. M.
Whipple, the Superintendent of the Kew Observatory, in the course
 of some conversation respecting a journey to Western America which
1 contemplated making in order to observe the total solar eclipse of
 last July.   As my station was to be in the State of Colorado, which
 is practically midway between the northern and southern boundaries
 along which the observations above referred to had been made, it
 seemed to Mr. Whipple advisable to seize the opportunity to add to
 our magnetical knowledge of the intervening area to the extent even
 of securing observations on a single spot only.     Further consideration
 showed that the project might be extended with advantage, and ac
            I
 cordingly offered to make a complete series of observations of the
 three elements — dip, intensity, and declination, at such times and
 places as the circumstances of travel would allow.         The Kew Com
 mittee kindly offered me the loan of the instruments which the Rev.
 S. J. Perry had employed in Kerguelen's Land and in other places on
 the occasion of the recent Transit of Venus Expedition ; at the same
 time Professor Balfour Stewart generously undertook to use his in
 fluence with the Council of the Owens College to obtain for me the
 admirable magnetic equipment belonging to that institution.          After

              A Magnetic Survey    of the Fortieth Parallel.            133
some experience with both sets of instruments,    I decided to accept those
belonging to the Owens College, partly because they were of more
modern construction than the others, being furnished with certain
contrivances and improved modes of adjustment, suggested by Dr.
Stewart's extensive experience, which made them more convenient to
use, whilst they materially added to the trustworthiness of their indi
cations ; and partly (which was of great importance) because the in
strumental constants had been comparatively recently determined and
verified by Mr. Whipple.      The Owens College instruments consisted
of a dip-circle by Dover, No. 6 ; a unifilar magnetometer by Elliott
Brothers, No. 27 ; and a marine chronometer by Frodsham, No. 4066.
I would here record my sense of obligation to Professor Stewart and the
Council of the Owens College for the readiness with which they placed
their instruments at my disposal.     My thanks are also due to the Kew
authorities for the loan of a couple of tripods. I am specially indebted
to Mr. Whipple and to Mr. Figg, the Magnetic Assistant at the Kew
Observatory, for instruction in the use of the instruments, for advice
in the conduct of the observations, and for assistance in their sub
sequent reduction.
    In addition to the ordinary magnetic instruments,      I provided my
self with an excellent 7-inch sextant by Casella, a couple of artificial
horizons, some spare thermometers, an aneroid for altitudes up to
5,000 feet, and a hypsometric apparatus for greater elevations.         The
fortunate circumstance that I was accompanied by Dr. Schuster has
added, in no small degree, to the completeness of the work ; for that
gentleman, being provided with one of Pistor and Martin's small
prismatic circles, and being very expert in its nee, kindly offered to
take charge of the observations for time and latitude throughout the
journey. It is in great measure due to this assistance that         I  have
been able to develope the original intention into what may be con
sidered as practically a magnetic survey of the fortieth parallel across
the American Continent, that is to say, of the district which lies mid
way between the lino of observations already run along the northern
and southern boundaries of the United States territory.
    The observations were begun at Kew, which was adopted as a base
station, and were resumed on the other side of the Atlantic, at New
Haven, Connecticut.     Determinations wore next made at La Junta in
 South Colorado, the eclipse station selected by Professor Asaph Hall,
of the United States Naval Observatory ; afterwards at Manitou, at
the base of Pike's Peak ; at Denver, and at Cheyenne in Wyoming.
No further observations were made until we arrived at Salt Lake City,
where, thanks to the kindness of President Taylor, we were permitted
 to make a complete series in an excellent spot in a garden to the side
 of the late President Toung's house. The transit instrument, by
 Wurdermann, of Washington, belonging to the Community, which is

134                         Dr. T. E. Thorpe.
mounted     in the rear of the Tabernacle, was also placed at our dis
posal  ; and  we had an opportunity of comparing our chronometers
with an instrument (Dent, 2392) which is regularly rated from
transit observations made by Mr. Anderson, of the President's Office.
Our next station was Ogden, in Northern Utah, at the observatory
directed by Lieutenant Wheeler, of the United States Engineers, and
on the spot selected by the French astronomers for their observations
of the recent Transit of Mercury. The observatory was then in charge
of Professor Truman Safford, of Williams College, who also rated our
chronometers and otherwise did all in his power to facilitate our work.
The next stations were Green River in Wyoming, Grand Island in
Nebraska, Council Bluffs in Iowa, Chicago, Allegheny, and Wash
ington.    Washington is one of the best observed stations in the
States.    Mr. Schott, of the United States Coast Survey Department,
who is well known as a leading magnetician in America, has here
made regular determinations in An observatory in the neighbourhood
of the Capitol Hill for many years past, and these he has tabulated
and discussed in various publications issued by the Coast Survey
authorities.    My object in selecting Washington was to obtain an in
dependent check on the indications of my instruments.        Mr. Schott
was kind enough to allow me to set up my instruments in his obser
vatory, and to afford me such assistance and information as I needed.
   I learned that the Coast Survey Department is gradually accumu
lating data for a discussion of the magnetic history of the continent.
It has already published a map of declination for 1870, from which it
is evident that much has been done in the determination of this par
ticular element since the date of Sir Edward Sabine's " Memoirs,"
more especially along the Pacific slope and in the regions to the west
and south-west of the Great Salt Lake. As yet, however, no obser
vations have been published relating to any of the districts west of
the Mississippi that we visited.
   The geographical positions of the several stations, their altitudes
above the sea-level, the geological character of the district in which
they are situated, together with such details of the exact sites as may
be necessary for their identification, are given in Table I.    For the
greater part of the geological information I am indebted to my col
league, Professor A. H. Green ; the rest I owe to the kindness of
 General Humphreys, Chief of the United States Engineers, who sup
plied me with the beautiful geological and topographical atlas accom
panying Mr. Clarence King's Report of the Geological Exploration of
the Fortieth Parallel.

local magnetism in the circle.                " British Association Reports,"
                                        (See
Aberdeen,      1859.)    After a number of trials with both circles,              I
decided to make use of the one belonging to Owens College (the
Dover circle), principally for the reason that the method of lifting
the needles in that instrument seemed to afford more concordant
results than that adopted in the other.              The Dover circle was pro
vided with two needles of the ordinary form, each 3 5 inches long and
0'27 inch in maximum breadth.
    In order to preserve them from rust during the sea-voyage, the
needles were carefully wrapped in gutta-percha tissue and placed in a
small box filled with soda-lime.           This method of preservation was
found to be perfectly efficacious : at no time during the journey was
the slightest trace of oxidation discernible under the magnifying
glass.
    The mode of observing was that described by Mr. Welsh in the
 " Admiralty Manual of Scientific Inquiry," 3rd edition, 1859. Eight
readings of the vertical needle gave the magnetic prime vertical.
 The circle was then turned so that the needle could oscillate in the
 magnetic meridian.        Sets of readings were taken with the face of the
 circle first east and then west, the face of the needle being towards
 the face of the instrument; the needle was then reversed on its
 bearings and again read east and west : afterwards its polarity was
 reversed by stroking with the bar-magnets and both series of readings
 were repeated.       The needle was raised and lowered several times
 between each set of readings ; these were in all cases repeated, and if
 a difference of more than 3' was observed, a fresh set was taken.
     A comparison, made at Kew, between the Dover circle and the
 instrument employed in the monthly observations regularly carried on
 at that observatory, afforded the following results : —

    Only    a single complete set             of observations          with needle    1  could be
taken at Greeu River.              This was just concluded when a                     sudden and
violent wind-storm, which filled the air with dust and nearly upset the
tripods, put an end to the work. In the absence of the requisite data
it is scarcely possible to attempt to correct the foregoing numbers for
secular variation, even if that should be thought necessary; the time
occupied by the survey was hardly long enough to affect the results to
any appreciable extent. We may, therefore, safely take 1878-7 as the
epoch of all the observations.
    Of the thirteen stations named in the foregoing table, New Haven,
Washington, Allegheny, and Chicago alone would seem to afford data
for a discussion of the yearly rate of change in the inclination ; these
four towns (if we may consider Pittsburg and Allegheny, which are
merely separated by the Monongahela River, as practically identical)
are the only ones included in the long list given by Sir Edward
Sabine for the epoch 1842-5.                          (Contributions to Terrestrial Mag

   No certain conclusion, however, can be drawn from these numbers
respecting the extent of the secular change in this element, since, as
Mr. Schott's observations at Washington have shown, the dip at that
place  was   on  the  increase   at the epoch 18425, and attained a
maximum about 1854 8. Doubtless a similar increase occurred at
New Haven and Pittsburg (Allegheny) and probably a maximum
was also reached at these places at about the same period.          The result
for Chicago seems exceptional ; I am hardly inclined to regard it as
due to an error in the determination of the dip at the epoch 1842 5,
on account of the number and fairly concordant character of the
observations, which were all made at about the time of the first epoch
by different observers.     These are —

   My own results agree perfectly among themselves         : they were taken
under favourable circumstances, and so far as I           could learn from
Professor Colbert, the Director of the Dearborn Observatory — there
was nothing in the spot selected for the observations — an open space
in the grounds of the University of Chicago — which could at all
interfere with the proper direction of the needle.        Whether Chicago
is affected by any strong local disturbance I am unable to say : the
geological character of the district affords no evidence on this point.
   In an Appendix to the " United States Coast Survey Report for
1870," Mr. Schott has discussed the secular changes in the declina
tion, dip, and intensity of the magnetic force at Washington. The
observations of inclination, which extend over a period of nearly forty
years, may be represented by the expression       —
        I=71°'335 -0-000229       (i-1855-0)-0-000640        (*-1855)«

which, as the accompanying comparisons            show, gives results closely
accordant with the observed values.

   This formula, although perfectly applicable between the intervals

no                             Dr. T. E. Thorpe.
for which it was originally calculated, no longer accords with the ob
servations of the present epoch.        On June 15, 1878, Mr. Schott found
the magnetic dip, at his observatory, to be 70°"80: my own observa
tions at the same place, three months later, made it 70"-78 ; the value
calculated from the above formula is 70°-57, or 14' less than the mean
of our observations, an amount far in excess of the error of the ob
servation.     It is not at all improbable, as indeed Mr. Schott has already
remarked,     that although on the whole the dip is decreasing at
Washington there are subordinate periods of comparatively short
duration during which an increase occurs, the former rate of diminu
tion being afterwards re-established.          Inequalities of the same kind,
although by no means of the same extent, have also been traced in the
observations of inclination made at Toronto and Kew by Sir Edward
 Sabine and Dr. Balfour Stewart (Sabine, " Phil. Trans., 1863 ;
                                                                             "

between the magnetic moment of the magnet employed and the hori

 readily find the vertical component V from the formula : —

    According to Mr. Schott, the horizontal force at Washington has
 been steadily increasing since 1853'5. From observations made since
 1842-5, he finds that the value of this element may be represented by
 the formula
          X=   4-270 + 0-00084        (t- 1855     0) +0-000248         (f-18550)2.

               A  Magnetic Survey  of the Fortieth Parallel.           145
   For the present epoch the calculated value is 4-4292. My deter
minations gave 4-3608, in close accordance with Mr. Schott's observa-
vation made on June 15, 1878, of 4 366.       The difference between the
observed and computed values affords further evidence of the fact
pointed out by Mr. Schott, that the secular changes in the neighbour
hood of Washington are of a mixed progressive, and periodic
character.    The divergences exhibited both in this case and in that of
the dip, further show how very unsafe it is to employ numerical
formulae of this kind beyond the limits of the time within which tho
observations upon which they are based are comprised.
                               Declination.
   The unifilar magnetometer was provided with a mirror and hori
zontal telescope in accordance with the plan first proposed by Dr.
Lloyd in the " Proceedings of the Koyal Irish Academy " for 1858 ;
hence the observations could be carried out in the manner described
by Mr. Welsh in the
                        " Admiralty Manual of Scientific
                                                           Inquiry."
   As a rule, six readings of the position of the magnet were taken ;
three of these were with the scale erect and three with the scale
inverted : at Cheyenne, however, owing to lack of time, only four
observations    were possible.
   Care was always taken that the transit-mirror was in adjustment
before commencing the observations.         The operation of adjustment
for collimation-error was greatly facilitated by a neat contrivance
which Dr. Balfour Stewart had caused to be introduced in the origi
nal construction of the instrument. In order to eliminate any error
which might arise from the plane of the mirror not being parallel to
its axis, the observations were always made first with the mirror in its
normal position and then after reversal on its bearings.         Care, too,
was always taken to remove, as far as practicable, all torsion from the
suspending thread.      When time permitted, the magnet was replaced
by a torsion-plummet of equal weight, the position of which was
noted after an interval of an hour or so, a suitable correction being
applied to the original observation if it were found that any torsion
still remained in the thread.
   As the correct determination of the sun's azimuth was mainly
dependent upon an accurate knowledge of local time, every oppor
tunity was taken to ascertain the errors and rates of the chronometers
employed.     In order to guard against the possible accidents of travel
over a country so rough and difficult as that of many parts of Western
America,    I  provided myself with three of these instruments.       That
lent to me by Dr. Stewart was a large-sized marine chronometer, by
Frodsham, No. 4,066 ; in addition,   I  hired a pocket instrument from
the same makers, No. 5,674, which had behaved well as a " hack "
chronometer for some months previously : this was always carried

                                                                           well-finished,
his horological skill and knowledge ; it was a remarkably
instrument by Kuhlberg, No. 2,918, and was specially compensated,
for fluctuations of temperature.                    The Owens College instrument,
however, went so well throughout the entire journey that I used                              it
exclusively, relying on the others mainly for comparisons.                    At several
of the stations, viz., at Ogden, Chicago, Allegheny, and Washington
I  was able, thanks to the Directors of the observatories at those

places, to make comparisons with standard instruments ;
the errors and rates were furnished to me by Professor                   Hall  ; on other
 occasions     I   obtained the time from Dr. Schuster's observations.

   I  have not attempted to correct these results for diurnal range.
Accurate observations of daily change have been made at Philadelphia,
Washington, and Key West in Florida, and on the assumption that
the range of the daily variation is inversely proportional to the hori
zontal force, the data derived from these observations may perhaps be
considered as fairly applicable to any place in the United States. But
such corrections are at best very unsatisfactory, as the epochs of the
extreme positions are subject to very great fluctuations on account of
disturbances : these are usually most prevalent at about the time at
¦which   my observations were made, viz., August and September.                          The
magnet, however, was always quiet during the time of observation ;
hence the correction due to diurnal range would seldom exceed 3' or 4'.
    Observations of declination have been made in the district of
Columbia, in which Washington is situated, from as far back as 1792.
These have been collected and discussed by Mr. Schott in the memoir
above referred to, and represented by him by the formula —
    (I.)                 D=lo79 + l°-90           sin   (l-5n-249 l),
in which n is the number of years since 1830, and D the declination,
 + when west, expressed in degrees.
    The annual variation v was given by the formula —
    (II.)                «=2'-985 sin (V5»+66°).
 The preceding formula gives the value of the declination for 1870 as
 2° 54', and for 1880 as 3° 16'.              The observed declination, however,
 already considerably exceeds the latter value.                   Mr. Schott informs me
 that an observation made on June 15, 1878, gave 3° 47' ; my own

              A  Magnetic Survey        of  the  Fortieth Parallel.               149
determination on September 8, 1878, was 33 42'85 (uncorrected for
diurnal range).
   In a later publication " On the Secular Change of the Magnetic
Declination in the United States and other parts of North America "
(United States Coast Survey Report for 1874, Appendix No. 8), Mr.
Schott adopts the formula
                    D=l°-79 + l°-90 sin (l-5m+5°-9),
where m is the number         of years and fraction of a year since 1850 ;
but this expression also affords lower values than those actually ob
served.    The value for 1880, for example, is given as 3° 15''6, and for
1870 as 2" 54'. Mr. Schott has also discussed (loc. cit.) the various
observations    made at New Haven, Connecticut,                  since 1761, and
has represented them by the expression
                   D=+      7  83 +316 sin      (l-4m-21°-6),
where    m  has the same      signification as in the last formula. The
annual change is     at.  present about 4'-3.       This would give for 1878'6
the value 8° 45', which agrees very closely with that actually observed.

   Since sending in the foregoing communication         to the Society,  I
have received the following letter from Mr. C.        A. Schott, of the
United States Coast Survey Department, respecting the inadequacy
of the formula published in the Report of 1870, as representing the
values of the magnetic elements at the present time.
   It will be noticed that Mr. Schott confirms my observations on this
point ; and by permission of the Superintendent of the Survey, he sends
amended      formula for dip, declination and horizontal force which
represent with sufficient accuracy both series of observations, viz., his
made in June, and mine made in September, 1878.

My Dear Sir,
   I hasten to reply to yours of March 13, respecting magnetic obser
vations in this city. The formulae in the 1870 Report undoubtedly fail
to represent adequately our late observations, a contingency which was
referred to in the concluding paragraph of that report : " They should
not   be used much    beyond the time for which they are supported by
observations."     There is nothing unusual going on in the behaviour
of terrestrial magnetism in this locality, and the dip and intensity
formula may be easily amended to represent our observations, but in
regard to the declination there is a disturbing element introduced,
viz. : the change of station in 1876, which developed a local difference
of 20' as near as   I  can judge ; whether the old or new place is the
more normal one I cannot say. There is apparently no difference in
dip and intensity. Considering the dissimilarity of the instruments
used our observations agreo well, indeed they accord within the daily
variations of the magnetic force.        By permission of the Superin
tendent of the Survey,    I  enclose the latest formulas for declination,
dip, and intensity in this place, as well as my observations of last year ;
they are   : —
   The magnetic dip observed at Washington between 1839 and 1879
can be represented    by the formula —
       I=71°-335-0000229(i-1855-0) -0-000640 (<-1855-0)2
                                           -0-0000140 (<-1855-0)s,
which will leave no greater differences than those given by the old
formula. (Report of 1870.) The magnetic horizontal intensity ob
served between 1842 and 1879 is represented by
          H=4-270+0-00084(f-1855-0)        + 0-000130(<-1855-0)2,

                A  Magnetic Survey   of the Fortieth Parallel.                     151
•which    will leave differences of about the same character                as   those
given by the old formula.
    The very nature of these functions precludes them from answering
for any length of time, and as soon as the case becomes ripe,                  I  shall
substitute harmonic functions.
    The following is an improved formula for the declination at
Washington, prepared for a new edition of the paper in the 1874
Report :
                      D=+2°19 + 2°-22 sin {Vim,-6° G),
it   represents the observations      between 1792 and 1879; m—t —
1850-0.
    These observations are difficult to manage on account of con
siderable    local deflection in this vicinity produced       by iron (bog-ore)
which in many places crops out to the surface.
    Our observations compare as follows :

    In            " On the Spectra of Metalloids "
       a memoir                                        (" Nova Acta Reg.
Soc. Upsal.," ser. iii, vol. ix), Angstrom and Thalen have made a
careful analysis of the different spectra assigned to carbon.        They
distinguish four sets of groups of shaded bands produced under dif
ferent circumstances, which they define, besides the line spectrum
which they ascribe to carbon itself. Of these four sets of bands, two
sets, situated at the extremities of the spectrum, they show to be
produced in the combustion of cyanogen, a third to be common to all
the hydrocarbons, and the fourth to be produced by carbonic oxide.
The first two sets, the third, and the fourth sets respectively, they
observed to be produced also in the electric discharge between carbon
electrodes according as it took place in nitrogen, hydrogen, or oxygen.
Their observations on this subject appear to us almost conclusive.
Nevertheless, other observers have, since their publication, maintained
different opinions.
    The spectrum of hydrocarbons burning in air has been repeatedly
described : first by Swan in 1856, and afterwards by Attfield, Watts,
Morren, Pliicker, Boisbaudran and others, and has been given in
detail by Piazzi Smyth (" End on Illumination in Private Spectro
scopy ").     The characteristic part of this spectrum consists of four
groups of bands of fine lines in the orange, yellow, green, and blue
respectively,   and we refer hereafter to these as the hydrocarbon
bands.     These four groups, according to Pliicker and Hittorf, also
constitute the spectrum of the discharge of an induction coil in an
atmosphere of hydrogen between carbon electrodes.            They are also
conspicuous in the electric discharge in defiant gas at the atmo
spheric and at reduced pressures.
    The descriptions of the other less conspicuous parts of the spectrum

notices, besides the four hydrocarbon bands, only two hazy bands in
the indigo.   Watts (" Phil. Mag.," 1869 and 1871) and Piazzi Smyth
give the same two bands somewhat wider, and resolved into a series
of fine lines. These two observers are in substantial agreement about
this part of the spectrum, but Piazzi Smyth notices in addition a
faint haze      in the red below C.
  Pliicker       and Hittorf notice the entire absence in the flame of
olefiant     gas of the two bright groups of lines (blue and violet as
described      below) characteristic of the flame of cyanogen, and the
presence     of a series of dark      bines on a    violet background in   a position
intermediate       between those      of the two cyanogen groups.          A similar
description is given by Morren ("Ann. Ch. et Phys.," Mars, 1865).
Neither of these observers notices the two hazy bands above-mentioned.
The descriptions given by these authors of this series of dark lines
appear to relate to something not seen by the other observers.  They
resemble in some respects the description of the corresponding part of
the spectrum of the electric discharge in vapour of sulphur, and we
think it highly probable that these lines were due to some compound
of sulphur derived from the sulphuric acid employed in preparing the
gas.
  Several observers also have described               the spectrum of the flame of
burning cyanogen.  Faraday,            as    long ago as 1829, called the attention
of Herschel and Fox Talbot to           it,    and the latter, writing of his obser
vations    Phil. Mag.,"ser. iii, vol. iv, p. 114), points out as peculiarity
           ("                                                         a

 instead of air, they state that an ultra-violet group of three fluted
bands appeared.      They notice also certain red bands with shading in
the reverse   direction, -which are better seen when the flame is fed with
air than with oxygen.      Other observers give similar accounts, noticing
the brilliance of the two series of bands in the blue and violet above
mentioned,    and that they are seen equally in the electric discharge
through cyanogen.       All do not notice the ultra-violet group, but this-
is no doubt owing to the absorption of these rays by the prisms
employed, for photographs which we have taken of the spectrum of
the cyanogen flame in air show this group strongly developed.
    These three bright groups of bands of fine lines are as characteristic
of the flame of cyanogen and of the spark in that gas, as the four
hydrocarbon bands are of the flame of hydrocarbons.
    The flame of carbonic oxide shows nothing but a continuous spec
trum. The series of bands seen in the spark in an oxide of carbon
are well known, and there is not, so far as we know, any dispute about
them.     The brightest of them appears to have been seen by some
observers in the flame produced by the combustion of other compounds
of carbon.
    The contention of Angstrom and Thalen is that the channelled
spectra of the hydrocarbon and cyanogen flames are the spectra of
acetylene and cyanogen, and not of carbon itself, and that in the
flame of burning cyanogen we sometimes see the spectrum of the
 hydrocarbon superposed on that of the cyanogen, the latter being the
brighter ; and that in vacuum tubes containing hydrocarbons the
cyanogen spectrum observed is due to traces of nitrogen.
    No chemist who remembers the extreme sensibility of the spectro
 scopic test, and the difficulty, reaching almost to impossibility, of
 removing from apparatus and material the last traces of air and
 moisture, will feel any surprise at the presence of small quantities of
 either hydrogen or nitrogen in any of the gases experimented on.
     Mr. Lockyer (" Proc. Roy. Soc," vol. xxvii, p. 308) has recently
 obtained a photograph of the arc in chlorine, which shows the series
 of fluted bands in the ultra- violet, on the strength of which he throws
 over the conclusion of Angstrom and Thalen, and draws inferences as
 to the existence of carbon vapour above the chromosphere in the
 coronal atmosphere of the sun, which, if true, would be contrary to
 all we know of the properties of carbon.       We cannot help thinking
 that these bands were due to the presence of a small quantity of
 nitrogen.
     Our faith in the conclusions      of Angstrom and     Thalen   on this
 subject has been much strengthened by our own observations, which
  we now proceed to describe.

a large part of the metallic impurities present in the commercial

in the indigo (wave-lengths about 4364-5, 437T5, 4381'5), and much
more brightly the six bands in the violet (wave-lengths 4220 to 4158,
Watts) and five ultra-violet (wave-lengths          about 3883'5, 3871,
3862, 3854'5, 3850.)      Besides these bands, lines of iron, calcium,
and sodium were visible.     The arc in this  case was practically taken
in a mixture of nitrogen and carbonic oxide, for in a short time the
oxygen of the air is converted into carbonic oxide, as was shown by
the flame which always filled the globe on stopping the arc for a
second or two.
              Spectrum of the Arc in Carbonic Acid Gas.
   On passing through the globe continuously a current of carbonic
acid gas, the seven bands in the blue, and those in the violet and ultra
violet gradually died out until they ceased to be at all visible con
tinuously, and when now and then momentarily seen were only just
discernible. On the other hand, the hydrocarbon bands, yellow, green,
and blue, came out stronger and were even brilliant.         Lines of iron
and calcium were still   visible.  On  stopping  the  current  of carbonic
acid gas and allowing air to diffuse into the globe, the violet and ultra
violet bands soon began to appear and presently became permanent
and bright, the hydrocarbon bands remaining bright.
                   Spectrum of the Arc in Hydrogen.
   The globe had next a continuous current of dry hydrogen passed
through it. The arc, contrary to what would be expected from the
behaviour of the spark discharge in hydrogen, would not pass through
more than a very short space, very much less than in air or carbonic
acid gas. There was a tolerably bright continuous spectrum, no trace of
the seven bands in the blue, or of those in the violet or ultra-violet, and
no metallic lines, but a fairly bright line in the red, which we identi

fied, by comparison with the spark in a vacuum tube, with the C line
of hydrogen.      The F line, identified in like manner, was also seen as
a faint diffuse band. This last line was in general overpowered by the
continuous spectrum, but was regularly seen, when, from some varia
tion in the discharge, the continuous spectrum became less brilliant.
This was the first occasion on which we had seen the hydrogen lines
in the arc at all, though Secchi (" Compt. Rend.," 1873) states that
he had seen them by the use of moist carbon poles.          We tried to
repeat his experiment, without success. The hydrocarbon bands in the
green and blue were at intervals well seen.      Those in the yellow and
orange were, owing doubtless to the smaller dispersion of the light in
that region, overpowered by the continuous spectrum. Whereas when
air and carbonic acid gas were used, the inside of the globe was
quickly covered with dust from the disintegrated poles, scarcely any,
if any, such dust was thrown off when the arc was passed in hydro
gen.

  Nitrogen was next substituted for the hydrogen.      A longer arc
would now pass, the seven blue, the violet and ultra-violet bands all
came out well, at intervals brilliantly. The green and blue hydro
carbon bands were also well developed.
                        Spectrum of tlie Arc in Chlorine.
   On filling the globe with chlorine and keeping a current of that
gas passing through       it,
                         the arc would not pass through a greater dis
tance than about    millims. No metallic lines were visible.

the violet bands, as well as the green and blue hydrocarbon bands,
were visible, but gradually when the current of chlorine had been
passing for some minutes, there was nothing to be seen but     con  a
tinuous spectrum with the green and blue hydrocarbon bands.
Neither of these bands were strong, and at intervals the blue bands
disappeared   altogether.

oxide and a current of that gas passed through             it,
                                                      the arc would not
pass through any greater space than in chlorine. There was much
continuous spectrum; the yellow, green, and blue hydrocarbon bands
were well seen, some of the seven blue bands were just discernible, the
violet had nearly, and the ultra-violet quite, gone from sight. No
trace of the carbonic oxide bands, as seen in the spark discharge in
that gas, was visible.    This     the more remarkable since under
                                           is
similar circumstances two of the characteristic lines of hydrogen were
seen.

                     Spectrum  of the Arc in Nitric Oxide.
   In this   gas a very long arc could be obtained.          The violet and
ultra- violet  bands  were well  seen, the  seven  blue bands  were seen but
weaker.     The blue and green hydrocarbon bands were also seen well
when the arc was short, not so well when the arc was long.               The
length of the arc did not seem to affect the brightness of the violet
bands.    Many metallic lines of iron, calcium, and magnesium were
seen.
                      Spectrum of the Arc   in Ammonia.
   In ammonia only     a short arc  could be obtained.    All the bands were
faint, but the seven blue, the violet and ultra-violet bands were
always visible.
   These experiments with different gases eliminate to a large extent
the influence of electric conductivity on the character of the spectrum ;
but we intend to examine more thoroughly the effect of this variable
by observation of the arc in some of these gases under different condi
tions of pressure.
                  Spectra of Flames of Carbon Compounds.
   Besides the experiments with the arc above described, we have made
some observations of the spectra of flames of sundry compounds of
carbon.
   In   the  flame of cyanogen, prepared from well dried mercury
cyanide, passed over phosphoric anhydride inserted in the same tube,
and burnt from a platinum jet fused into the end of the tube, we found,
as  Pliicker and Hittorf had found, that the hydrocarbon bands were
almost entirely absent, only the brightest green band was seen, and
that faintly. The seven blue and the violet bands on the other hand
were, as described by other observers, well developed, the three indigo
bands less brightly.     A series of bands at the red end, also described
by Dibbits and by Pliicker and Hittorf, was also visible.              These
bands are sharply defined on the more refrangible side and fade away
on the other side, and extend beyond the orange hydrocarbon bands on
the red side. They have not been seen by us in the spectra of the arc,
but they may very well have been present in some of those spectra and
yet not seen because of the continuous spectrum of the arc, which, not
being very much dispersed at the red end, was bright enough to
overpower any such bands.          This continuous spectrum seems much
stronger when well purified carbon electrodes are used than when they
contain metallic impurities to the extent commonly present in them.
We may remark that in general we see only six bands, or rather six
maxima of light, in the violet series, as stated by Dibbits, not seven, as
stated by Morren and by Pliicker and Hittorf ; and in the ultra-violet
we always see five maxima of light, instead of four as given by

 1880.]     Compounds   of Carbon    vnth Hydrogen and Nitrogen.         159
 Dibbite, and three given by Pliicker and Hittorf. These ultra-violet
 bands are well developed in the flame of cyanogen burning in air and
 are readily photographed,     and easily seen when quartz lenses and
calcite prisms are employed.
    The flame of hydrocyanic acid burning in air showed very much the
same as that of cyanogen.
    In the flame of a mixture of hydrogen and carbon disulphide,
 made by passing purified hydrogen through a tube containing carbon
disulphide so as to be nearly or quite saturated with the vapour, and
 burning it in air, no hydrocarbon bands at all could be detected.
    Nor could any hydrocarbon bands be detected in the flame of a
 mixture of carbonic oxide and hydrogen burnt in air.
    When a mixture of hydrogen with carbon tetrachloride vaponr was
burnt, hydrocarbon bands made their appearance, but were rather
weak.
    The flame of carbonic oxide mixed with vapour of carbon tetra
chloride showed faint traces of hydrocarbon bands occasionally, but
not continuously.
    On the other hand, chloroform, carefully prepared from chloral and
fractionated, when mixed with hydrogen, gave, when burnt in air, the
hydrocarbon bands very strongly. When it was mixed with carbonic
oxide instead of hydrogen it still gave the hydrocarbon bands, but
not nearly so strongly as with hydrogen.
    On a review of the whole series of observations, certain points stand
out plainly. In the first place, the seven blue, the violet, and ultra-violet
 bands, characteristic of the flame of cyanogen, are conspicuous in the
arc taken in an atmosphere of nitrogen, air, nitric oxide, or ammonia,
and they disappear, almost, if not quite, when the arc is taken in
a non-nitrogenous atmosphere of hydrogen, carbonic oxide, carbonic
acid, or chlorine. These same bands are seen brightly in the flames of
cyanogen and hydrocyanic acid, but are not seen in those of hydro
carbons, carbonic oxide, or carbon disulphide.      The conclusion seems
irresistible that they belong to cyanogen ; and this conclusion does not
seem to us at all invalidated by the fact that they are seen weakly, or
 by flashes, in the arc or spark taken in gases supposed free from
nitrogen, by reason of the extreme difficulty of removing the last traces
•of air.  They are never, in such a case, the principal or prominent part
of the spectrum, and in a continuous experiment they are seen to fade
out in proportion as the nitrogen is removed.           This conclusion is
strengthened by the observations of one of us, that cyanogen (or
hydrocyanic acid) is generated in the arc in atmospheric air in large
quantity. Also in the experiment above described with the arc in
nitrogen, we have found that when the current of nitrogen issuing
from the globe is passed through a solution of potash the solution soon
gives the reactions  of a cyanide.

 160          Profs. Liveing and Dewar.         Spectra of the  [Feb. 5,
   In the next place, the green and blue bands, characteristic of the
hydrocarbon flame, are well seen when the arc is taken in hydrogen ;
but though less strong when the arc is taken in nitrogen or in chlorine,
they seem to be always present in the arc, whatever the atmosphere.
This is what we should expect, if they be dne, as Angstrom and Thalen
suppose, to acetylene ; for we have found that the carbon electrodes
always contain, even when they have been long heated in chlorine, a
notable quantity of hydrogen.
   In the flames of carbon compounds they by no means always appear ;
indeed, it is only in those of hydrocarbons or their derivatives that
they are well seen. Carbonic oxide and carbon disulphide, even when
mixed with hydrogen, do not show them ; and if seen in the flames of
cyanogen, hydrocyanic acid, and carbon tetrachloride mixed with
hydrogen, they are faint, and do not form a principal or prominent
part of the spectrum.     This is all consistent with the supposition of
Angstrom and Thalen. The fact that the bands are not produced
even in the presence of hydrogen, when it is not present in the flame
in the form of a compound with carbon, is very significant ; for we
know that acetylene is present, and can easily be extracted from the
flame of any hydrocarbon, and that it is formed as a proximate pro
duct of decomposition of hydrocarbons by the electric discharge, but
we have no evidence that it is producible as a product of direct com
bination of carbon with hydrogen at the comparatively low tempera
ture of a flame such as we have mentioned.
   The hydrocarbon bands are best developed in the blowpipe flame,
that is under conditions which appear, at first sight, unfavourable to
the existence of acetylene in the flame. We have, however, satisfied
ourselves, by the use of a Deville's tube, that acetylene may readily
be withdrawn from the interior of such a flame, and from that part of
it which shows the hydrocarbon bands most brightly.
   The question as to whether these bands are due to carbon itself or
to a compound of carbon with hydrogen, has been somewhat simplified
by the observations of Watts and others on the spectrum of carbonic
oxide.   There is, we suppose, no doubt now that that compound has
its own spectrum quite distinct from the hydrocarbon flame spectrum.
The mere presence of the latter spectrum feebly developed in the
electric discharge in compounds of carbon supposed to contain no
hydrogen, appears to us to weigh very little against the series of
observations which connect this spectrum directly with hydrocarbons.
   In the next place, it appears conclusively from the experiments, that
the development of the violet bands of cyanogen, or the less refrangible
hydrocarbon bands, is not a matter of temperature only.          For the
appearance   of the hydrogen  lines C and  F  in the arc taken in hydro
gen, indicates a temperature far higher than that of any flame.      Yet
the violet bands are not seen in hydrogen at that temperature, while

 1880.]     Compounds    of Carbon with Hydrogen and Nitrogen.         161
 the green bands are well developed.         The violet bands are, never
 theless, seen equally well at the different temperatures of the flame,
 arc, and spark, provided cyanogen be the compound under observation
 in the flame, and nitrogen and carbon are present together at the
 higher temperatures of the arc and spark.
    The similarity in the character of the magnesium-hydrogen         spec
 trum, which we have described, to the green band of the hydro
 carbons is very striking.     We have similar bright maxima of light,
 succeeded by long drawn out series of fine lines, decreasing in in
 tensity towards the more refrangible side. This peculiarity, common
 to both, impels the belief that it is a consequence of a similarity of
 constitution in the two cases, and that magnesium forms with
 hydrogen a compound analogous to acetylene. In this connexion the
 very simple relation (2 : 1) between the atomic weights of mag
 nesium and carbon is worthy of note, as well as the power which
 magnesium has, in common with carbon, of combining directly with
 nitrogen. We may with some reason expect to find a magnesium-
nitrogen spectrum.
    Apart from the mere relative electric conductivity of gases, it is
clear, from the foregoing experiments, that the length and the
 character of a discontinuous electric discharge in different gases does
 not follow the law which we should expect. It will require a prolonged
 series of experiments to arrive at definite conclusions on this matter,
 but it appears to us, in the mean time, highly probable that one of the
 main factors in producing these remarkable variations in the arc will
 be found to be the relative facility with which the carbon electrode
combines with a gaseous medium.
    The interest attaching to the question of the constitution of
 comets, especially since the discovery by Huggins (" Proc. Roy.
 Soc," xvi, p. 386; xxiii, p. 154; "Phil. Trans.," 1868, p. 555), that
 the spectra of various comets are all identical with the hydrocarbon
spectrum, naturally leads to some speculation in connexion with the
conclusions to which our experiments point. Provided we admit that
the materials of the comet contain ready formed hydrocarbons and
 that oxidation may take place, then the acetylene spectrum might be
produced at comparatively low temperatures without any trace of the
cyanogen spectrum, or of metallic lines.         Such reactions might be
brought    about  by the tidal disturbances   involving collisions and pro
jections of the constituents of the swarms of small masses circulating
in orbits round the snn, which we have every reason to believe
constitute the cometic structure.      If, on the other hand, we assume
only   the  presence  of  uncombined    carbon and hydrogen, we know
that the acetylene spectrum can only be produced at a very high
temperature ; and if nitrogen were also present, that we should have
the cyanogen spectrum as well. Either then the first supposition

is the true one, not disproving the presence of nitrogen ; or else the
atmosphere which the comet meets is hydrogen and contains no free
nitrogen.
II.   " On the Epipubis in the Dog and Fox.'" By T. H: Huxley.
                  Sec. R.S. Received January 30, 1880.
   In   1871*   I  gave a brief description of a structure which       I had ob
served in the dog, in the following terms : —
    " In the myology of the
                                   dog, the insertion of the tendon of the
external   oblique muscle of the abdomen presents some interesting pecu
liarities.   The outer and posterior fibres of this muscle end in a fascia,
which is   partly continued over the thigh as fascia lata, and partly forms
an arch    (Poupart's ligament) over the femoral vessels ; by its inner
end it is inserted into the outer side of a triangular fibro-cartilage, the
broad base of which is attached to the anterior margin of the pubis,
between its spine and the symphysis, while its apex lies in the abdo
minal parietes.      The internal tendon of the external oblique unites
with the tendon of the internal oblique to form the inner pillar of the
abdominal ring, and is inserted into the inner side of the triangular
fibro-cartilage. The pectinew is attached to the ventral face of the
cartilage ; the outer part of the tendon of the rectus into its dorsal
face ; but the chief part of that tendon is inserted into the pubis
behind it. This fibro-cartilage appears to represent the marsupial bone,
or cartilage, of the Monotremes and Marsupials."
    The only reference to this statement which          I have met with is by
Professor Macalister, in his " Introduction to the Systematic Zoology
and the Morphology of Vertebrate Animals" (1878), p. 265 : —
    " Professor Huxley describes a                           '
                                        fibro-cartilaginous marsupial' above
the pubis, from whose anterior surface the pectineus arises.              I have
failed to satisfy myself of its existence as a constant structure in many
dogs, in the common and Bengal foxes, in the dingo, jackal, Ganis
pallipes, and wolf."
   The wording of this passage does not make it quite clear whether the
writer has not found the structure in any case, but does not mean to deny
that it may occur occasionally in the various CanicUe he mentions ; or
whether he has found it occasionally, but not constantly, in all or some
of them.
   Under these circumstances, it may be desirable to publish the fact
that, having recently dissected, for purposes of comparison, a male and
female fox and a male and female dog, I have not had the slightest diffi
culty in demonstrating the existence of the structure which describedI

 1880.]      Prof. Huxley.     Epipubis of ilie Doy and Fox.        163
in 1871, in all four.    And the only phrase which appears to require
modification in that description is the use of the term fibro-cartilage.
I  do not remember whether, formerly, I submitted the structure to
microscopic examination or not ; but in the specimens lately examined,
notwithstanding the firmness and density of the triangular plate, it
contains no true cartilage cells, but is entirely composed of fibrous
bands which lie parallel with one another in the middle of the plate,
while, at the thickened edges, they become closely interwoven.
   A comparison of this triangular fibrous plate in the fox, with the
" marsupial " bones of Phalangista vulpina, shows that the fibrons plate
in the former animal exactly answers to the basal part of the " mar

epipubic ligament,   and  must  be regarded as a structure of the same
order as the rudimentary clavicle and the rudimentary hallux of the
Canute t; that is to say, as the remains of an organ which was fully
developed in the ancestral forms of that group.
   It is interesting to remark, in connexion with this interpretation of
the facts, that, in the existing Thylacinus, which presents so many
curious points of resemblance to the dogs, the epipubis is not ossified.
As, however, the Canidas have certainly existed since the Eocene
epoch, there is no likelihood of the existence of any direct genetic
connexion between the dogs and the Thylacines. The existing carnivo
rous Marsupialia have evidently all proceeded from ancestral forms,
characterised by the possession of a thumb-like hallux, a peculiarity
which is presented neither by the dogs, when they possess a hallux,
nor by any other Carnivora with pentadactyle hind feet. Moreover,
the early birth of the young and the development of a marsupium in
the female, are evidences of the departure of the existing Marsupialia
from the direct line by which the Mammalia have advanced from the
ornithodelphous type. That the ancestors of all mammals possessed
bony or cartilaginous epipubes is,     I  think, highly probable, but it
does not follow that they had the marsupial method of bearing and
nourishing their young.

  I. " Studies on the Chiuoline Series." By James Dewar, M.A.,
       F.R.S., Jacksonian Professor, University of Cambridge.
       Received February 10, 1880.
    In the first part of this paper which appeared in the " Proceedings "
 of the Society for 1877, it was shown that the leucoline series of bases
 occurring in coal tar were really aromatic derivatives, as on oxidation
 an acid could be obtained which readily decomposed on distilling with
 an alkali, giving aniline.
    The acid, which was named leucolinic acid, had the composition
 C9H9NO:1, and may be regarded as a higher homologue of isatic acid,
 CyijNO;,, which is one of the characteristic indigo derivatives.    The
 conclusions of this paper have been confirmed by the synthesis of
 chiuoline by Baeyer from the hydro-carbostyril, and by Koenigs
from allylaniline, the latter reaction being similar in principle to the
 synthesis of pyrrol, described in my former paper, by passing ammonia
and a mixture of monobromethylerie and acetylene through a red hot
 tube.
    Experiments on the oxidation of leucoline and the alkaloidal bases
have been repeated by Hoogewerff, Van Dorp, and Koenigs.           These
experimenters have found that instead of leucolinic acid being pro
duced, they obtain a variety of pyridene dicarbonic acid, a substance
which I had on a former occasion separated from the oxidation pro
ducts of picoline.
    The explanation of the difference of the results is to be found in
the fact, that my object was to obtain the first products of oxidation
and thus to avoid breaking up the body into simpler constituents.
    Both the tar and cinchona bases may be regarded as having a
double nucleus of a benzol and pyridene residue, and the latter, being
the moro stable of the two, derivatives of it are obtained when the
oxidation is more complete.

1880.]                  Studies on the Chinoline Series.                   165
   The interest of the subject has been greatly enhanced by the results
of Weidel, Schmidt, Ramsay, and Dobbie on the direct oxidation of
the cinchona alkaloids.
   All these chemists agree that the chief oxidation product has the
composition and properties of either a pyridene di- or tri-carbonic
acid.
   My attention being         directed to other scientific subjects,   I  have
thought    the  results  of  experiments,   which  I had intended   extending,
had better be published, as research in this department            of organic
chemistry is being vigorously prosecuted, which will in all probability
at no distant date result iu the synthesis of some important alkaloids.
                        Oxidation of Cinchona Chinoline.
   Chinoline    obtained    from cinchonine, which had been carefully
purified as described in my former paper, was treated with permanga
nate in the same way as leucoline, in order to see if any acid similar
to the leucolinic acid could be obtained.           In each operation, about
13 grms. of chinoline        was dissolved in dilute sulphuric acid, and
a hot solution of 30 grms. of permanganate of potash added.            As the
chinoline is more readily attacked than the corresponding tar base, to
prevent loss the oxidation must be carried out in large basins, as the
mass is apt to froth over from the evolution of carbonic acid.
   After filtration from the oxide of manganese, the alkaline solution
was evaporated to dryness, and extracted with alcohol to separate the
sulphate, carbonate, and oxalate of potash.
   The soluble potash salt was dissolved in water, excess of sulphuric
acid added, and the organic acid extracted by shaking with ether. The
yield of acid was small, and as no modification of the process seemed
to increase    the amount, the substance obtained         was chiefly used to
determine its composition and general reactions.
                                  Chinolinic Acid.
   The acid crystallised in nodular masses very soluble in water. It
melts   at 143°, or 20° lower than the isomeric leucolinic acid.           The
silver salt is very insoluble, separating from cold solutions as a floccu-
lent precipitate, which on standing becomes crystalline. When it is re-
crystallised from a large volume of boiling water, it is obtained in
tufts of fine needles. The crystals were always mixed with a slight
reddish-brown substance, which appeared to be oxide of silver.
   The acid gave no violet colonr with ferric chloride, but the am
monia salt gave a violet precipitate,           which rapidly became of a
reddish-brown     colour.
   Analysis of the acid obtained from cinchona chinoline and the silver

    A quantity of the silver salt which had been treated with dilute
nitric acid, weighing 0-186, gave 0-081 of silver, or equivalent to 43 5
per cent.    A sample recrystallised, weighing 0-1492, gave 0-0655 of
silver, or 43 9 per cent. The second fraction, obtained by partial
precipitation from the ammonia salt amounting to 0 3033, gave 0-1343
of silver, or 44"2 per cent.     The mean of the five analyses giving
43'5 per cent, of silver.   Nitrogen determination : — The nitrogen was
found on combustion to bear to the carbonic acid the relative volume
ratio of 1 to 18 3.
   The above analyses of the silver salt prove that it always contains
excess of silver, either from a higher substitution prodnct, or from
combined oxide. The composition might be represented by eight equiva
lents of the normal silver salt combining with one of oxide of silver.
Although the want of material prevented the examination of a greater
number of salts, there can be little doubt that the composition of the
acid is C9H9N03.
   The acid fused with caustic potash gives aniline, and the silver salt
when heated gave a crystalline sublimate with drops of aniline.
   The acid dissolves in hot glycerine with a fine violet fluorescence, and
begins to decompose, giving off carbonic acid at 180°, together with oily
drops of aniline.

   Leucolinic acid does not decompose in glycerine before a temperature
of 205° is reached ; the general decompositions of this acid are clearly
identical with that of the isomeric acid obtained from the tar base,
and prove conclusively      that both bases are intimately related      to the
aromatic series.
                           Nature of Tar Leueoline.
   According to the researches of Greville Williams the leueoline of tar
is distinguished from the corresponding cinchona base by its giving
an oily chromate, which in his hands never crystallised. -
   The leueoline URed in my experiments can be shown to be a mixture
of at least two isomeric bases, one of which yields a crystalline chro
mate, which is not however identical with the chromate of the alkaloid
base.
   The portion boiling between 210° and 220° gave the largest yield of
the crystalline chromate.
    In no case did the mixture of the base with excess of chromic acid
give any crystals until it had stood for several days.
   After separating the crystals the free base was obtained by distilla
tion with caustic potash, and gave immediately        a well crystallised  salt
on the addition of a little chromic acid.
    The base separated from the uncrystallisable         chromate   seemed to
 boil on the whole at a lower temperature.

bine with   it,forming a reddish-violet solid. If the excess of chloride
of ethyl containing the uncombined leucoline          distilled in a current
                                                           is
of steam, this portion of the base now yields a crystalline chromate.
Similarly, the original leucoline heated in sealed tubes to a tempera
ture of 170° C. with chromic acid in the proportion of 10 grms. to
5 cub. centims. of the base, gave, after separating the oxide of chro
mium, on distilling caustic potash, the base yielding the crystalline
chromate.     The alkaline fluid on evaporation to dryness, and heating
 with soda ime, gave a little pyrrol, but no aniline.    The alkaline solu
tion distilled with excess of sulphuric acid gave volatile organic acids.
The ordinary leucoline treated directly with iodide of ethyl gave a red
viscid mass, containing yellow crystals, which may be separated by
successive washings with alcohol. When this iodide of ethyl leucoline
was distilled, the free base yielded the crystalline chromate   ;    whereas
the leucoline separated from the oily chromate, when heated with
iodide of ethyl, gave an intense red-coloured fluid, in which a few
crystals appeared after standing for a week or two.
   It thus appears by the three methods detailed above, that ordinary
leucoline   isa mixture of two isomeric bases   and that samples of the
                                                   ;
tar product may differ considerably in properties.
   We can thus easily explain how Hofmann obtained on one occa
sion a crystalline chromate from the tar bases, which led him to infer
that the substance was identical in properties with that derived from
the decomposition      of the cinchona alkaloids         whereas Greville

Williams, working upon a different specimen, could obtain nothing
but an oily nncrystallisable salt.
   In reality both experimenters described the properties of different
specimens of the bases.

   Many attempts to increase the yield of leucolinic acid, by varying
the proportions and temperature of the reacting bodies, led to the
following results.
   The greatest amount of acid    obtained when one part of the base,
                                    is
dissolved in the form of neutral sulphate,  treated with 2£ times its

weight of permanganate of potash dissolved in boiling water, the
oxidising agent being carefully added to the salt of leucoline.    If the
action is allowed to proceed in the cold with about four parts of the
permanganate to one of base, there      no leucolinic acid formed, all the
                                         is
higher boiling point bases, belonging cither to the tar or cinchona
series of bases, yielded acid derivatives on oxidation, which, on distil
lation with soda-lime, gave aniline when the above plan was adopted            ;
if this was not done, the chief product was member of the pyridine
                                                    a
series.  This explains why von Dorp, Koenigs, and others have found
only pyridine dicarbonic acid without any trace of leucolinic acid.

    The crude acid separated from the potash salt or the insoluble lead
salt always contains a considerable quantity of a syrupy acid, which
does not crystallise unless it is boiled with water for some days.           It is
possible this substance may be the acid derived from one of the
isomeric bases, and that it is slowly changed into the crystalline
modification.      The crystalline leucolinic acid treated with glycerine
gives   a  substance  having the characteristic reactions of indol, but the
amount obtained is always small ; many attempts made to increase
the yield of this body have not been successful. If fused chloride of
zinc be employed instead of glycerine, the distillate is hydrochlorate of
aniline, without any of the indol substance.          Similarly, a solution of
tho potash salt of the acid, heated to 200° C, gave only aniline,
carbonic and acetic acids.           On heating the acid with zinc-dust,
¦chinoline was not reproduced, as the product was a crystalline sub
stance which has not been examined.
    The decompositions of leucolinic and chinolinic acids point to their
being amido-phenylpyruvic acids, and their general relations to nearly
allied substances are shown in the following formulae: —

II. "   Note on Electrolytic Experiments."            By James Dewar.
       M.A., F.R.S., Jacksonian Professor, University of Cam
       bridge.    Received February 10, 1880.
   Having had occasion to employ the intermittent current of the
de  Meritens magneto-electric machine arranged for intensity in con
nexion -with spectroscopic work, the following notes of electrolytic
experiments made by means of it may not be without some interest.
   The number of intermittent currents taking place in the circuit
during the course of the following experiments may bo taken as
about 300 per second, and as the amount of energy in circulation is
very considerable, an examination         of its action on electrolytes
was of some interest.
   Dilute sulphuric acid, of about 1 of acid to G of water, used as the
electrolyte in a large circular glass vessel, gave the following results : —
   On placing two rather large platinum poles, each exposing a sur
face of about 32 square centims., no decomposition took place, a few
bubbles of gas came off at one pole for a short time, which soon
ceased.    The current was proved to be passing by placing a telephone
near the side of the glass vessel, and also by the rapid increase in
the temperature of the acid, which very soon reached the boiling
point.    The absence of decomposition was due to the rapidity with
which the current in the de Meritens machine is alternated, the gases
given off at each pole being rapidly superposed and combining imme
diately to form water.
   Decomposition was immediately produced by making and breaking
the enrrent rapidly with tho hand, or better still, by placing a large
tuning fork in the circuit, to which was attached a copper rod which
dipped in and out of mercury at every vibration of the fork.
   When two poles were used, consisting of platinum wire, decom
position went on without intermission at both poles, but on the other
hand, when one pole was a plate of platinum and the other a platinum
wire, the mixed gases were given off at the wire pole only.
   The spectrum of the platinum poles, viewed with a small direct
vision spectroscope, was very complicated, showing the H and air
lines.
   Platinum wire of about 5 inillim. in diameter used as one pole,
readily fused when held close to the surface of the liquid, and re
mained white hot when immersed below the surface, with a continual
ejection of the particles of the fluid, and successive small explosion-
of the mixed gases.
   Aluminium      wire behaved in a remarkable way when used as one
of the poles, the other pole consisting of a large surface of platinum.

On first plunging the wire beneath the surface nothing is observed ;
almost immediately, however, it becomes intensely illuminated all over
the surface.   The light seems to emanate from an immense number of
points which look like lit up gems.        This appears to be due to the
formation of oxide of aluminium, which offers a great resistance to
the passage of the current and consequently becomes intensely heated,
and is pierced or disintegrated at certain points, and this supposition
seems to be confirmed by the absence of any incandescence of the
wire when hydrochloric acid, caustic potash, or any other medium
which dissolves the oxide as soon as formed, is used. If another
aluminium wire is substituted for the platinum plate, then either the
one or the other becomes illuminated according to the extent of surface
of metal immersed, but they are generally not illuminated at the same
time, the largest surface always remaining dull ; gases are now freely
given off, being chiefly hydrogen.
    The luminosity of the aluminium wire becomes very much diminished
after a short time, as the wire becomes almost completely covered with
a uniform layer of the white oxide, and is gradually eaten away. The
luminosity can again be produced by cleaning the poles. The same
effects took place when dilute hydrochloric acid, or saturated chloride
of sodium was substituted for the dilute sulphuric acid. After the
current had passed for some time gas was given off at both poles.
    The light evolved from the surface of the poles below the
surface of the electrolyte was intensely white, and on spectroscopic
examination, proved to be the characteristic channeled spectrum of
oxide of aluminium, first described by Thalen. The characteristic
metallic lines between the two H lines were faint.
    On bringing a piece of thin foil aluminium as one pole near the surface
of the acid it is immediately fused, globules of the melted metal flying
about in all directions ; the aluminium wire is also fused after a short
time, and falls through the liquid in white hot globules.
    Magnesium wire at one pole, the other being the platinum plate as
 before, gave an intense green colour below the surface, a spectroscopic
 examination showing the combined spectrum of the metal and oxide.
    It burnt on the surface of the liquid in the same manner as the
 aluminium, showers of melted metal being thrown off ; the action when
 a saturated solution of chloride of sodium was employed was, if any
 thing, more intense.      Similar actions took place with other metals,
 such as copper and zinc.
    A solution of chloride of sodium was rapidly decomposed, abundance
 of chlorine being set free, when a platinum wire was used as one pole,
 the larger platinum plate being used for the other. A solution of
 iodide of potassium behaved in the same way, but was decomposed at
 a very much slower rate when both the poles were of large surface. A
 saturated solution of sulphate of copper deposited hardly a trace of

copper, when the platinum plate and a thick platinum wire were used
as the two poles.    Various modifications of these experiments may be
made by employing different metals.       The intensity current used with
a saturated solution of nitrate of potash, has the power of engraving
on glass, as described by von Plante.
    The determination of the heat evolved from the Jablochkoff candle
in the annular calorimeter formerly described, amounted to about
6,000 gram-units per minute, or in other words, it is about -Jth of
the total radiation of the Siemens machine when the small resistance
of the electric arc is alone in the circuit.
    On introducing into this circuit containing a Jablochkoff candle the
voltameter   which was formerly used, and in which no decomposition
was apparent when used alone, the total radiation of the candle
was very slightly diminished, but the cell showed intermittent bursts
of electrolytic gas just as when the tuning fork was used as formerly
described.     This seemed to be always associated with any quality
of intermittence due to the want of regularity in the action of the
candle.    Assuming that the whole work of the intermittent current
was exhausted first in electrolysis, and then in recombination     of the
separated electrolytes, and that recombination resulted solely in a
heating effect localised in the cell, then the elevation of temperature
would be a measure of the chemical work done. As, however, the
amount of this heating is relatively small in comparison with the
current circulating, we must suppose that a considerable portion of
the energy of recombination is thrown into the circuit as a new electro
 motive force. The chief interest in these experiments is the value of the
 de Meritens machine, as having many of the advantages from Plante's
secondary piles, and the facility and ease with which this power can
 be used.    Mr. Spottiswoode's    recent experiments have shown that
 the character of the arc obtained from the de Meritens machine is
 intermediate in qualities between that of the ordinary arc and that of
 the induction spark, and may be employed with great advantage in
 exciting the induction coil. The use of it in spectroscopic work has
been fully detailed to the Society in conjoint communications        with
 Professor Liveing.       The luminous discharge obtained below the
 surface of fluids shows another valuable use of the machine in con
 nexion with this subject.

     In  the  " Philosophical Magazine " for November of last
                                                                  year I gave
an account of a mode of exciting an induction coil by the direct appli
 cation of one of M. de Meritens' alternating machines, without the
 intervention of a contact-breaker or the use of a condenser.             The
 experiments of Professor Dewar on the arc furnished by the machine
 itself, on its spectrum, and on its behaviour in respect of electrolysis
 described before the Royal Society (see " Proc. Roy. Soc," vol. xxx,
 p. 170), have led me to think that an account of some of the pecu
 liarities in the induced discharge,      to which the machine gives rise,
  might be acceptable to the Society.
      And, first, as regards the secondary discharge in air. It was men
 tioned in the paper first quoted that the spark produced by this machine
 presented an unusually thick yellow flame, and that it was accom
  panied by a hissing noiso different from that commonly heard with a
  coil excited by a battery. As the machine gives alternate currents, the
 secondary discharge presents sparks of equal strength in both direc
  tions, and the general appearance to the eye is symmetrical in respect
  of both terminals.      The spark was observed in a revolving mirror,
  first in a vertical and secondly in a horizontal direction. The discharge,
  although apparently continuous, was immediately seen to bo inter
  mittent, with a period in unison with that of the machine.         Tongues
  of flame, leading alternately from one terminal and from the other,
  crossed the field of view. The length of spark first used (vertically) was
  about half an inch. When the length was increased to about two inches,
  the discharge being vertical, flashes or bands of continuous light were
  seen to traverse the field of view in diagonals of low slope (i.e., nearly

 from time to time at moderate velocity between the terminals.     From
 the known period of the machine, and the nnmber of the discharges
crossed by these flashes in their passage from terminal to terminal, it
 was calculated that the time of passage was about "03 of a second.
 Occasionally there was a still brighter flash or meteor, which similarly
traversed the field, but with a velocity apparently of about double that
of the others.
   When the discharge was set horizontally, similar phenomena were
seen ; but at a distance about midway between the two terminals, the
flames appeared to meet, and at their point of meeting they showed
continuous luminosity throughout. When the flame was blown aside,
there appeared occasionally, and at rather long intervals, the true
spark, evinced by an irregular bright line, reaching from one terminal
to the other.
   On observing the discharge in air attentively, it was noticed that
whenever a true spark passed vertically its passage was marked, as
usual, by an irregular bright line when its path was outside the
aureola or flame, but by a similar dark line when its path was within
the aureola.
  With reference to this phenomenon, it may        be observed, in the first
place, that  in every coil discharge the time spark is always anterior to
the aureola, which, in fact, immediately follows it. The true spark of
each discharge taken by itself will, therefore, always appear as a bright
line. It, however, sometimes happens, as mentioned above, that in the
succession of discharges produced by the present method, the flame or
aureola of one discharge lasts, at least over part of its length, until the
next takes place.     When this is the case, the spark of the succeeding
discharge will pass partly through air, as usual, and partly through
the flame which has lasted over from the preceding discharge.          This
part of  its  path  will be through   a conductor,   which  may   be so  far
better than the air, as to allow the spark to pass in a non-luminous
condition.    The phenomenon noticed by Mr. De La Rue, viz., the
sudden expansion of a gas at the instant of the passage of an electric
discharge through it, may then take place, and the displacement of
the flaming gas over that part of the path may give rise to the appear
ance of the dark line within the area of the aureola.       The remaining
part of the path, if any, will be bright. It    is, however, further to be
noticed that the true spark, or those portions of      itwhich are bright,
always appears to lie outside, and never within, the aureola.          This
may arise from the fact that on the extinction of a flame the portions
of space immediately outside are for the moment the hottest and most
conductive,  and that the next spark will consequently choose a path
really outside the contour of the flame just extinguished.   And as the
successive flames do not differ materially in size or shape, the bright
spark   will appear always to lie outside the flame.

   The spectrum of the secondary spark was then examined with
terminals of various metals.
   Aluminium. — The spectrum showed a faint continuous background
with the yellow sodium lines, and faint oxide of aluminium lines.
This was with a spark of half an inch. But although the spark was
subsequently lengthened, no difference in the spectrum was perceived
excepting that the continuous            background was rendered more
bright.
   It would   seem that these appearances      are due to some such process
as   the following : — The heat due to oxidation, added to that of the
discharge, is sufficient to volatilise the oxide of aluminium ; but that in
its passage across the interval between the terminals, the oxide becomes
so cooled that it gives a continuous      spectrnm.    When the spark was
lengthened, the oxide, although perhaps at first more heated than
with the shorter spark, had more time to cool.
   Magnesium. — In this, as in the former case, we have a faint con
tinuous spectrnm as a background, on which were seen the b group of
magnesium lines.       One other line in the blue occasionally flashed out,
but was not permanently present.         There was also a faint trace of the
oxide spectrum.      The contrast between the cases of aluminium and
magnesium, in respect of the prominence of the oxide, or of the true
metallic spectrum, is doubtless due to the fact that in the former case
the oxide, and in the latter the metal, is the one which is more easily
vaporised.      On sending a blast of air on the discharge, the blue line
always disappeared ; the current of air having lowered the temperature
so far as to prevent the vaporisation necessary for its production.
   When the spark between magnesium terminals was made to pass
through hydrogen, the characteristic lines of hydrogen were seen,
apparently owing to a rise in temperature.         This, as mentioned below,
does not occur with carbon poles.
   Platinum. — With terminals of this metal the spectrum was mainly
continuous, with the addition of the ubiquitous yellow sodium lines.
When the spark was short a few bands were faintly visible, some
apparently those of nitrogen, and others in the blue and violet belong
 ing to the oxide of platinum. When the spark was lengthened, these
bands disappeared, and nothing but the continuous spectrum (with the
D lines) was visible.
    It appears from these experiments that the application of the
de Meritens machine to the induction coil furnishes us with the
means of isolating certain lines of the metallic spectrum from the rest.
It has, in fact, enabled us to reduce at pleasure the spectra of aluminium,
of magnesium, and of platinum, to their most persistent lines ; precisely
as had already been noticed as occurring by natural processes in the
cases of sodium and of calcium.         As a general rule, when the spark is
shortened, the metallic, or the oxide, lines come out, according as the

17(!      Mr. W. Spottiswoode.             On Effects produced by          [Feb. lti,
one   or the other is more easily vaporised         ;  and when it is lengthened
they disappear.
    From this we may conclude (1) that the discharge which we havr
been examining, is a real flame with metallic particles passing between
the terminals in a solid condition ; and (2) that in general the tempe
rature is comparatively low, i.e., that it is insufficient to cause any con
siderable vaporisation.         This is notably the case when the arc is long,
and when the matter thrown off from the terminals has sufficient time
in its passage to cool.
    The spark was then tried between carbon terminals in atmospheres
of hydrogen and of carbonic acid.             In none of them did the spectrum
show any gas lines ; but with hydrogen there were faint traces of the
hydrocarbon group in the green.               In this respect the spark differs
from the discharge direct from the machine, inasniueh as the latter
gives some of the hydrogen lines in hydrogen and carbon lines in
carbonic acid.
    When magnesium             terminals    were used in an atmosphere of
hydrogen, the yellow sodium lines, the blue and green magnesium
lines, and the red line of hydrogen were visible near the terminals,
with a continuous background.*
    When the spark was discharged in a magnetic field, known pheno
 mena were reproduced, but owing to the thickness and mass of the
flame and the extraordinary strength of the magnetic field, they were
exhibited in a state of great splendour.f
    When the spark passed in an equatoreal direction the whole flame
 was spread out in an equatoreal plane, in which heated masses might
 be seen revolving in one direction or in the other in the neighbourhood
of each of the magnetic poles.               To give some idea of the actual
appearance, it may be mentioned, that a symmetrical spindle-shaped
discbarge, 15 millims. in length and 3 millims. in thickness, was
spread out by the magnet into a disk of about 15 millims. in diameter
and 1 millim. in thickness.             When the spark passed in an axial
direction, or when the poles themselves were made the terminals, the
                                               " On an Experiment in Klectro-

 reproduced.
    Whatever was the direction of the spark, the resistance due to the
 magnetic field was such as to extinguish the discharge, provided that
    * When the same discharge was effected in a

 served was that the lines became slightly fainter.    There was some reason to think
 that, at tho moment of making the magnet current, the lines became decidedly
 brighter, and that they lost their brilliancy if that current was maintained.      But
 this, perhaps, requires further examination.

the  striking distance was near the limit that it could attain when        no-
magnetic field was present.            If a plate of glass was interposed
between the poles of the magnet (which were still used as terminals)
the yellow flame disappeared, and the spark divided itself into
numerous      ramifications    of true sparks which found their way round
the edges      of the plate.      As soon as the magnet was excited the
resistance   in the field became so great as to exceed that of the glass
plate itself, and the plate was pierced.
    Professor Dewar was good enough to measure the efficiency of the
secondary discharge, by taking an inch spark in a glass bulb placed in
the centre of a calorimeter, in the same way as he had already
measured the efficiency of the intermittent current direct from the
machine.       The former amounted to about 430            gramme-units per
minute, while the latter had been found to be              6,000 per minute.
The relative efficiency may, therefore, be taken at        about 1 : 15. And
as the machine was giving about 300 currents per           second, this would
give for the secondary
                  430   : 60 x  300= -023 unit per discharge,
and   for the primary
                    6000   : 60 X 300= -3 unit per discharge.
    The results in the case of the secondary discharge may not perhaps
possess any great degree of accuracy ; but, in the absence of any other
information on the question, they may serve to indicate the general
scale of magnitude by which the coil discharge is related to that of
the machine.
    Leaving the subject of the spark from the induction coil, one of the
most remarkable effects produced by this machine was the illumina
tion of vacuum tubes by the currents taken simply from the machine.
A small    sphere of about two inches      in diameter, with an air-vacuum,
and having two parallel straight terminals reaching nearly across the
sphere and about half an inch apart, was (after the first attempt,
when there      was some difficulty in getting the discharge to pass)
readily illuminated. Owing to the alternate currents, both terminals
 were of course surrounded with the usual blue halo.          When the speed
 of the machine was reduced, the discharge through the tube was not
 maintained, showing that only that part of the current from the
 machine which possessed the highest electromotive force, and perhaps
 also the greatest strength, was sufficient and was therefore actually
 used for the purpose.         As this was apparently only a small fraction
of the whole current, we may herein find an explanation of the fact
 that, compared with the effect from the induction spark, the illumina
 tion was moderate, and the heating insignificant. It would perhaps
not be easy to establish an accurate comparison between this and other
sources of electricity ; but some idea may be conveyed by the fact

chloride of silver battery on
                            a former occasion, and quite independently
of the present question, it was estimated that a current having an
electromotive force of 400 volts was necessary to effect a discharge.
   Other tubes were tried, and were illuminated in the same way.
   When the tube was placed in the magnetic field, the discharge
underwent the modifications  described by Pliicker, by Hittorf, and by
others.   But it may     be mentionedas a result of the extraordinary
strength of the field here employed that, whenever the tube was so
placed that the direction of discharge made any considerable     angle
with the lines of magnetic force passing through         it,

part of the field, the discharge reappeared distorted in form, and
altered in colour, in a manner known to those who have experimented
in this direction.

1880.]            On the Solubility of Solids in Gases.             17^
This conclusion is based on the relation of volume to pressure for
different temperatures, and on the failure of optical tests to show any
distinction between gas and liquid when pressure is applied above the
critical temperature.   It occurred to us, that some knowledgo might
be gained by examining the solvent properties of some fluid for a non
volatile solid, in the passage of the solvent from the liquid to the

180                Messrs.    J.  B. Hannay and    J. Hogarth.        [Feb. 2ti,
 gaseous state.        The property of dissolving solids being supposed
peculiar to liquids, it seemed to us that on passing through the critical
state there would be a precipitation of solid, or if on the other hand
no separation occurred, a further proof of the perfect continuity of
the gaseous and liquid states would be presented.            To put the matter
to the test, a solution of potassic iodide in alcohol was prepared, and
a strong tube filled to about one-half with the solution.         After sealing,
the tube was placed in an air-bath, and heat applied.             No precipita
tion of solid could be seen even at a temperature of 350° C, more
than 100° C. above the critical point of alcohol.
    For the examination of the phenomena of solution some form of
pressure apparatus was necessary, so that the volume of the fluid
experimented on might be altered at pleasure.           After several experi
ments we adopted a modified form of Dr. Andrews' apparatus, which
allowed us to change an experimental tube in a few minutes, and
showed no sign of leakage at the highest pressure reached (fig. 4).            A
section of the apparatus is shown in the annexed engraving. It is made
of wrought iron tubing such as is used in hydraulic machinery, about
   inch internal, and 1 inch external diameter.           The length of the
apparatus    is !) inches,   and   there is a side tube welded   on, measuring
about 3 inches, for the insertion of the manometer tube.                On the
ends of the tube are screwed strong caps, also of wrought iron ;
Through one of these the pressure screw works, the others serve for
the admission of the experimental and manometer tubes. The dis
tinguishing feature of the apparatus is the packing for the screw and
tubes.                                                            i
          It consists of a solid plug of india-rubber, about inch thick,
placed  in  the hollow cap, so that it serves both for packing the screw
or tube, and for making the joint between the cap and the iron tube
tight. To prevent the pressure screw from cutting the india-rubber,
a lining of thin leather, well soaked in lard, was placed between it
and the rubber.        The tubes were similarly packed, and to keep them
from being forced out through the aperture in the cap, a thickening
was made in the glass by fusing and pressing together, and between
this bulbous part and the iron a strong leather washer was placed.
In some cases, when a very high pressure was wanted, the tube was
cemented in with oxychloride of zinc, which effectually prevented it
from coming in contact with the iron cap. With this mode of
packing the pressure screw did not require to be very fine, the one
commonly used being          \  inch in diameter and screwed 30 threads to
the inch.     The only limit to the pressure was the frailty of the glass
tubes; we have, however, attained a pressure of 880 atmospheres as
shown by an air manometer, and even at this enormous pressure the
screw could be freely moved in either direction without leakage.             The
apparatus    was    as  tight  with  mercury as with  water,  so that there was
no necessity for using two liquids as in Dr. Andrews' machine.            When

 1880.]            On  the Solubility of Solids in Gases.                181
a  high temperature was required, the experimental tube             was bent
 over as shown in the drawing, and passed into an air-bath        formed of
two concentric iron cylinders.          The cylinders had mica      windows,
 through which the experiment could be observed, and               to  ensure
 perfect regnlarity of temperature, the inner one was lined with cement
about   \ inch thick. As in most of onr experiments it was quite un
necessary to know the pressure, a simple straight tube was used in
stead  of the T-shaped one described.        It was screwed to fit the same
 caps, and from its simplicity made a very convenient and efficient
apparatus.
   The experiments with the sealed tube showed us that no deposit of
solid occurred above the critical point. With the assistance of the
apparatus just described, we were able to show a crystal of potassic
iodide dissolving in alcohol gas (using the word gas as Dr. Andrews
proposes for a fluid at any temperature above its critical point).
Having fixed a tube (internal diameter '75 mm., external 7 mm.), in
the  apparatus previously filled with mercury, some alcohol was sucked
in by gradually withdrawing the pressure screw.           By a further with
drawal of the screw, the little thread of alcohol was moved inwards
past a constriction made in the glass tube near the end, and a small
fragment of fused potassic iodide dropped in so as to rest on the
narrow neck. Sufficient heat was now applied to boil the alcohol and
expel the air, and the end of the tube strongly sealed with the blow
pipe.    The tube being placed in its position in the bath, heat was
applied and the pressure regulated so as to keep the alcohol from
passing round the bend into the other limb of the U tube.           The tube
and its contents were thus raised to a temperature of 300° C. (the cri
tical point of alcohol as will be shown is 234°'4 C), the crystal never
having come in contact with the liquid alcohol.           Pressure was now
applied   nntil  the  alcohol  was   reduced  to about  the volume occupied
by it while still liquid, when the fragment of iodide was seen to dissolve
gradually and completely. On withdrawing the screw slowly no
deposit    occurred    even when the volume was very considerably
increased, but by taking off the pressure very rapidly a crystalline
film appeared on the glass, and in some cases, a cloud of fine crystals
floating in the menstruum.        These crystals could be easily redissolved
by again increasing    the pressure.   The deposit most frequently occurred
just at the surface of the mercury, and this we ascribe to a local
rarefaction caused by the slightly higher temperature of the mercury.
The fact of the existence of solvent power above the critical point
being established by this experiment, we next songht to examine the
phenomenon      by using other solvents and solids.         The sealed tube
method was found most convenient for this purpose, an experiment
with the pressure apparatus being resorted to when we wished to vary
the volume. -The tube was filled from half to two-thirds with the

182             Messrs.  J.  B. Hannay and       J. Hogarth.       [Feb. 2i>,
solution to  be tested, and by a      few experiments the strength of the
solution  was  so adjnsted that no    separation of solid took place, wben
the tube was completely filled by      expansion.
   The behaviour of a solution         of potassic iodide we have already
described.    Bromide of potassium gave a similar result. The solubility
of chloride of calcium in alcohol was found to be uninterrupted by the
passage of the alcohol through the critical state. Cobaltous chloride
(anhydrous) remained in solution at 320°C. the highest temperature
reached in this experiment, and the beautiful blue colour of the
solution was unimpaired.        Ferric chloride (sublimed) gave a yellow
fluid at a temperature of 260° C. This yellow colour rapidly disap
peared, and a reddish-coloured     powder separated out, which remained
insoluble on cooling.      On opening the tube a strong ethereal odour
was perceived.    This was most probably due to the formation of ethylic
chloride.   Some peculiar phenomena observed when heating the ferric
chloride solution deserve description.       At a temperature of 120° C. a
very strongly   coloured  liquid layer appeared at the bottom of the tube,
while the uppermost layer was perceptibly paler. As the temperature
rose the two layers gradually mixed and the fluid was quite homo
geneous at and above the critical point.
   A solution of ferric chloride in ether was distinctly coloured at least
30° C. above the critical point, but the colour gradually faded, and
did not return on cooling.     The separation and redissolving of part of
the ferric chloride occurred also with ether.
   A solution of sulphur in carbon disulphide showed no separation
of sulphur when raised 50° C. above its critical point.           Of course
sulphur at this temperature is a liquid, but its vapour tension is com
paratively so small that its solution is worth recording.      Selenium also
remained in solution in carbon disulphide above its critical point, and
separated out in part when the solution cooled.             Chemical action
evidently took place in this experiment, for on evaporating a portion
of the solution after heating, a reddish-yellow          residue containing
selenium was obtained.       The liquid had a distinct horse-radish smell,
and on burning gave a dark stain on a piece of porcelain held in the
flame.    Sulphide of selenium was most probably formed.         An attempt
was made to dissolve cadmic sulphide in carbon disulphide, but
without success.     In an experiment with metallic arsenic and carbon
disulphide the arsenic seemed to dissolve, but as an orange-coloured
film appeared    on the glass on cooling, we are inclined to doubt its
solubility. When some sulphur was enclosed in the tube with arsenic
and carbon disulphide, and the temperature raised above the critical
point, solution occurred, and when the temperature was allowed to
fall a separation of dense liquid drops took place at the critical point.
At  a lower temperature these solidify and form reddish-yellow crystals.
The apparent solubility of arsenic was thus probably due to its con

version into a sulphide,         and the subsequent solution        of the sulphide
formed.
   Carbon tetrachloride was also tried as a solvent, but as the number
of substances      soluble in this fluid is very small, we can only record a
few negative       experiments.          Cupric chloride did not dissolve, but
appeared to be acted on chemically above the critical point, its colour
changing to brown.             Chromic chloride showed no sign of solution.
Zinc oxide did not dissolve, but at a temperature 20° or 30° above the
critical point a sudden chemical change occurred, and as a result the
critical point was found to be lowered from 280° C. to about 200°. On
cooling some transparent globules were seen, and on opening the tube
there was an outrush of gas.              The transparent globules dissolved in
water, and were found to be chloride of zinc.
    The use of water as a solvent was quite out of the question, both on
account of its high critical point and the corrosion of the glass tubes,
so that we were debarred from the use of the liquid whose examination

    The mixture of light paraffins known as paraffin spirit was tried as
a solvent     for some organic substances. A solution of resin in this
liquid remained perfectly bright and without sign of separation at a
temperature of 350° to 360°, almost 100° above the critical point.
    The examination of liquids to determine their critical temperature
and pressure was not exactly in the line of our research, but as
 Cagniard de la Tour's numbers, so far as we are aware, are the only
 ones on record, we have made a number of experiments in this direc
 tion.    To obtain accurate measurements of pressure is a matter of
 very great difficulty, and as for our purpose these were not required,
 it would have made our research unnecessarily tedious to attempt it.
 Our numbers are as follows : —

 had taken place to any great extent.

     The differences between Cagniard de la Tour's numbers and our
  own in the case of alcohol are no doubt due to the difficulty of obtain
 ing that body anhydrous.         As will be seen from the density given, the
 alcohol used   in  these experiments contained only a very small quantity
 of water, and was indeed practically anhydrous.
    To determine whether the presence of a solid in solution affected
 the critical temperature and pressure, a cold saturated solution of
 potassic iodide in alcohol was prepared.        Experiments with this solu
 tion gave as the average of three trials — temperature 237°'l C.,
 pressure 71'1 atmospheres. The probable error of a single experiment
 is for the temperature 0°"37 C, for the pressure 0-5 atmosphere.          The
 exact amount of solid present in solution when the readings were made
 it was impossible to determine ; for in altering the volume, so as to
observe the critical point, a small quantity was deposited on the glass
just at the end of the mercury column.          To make sure that some salt
did remain in solution, we brought the mercury column up so as to
cover the crystalline film, and after carefully examining to see that no
solid particles were above the mercury, wo allowed the fluid to cool
under pressure. When cold, the end of the capillary was broken off,
and the liquid, which had been shut off by the mercury from contact
with the crystalline deposit, received in a watch glass. On evaporation
it gave an appreciable residue. These experiments seem to show that
 a liquid has its critical point raised by the solution in it of a solid.
    As the solubility of potassic iodide in alcohol is very slight (1 part
 in 40 at 13°"5 C.) we thought it advisable to try a solution of chloride
 of calcium in alcohol, so that the effect of solution on the pressure
 and temperature might be shown in a more marked degree.              On heat
 ing  a  cold saturated   solution  of calcic  chloride   (anhydrous), a dense
liquid layer was observed to form at the bottom when the temperature
reached 230° C. ; at 240° C. the line separating the lighter layer of
liquid from vapour was very indistinct, and could not be distinguished at
all above 250° C. ; at 255° C. the dense layer dissolved, but re-appeared
 when pressure was taken off. When the volume was again reduced, it
re-dissolved, and at 270° C. expansion caused a deposition of crystals.
 In this experiment there was no sharp critical point, and no pressure
readings were taken.        A dense layer, it will be remembered, was also
 noticed in the ferric chloride experiment.            A combination of the
chloride with part of the alcohol evidently occurs, and at a higher
temperature diffusion takes place until the fluid is quite homogeneous.
    While working with cobnltous chloride an interesting question pre
 sented itself to us — Is the absorption spectrum of a substance dissolved
in a fluid above its critical point the same as in liquid solution or in

  1880.]            On the Solubility  of Solids in Gases.                 185
  the solid state ?    To answer this question, a solution of anhydrous
  eobaltoua   chloride  was sealed in a tube as before, and its spectrum
 observed while heat was applied.        No change could be detected in its
 passage through the critical point, and a careful comparison of the
 spectra of the same solution at 15° C. and at 300° C. showed no differ
 ence beyond the fainter and more nebulous character of the bands
 caused by expansion.       The position of the bands was not changed.
 Chloride of cobalt, however, was not well fitted for our purpose, the
 measurement of the bands being rather uncertain on account of the
 nebulous nature of their edges. At the suggestion of Professor Stokes,
 we turned our attention to the product of the decomposition of chloro
 phyll by acids.     The beautiful spectrum of a solution of this body in
 alcohol was quite permanent, even at a temperature of 350° C, although
 when heated in air it decomposes below 200° C.            A direct comparison
 of the hot and cold solutions failed to show any change in the position
of the lines.
    A good opportunity of testing the question further seemed to be
offered by the blue solution of sodium in liquefied ammonia, described
by Gore.*       To prepare this, we first tried compression of the gas by
the pressure apparatus, but the quantity of liquid got by this method
was too small for experiment.       We next tried a combination of Gore's
method with the pressure apparatus.          A tube, shaped as in the draw
 ing,  had   the  wide  part charged    with   chloride of calcium saturated
with ammonia, and the end sealed.           By applying slight heat, the air
was expelled by the liberated ammonia.           A small piece of sodium was
then placed in a pocket near the end of the experimental tube, and,
after sealing, the tube was placed in the pressure apparatus and sur
rounded with mercury.          The iron tube was now heated by flaming
with a Bunsen, and the experimental               tube cooled in a freezing
mixture. Distillation      of ammonia commenced, and when a sufficient
quantity of liquid was obtained the pressure screw was advanced,
until, coming in contact with the wide tube, it broke the narrow neck
joining it with the experimental tube, and allowed the mercury to
rush in and enclose the liquefied ammonia.            Further pressure brought
the ammonia in contact with the sodium and solution commenced, but
an unforeseen difficulty caused the experiment to fail, for the sodium
solution coming in contact with the mercury was rapidly decolorised
by it.     It was, therefore, necessary to dispense with the use of mer
cury.     Several methods were proposed, and we finally arrived at the
following simple and effective one. A piece of tubing, about $ inch
diameter, was joined to a piece of marine barometer tubing, and just
lieside the join the latter was drawn out to an exceedingly fine bore.
The wide tube was now charged with ammonia-saturated chloride of
                           * " Proc. Roy. Soc.," vol. XXL

  186             Messrs.   J.  B. Hannay and     J.  Hogarth.      [Feb. 26,
  calcium and the end sealed.       A small piece of solid paraffin was then
 dropped into     the capillary tube so that it lay next the drawn out
  portion.   When all air was expelled by heating slightly, a few frag
  ments of sodinm were placed in the tube and the whole sealed. The
 arrangement is shown in the Plate, fig. 3. The end containing the
 sodium     being placed in a freezing mixture, the wide tube was care
 fully heated until sufficient ammonia was distilled over. "When re-
 absorption commenced the fragment of paraffin was melted by the
 application of a very small flame, and capillary attraction caused
 it to run into the fine bore, where it solidified and prevented any
 passage of ammonia.        The tube now containing a solution of sodium
 in ammonia,      was next" cut off near the join and the end sealed
 in the blowpipe flame, the paraffin plug preventing outward pressure.
 On heating the tube thus prepared in the air bath, the bine colour
 disappeared before the critical point was reached, and the loss of
 colour was accompanied by the deposit of a white powder.              It was
 at first thought that this was due to the presence of water in the
 ammonia, but many experiments, in which every care was taken to
 have the ammonia perfectly dry, failed to give any other result.          In
 one case only, when the temperature        had been raised very rapidly, did
 the blue colour remain above the critical point, and this only for a few
seconds. This chemical action most probably consists in the formation
 of sodamide, and this view is supported by the fact that one of the
 tubes opened under mercury        gave a quantity of gas not dissolved by
 water.
    As the solution of an alkali metal      seemed best adapted for spectro
 scopic  examination,    we made    an  attempt to dissolve sodium in com
 pressed hydrogen.       For this purpose a tube with a very large expan
sion was made, and filled with carefully dried hydrogen.           While the
stream of gas was still passing, a small piece of sodium was placed
in  a pocket at the end of the tube, and the aperture closed before the
blowpipe.      In this experiment we used no manometer, our intention
being to increase the pressure slowly and to make it as great as
possible.    After about half an hour, at a pressure so far as we could
judge of about 300 atmospheres, the mercury, which had never come
in contact with the solid sodium, was observed to become thick and
pasty.     At this point the tube burst (no fnrther pressure had been
put on) close to the iron cap, and on examining the broken piece small
semi-solid globules of mercury were observed adhering to the glass,
 marking the highest point to which the mercury had reached. These
were taken out and placed in water, when small bubbles of gas were
observed rising from them.           In another experiment a small rod of
sodium, quite filling the capillary bore, was observed to be gradually
corroded, until only a shell adhering to the glass remained.        The very
frequent bursting     of  the  tubes, made   more  frail by the reduction of

  1880.]            On the Solubility    of Solids in    Gases.           187
 lead oxide, due to the action of hydrogen on the hot glass, makes the
 demonstration of the solnbility of sodium in hydrogen exceedingly
 difficult, but the phenomena described, we are convinced, can only be
 explained on this hypothesis.        In several experiments we have seen
 little pieces of sodium slowly disappear, leaving only the thin shell of
 oxide formed round them while they were being placed in ^he tube.
 There seemed in many cases to be a sudden chemical action, for the
 tube burst, not while pressure was being applied, but often several
 minutes after the pressure screw had been advanced.               A beam of
 light passed through the tube showed no absorption when examined
 by the spectroscope.
     Having described our experiments, it remains only for us to con
 sider the state of the solvent at a distance above the critical point.
 We cannot do better than quote Dr. Andrews' consideration of the
 subject.    He says,* "What is the condition of carbonic acid when it
 passes at temperatures above 31° C. from the gaseous state down to
 the volume of the liquid without giving evidence at any part of the
 process of liquefaction having occurred ? Does it continue in the
 gaseous state, or does it liquefy, or have we to deal with a new con
 dition of matter ? If the experiment were made at 100° C, or at a
higher temperature, when all indications of a fall had disappeared, the
probable answer that would be given to this question is, that the gas
preserves its gaseous condition during the compression, and few would
hesitate to declare this statement to be true, if the pressures, as in
batterer's experiments, were applied to such gases as hydrogen or
nitrogen. On the other hand, when the experiment is made with
carbonic acid at temperatures a little above 31° C, the great fall
which occurs at one period of the process would lead to the conjecture
that liquefaction had actually taken place, although optical tests care
fully applied failed at any time to discover the presence of a liquid in
contact with a gas. But against this view it may be urged with great
force, that the fact of additional pressure being always required for a
further diminution of volume, is opposed to the known laws which
hold in the change of bodies from the gaseous to the liquid state.
Besides, the higher the temperature at which the gas is compressed the
less the fall becomes, and at last it disappears."         Leaving out of con
sideration the solubility of sodium in hydrogen, we have had iodide of
potassium in solution in alcohol at temperatures much too high for
measurement by the mercurial thermometer, and which may safely be
estimated at 150° C. above the critical point (=380° C). We think
therefore we are justified in saying that at this high temperature the
solvent was truly gaseous. An examination of Dr. Andrews' curves
for carbonic acid shows us that at a temperature only 16° C. above the

critical point, the sudden fall in volume corresponding to the boiling
line has disappeared, and although the curve does not coincide with
the air curve, it is regular and shows no sign of liquefaction having
occurred.     Our experiments were made at temperatures further
removed from the critical point than this, and as no sudden change
in solubility could be detected in passing from the liquid state to these
high temperatures, we conclude that, in these experiments, we have
further proof of the perfect continuity of the liquid and gaseous
states, and also a complete proof of the solubility of solids in gases.

                          (Preliminary Notice.)
   "While pursuing my researches into the solubility of solids in gases.
I  noticed that many bodies, such as silica, alumina, and oxide of zinc,
which are insoluble in water at ordinary temperatures, dissolve to a
very considerable extent when treated with water-gas at a very high
pressure. It occurred to me that a solvent might be found for carbon ;
and as gaseous solution nearly always yields crystalline solid on with
drawing the solvent or lowering its solvent power, it seemed probable
that the carbon might be deposited in the crystalline state.     After a
large number of experiments, it was found that ordinary carbon, such
as charcoal, lampblack, or graphite, were not affected by the most
probable solvents   I could think of, chemical action taking the place
of solution.
    A curious reaction, however, was noticed, which seemed likely to
yield carbon in the nascent state, and so allow of its being easily dis
solved.    When a gas containing carbon and hydrogen is heated under
pressure in presence of certain metals its hydrogen is attracted by the
 metal, and its carbon left free. This, as Professor Stokes has sug
 gested to me, may be explained by the discovery of Professors Liveing
 and Dewar, that hydrogen has at very high temperatures a very
 strong affinity for certain metals, notably magnesium, forming ex
 tremely stable compounds therewith.
    When the carbon is set free from the hydrocarbon in presence of a
 stable compound containing nitrogen, the whole being near a red heat,
 and under a very high pressure, the carbon is so acted upon by the
 nitrogen compound that it is obtained in the clear, transparent form
 of the diamond.     The great difficulty lies in the construction of au

 inclosing vessel strong enough to withstand the enormous pressure
 and high temperature, tubes constructed on the gun-barrel principle
 (with a wrought iron coil), of only half an inch bore and four inches
 external diameter, being torn open in nine cases out of ten.
     The carbon obtained in the successful experiments is as hard as
 natural diamond, scratching all other crystals, and it does not affect
 polarised light. I have obtained crystals with curved faces belonging
 to the octahedral form, and diamond is the only substance crystal
 lising in this manner.        The crystals burn easily on thin platinum-foil
over a good blowpipe, and leave no residue, and after two days'
immersion in hydrofluoric acid they show no sign of dissolving, even
when boiled.         On heating a splinter in the electric arc, it turned
        —
black a very characteristic reaction of diamond.
     Lastly, a little apparatus was constructed for effecting a combustion
of the crystals and determining their composition.              The ordinary
organic analysis method was used, but the diamond crystals were laid
on a thin piece of platinum-foil, and this was ignited by an electric
current, and the combustion conducted in pure oxygen.              The result
obtained was, that the sample (14 mgrms.)          contained  97"85 per cent,
of carbon, a very close approximation, considering the small quantity
at my disposal.       The apparatns and all analyses will be fully described
in a future paper.

      OBITUARY NOTICES OF FELLOWS DECEASED.
   Charles Brooke was born on the 30th Jane, 1804. He was the
son   of the well-known mineralogist Mr. H. J. Brooke. His early
edncation was carried on at Chiswick, under Dr. Turner ; after this he
studied   at Rugby ; and from thence he went to Cambridge.             He
remained there five years, and graduated in Arts, taking honours as a
Wrangler.      During the latter part of this period he studied medicine,
and his professional education was completed at St. Bartholomew's.
He lectured for one or two sessions on surgery, at Dermott's School,
and afterwards held positions on the surgical staff of the Metropolitan
Free Hospital and the Westminster Hospital. At the latter he con
tinued to lecture till a short time before his death. In 1844 the
Royal College of Surgeons conferred on him an Honorary Fellowship ;
in 1847 he was elected Fellow of the Royal Society, at the evening
meetings of which ho was a very regular attendant, and frequent
speaker, especially on physical      questions.    He belonged to the
Meteorological     and Royal Microscopical Societies, and occupied the
President's chair in each of these bodies ; he also at various times
served on the management of the Royal Institution, and on the
Council of the Royal Botanical Society.      In addition to these he was
connected with many philanthropic and religious societies ; and was a
very active member of the Victoria Institute and Christian Medical
Association.
   He was much esteemed in his profession as a surgeon ; and is
known as the inventor, forty years ago, of the "bead suture,"
which was a great step in advance in the scientific treatment of deep
wounds.
   His pnblished papers and lectures have almost always pertained to
the department of physics, mathematical and experimental ; and his
more especial work was the inventing or perfecting of apparatus.
His papers date back to 1835, when he wrote upon the Motion of
Sound in Space ; but the work upon which his reputation mainly
rests was published between 1846 and 1852.         This was the invention
of  those  self-recording instruments   which   have been adopted at the
Royal Observatories of Greenwich, Paris, and other meteorological

                                       11
  stations.  They consisted of barometers, thermometers, psychrometers,
  and magnetometers       which registered their variations by means of
  photography.      His method obtained the premium offered by the
  Government for such apparatus, us well as a Council Medal from the
  Jurors of the Great Exhibition.         These instruments   record auto
  matically, by very beautiful arrangements, the continual changes in
  the dip and declination of the needle, and in the intensity of the
  magnetic force.     This could not be arrived at by any amount of per
  sonal  observation  ; and the movements     of a spot of light upon the
  revolving sheet of chemically prepared paper are more to be trusted
  than the perceptions of the human eye.           The adoption of these
  instruments at the Greenwich Observatory rendered it possible to
  reduce the staff of assistants and to dispense with night duty, while
  they revealed magnetic disturbances of a character which otherwise
 would prohably have escaped notice.             The perfecting of these
 apparatus involved many considerations         both of a mathematical,
 physical, and chemical nature, which will be found detailed in the
  " British Association Reports," from 1846 to 1849, and in the
  " Philosophical Transactions " of 1847, 1850, and 1852.
     Mr. Brooke also studied the theory of the microscope, and was the
 author of some inventions which facilitated the shifting of lenses, and
 improved the illumination of the bodies observed.        He also applied
 his improved methods to the investigation of some of the best known
 test objects of the microscope.       {See "Proc. Roy. Soc.," vol. vii,
 p. 139.)   In later years his papers were of a more theoretical character,
 bearing upon the dynamical theory of electricity, an the nature of
 electric energy, and on the supposititious character of that -ether which
 is assumed to pervade all matter and space.       These are to be found
               in       " Phil. Mag." for 1866, and in the " Proc.
 principally       the                                                Roy.
 Soc," vol. xv. He was also the author of various papers and lectures
 bearing on the relations of nat ural science and religion.
     He is, however, most popularly known by means of the " Elements
 of Natural Philosophy," originally compiled by Dr. Golding Bird, but
 which after the death of that physician was re-written and enlarged
 by Mr. Brooke on bringing out the fourth edition.        Since that time
new editions have been constantly called for ; the results of more
 recent discovery have been carefully added, and the book has remained
 a favourite    introduction to the study of the physical sciences,
especially in the medical schools.
    Mr. Brooke died at Weymouth on the 17th of May, 1879, leaving a
widow and family, and many friends who recognized him as one of the
most kindly and modest of men.         He will be remembered on account
of his pleasant     conversation, or his thoughtful advice, or the quiet
influence of his private life, by many who knew little or nothing of
his varied acquirements and ingenious inventions.

I. " Fired Gunpowder.         Note on the Existence of Potassium
       Hyposulphite in the Solid Residue of Fired Gunpowder."
       By Captain Noble (late R.A.), F.R.S., &c., and F. A. Abel,
       C.B., F.R.S., V.P.C.S.     Received February 24, 1880.
   In onr second memoir on fired gunpowder we have discussed in
detail that part of M. Berthelot's friendly criticism of our first
memoir     which relates to the potassium hyposulphite found by us, in
variable proportions, in our analyses of the solid products obtained by
the explosion of gunpowder in the manner described.       While pointing
out that we had taken every precaution     in our power  to guard against
the production of hyposulphite, by atmospheric action upon the po
tassium sulphide, during the removal of the hard masses of solid pro
ducts from the explosion vessel, and had effectually excluded air from
them, when once they were removed until they were submitted to
analysis, we admitted the impossibility of guarding against the acci
dental formation of some hyposulphite during the process of removal,
especially in some instances in which the structure of the residue had
certainly been favourable to atmospheric action, and in which a more
or Jess considerable development of heat had afforded indications of the
occurrence of oxidation.
    We contended, however, that the method of analysis, and the pre
 cautions adopted by us in carrying it out, precluded the possibility of
 accidental formation of hyposulphite at this stage of our investigations.
 With respect to the precautions, we could, and still do, speak with
 perfect confidence ; and we certainly have believed ourselves fully
 justified in being equally confident with respect to the process adopted
 by us for the determination of the proportions of sulphide and hypo
 sulphite, inasmuch as we accepted and used in its integrity the method
 published in 1857 by Bunsen and Scbischkoff in their classical memoir
 on the products of explosion of gunpowder, and adopted since that
 time by several other investigators who have made the explosion of
 gunpowder the subject of study, and whose results are referred to in
 our first memoir.
    Imposing implicit confidence in the trustworthiness of this method

  of analysis, emanating   as it did from one of the highest authorities in
  experimental research, we considered ourselves fully justified in main
  taining that the very considerable variations in the amount of hypo
  sulphite found in different analyses, carried out as nearly as possible
  under like conditions, and the high proportion of sulphide obtained
  in several of those analyses, afforded substantial proof that accidental
  oxidation during tho collection and analysis of the residues was not
  sufficient to account for all but the very small quantities of hypo
  sulphite, which, in M. Berthelot's view, could have pre-existed in the
 powder residues. Other facts established by the exhaustive series of
 experiments detailed in our first memoir, were referred to by us in
 our second memoir in support of the above conclusion (from which we
 have still no reason whatever to depart). At the same time we de
 scribed a series of supplementary experiments which had been instituted
 by us, with a view to obtain, if possible, further decisive evidence as
 to the probable proportions of hyposnlphite and sulphide actually
 existing in the residues furnished by the explosion of gunpowder in
 closed vessels.
     In the first place, the residues obtained by the explosion of charges
 of R.L.G. and pebble powders were submitted to special treatment.
 Portions of each, consisting exclusively of large masses, were very
 speedily detached and removed from the explosion vessels, and sealed
 up in bottles freed from oxygen, having been exposed to the air only
for a few seconds. Other portions of the same residues were very
finely ground and exposed to the air for 48 hours.       As was stated in
our recent memoir, the portions of the residues treated in the last-
named manner contained very large proportions of hyposulphite
 (although in one of them there still remained about 3 per cent, of
sulphide) while those portions which had been for only a brief period
exposed to air (and which presented but small surfaces) were found
to contain from 5 to 8'5 per cent, of hyposulphite.        As, throughout
oar entire series of previous experiments, no accidental circumstances
had occurred which even distantly approached the special conditions
favourable to the oxidation of the sulphide presented in these par
ticular experiments, we considered ourselves fully justified in con
cluding that the non-discovery of any snlphides in the analyses of
residues furnished by the fine grain powder in three out of the whole
series of experiments, was not due to accident in the manipulations ;
and that in those instances, in our several series of experiments, in
which large quantities of hyposulphite were found, the greater pro
portion of that substance must have existed before the removal of the
residues from the explosion vessel.
    Not suffering the question to rest there, however, we proceeded, in
the second place, to adopt new precautions, in two special experi
ments, for guarding against the possible formation of hyposulphite in
                                                              p'2

the removal of the residues from the explosion       vessel, and their pre
paration for analysis.
   Distilled water, carefully freed from air by long continued
boiling, was syphoned into the vessel when it had cooled after the
explosion, and thus no air was ever allowed to come into contact with
the solid products.    When the vessel was quite filled with water it
was closed, and, after having been left at rest for a sufficient time to
allow the residue to dissolve completely, the solution was rapidly
transferred to bottles which had been freed from oxygen.              These,
when completely filled with the liquid, were hermetically sealed until
the contents were submitted to analysis in accordance with the usual
method, when they furnished respectively 4 and 6 per cent, of hypo
sulphite.   These results corresponded closely to others obtained by the
analysis of seven residues obtained in experiments with P., R.L.G.,
and L.G. powders, in which there were no peculiarities assignable as a
possible reason why the proportions of hyposulphite should be so
much lower, in these cases, than in other experiments carried out
with the same powders under as nearly as possible the same con
ditions.
   By the results obtained under the various conditions pointed out in
the foregoing, we were forced to the conclusion that the discovery of
a small or a larger proportion of hyposulphite by the analysis of the
powder residue, obtained as described, is consequent upon some slight
variation (apparently not within the operator's control) attending
the explosion itself ; but that hyposulphite does exist, though generally
not to anything like the extent we were at first led to believe, as
a normal and not unimportant product of the explosion of powder in
a closed space.
    Some time after the submission of our second memoir to the Roy al
 Society, we received a communication from Professor Debus, which
has led us to institute a further series of experiments bearing upon
this question of the existence of hyposulphite, and the results we
 have arrived at have led us so greatly to modify our views on this
 point, that it is our duty to communicate them without loss of time
 to the Royal Society.
    As introductory to these, it is necessary to repeat the account, given
 in our first memoir, of the method pursued by us for determining the
 proportions of potassium monosulphide and hyposulphite in a powder
 residue.
    The solution of the residue, prepared by the several methods already
 described, was separated by filtration, as rapidly as possible, from the
 insoluble portion, the liquid being collected in a flask in which it was
 at once brought into contact with pnre ignited copper oxide.             The
 solution and oxide were agitated together, from time to time, in the
 closed flask, the two being allowed to remain together     until the  liquid

1880.]                      Fired Gunpowder.                        201
was perfectly colourless.    In a few instances the oxide was added in
small quantities at a time, in others the sufficient excess was added
at once, with no difference in the result obtained.     The only points
in which this method differed from that described by Bunsen and
Schischkoff in their memoir, was in the employment of a flask well
closed with an india-rubber bung for the stoppered cylinder which
was employed by them ; and in occasionally curtailing somewhat the
prescribed period (two days) for which the liquid and the copper
oxide were allowed to remain together, the operation being considered
complete when the solution had become colourless.          Bunsen and
Schischkoff prescribed that the liquid when separated by filtration
from the mixed copper oxide and sulphide obtained in the foregoing
treatment, is to be divided into seven equal volumes,' in one of which
the amount of hyposulphite may be most simply estimated by acidi
fying it with acetic acid, and then titrating with a standard iodine
solution. This course was adopted by us, and it will therefore be
seen that we departed in no essential point whatever from the method
of Bunsen and Schischkoff, which we had considered ourselves fully
warranted in adopting, without questioning its trustworthiness.
   We were informed, however, last July by Dr. Debus, that in sub
mitting potassium polysulphides to treatment with copper oxide, he
had found much hyposulphite to be produced, even when air was
perfectly excluded, it having been in the first instance ascertained
that the several polysulphides experimented with did not contain any
trace of hyposulphite.     We proceeded at once to confirm the correct
ness of his observations, by submitting potassium polysulphides to
treatment with copper oxide, proceeding exactly according to the
method prescribed by Bunsen and Schischkoff for the treatment of
powder residues.      In one experiment we obtained as much as 87'1
per   cent, of potassium hyposulphite (calculated upon 100 parts of
potassium monosulphide). Even in an experiment with pure potas
sium monosulphide, we obtained 11"6 per cent, of hyposulphite upon
its treatment for the usual period with copper oxide.
   We next proceeded to convince ourselves that by substituting zinc
chloride solution for copper oxide, the sulphur existing iu solutions
of potassium mono- and poly-sulphides might be abstracted, accord
ing to the usual method of operation, without producing more than
the very small quantities of hyposulphite ascribable to the access of
a little air to the sulphides before or during the method of treatment.
   Having confirmed the validity of Dr. Debus' objection to Bunsen
and Schischkoff 's method, and established the trustworthiness of a
modification of that method (zinc chloride being substituted for copper
oxide), we proceeded to submit to precisely similar treatment with
these two reagents portions of solutions obtained by dissolving, with
total exclusion of air (in the manner described in our last memoir

   Iu  reference to the foregoing numerical statements, we have to offer
the following observation : —
   1.  Substituting zinc chloride for copper oxide as the precipitant
of the sulphur which existed in the form of sulphide in solutions of
powder residues to which air had not had access at all, until the time
of its treatment with the zinc chloride, the amount of hyposulphite
existing in solution after such treatment was found to range from
0'05 to 0-78 in 100 parts of gunpowder, while the treatment of por»
tions of the same solutions with copper oxide, in the precise manner
adopted in our series of experiments, yielded proportions ranging from
1*38 to 2-39 per 100 of powder used. Comparing the results furnished
by the two modes of treatment, it will be seen that in the case of the
parallel experiments (245), which exhibited the least considerable
difference in the amount of hyposulphite found, that existing after the
copper oxide treatment was about sixteen times greater, while in the
case of the highest difference (Experiment 241) it was about thirty,
four times greater than that found after the treatment with the zinc
chloride.
   2. It would appear from these results that, in four or five out of
seven experiments, no hyposulphite,       or at any rate only minute
quantities, existed in the residues previous to their solution, and
although it would seem to have existed in very appreciable amount
in two out of seven residues, the highest proportion found after the
zinc chloride treatment was less than one-half the lowest proportion
found in our complete series of analyses in which the copper oxide
treatment was adopted.
   3. A comparison of the results among each other leads, therefore, to
the conclusion that potassium hyposulphite cannot be regarded as a
normal constituent of powder residue (obtained in experiments such
as those carried out by us), and that M. Berthelot is correct in re
garding this salt as an accidental product, which, if existing occa
sionally in appreciable amount in the solid matter previous to its
removal from the explosion vessel, is formed under exceptional con
ditions, and then only in comparatively small proportions.
   While submitting this as the conclusion to be drawn from our most
recent experiments,      we are of opinion that the following points
deserve consideration in connexion with the question whether hypo
sulphite may not, after all, occasionally exist, as the result of a
secondary reaction, in comparatively large proportion in the explosion
vessel before the residue is removed.
   It will be observed that although the copper oxide treatment, when
applied to the sulphide in the pure condition (tie., undilnted with the
other potassium compounds found in powder residue), gave rise
to the production of very large proportions of hyposulphite, when
polysulphides were used, the highest proportion of that substance

found, after the treatment  of the particular residues used in the ex
periments given in Table I, only amounts to 2 82 per cent, upon the
gunpowder (pebble powder) employed, which corresponds to about
14"5 per cent, of the average proportion of monosulphide existing in
the residue furnished by that powder.      In observing this, it must
be borne in mind that the sulphide existing in powder residue is
always present, in part, and sometimes to a considerable extent, in
the form of polysulphide, also, that the experiments with the sul
phides were conducted precisely according to the method pursued in
the treatment of the powder residues.      It would appear, therefore,
as though the mixture of the sulphide with a very large proportion
of other salts in solution rendered it less prone to oxidation by the
copper oxide than when the undiluted sulphide is submitted to its
action.                                                                   >
  In comparing with      the results furnished by the zinc chloride those
obtained   by   the   copper oxide treatment, in the special experiments
given above, it is observed that, omitting one exceptional result
 (No. 241) for which we do not attempt to account, the highest pro
portions of hyposulphite are furnished by those residues which also
gave the highest with the zinc chloride, the differences between the
results furnished by the two treatments being likewise the highest in
these three cases ; so also the lowest proportions furnished by the copper
oxide treatment, correspond to the lowest obtained with the zinc
oxide, and the differences between the results furnished by the two
methods are in the same manner the lowest in these. It would almost
appear, therefore, as though the existence of a very appreciable pro
portion of hyposulphite in the solution of the residue had some effect
in promoting the production of hyposulphite when the residue is sub
mitted to treatment with copper oxide.
   In a recalculation of the results of our analyses of the powder
residues upon the (assumption that the whole of the hyposulphite
obtained existed originally as monosulphide,         it is found that, in
several instances in which the proportion of hyposulphite was high,
the analytical results are much less in accordance with each other
than when it is assumed that the hyposulphite found, or at any rate a
very large proportion of      it, existed as such in the residue before
removal from the explosion vessel. Thus, taking the F.G. series, in
which the mean quantity of hyposulphite actually found    is  about double
of that obtained either from the pebble or R.L.G. powders, select
ing from this series the three experiments which gave the highest
proportions of hyposulphite, and calculating in the manner described
in our first memoir the total quantities both of solid and gaseous pro
ducts, first from the basis of the analysis of the solid products, secondly
from the basis of the analysis of the gaseous products, and further on
the assumption that the hyposulphite found existed as hyposulphite

     Lastly, we still think that the following facts, given in our second
 memoir, must not be overlooked in considering the question of possible
occasional existence of considerable proportions of hyposulphite, viz.,
 that " the production of high proportions of hyposulphite was but
 little affected by any variations in the circumstances attending the
 several explosives (i.e., whether the space in which the powder was
 exploded were great or small), excepting that the amount was high in
 all three cases wben the powder was exploded in the largest space ; on
 the other hand, a great reduction in the size of grain of the gun
 powder used appeared to have a great influence upon the production
¦of hyposulphite, as when       passing from a very large grain powder
 (P.   or R.L.G.)  to a fine grain powder (F.G.).    Thus, the production
of hyposulphite exceeded 20 per       cent, (on the solid residue) in only
 3 out of 9 experiments with P. powder, in 3 out of 10, with R.L.G.,
 and in 7 out of 9 with F.G. ; while it was below 10 per cent, in 4 out
 of 9 experiments with P. powder, in 5 out of 10 with R.G.L., and in
 only 1 out of 9 with F.G. powder." The experiments made with these
 several powders followed in no particular order, and no circumstance
•existed   in connexion with them to which these great differences in the
 results obtained could be ascribed.
     We append a recalculation of the mean results of our three series
 of analysis, adding the values of the hyposulphite found, as mono-
 sulphide, to the amount of sulphide actually found, and we hope to be
allowed to add to our second memoir a similar recalculation of the
 whole of our analyses.
     This recalculation develops (as we pointed out in our second
 memoir must necessarily be the case) a more or less considerable
¦deficiency of oxygen in the total products of explosion ; there is,
 however, in every instance, also a deficiency of hydrogen, and it may,
 therefore, be reasonably concluded that the deficiencies in the total
¦quantities of the oxygen and the hydrogen in the powder used, which
.are unaccounted for in the products found, on the assumption that
 variable proportions of the total hyposulphite found actually existed
 in the residues as sulphide, are properly accounted for by assuming
 that the missing quantities of these elements actually existed among
 the products as water, the amount of which it was obviously im
 possible to determine.
     In conclusion, we have to state that we considered it right, in con
 sequence of the error discovered in the method adopted for the
 examination for hyposulphite, to repeat the experiments described in
¦our first memoir as having been made by us, with the view of
 ascertaining whether hyposulphite could exist at temperatures
approaching those to which the solid products of explosion were
Actually subjected in the explosion vessels in our experiments.

quarter of an hour, to the highest heat (about 1,700° C.) of a Siemens
regenerative furnace, two platinum crucibles, one filled with powder
residue, the other with potassium hyposulphite.      At the conclusion of
the exposure, and while the crucibles were still red hot, they were
plunged into water, deprived of air by long-continued boiling, and at
once sealed.    The powder residue was found still to contain 1'27 per
cent, of hyposulphite, while the crucible with the pure salt consisted
of a mixture of sulphate and sulphide, but with an amount of 2-l per
cent, of hyposulphite.
   It is probable that, if the exposure had been still longer continued,
the hyposulphite would have altogether disappeared, and the experi
ment can only be taken as proving that the hyposulphite, especially if
mixed with other salts, is neither quickly nor readily decomposed,
even at very high temperatures.

Siemens of the dynamo-electric or accumulative principle of generating
currents, makes reference to the two papers on the subject presented,
the one by Sir Charles Wheatstone and the other by himself, to the
Royal Society in February, 1867.        The machine then designed by
him, and shown in operation on that occasion, is again brought
forward with a view of indicating the progress that has since taken
place in the construction of dynamo-electrical     machines, particularlr
those by Gramme and Siemens-von Alteneck.          The paper next points
out certain drawbacks to the use of these machines, both of them
being subject to the disadvantage that an increase of external resist
ance causes a falling off of the current ; and that, on the other hand,
the short circuiting of the outer resistance, through contact between
the carbon electrodes of an electric lamp, very much increases the
electric excitement of the machine, and the power necessary to main
tain its motion, giving rise to rapid heating and destructive sparks in
the machine itself.
   An observation in Sir Charles Wheatstone's paper is referred to,
pointing to the fact that a powerful current is set up in the shunt
circuit of a dynamo-electric machine, which circumstance has since
been taken advantage of to some extent by Mr. Ladd and Mr. Brash,
in constructing current generators.
   The principal object of the paper is to establish the conditions under

  1880.]              On the Dynamo-Electric     Current.              209
  which dynamo-electric    machines worked on the shnnt principle can be
 made to give maximum results.        A series of tables and diagrams are
  given, the results of experiments conducted by Mr. Lauckert, elec
 trician, employed at the author's works, which lead up to the conclusion
  that, in constructing such machines on the shunt principle, the resist
  ance on the rotating helix has to be considerably reduced by increas
 ing the thickness of the wire employed, and that on the magnets has to
 be increased more than tenfold, not by the employment of thin wire,
 but by augmenting the length and weight of coil wire employed.
     The results of this mode of distributing the resistances is sum
 marised as follows : —
     1. That the electro-motive   force, instead of diminishing w;th in
 creased resistance, increases at first rapidly, and then more slowly
 towards an asymptote.
    2. That the current in the outer circuit is actually greater for a
 unit and a half resistance than for one unit.
    3. With an external resistance of one unit, which is about equiva
 lent to an electric arc, when thirty or forty webers are passing through
 it, 2-44 horse-power is expended, of which l-29 horse-power is usefully
employed, proving an efficiency of 53 per cent., as compared with 45
 per cent, in the case of the ordinary dynamo-machine.
    4. That the maximum energy which can be demanded from the
engine is 2' 6 horse-power, so that but a small margin of power is
needed to suffice for the greatest possible requirement.
    5. That the maximum energy which can be injuriously transferred
 into heat in the machine itself is 1"3 horse-power, so that there is no
 fear here of destroying the insulation of the helix by excessive heating.
    6. That the maximum      current is approximately that which would
be habitually used, and which the commutator and collecting brushes
are quite capable of transmitting.
    Hence the author concludes that the new machine will give a steadier
light than the old one with greater average economy of power, that it
will be less liable to derangement, and may be driven without variation
of speed by a smaller engine ; also that the new machine is free from
 all objection when used for the purpose of electro-deposition.
    This construction of machine enables the author to effect an im
portant simplification of the regulator to work electric lamps, enabling
him to dispense with all wheel and clockwork in the arrangement.
The two carbons being pushed onward by gravity or spring power
are checked laterally by a pointed metallic abutment situated at such
a distance from the arc itself, that the heat is only just sufficient to
cause the gradual wasting away of the carbon in contact with atmo
spheric air. The carbon holders are connected to the iron core of a
solenoid coil, of a resistance equal to about 50 times that of the arc,
the ends of which coil are connected to the two electrodes respectively.

 The weight of the core (which may be varied), determines the force
 of current that has to pass through the regulating coil in order to
 keep the weight in suspension, and this in its turn is dependent upon
 the resistance of the arc.     The result is that the length of the arc is
 regulated automatically,      so  as to maintain a uniform resistance
  signifying a uniform development of light.
 III.  " On the Influence of Electric Light upon Vegetation, and
       on certain Physical Principles involved."          By C. William
       Siemens, D.C.L., LL.D., F.R.S. Received March 1, 1880.
    Although according to Ste. Claire Deville the dissociation of CO*
 and H20 at atmospheric pressure commences at a temperature not
 exceeding 1,200° C, the reverse action, namely, combustion, continues
 to be sufficiently active to increase the heat of a flame until a tempera
 ture of probably 2,200° C. is reached, of which the Deville oxygen
blast and the regenerative gas-furnace furnish examples.
    In the working out of a process, by means of which steel and fused
iron are produced in large masses on the open hearth of the regenera
tive gas-furnace, I have had frequent opportunities of observing the
utmost limit of temperature practically attainable by means of the
combustion of carbonaceous substances.         The heat of that furnace is
not dependent upon a blast or upon chimney draught, and the pres
sure   within the furnace balances the external atmospheric pressure so
completely that the large working doors may be opened occasionally
for inspecting the metal.        On these occasions it may frequently be
observed that serrated clouds of highly heated combustible            gases
pass through the furnace chamber (as may be seen through obscured
or coloured glasses) without suffering apparently any diminution
through contact with an excess of heated oxygen, showing that the
limit of furnace heat, or the point of complete dissociation, has been
nearly reached.
    When thus brought face to face with the utmost limit of heat
attainable by combustion, it is surprising how slight is the incon
venience (in the absence of heated matter flying about) experienced
in approaching the open furnace, and how much higher must be the
temperature of the sun or of the electric arc when the effects of
distant radiation suffice to break up compounds such as nitrate of
                                              I
silver in a few seconds. Some years ago undertook certain experi
mental inquiries having for their object to study the effect of radiant
energy upon the ordinary products of combustion, C02 and H20,
presenting them in an extremely rarefied conditon to solar and electric

radiation, which, inquiries were not however carried far enough to
furnish absolute results.     They served me, however, for a stepping
stone to the subject  of my present communication.
   The vast development of vegetation proves that dissociation is
accomplished freely within the leaf-cells of plants, in which both water
and carbonic acid are broken up in order that chlorophyl, starch, and
cellulose may be formed.    It is well known that this reaction depends
upon solar radiation ; but the question may fairly be asked whether it
is confined to that agency, or whether other sources of light and heat,
which in common with the sun exceed the temperature of dissociation,
may not be called into requisition, in order to continue the action of
growth, when that great luminary has set or is hidden behind clouds ?
   About two years ago I mentioned to Sir Joseph Hooker, then Pre
sident of the Royal Society, that     I
                                      thought the electric arc might be
found sufficiently powerful to promote vegetation, and that should     I
be   willing   to undertake    some experiments      on   the   subject,   if     he
could give me any           hope of confirmative   results. Sir Joseph
Hooker gave me sufficient encouragement to induce me to follow up
the subject, and I have since that time gradually matured a plan for
conducting the experiment.      Operations were commenced only at the
beginning of the year, and although the results are necessarily in
complete, they are nevertheless sufficiently positive and remarkable to
make them perhaps acceptable to the Royal Society as a preliminary
communication on the subject.     I was induced to look for interesting
results in these experiments on account of the great abundance of
blue and actinic rays in the electric arc, upon which its value in-
photography depends. In experimenting with powerful electric lamps
for illuminating purposes,     I
                              have been struck moreover by the action
produced upon    the  skin, which is blistered, without the sensation of
excessive heat at the time, an effect analogous to that produced by
solar rays in a clear atmosphere.

               Experiments on Effect of Electric Light on Plants.
     My object in making these experiments was to ascertain whether
 electric light exercised any decided effect npon the growth of plants.
 For this purpose I placed the regulator in' a lamp with a metallic
 reflector,   in the open air, about       2 metres above the glass           of a sunk
 melon house. A considerable number of pots were provided, sown
 and planted with quick-growing seeds and plants, such as mustard,
 carrots, swedes, beans, cucumbers, and melons. The plants could then
 be brought at suitable intervals under the influence of daylight and
 electric light, without moving them, both falling upon them approxi
 mately at the same angle.           The pots were divided into four groups.
    1. One pot of each group was kept entirely in the dark.
    2. One was exposed to the influence           of the electric light only.
    3. One was exposed to the influence of daylight only.
    4. One was exposed successively to both day and electric light.
    The electric light was supplied for six hours, from 5 to 11 each
 evening, all the plants being left in darkness during the remainder of
 the night.
    In all cases the differences of effect were unmistakable.                The plants
 kept   in   the   dark  were   pale yellow,    thin  in the   stalk,  and   soon died.
Those exposed to electric light only showed a light-green leaf, and
 had sufficient vigour to survive.         Those exposed to daylight only were
 of a darker green and greater vigour. Those exposed to both sources
 of light showed a decided superiority in vigour over all the others,
and the green of the leaf was of a dark rich hue.
    It must be remembered that, in this contest of electric against
solar light, the time of exposure was in favour of the latter in the
proportion of nearly 2 to 1, but all allowance made, daylight appeared
to be about twice as effective as electric light. It was evident, how
ever, that the electric light was not well placed for giving out its
power advantageously.            The nights being cold, and the plants under
experiment for the most part of a character to require a hot moist
atmosphere, the glass was covered very thickly with moisture, which
greatly obstructed the action of the light, besides which, the electric
light had to pass through the glass of its own lamp.* Notwithstanding
these drawbacks, electric light was clearly sufficiently powerful to
form chlorophyl and its derivatives in the plants.                It was interesting
to observe that the mustard-seed stem, when placed obliquely, turned
completely towards the light in the course of two or three hours, and
that cucumber and melon plants were affected in the same way, though
at a slower rate.        The cucumber and melon plants which have been
   * Professor   Stokes has shown, in 1853, that the electric arc is particularly rich in
highly   refrangible invisible rays, but that on passing the rays through glass,       all
those of high refrangibility  are found to have been absorbed.

exposed to both day and electric light have made great progress, and
my gardener, Mr. D. Buchanan, says that he could not have bronght
on the latter, without the aid of electric light, during the early winter.
Some of these commenced to blossom on the 14th of February.
   These preliminary trials go to prove that electric light can be
utilized in aid of solar light by placing it over greenhouses, but the
loss of effect in such cases must be considerable. I, therefore, directed
my observations, in the next place, to the effect of electric light upon
plants, when both were placed in the same apartment. A section of the
melon house, already referred to (7' 3" x 3' 3", 2'21 m. x 0-19 m.), was
completely darkened by being covered in with thick matting, and was
whitewashed     inside.  The electric light was placed over the entrance
door, and shelves were put down, in a horse-shoe form, to receive the
pots containing the plants to be exposed to the action of electric
light, the plants being placed at distances from the lamp varying from
(>5 metre to 2 metres.     Upon the first occasion of trying the naked
electric light  in this manner,  some of the plants, and especially some
melon and cucumber plants, from 20 centims. to 40 centims. in height,
which were within a metre distance from the lamp, commenced to
snffer ; those leaves which were directly opposite the light turning up
at the edges and presenting a scorched appearance. On subsequent
nights, therefore, the stands were so arranged that the distance of the
plants from the light varied from 1*5 metres to 23 metres. The
plants under experiment were divided into three groups ; one group
was exposed to daylight alone, a second similar group was exposed
to electric light during eleven hours of the night, and were kept in
 the dark chamber dnring the day time, and the third similar group
was exposed to eleven hours' day and eleven hours' electric light.
These experiments were continued during four days and nights con
secutively, and the results observed are of a very striking and decisive
character, as regards the behaviour of such quick-growing plants as
mustard, carrots, &c.     The experiment was unsatisfactory in this one
respect, that dnring the third night the gas-engine working the
dynamo-machine came to a standstill, owing to a stoppage in one of
the gas channels, and thus more than half the electric-light influence
that night was lost to the plants.      But, notwithstanding this draw
back, the two groups of plants showed unmistakably the beneficial
influence of electric light. The plants that had been exposed to day
light alone (comprising a fair proportion of sunlight) presented their
usually healthy green appearance ; those exposed to electric light
alone were, in most instances, of a somewhat lighter, but, in one
instance, of a somewhat darker hue than those exposed to dayhglit ;
and all the plants that hail the double benefit of day and electric
light far surpassed the others in darkness of green and vigorous
appearance generally.     A  fear had been expressed that the melon and

cucumber plants, which had been scorched by excess of electric light
on the first evening, would droop or die if further exposed to that
agency, but I insisted upon their being placed within the influence of
the electric light, at a distance from it exceeding 2 metres, and all
of them have shown signs of recovery, throwing out fresh leaves and
pearls of moisture at their edges.      A pot of tulip buds was placed in
this electric stove, and the flowers were observed to open completely
after two hours' exposure.
    One object I had in view in this experiment, was to observe whether
the carbonic    acid and nitrogenous compounds produced within the
electric arc exercised any deleterious action upon the plants.     All con
tinuous access of air into the stove was closed, and in order to prevent
excessive accumulation     of heat, the stove pipes were thickly covered
with matting and wet leaves.           But although the access of stove
heat was thus virtually stopped, the temperature of the house was
maintained throughout the night at 72° F., proving that the electric
lamp furnished not only a supply of effective light, bnt of stove heat
also. No hurtful effect was moreover observed on the plants from the
want of ventilation, and it would appear probable that the supply of
(jure carbonic acid resulting from the complete combustion of the
carbon electrodes at high temperature, and under the influence of an
excess of oxygen, sufficed to sustain their vital functions.         If the
nitrogenous compounds which Professor Dewar has shown to be de
veloped in the electric arc were produced in lar<;e quantities, injurious
effects upon the plants must undoubtedly ensue, but it can be shown
that in a well-conditioned electric lamp, with a free circulation of air
round the carbon electrodes, the amount of these products is ex
ceedingly small, and of a different nature than is produced in a con
fined space.     They could not indeed be perceived by their smell in
 the stove, when all ventilators were closed, and no injurious effects
from them have hitherto been observed in the plants.
    These experiments are not only instructive in proving the sufficiency
 of electric light alone to promote vegetation, but they also go to prove
 the important fact that diurnal repose is not necessary for the life of
 plants, although the duration of the experiments is too limited perhaps
 to fnrnish that proof in an absolute maimer.         It may, however, be
 argued    from  analogy, that such   repose is  not necessary, seeing that
 crops grow and ripen in a wonderfully short space of time in the
 northern regions of Sweden and Norway, and Finland, where the
 summer does not exceed two months, during which period the sun
 scarcely sets.
     The next step in the course of theso experiments was to remove the
  electric lamp into a palm house, constructed of framed glass, which was
  28 ft. 3 in. long, 14 ft. 6 in. wide, and averaging 14 ft. 6 in.
  (8  62 m.   x 14 42 m.  x 4 42) in height.    In the centre of this houst

a banana palm, and     a few other small palm treeB are planted, the sides
of the house all round being occupied with a considerable variety of
 flowering plants.    The electric light was fixed as high as practicable
at the south corner of the house, in order that its rays might fall upon
the plants from a direction and at an angle coincident with those of
 the sun during the middle of the day.              A metal reflector was
 placed behind the lamp in order to utilize the electric rays as
much as possible.       Along the eastern side of the house are some
young vines, having their roots in a bed outside.            Three pots of
 nectarine plants, just beginning to bud, were placed on the floor at
various distances from the electric light, and also some rose plants,
geraniums, orchids, Ac. The temperature of the house was maintained
at 65 F., and the electric lamp was kept alight from 5 p.m. to 6 a.m.,
for one week, from February 18th to February 24th, excepting
 Sunday night. The time was hardly sufficient to produce very strik
ing effects, but all the plants continued to present a healthy ap
pearance.     Of three Alicante vines, the one nearest the electric light
made most progress, and the same could be said of the nectarines and
roses.    It was observed that other plants, such as geraniums, con
tinued to exhibit a vigorous appearance, notwithstanding the heat of
the place. The electric light appeared to impart the vitality neces
sary to prevent a collapse of the organism through excessive tempera
ture. This experiment is of importance in showing that the electric
light if put into conservatories or greenhouses does not injure the
plants, but rather improves their appearance and growth. The leaves
assume a darker and more vigorous appearance, and it seems that
the colouring of the flowers becomes more vivid, but a further period
of time is necessary to establish this observation absolutely.          The
effects producible by electric light in conservatories is very striking,
owing to the clear definition of form and colour produced, far exceeding
that of ordinary daylight.
    No fnrther results of any particular interest could be expected from
a continuance of this experiment, and        I  decided to try the effect of
electric light as a means of promoting growth in the open air and
under glass at the same time. The regulator was put back into its
first position, 2 metres above the ground, with a sunken melon house
on one side, and a sunken house containing roses, lilies, strawberries,
and a variety of other plants on the other.           The space of ground
between these, about     1  metre broad, and    7 metres long, was covered
with boxes sown with early vegetables, including mustard,       peas, beans,
and potatoes, and in order to prevent cold winds from injuring the
plants, low protecting walls were put up across the openings of the
passage between the two houses. The effect of electric light could
thus be observed at the same time, upon the melon and cucumber
plants in the one house, upon the roses, strawberries, <fcc, at aD
                                                               Q2

inferior temperature in the other, and upon the early vegetables un
provided with covering.
   Some weeks must elapse before any absolute results can be given,
but growth is evidently promoted under all these various circum
stances.    In order to test this clearly, a portion of the plants both
under glass and in the open air are shaded from the electric light
without removing them from their position of equal temperature,
and exposed to solar light during daytime.           The effect upon the
flowering plants is very striking, electric light being apparently
more efficacious to bring them on than daylight.             Although the
amount of heat given off from the electric arc is not great compared
with a gas flame (giving off its products of combustion), yet the rays
of intense heat of the arc counteract that loss of heat by radiation
from the leaves into space, whicli during a clear night causes hoar
frost.   For this reason I expect that electric light may be usefully
employed in front of fruit walls, in orchards and in kitchen gardens,
to save the fruit-bud at the time of setting; and in this application
electric light will probably be found a useful agent not only to pro
mote rapid growth, but to insure a better yield of fruit.       Experience
alone can determine absolutely the effect of electric light upon the
ripening of delicate fruit, but considering its evident power to form
chlorophyl, there seems no reason to suppose that its action would not
also in this case resemble that of the sun, and that saccharine matter,
and more especially the aromatic constituents, would be produced.         In
this conntry solar light is too often found insufficient to ripen the
fruit or even the wood of fruit trees during the short summer months ;
and I believe that electric light will be found a most useful auxiliary
to solar light to effect the production of ripe and aromatic fruit botb
under glass and in the open air.
                  Estimated Cost of Electro-Horticulture.
   A very important question is that of the cost of clectro-horticultnre.
 This will depend in a great measure upon the cost of the fuel or other
 source of energy, and upon the scale of application.         To work only
 one electric lamp by means of a small steam or gas engine is expensive
 both in fuel and in cost of attendance.    If steam-power has to be re
 sorted to, an engine of sufficient size should be employed to give
 economical results per horse- power of energy produced, and the electric
 arc should be of sufficient brilliancy to give a good effect for the power
 expended.    Experience in electric illumination has established a form
 and size of machine, both convenient and suitable for the attainment
 of economical resnlts, viz., the medium dynamo-electric           machine,
 which, if applied to a suitable regulator, produces fully 6,000 candle-
 power of diffused light with an expenditure of 4 horse-power.
    The experiments before given show that the most effective         height

about 2 metres.       By providing a metallic reflector, and thus throwing

protection of a tin plate or other reflector.         In operating upon an ex
tended surface several lamps should be placed at such distances apart,
as to make the effect over it tolerably uniform. The effect of radiation
would lie equally distributed over the ground if the radiating centres
were placed at distances apart equal to double their height above the
ground   ;  for under these circumstances         a square foot of surface mid
way between them would receive from each centre one-half the number
of rays falling upon such a surface immediately below a centre.               A
plant at the intermediate point would, however, have the advantage
of presenting a larger leaf surface to the two sources of light ; and in
order to compensate for this advantage, the light centres may be
placed considerably further apart, say at distances equal to three times
their elevation, or 18 metres. Nine lights so placed would cover an area
54 metres     square, or just about       | acre.   If this space was enclosed
with a high fruit wall (as shown with the lamp centres marked in the
accompanying sketch), this will also get the full benefit of electric
radiation, and would serve at the same time to protect the plants from
winds.     Protection against injury from this latter cause might be
further carried out with advantage by following plan adopted (with
excellent results     I  believe) by Sir William Armstrong, that of sub
dividing    the  area   under    forced cultivation by vertical partitions of
glass.
   The engine-power necessary to maintain this radiant action would
be 9x4=30 horse-power,             involving the consumption of 30x2i =
00 lbs. of fuel per hour, or say, for a night of 12 hours (with an
allowance of 40 lbs. for getting up steam) 10 cwt., which, at sixteen
shillings per ton, would cost eight shillings.          This expenditure would
not include, however, the cost of carbons and of an attendant, which
would probably amount to another eight shillings, making a total of

218             Influence  of Electric Light  upon Vegetation.    [Mar.  4T
sixteen shillings.     If, however, an engine can be found doing other
descriptions of work during the day time, the cost of steam power
and attendance for the night-work            only would be considerably
reduced.     In the calculation just given, I have assumed the employ
ment of fuel for the production of mechanical energy, whereas the
question will assume a totally different aspect if natural sources of
power, such as waterfalls, can be made available within the reasonable
distance of halt-a-mile.     The expenditure for energy will, in that case,
be almost entirely saved, and that of attendance be greatly diminished,
and under such circumstances         it seems  probable that electro-horti
culture may be carried out with considerable advantage.
   The experiments furnish proof that the management of the elec
trical apparatus presents no particular difficulty, as the gas-engine,
dynamo- machine, and regulator have been under the sole management
of my head gardener, Mr. D. Buchanan, and his son an assistant
gardener.     The regulator requires no attention beyond the replace
ment of carbons every four or five hours, which period may easily
be increased to twelve hours, by a slight modification of the lamp.
                                 Conclusions.
   The experiments seem to lead to the following conclusions : —
   1. That electric light is efficacious in producing chlorophyl, in the
leaves of plants, and in promoting growth.
   2. That an electric centre of light, equal to 1,400 candles, placed at
a distance of 2 metres from growing plants, appeared to be equal in
effect to average daylight at this season of the year, but that more
economical effects can be attained by more powerful light centres.
   3. That the carbonic acid and nitrogenous      compounds generated in
diminutive quantities in the electric arc, produce no sensible dele
terious effects upon plants enclosed in the same space.
   4. That plants do not appear to require a period of rest during the
twenty-four hours of the day, but make increased and vigorous pro
gress if subjected during daytime to sunlight and during the night to
electric light.
   5. That the radiation of beat from powerful electric arc* can be
made available to counteract the effect of night frost, and is likely to
promote the setting and ripening of fruit in the open air.
   6. That while under the influence of electric light, plants can
sustain increased stove heat without collapsing, a circumstance favour
able to forcing by electric light.
   7. That the expense of electro-horticulture depends mainly upon
the cost of mechanical energy, and is very moderate where natural
sources of such energy, such as waterfalls, can be made available.
   Since writing the above my attention has been drawn to an article
in " Nature," 29th January, 1880, giving interesting observations by

 1880.]       Elementary Principles    of Animal Mechanics.           219
Dr. Schiibeler, of Christiania, on " The Effect of Uninterrupted Sun
light on Plants in the Arctic Regions."          These observations fully
confirm the conclusion indicated by my experiments with electric
light. Not only are plants able to grow continuously, according to
Dr. Schiibeler, but when under the influence of continuous light they
 develop more brilliant flowers and larger and more aromatic fruit than
under the alternating influence of light and darkness, whereas the
 formation of sugar appears to be dependent chiefly upon temperature.
    It would follow from these observations, that with the aid of stoves
 and electric light, fruit, excelling both in sweetness and aroma, and
 flowers of great, brightness, may be grown without solar aid.         Dr.
 Schiibeler mentions that in removing an Acacia plant from the dark,
and placing it under the influence of the arctic midnight sun, the
 leaves opened slowly, and it is interesting to observe that the same
 effect took place when an Acacia lophantha was placed       (in the open
air) under the influence of my midnight lamp.

       Trinity College, Dublin. Received February 28, 1880.
     In the preceding  note (No.  VIII)   I have shown that, in lifting
weights at a fixed rate with the arms, until fatigue sets in, the follow
ing equation, deduced from the law of fatigue, is complied with, very
closely : —

•220                     Rev. S. Haughton.                      On some               [Mar. 11,
                     where «=number of lifts,

                             AJ         the experiments themselves.
  From this equation, and from the experiments                               themselves,   it ap
peared that there was a particular time of lift —
                                             t   = T,
at which the maximum work was done, and that,

   The object of the series of experiments carried on during six months
of the winter of 187G-7, and described in the present note, was to
find in what manner the co-efficients t, or        vary with the weight
                                                                  /3,
employed and lifted.       The experiments were conducted in every
respect as those described  in Note VII, the conditions of which   here                I
quote and repeat —   :
  " The following experiments were made during the last six months
upon Dr. Macalister —    :
  " A pair of dumbbells, held one in each hand, were raised simul
taneously, from the vertical to the horizontal position, and again
lowered, at a rate regulated by a metronome made for the purpose.
No rest was allowed at the beginning or end of the motion, which
took place as before, under the following conditions, viz. —                      :
   "1. To keep time with the metronome.
   "     To raise the weights in the transverse plane.
       5. 4. 3. 2.
   "     To supinate the hands.
   "    To abstain from all bending of the knees or spinal column.
   "     The experimenter not to count the lifts.
   " The
           experiments were made at intervals of never less than
24 hours, so as to avoid all risk of the muscles becoming trained                              ;
and on each occasion the weights were lifted until     became impossibleit
to effect another lift, without violating condition No.    indicating that   4,
other muscles were called in to aid the shoulder muscles already worn
out."

must   be rejected, as   its results differ from all the others.                    The rate of

II.   "On the Tonicity of the Heart and Arteries.''                            By W. II.
       Gaskell.       M.D.,    Trinity College, Cambridge.                   Communi
       cated by Dr. Michael Foster, Prelector of Physiology in
       Trinity College. Cambridge.                   Received March 1, 1880.
    The author Las made a lengthened series of observations on the
heart of the frog and tortoise, both on the entire ventricle and on the
apex, supplied, by the help of Roy's* tonometer, with saline solutions,
or with diluted blood (of rabbit, sheep, or bullock).
    That the artificial blood solutions differ in their action on the apex
from the frog's own blood in degree only and not in kind, and thut
consequently Bernsteinf is wrong in regarding these fluids as specific
stimuli giving rise to rhythmic action, is shown by the following facts.
    1. The apex of the frog's heart brought to quiescence after Bern
stein's method, will beat spontaneously when the pressure in its cavity
is increased by clamping the aortic arches.
    2. If while the heart still remains in its natural position within the
body, the frog's own blood be replaced by the artificial blood solution,
and the ventricle be then nipped by fine forceps, the apex will remain
quiescent for an indefinite length of time.                  As soon, however, as the
pressure     in  the  cavity   is   increased,   the    apex commences to contract,
and beats as long as the heart is distended by the increased pressure.
    The conclusions to which the author has been led by his experiments
are as follows : —
    1. The heart possesses, like the arteries, what may be called tonicity,
and the variations in this tonicity play an important part in deter
mining the features of the cardiac beat.
    The apex, when firot tied on to the cannula, the pressure of the
 blood solution being kept constant at 10 cm. or less, remains quiescent
 for some time in the position of greatest relaxation.                As, however, the
 blood solution continues to pass through, the lever of the tonometer
 rises   often very appreciably even before the apex begins to beat.
 This rise, unless otherwise explained, would seem to show that the
 first effect of the blood solution has been to bring the apex into a
 condition which is no longer that of greatest relaxation for that
 particular pressure.
     Fnrther, in correspondence with this raising of tone of the cardiac
 muscle by the artificial blood solution, is the alterat ion in the character
  of the beat.
    The first beats, whether natural or artificially produced, which occur
  while the ventricle is still in a somewhat relaxed or atonic condition in

 consequence of the operation of being tied on the cannula, are less in
 height and more pointed in appearance, i.e., remain a shorter time at
 the height of contraction than those which are obtained after the blood
 has been passing some time.
    2. The tonic condition is in all probability partly due to the alkali
 nity of the blood.                              ,
    a. After the ventricle or apex beating with artificial blood solution
                                                                 " normal   "
 has been brought to standstill by replacing the blood with
 salt solution, then an alkaline salt solntion (1 sodium hydrate to 20,000
 normal salt solution) causes beats to reappear, and again the ventricle
 stops beating, but no longer in the position of diastole, the standstill
 that now occurs is always a systolic not a diastolic standstill.
    6. When the ventricle or apex is beating under the influence of an
 artificial blood solution and the alkaline solution be sent through, then
 the resulting curve shows how the alkaline standstill is brought about,
 every contraction is as powerful as with the blood solution, the cavity
 being closed each time, but every relaxation is less perfect, and of
 shorter duration than the previous relaxation, while the period of full
 contraction in each beat is progessively lengthened, the rate of rhythm
 not being much altered ; at last each relaxation becomes invisible, and
 the lever traces a straight line at the level of the height of full con
 traction.
    c. When the apex is not beating, but is motionless in the position
of complete relaxation, as is frequently the case when salt solution
alone is sent through, then the alkaline solution brings it very
gradually from the position of extreme relaxation to that of extreme
contraction without the necessary production of a single beat.
    Further, if during this tonic action of the alkaline solution, artificial
beats be produced, then, as in the case just mentioned, the time of
full contraction in each beat is lengthened as the tonicity rises.
    3. Dilute acid solutions, such as lactic acid (1 lactic acid to 20,000
normal saline solution), lower the tonicity of the cardiac muscle.
   a. When the lactic acid solution is sent through a beating ventricle
or apex, then a curve is produced nearly the exact converse of the
curve obtained from alkaline solutions ; the separate beats progressively
diminish in force, present a pointed appearance, owing to the extreme
shortness of the time of full contraction, and very quickly               the
ventricle or apex remains still in the position of extreme relaxation.
   b. When by means of the acid solntion the beats have been much
lowered in force, then the alkaline solution can bring them back to
their original force and character, and then produce its own
characteristic effect, and if the acid solution be again sent through, it
gradually overpowers the action of the alkali, and the apex or
ventricle slowly falls from a condition of extreme contraction to one
of extreme relaxation.

 1880.]          On the Tonicity  of the Heart and Arteries.             227
    c. If the acid solution    has brought about a condition of nearly
absolute relaxed or atonic standstill, then removal of the acid by salt
solution does not improve the beats, and does not raise the tonicity,
but immediately the alkaline solution is sent throngh, the tonicity
begins to rise, and the beats are strengthened until the ventricle
passes into the condition of systolic or tonic standstill.
    tl. The reverse case is also true ; although salt solution sent through
af ter the alkaline solution will very gradually bring the ventricle from
the contracted to the dilated condition, yet the lactic acid solution
produces the same effect with much greater rapidity.
    e. These very dilute alkali and acid solutions do not produce their
effects by permanently injuring the cardiac muscle, for in either case
it is possible to restore the beats to their original strength and character
by sending the artificial blood solution through.
   4. Certain alkaloids act in this respect in the same manner as
alkalies, others as acids.
   a. Digitalin or antiarin in artificial blood solution or in normal salt
solution produce exactly the same effect upon both the beating ventricle
and the non-l)eating apex as the alkaline salt solution.
    b. Blood solutions containing muscarin and pilocarpin gradually
diminish the force of the beat without necessarily slowing the rate of
rhythm until the ventricle stops beating in a condition of relaxation, as
in the case of lactic acid solutions ; at the same time the beats show all
the characters of the atonic beat.
   c. Atropin acts in the same direction as alkalies, but only raises the
tonicity to a slight extent, at least with the dilute solutions hitherto
employed.
   5. The tonicity of the muscles of the smaller arteries is increased by
alkalies and lowered by acid solutions.         This is concluded from tho
action of the alkaline and lactic acid solutions upon the vessels of the
mylohyoid muscle, upon the rate of flow from the abdominal vein when
the solutions are sent through the legs alone and upon the mesenteric
vessels.
    In all cases  with the alkali solution the arteries contract, the rate of
flow diminishes    or ceases altogether, and as long as the alkali solution
is passing through the contraction remains ; with the lactic acid solu
tion, on the other hand, the arteries dilate to their full extent, the rate
of flow is markedly increased, and no constriction takes place unless
 the alkaline solution be again sent throngh.
    The anthor reserves for another occasion a fuller description of his
 results, as well as a discussion of their bearings.

       Fossil Flora of Alum Bay." By Dr. Coxstantin Baron
       Ettingshauskn, Professor in the University of Graz,
       Austria. Communicated by Professor Huxley, Sec. R.S.
       Received March 4, 1880.
    The white clay of Alum Bay and the fossil plants included in it
have been long known. The introduction to the " Monograph on the
British Eocene Flora," Palseontographical Society, 1879, p. 12, gives a
detailed history of this locality.
    The first scientific investigation of the fossil plants of Alum Bay
were made by Dr. Do la Harpe and Professor Oswald Heer, who
enumerated a Flora of about forty species, distributed in several
genera.
    I have   devoted   the winter    1879-80 to the investigation of this
                                              I
Fossil Flora at the British Museum, and have had under examination
for this purpose the fossil plants of Alum Bay collected by W. Stephen
Mitchell and Mr. H. Keeping, the collections of the Woodwardian
Museum at Cambridge, and those of the Museum of Practical Geology,
and the collection of Mr. John Starkie Gardner.
    The results of this investigation are as follow: —
    The Fossil Flora of Alum Bay contains at least 116 genera and 274
species, which are distributed into 63 families.           Of these genera 3
belong    to  the Thallophyta,  2 to  the  Filices, 5  to the Gymnospermw,
6 to the Monocotyledons,      28 to the Apetalfe,     15 to the Gamopetahv.
54 to the Dialypetaloe, and 2 are indeterminable.
    A  sub-tropical climate, at least, is indicated by many of the Ficus
species, and by the Artocarpere, CinchonacetB, Sapotaceas,         Ebenaeea-,
 Biittneriaceas, Bombacea?, Sapindacete, Malpighiaceas, etc.
    The genera which are common to Alum Bay and Sheppey are :
 •Callitris, *Cupressinites, Sequoia, *Cyperites, Smilax, *Sabal,
 *Aronium, *Quercus, Jnglans, *Laurus, Nyssa, Proteoides, Cinchoni-
dium, Apocynophyllum, Sapotacites, *Diospyros, Symplocos, Mag
nolia, *Nelumbium, *Hightea, Acer, *Sapindus, 'Cupania, Eugenia,
 *Eucalyptus, *Prunus, Amygdalus, *Podogonium, Lcguminosites,
 *Carpolithes. In the genera to which an asterisk is prefixed, are found
 species common to Alum Bay and Sheppey.                This great number of
 genera, common to Alum Bay and Sheppey, seems to point to such a
 close connexion between the two Floras, that it does not appear to me
 to be advisable to distinguish the leaves of the one from the fruits of
 the other, even though they cannot be absolutely connected, by separate
 specific names.     I find it is possible, by comparing the leaves and
 fruits of their nearest living analogues, to unite them in many cases,
 at least provisionally.   For instance, I find that the leaves of one of

1880.]                On the   Fossil Flora of A lum Bay.                     229
the Cupanias from Alum Bay approach nearly to those of the existing
Cnpania glabra, and          I  should prefer to unite with these Alum
Bay    leaves   the  form   of  Cupania fruit from Sheppey, which most
nearly agrees with the same living species, namely, C. glabra, &c.
   Liquidambar* and Metrosideros, which are common to Sheppey and
Bournemouth, are as yet absent at Alum Bay ; on the other hand, we
have in Alum Bay the genera Symplocos, Nelumbium, and Hightea,
which are common to this locality and Sheppey, but not yet found at
Bournemouth.
   The small number of ferns and palms, in comparison with the much
greater number at Bournemouth and of tho latter at Sheppey, is re
markable.       This is attributable,    I think, only to local physical con
ditions, and perhaps the- same conditions may have led to the much
greater prevalence of Dicotyledons in Alum Bay. In the beds of
Studland, which are on the same horizon as Alum Bay, remains of
palms and ferns abound, though belonging to few species.
   Many of the Dicotyledons correspond with Miocene species, and I
do not doubt that there is a genetic connexion between them. .We
have in Alum Bay the precursors of Quercus Lonchitis, Q. mediter-
ranea, Ulmus longifolia, Celtis Japeti, Ficus lanceolate, F. sagoriana,

   In addition to the great number of Miocene          species, whose origin
can apparently be traced back to the Eocene, there are not wanting
indications that certain Miocene genera were not completely differen
tiated into genera in the Eocene period.          For instance, the genus
Castanea, perfectly developed in the Miocene, seems to be represented
in the Eocene by a Castanea-like oak, Q. Bournensis, which combines
in itself characters common to both genera, which are no longer found
united.    Another example is afforded by a Pomaderris-like Rhamnus,
which, in like manner, seems to show the commencement of the differen
tiation of Pomaderris from Rhamnus, completed in the Miocene Flora.
   I have selected for mention a few from among a great number of
new forms, as possessing special interest.
   A very distinct Marattia, nearly allied to M. Kaulfussi, J. Smith, is
remarkable as being the first species met in the Tertiary.        The Celtis
is allied to C. Japeti of the Miocene Flora of Parschlug on the one
side, and to the living C. anstralis on the other.
   The only Adenopeltis is allied to an American living species. The
presence of two species of Banksia is ascertained beyond all doubt,
since their seeds also occur ; many other leaves formerly named
Banksia     I   now agree may belong to Myrica.             The proteaceous
Lomatia is represented by a fruit.          Very   characteristic   leaves of
Aristolochia and of Alyxia allied to the living Alyxia spicata R.
Brown, and a Clerodendron allied to the East Indian C. viscosum
Vent, are found, but rarely.
    Of Diospyros is found calyx, berry and leaf, the berry occurring
also in Sheppey.      The solitary species of Diospyros of Alum Bay and
that of Sheppey are the same.       The only species of Cornus is remark
able as showing perhaps a genetic relation with some of the Miocene
species. The leaves of two species of Malvaceae belong,           I  think, to
two of the species of Hightea from Sheppey, where eight species are
found.     One of the very characteristic      leaflets of Bombaceas may
belong, on account of its venation and form, to the Brazilian genus
Salmalia ; and very characteristic leaves of Ternstrcemia, nearly allied
to a Miocene form, are found.      Of Cupania, the fruits of eight species of
which   are   found at Sheppey,  I have distinguished six species by their
leaves in Alum Bay, and these I provisionally refer to the nearest of
the Sheppey species.      The only Alum Bay Pistacia is nearly allied to
the well-known P. vera.       The putamens of two species of Prunus, of
which one is common to Sheppey occur, and of Amygdalus three
species of fruits are found.
   Of the Papilionaceffl I could distinguish thirty-eight species belong
ing to ten genera. The richest are Cassia and Dalbergia, and many
species of them are also found in Hrering and Sotzka.
   The comparison of the Fossil Flora of Alum Bay witb that of
Bournemouth and with the other Tertiary Floras is reserved ui«til

further investigations are completed. The most striking fact, how
ever, in connexion with the Alum Bay Flora that my work even at
this stage has brought out, is, that more than fifty of the species are
common to Sotzka and Heering, while a lesser number are common to
Sezanne, the Lignitic of America, and to other Floras.
    It is my pleasing duty to have again to acknowledge my thanks
for the very important help the Royal Society has afforded me. I
have also to acknowledge my indebtedness for advice and assistance
to Sir Joseph Hooker, Dr. Henry Woodward, Mr. William Carruthers,

                      The Ovarian Ovum of the, Bird.
    In the ovary of a laying hen, Graafian follicles are to be found in
almost every stage of growth, and the fundamental parts — germinal
spot, germinal vesicle, yolk, and follicular >epithelium — exhibit dif
ferences both in relative size and iu structure at various stages of
growth. I will proceed to consider the structure of each fundamental
part in detail, as it is presented in sections of the ovary prepared

   Germinal Spot. — In larger ovarian ova, those which aro already
•5 millim. and upwards in diameter, the germinal spot appears homo
geneous and stains of a-uniform dark colour with logwood (fig. 1).       It
is either completely spherical in shape, or somewhat ovoid. In the latter
case it is very commonly eccentric and placed close to the wall of
the germinal vesicle, with which it -may appear to be blended. When
spherical it is often situated near the centre of the vesicle ; and from
its periphery, in what may be considered a typical condition, filaments
of great tenuity radiate outwards to the wall of the vesicle, to the
inner surface of which they are again attached, and that so. closely
that it frequently happens that when shrunken from the. action of
reagents, the filaments may break in the middle rather than suffer
themselves to be dragged away from the wall (fig. 1, g). These radi
ating filaments ramify and intercommunicate in such a way as to form
a delicate network (intra- nuclear -network) which as we have seen

238      Mr. E. A. Schafer.       On Immature Ocai-ian        Ovum       [Mar. 18,
serves to connect         the germinal    spot  with     the inner wall of the
germinal vesicle.        The network is hardly at all stained by logwood,
thus presenting a marked contrast to the substance of the germinal
spot ; moreover the nodal points are not marked and the whole strnc-
tnre is comparatively indistinct. It is jnst such an appearance as
can be produced in an albuminous fluid by coagulating reagents, and
I   am at present unable to decide clearly in my own mind, whether it
is natural or has thus bee* formed artificially. In other ova, chiefly
those of smaller size (figs. 2, 3, 4, and 8), the germinal spot is
composed of two distinct substances, a homogeneous matrix (ma)
staining but slightly, and a number of coarse grannies which are
darkly stained by the logwood.              The granules may be scattered
equally thickly over the whole matrix, or they may leave a peripheral
layer of the spot clear; or again there may be a clear part in the
centre (fig. 3, c) as well as at the periphery of thespot(1).*             This last
condition I have especially noticed in some of the smallest ova.               As a
rule the intra-nuclear network above doscribed in the larger ova is
not to be seen in the smallest ones.          This may be accounted for by
the assumption that the network is formed subsequently by a pro
trusion of the homogeneous substance of the spot ; i.e., if we regard
the network as a- natural formation.         On the other hypothesis, namely,
that it is an artificial production, we must assume that there is less
albuminous matter in the fluid which fills the germinal vesicle of the
smaller ovum, to what there is precipitated around the spot, and does
 not adhere together in the form, of reticulating filaments.                      In
almost all these smaller ova the germinal spot lies near the wall of the
 vesicle.
     Germinal   Vesicle.  — In all the ova the wall of the germinal vesicle
 is   a very distinct membrane which becomes stained by logwood, but
 not very darkly. When a portion of the membrane of the germinal
 vesicle of one of the larger ova is separated and examined on the flat,
 it has a finely punctated appearance, and in profile it can be seen
 that this is due to minute pits with intervening thickenings upon the
 inner surface of the membrane (fig. 7, a- and 6). (*) The action of
 the reagents employed generally produced a shrinking of the vesicle,
 so that its outline in many cases became irregular (fig. 3), but where
 this shrinking has not taken place, it is- almost perfectly spherical
 except in the largest ova. With the exception of the germinal spot
  the contents of the germinal vesicle in the younger ova remain abso
  lutely clear and unstained, so that we must either assume that there
  is very little albuminous matter naturally present, or, as above
 suggested, that this has been precipitated around the germinal spot
 during the process of hardening the tissue. In one small ovum two

germinal vesicles were observed in close contiguity. They were of
unequal size, and each had a relatively large macula.            In another,
a figure of which is given (fig. 8), there are also two vesicles, but
one of these is evidently in process of disappearance, for the mem
brane has become absorbed and the contents of the vesicle, including
the macula, are becoming assimilated in appearance to the vitellus.
    Yolk. — In all the ova the yolk seems composed of a network of
closely interlacing filaments (3). The network maybe coarser or finer ;
it is very fine indeed in the peripheral layers of the largest ova (those
above a millimetre in diameter) which generally have a finely granular
aspect (fig. 10, I, II) ; coarser in the smaller ova and in the central
parts of the larger, but in the latter the coarse appearance of the net
work seems chiefly due to the accumulation here of the large spherical
yolk globules, which being left clear in the sections, give a reticulated
appearance to the substance in which they are imbedded.                In the
smallest ova there is nothing but clear fluid in the meshes of the net
work, which is comparatively open. But in almost all there arc con
densations of the network (fig.6, c,) to be seen, in which the filaments are
far more closely interlaced, the appearance presented being very like that
which might be produced by gathering up a net made of string into a
bunch at one part. The filaments of the vitelline substance are but
slightly stained with logwood, but since they are more closely placed
in the condensations here spoken of, these are more stained than the
r«8t of the yolk. Eventually as the ova increase in size the conden
sations seem to become more numerous (fig. 5), and to spread, and
the vitelline network to become eventually closer and finer everywhere,
but especially at the periphery of the ovum and around the germinal
vesicle, the deposit of the yolk globules producing, as we have seen, a
coarser appearance in the more central parts.
   Other condensations (fig. 9) of vitelline substance occur in some ova
which are more circumscribed and definite than those just mentioned.
They are nucleus-like, spheroidal patches, which stain deeply with
magenta, less deeply with logwood, are homogeneous in appearance, and
are usually encircled with a corona of short, straight, radiating fila
ments, which do not interlace with one another like those of the
vitelline substance around, but may however (I am not suae of this) be
continued into the vitelline network of these pseudo-nuclei, as I will
term the structures- in question.         There may be one, two, or even a
greater    number   in   the vitellus of the same ovum, with the germinal
vesicle of which they have no apparent connexion.
   I  am unable to conjecture the meaning of these pseudo-nuclei, or to
                                                       "             " which
decide whether they are of the same nature as the yolk-nuclei
have been mentioned by several observers as occurring in the ova of
fish and Amphibia (*).
   In   the largest ova the yolk exhibits      several distinct layers which

240     Mr. E. A. Schafer.      On Immature Ovarian Ovum           [Mar.  18,
shade off the one into the other.      Close to the surface is a thin layer
 (fig. 10, I) very clear and almost free from grannies, or these
are of extreme minuteness ; next there is a finely granular looking
layer (II), considerably thicker than the last, in the deeper part of
which are imbedded the elements of the white yolk (III), which thus
forms the third layer, and which pusses gradually into the main central
 substance, or yellow yolk (IV).       It is difficult to observe the inter
lacing filaments of which the vitelline substance is in all probability
composed : even with the highest powers the superficial layers of the
yolk of these larger ova show little more than an appearance of fine
punctation.
    Peculiar striated systems of fibres (figs. 12 and 13) are to be seen
occasionally in the viteilus of some of the larger ova. They are gene
rally situated near the end or ends (for there may be two such systems
in one ovum) of the ovum, and call to mind some of the amphi astral
appearances of dividing nuclei. The fibres composing them do not
become more darkly stained .with magenta than the rest of the
viteilus, but they are very obvious both on account of their peculiar
arrangement (each system consisting of two triangular halves diver
ging from a common centre) and on account of the fact that they lie in
a substance which is clearer and stains less than the rest of 'the viteilus.
    In the ovum figured (fig. 12) one of these striated systems is situ
ated in a projection of the viteilus.      I draw attention to this because
it may mean that the viteilus just at the neck of the projection where
the system is 'situated is in a condition of contraction, and "that the
appearance described is characteristic of -that condition.      On the ether
hand, it is just possible that the figures in question are actually karyo-
litic, and derived from some extruded portion of the contents of the
germinal vesicle. In this case the phenomenon is probably connected
with the precocious formation of polar globules.         I say " precocious,"
because the ovum in qnestion was far from maturity (6).
                                I
    Membranes of the Ovum. — have only one remark to make about the
external   coverings  of the   bird's ovarian   ovum, and    it concerns the
zona radiata.    Waldeyer states that this membrane or layer is derived
from cells of the follicular epithelium, and is continuous with their sub
stance (6).   I find on the contrary that in good sections the zona is com
pletely distinct from the follicular epithelium, and its outline is more
sharply defined externally than internally (fig. 11, z. r.).       Moreover,
where the epithelium    has accidentally  been  broken  away, portions of its
cells do not adhere to the zona, as they would tend to do if their sub
stance were continuous with it. I am inclined with Balfour (7) to
 regard the zona radiata therefore as a product of the protoplasm of
 the ovum.    I have not been able to gain any information -with regard
 to the origin of the vitelline membrane which might enable me to
 decide whether it is a product of the yolk or of the follicular epithelium.

Nor can       I  say whether the clear interval between the follicular
 epithelium and the zona radiata in fig. 11, aud which seems to
be bridged across here and there by processes of the follicular
                                                         " chorion," or
epithelium cells, is the section of a homogeneous                       merely
 a layer of clear coagulated fluid (8) .
    Epithelium of the Graafian Follicle. — The follicular epithelium of the
 smallest follicles is a single layer of oblong or cubical cells (figs. 5, 6,
 8, 9, /. e). As the follicle grows the cells become more columnar.         In
larger    follicles   (figs. 10 and  11) the epithelium  is two  or  more cells
deep (9). The cells are not arranged in layers, but irregularly disposed.
They are for the most part rounded or angular in form, but between
these smaller cells other longer ones are met with, which extend
through the thickness of the epithelium, and are pyriform in shape,
generally with the stalk of the pear directed outwards (fig. 10, p).
These seem to be the cells which Waldeyer figures as being continuous
with the zona radiata, but, as will be seen from what has been stated
above,    I have not been able to confirm their continuity ; indeed, the
larger   end    of the cell does not always reach the inner border of the
follicular epithelium. On the other hand, the stalk of the pear, always
extends at least to the outer border of the epithelium, and may even
in some cases be traced into the connective tissue coat of the follicle.
These cells call to mind the pyriform cells which cover the surface of
the developing Elasmo branch ovary, and which also are traceable at
their attached smaller ends into the stroma of the organ         (10).
                             Ovarian Ovum of the Babbit.
    The following description is derived from the study of sections of
the ovaries of rabbits, which were either full grown or nearly so. The
ovaries were removed while still warm and placed in a concentrated
solution of picric acid. After hardening in this, they were transferred
to alcohol, which was frequently changed. Sections were then pre
pared and stained either with magenta dissolved in oil of cloves, and
subsequently mounted in Canada balsam, or they were stained with
Beale's carmine and mounted in glycerine, or sometimes in balsam. In
sections of such ovaries, as is well known, permanent ova and Graafian
follicles are to be found in every stage of growth.
    Germinal Spot. — In small ova the germinal spot, as in the bird, is
generally represented by a collection of darkly staining granules, im
bedded in a homogeneous, or very finely granular matrix (figs. 14 — 20).
The outline of the macula is generally less well defined than in
corresponding        ova of the bird, and the shape is more irregular.
This granular condition of the macula is not confined to the small ova,
 for it occurs also in those which are surronnded by a double layer of
follicular epithelium (fig. 20), and even in some which are contained
 in large Graafian follicles in which there is already a considerable

242      Mr. E. A. Schafer.       On Immature Ovarian Ovum         [Mar. 18,
accumulation of liquor folliculi.       In the latter case the matrix above-
mentioned is absent, and the macula is represented by a number (a
dozen or so) of globules of varying size which appear to lie loose
within the germinal vesicle (fig. 23, b). An intra-vesicular network is
sometimes present, and serves to unite the granules of the macula,
which are then few in number and individually larger (figs. 21 and
22).     It is possible that the homogeneous matrix above described may
represent the remains of such a network, the filaments of which have
shrunk up into a mass on contact with the hardening reagent ; but if
we are to assume this for some cases, it is difficult to understand why
it should not take place in every case.
    Germinal Vesicle. — With the exception of the germinal spot or spots,
and the intra-vesicular network wh«n present, the contents of the ger
minal vesicle are perfectly clear and do not become stained to any
appreciable extent.       The vesicle is either completely spherical in shape
or it may present one or more bulgings (fig. 18), and these bulgings
are frequently turned towards the nuclei presently to be described as
making their appearance in the peripheral layer of the vitellus. In
some of the sections the wall of the germinal vesicle seems to be defi
cient for a small extent (fig. 14, v. g.), as if to permit of an admixture
of its contents with the yolk ; but this appearance may be due to the
wall having become so thinned as to be imperceptible.          In some of the
smallest Graafian follicles two germinal vesicles are seen within one
ovum (fig. 26).        It is possible that one of these may afterwards dis
appear, i.e., that the follicle is really a nest, containing two fused primi
tive ova    ;  or, on the other hand, that the follicle and ovum are about
 to divide.
     Vitellus. — In small ovarian ova the vitellus, as in the corresponding
 ova of the bird, is in the form of a comparatively open network of
 anastomosing filaments (figs. 21, 22).       These tend to become collected
 more thickly together immediately around the germinal vesicle, and
 also at the periphery of the vitellus. In larger ova a network is no
 longer recognisable, but the vitellus acquires a uniformly granular
 aspect, with generally a number of larger and more distinct granules
 imbedded in it. In maturing ova the vitelline granules are chiefly
 collected immediately in contact with the inner surface of the tona
pellucida, but are also distributed throughout the whole vitellus, dis
 posed, it has sometimes appeared to me, in closely anastomosing tracts,
 leaving clear intervals between.
     The zona pellucida of the rabbit's ovum is late in becoming formed.
  Even when the epithelium in the Graafian follicle is composed of two
  layers of well-marked columnar cells, it is still thin and the radiating
  pores cannot be detected in it. In later stages of growth the pores are
  distinct enough, and they often appear to be occupied by minnte
   granules which are like the vitelline granules on the one hand, and, on

1880.]            tn the common       Fowl and in    the Rabbit.             243
the other hand, are indistinguishable from those in the layer of granular
material which lies between the outer surface of the zona pellucida
and the innermost layer of cells of the discus proligerus (fig. 23, a).
There can be little doubt that this granular matter is produced by the
cells of the discus, and      I  cannot but conjecture with Waldeyer (H)
that the granules in question pass bodily through the pores of the zona
to add themselves     to the food material     of the vitellus.   I have seen no
appearances such as those represented by Pfluger                   and Lindgren
(ls) of  the passage   of entire   cells of the discus  through  the  zona (u).
   Follicular Epitheluim.   —   In the smallest Graafian follicles which are
met with in the ovary of tho grown rabbit, the epithelium of the
follicle consists of a single layer of flattened cells, which tend, however,
to be thicker and more cubical on one side of the follicle, that, namely,
which is further from the surface of the ovary (fig. 25) (15). As the
ovum and follicle grow, the epithelium cells multiply and become
uniformly columnar, but long remain in a single layer (figs. 14, 15, 16,
18, 21).     Presently another layer is formed within this first one
(fig. 17). This inner layer of the follicular epithelium (discus proli
gerus) in the rabbit appears to be formed at the expense of the ovum.
At least, this is the only interpretation which I can adopt of the
remarkable    appearances    I  am about to describe.
   Formation    of  the  Discus   Prcligerus in the Rabbit. — If we examine
those Graafian follicles in the rabbit's ovaiy whose follicular epithe
lium is still composed of but a single layer of well-marked columnar
cells, it may frequently be observed that one or more nuclei are
imbedded in the peripheral layer of the vitellus (fig. 14, n), and this
part of the vitellus may be marked off from the rest by a sector
(fig. 16). The nuclei in question are oval, with their long diameter
parallel to the circumference of the ovum, and at right angles there
fore to the long axis of the columnar cells and oval nuclei of the
follicular epithelium.       The protoplasm in which they lie is more
sharply marked off from this epithelium than it is from the vitellus,
and, indeed, it looks like a part of the latter cut off, for it has the
same finely granular appearance, is stained similarly to that with
carmine aud magenta, and is bounded externally by a direct continua
tion of the general circumferential line of the ovum. Some ova are
met with which have only one of these nuclei, others, in which there
are two or more. When more than one, they may make their appear
ance in different parts of the periphery, and these parts being
segmented off, the ovum, from being round may acquire a very
irregular shape (fig. 22).
   As before mentioned, the germinal vesicle is often bulged towards
that part of the periphery of the vitellus where the nuclei are
situated (fig. 18), and with care fine striations may occasionally be
detected traversing the interval.         Such appearances incline one to the

 244     Mr. E. A. Scliafer.            On Immature Ovarian Ovum            [Mar.  18,
 belief that the nuclei are derived from the vesicle, but scarcely by a
 distinct process of cell-division. At least, I have never been able to
 detect anything in the shape of a division-spindle.                 The only other
 possible explanation is that the nuclei and cells in question are derived
 from cells of the follicular epithelium, which are situated in a different
 plane from that included in the section, and burrow obliquely between
 the first formed layer and the vitellus of the ovum, imbedding them
 selves in the surface of the- latter.         But this would not account for the
 sharpness     with  which      they   are always  marked off from the follicular
 epithelium, and the fact that both nuclei and cell-substance differ
 materially in appearance and in their reaction to staining fluids from
 the nuclei and cell-substance of the first formed layer of epithelium.
    However first formed, they soon multiply and spread around the
 whole of the ovum, so as to form a second complete layer of follicular
 epithelium, the cells of which in parta may be two deep.                They main
 tain for a time their disposition parallel to the circumference of the
 ovum and transverse to the direction of the cells of the first formed
 layer (fig. 17).       Moreover, they still exhibit the same behaviour
 towards staining fluids as the vitellus itself.           But as the follicle con
tinues to grow, and as the zona pelluoida becomes formed between
these cells and the vitellus, they acquire a columnar form with the
long axis of the cell perpendicular to the surface of the ovum, their
 contents clear up, and they come to resemble the cells of the first
formed layer in every particular (fig. 20).
    The only statement that I know of which suggests a parallel between
these appearances in the rabbit's ovum and others of a similar nature
elsewhere occurs in the description which Kappfer gives of the forma
tion of an inner layer of follicular epithelium (which is said to develop
into the test) from nuclei which make their appearance in the peri
pheral layer of the vitellus of the ovum of Ascidia canitta (16).               Unless
it is permitted to cite the observations of Kleinenberg upon the forma
tion of a layer of cells from the periphery of the ovum of Hydra, which
cells take no part in the development of the ovum, but are simply
transformed      into a capsular envelope (17).*
    I  have not been able to see anything of the kind                in the Graafian
follicles of other Mammals (cat, dog, man) .
                               Ovarian Ova of the Bitch.
    The young ova (figs. 27 to 29) have a germinal vesicle which
contains a germinal spot and a beautiful intravesicular network.
Attached to one side of the germinal vesicle is the main part of the
solid substance of the vitellus, and this vitelline mass is connected
   • There is one                difference between these cases and the appearances in

vitellus occurs after fertilisation.

 contents of the ovnm is clear.
        Post- Embryonic     Formation   of Graafian Follicles in the Bitch.
    In  sections of the ovary of a bitch-pnp of eighteen days it is easy to
 convince oneself of the glandular mode of formation of the Graafian
 follicles and their contents.          Figs. 30 to 33 are representations of
 such ovarial glands, showing their communication at this period with
 the surface of the ovary.          In fig. 30 this communication is direct,
 and the whole structure bears a striking resemblance to a racemose
 gland whose saccules are filled with cells ; in fig. 31 the glands are
 longer and more irregular, and the duct, if we may call it so, does not
 pass straight to the surface, but in an oblique or even convoluted
 manner.      It is impossible to confound glandular tubes of this descrip
 tion with creases upon the surface of the ovary, as Foulis suggests
 that Pfluger and Waldeyer have done (18), especially since in many
 cases where the tubes are cut across, the lumen can be distinctly seen
 (Fig. 32).      ,
    We can    see   in the figures how portions of these solid columns of
 cells are becoming cut off into " egg-nests " by ingrowths of the ovarial
matrix. In many of these nests the primitive ova are already distin
guishable from the other cells by their size and the clearness of their
 protoplasm.       But it often happens that the distinction does not appear
until the group of cells which constitutes the nest is completely
 separated     from the rest of the egg-tube.         Fig. 24 from the rabbit's
 ovary illustrates the same fact.
    In sections of the ovary of a young but nearly full-grown bitch the
 same glandular character of the superficial parts of the egg-tubes of
 Pfluger is evident      (fig. 34).   (w)   In  most the open communication
with the surface is lost, and the solid ends of the glands, which form
the " egg-columns," properly so-called, have also become severed, and
have sunk into the ovarial stroma.           But the lumen of the tube is still
distinct, and the section is wonderfully like that of the duct of a small
secreting gland.
    Appearances like these seem to me to point very clearly to the
conclusion that the typical mode of formation of the Graafian follicles
and their contents is by a gland-like ingrowth of the ovarial epi
thelium, and that the process, which is described by Balfour, as
occurring in the Elasmobranch and in the rabbit, is a modification
of this typical mode. For it must certainly be admitted that the
deeper-seatedness of the columns of germinal epithelium as the ovary
advances in development, cannot be wholly due to the outward growth
of the ovarian stroma, since we see how that even after the ovary has
attained its full size the Graafian follicles (which are derived from

•these columns), as they successively mature, sink deeper into the
substance of the organ.
  It will be seen that the view which               I
                                            have been led to take of
the derivation of the ova and epithelium cells of the Graafian follicles,
is that both structures originate in common from the germinal epi
thelium — in the dog (Pfliiger, Waldeyer) in the form of ingrowths
which may closely simulate the formation of tubular glands (ovarial
glands) ; in the rabbit (Balfour) in the form of columns of cells
which are altogether solid, and which thus present a modifica
tion of what is in all probability, as H. Ludwig's extensive comparative
researches have shown, the typical mode. This is essentially the view
first enunciated by Pfliiger (a>) for the vertebrate ovary, and differs
materially from that of Foulis, who contends for the derivation of the
follicular epithelium from the connective tissue cells of the ovarian
stroma.       I
              think that Dr. Foulis couid not possibly have arrived at
this result had he at first selected the ovary of the dog for study.
Above all the investigation of the human ovary in this respect teems
with difficulties, both because it cannot be obtained fresh enough, and
on account of the great relative development of the stroma.        On Dr.
Foulis' hypothesis that the first formed layer of follicular epithelium
is only modified connective tissue, the development in the rabbit of
the inner follicular epithelium from the ovum itself, as I have described
it, would be quite incomprehensible, whereas,     both ova and epithelium
                                                        if
have a common origin, there would be no morphological absurdity
involved in this apparently exceptional mode of development          espe         ;
cially since,  as V. Beneden (31) and  Balfour have shown, the permanent
ova are for the most part produced by the fusion of two or more cells
 (primitive ova), which originate from the germinal epithelium in
common with the first formed layer.

                                        (Abstract.)
   In    this paper an account of the spectroscopic and chemical characters
of urobilin is given.          Urobilin is a pigment which has been diagnosed
in urine by means of the spectroscope, and which has not               been-  hitherto
isolated.
   Before      its discovery in urine a pigment had been obtained by Jaffe
by acting on human bile with nitric acid, and on dog's bile with hydro
chloric acid, and subsequent treatment, which in solution gave the
same spectrum, and behaved in the same manner with reagent* as urine
containing urobilin.            By an examination         of the bile   of seventeen
animals,     I have     shown that it is present as such in the bile of all them,
but in greatest abundance in the bile of the mouse ; and the results are
described in the paper, while the spectra are shown in Chart II.
    I have also shown that human urine always gives an absorption
band at F, which almost always is affected in the same manner by re
agents as the pigment got by Jafl6 from bile, and that if this band is
not so affected another pigment called urolutein is present, which I
 describe and have mapped in Chart I.
    I have succeeded in isolating urobilin by the following method : —
 Having procured some urine which by preliminary spectroscopic an- 1

chemical tests showed a large amount of urobilin, it was precipitated by
neutral and basic lead acetate respectively, and filtered ; if the filtrate
gave an absorption spectrum, it was re-precipitated until the band disap
peared, the precipitates were united, extracted with alcohol acidulated
either with hydrochloric or sulphuric acid, and filtered. The filtrate was
of a fine red colour, giving the dark band at F. This fluid, in small
quantities at a time, was put into a separating funnel, a large quantity
of water added and         then pure chloroform,      the whole repeatedly
shaken     and then allowed to stand.      The red chloroform layer was
separated off and filtered, when it was again examined and found to
 give in every instance the original spectrum ; the chloroform was now
evaporated off and the residue repeatedly dissolved in chloroform,
finally on evaporation a brown-red, amorphous, shiny residue was ob
tained, which was perfectly soluble in alcohol, chloroform, nitric acid,
hydrochloric acid, acetic acid, lactic acid, acidulated water, and partly
soluble in ether, in water, and in benzol, but quite insoluble in bisul
phide of carbon.       I fully describe the spectra of the various solu
tions, which are shown in Chart I, and it will be seen that the same
pigment was present in every solution, and since by the action of
 different solvents and reagents, this pigment could not be separated
 into more than one, I conclude that pure urobilin was obtained and
urobilin only.      I have also endeavoured to show that the pigment ob
tained   was in combination   with the sulphuricacid, when prepared by the
sulphuric acid method, as it was found to contain sulphur, in addition
to carbon, hydrogen,        oxygen and nitrogen, which was absent and
replaced by chlorine when it was prepared by the hydrochloric acid
method.      The conclusions which this research led me to form were as
 follows :  —
    1. That urobilin had been separated from urine.
    2. That by the treatment adopted it had been separated in combi
nation with hydrochloric and sulphuric acid respectively.
    3. That the spectra of solutions of urobilin obtained by these
methods respectively differ in the position of certain feeble bands, but
agree in all possessing a black band at F, which can be made to disap
pear by ammonia in excess, and which is replaced by another band
nearer the red end of the spectrum on the addition of sodic hydrate.
    4. Urobilin is an amorphous brownish-red pigment, which contains
carbon, oxygen, hydrogen and nitrogen.             It is soluble in alcohol,
chloroform, acidulated water, and acids ; partially in ether, benzol, and
 water, i.e., if the pigment be separated in combination with hydro
chloric or sulphuric acid.
    5. Urobilin appears capable of existing in different states of oxida
 tion.
    6. It is derived from one of the colouring-matters     of bile.
    7.  It appears to be  the colouring-matter  of  the bile  of the mouse.

body, which easily splits up on treatment with reagents into decom
position products, each giving a peculiar spectrum.

       P. Geddes.      Communicated by Professor BtJRDON Sander
       son, F.R.S. Received March 13, 1880.
                                     [Platb  5.]
    Whether one collects the perivisceral fluid of        a sea-urchin  or of  a
worm, or the blood of a crustacean or a mollusc, the same phenomenon
is always more or less distinctly to be observed. A kind of coagulation
takes place, the fluid separating sooner or later into two portions, which
have considerable     superficial resemblance to the clot and serum of
vertebrate blood.
    It is easy to watch the formation of the clot by placing a drop of
fresh-drawn fluid upon a cover-glass and inverting this above a glass
cell, of which the edge is oiled to prevent evaporation.              The drop
thus hangs freely and the coagulation can go on without interference.
    The phenomena observed in various invertebrates are best under
stood by reference to the plate.        Fig. 1 represents some of the groups
into which the amooboid corpuscles of the perivisceral fluid of the
earthworm run immediately after drawing.               In fig. 2 we have a few
adjacent corpuscles from the gill of Plwlas; in fig. 3 they are com
 mencing to adhere ; in 4 and 5 their adhesion is complete ; in fig. 6
 they have all but completely merged into one mass, which is about to
 absorb a new-comer ; in figs. 8 and 9 the mass is now completely
 homogeneous, is altering its form and throwing out pseudopodia in all
 directions.    Figs. 10 — 12 represent the similar union of corpuscles of
 Patella, and figs. 13, 14 those of Buccinum.
     In Pag arm the corpuscles are of two very markedly different kinds,
 the coarsely and the finely granular.        The former are much elongated
 when freshly drawn, but rapidly become oat- or egg-shaped, and then
 throw out blunt pseudopodia from any part of their surface.              These
 stages   are  represented  in   fig.  15.   The  finely  granular  corpuscles,
 drawn separately at fig. 16, send out filamentous pseudopodia, and
 alone possess the power of union. Fig. 17 represents a small clot,
 formed by the union of the finely granular corpuscles, and containing
 a number of coarsely granular corpuscles, which do not merge into the
 surrounding mass.       The large pseudopodial process of hyaline ecto
 plasm on the left of the figure is worthy of notice.
     Figs. 18 — 23 show the union of five of the finely granular corpuscles

of the common shore-crab (Oarcinus mcenas).                           Fig. 24 represents a
few of both kinds of corpuscles of Cancer Pagurus, and fig. 25 a small
clot formed by the union of the finely granular corpuscles.                          In fig. 26
are represented some of the corpuscles of the common starfish (Astera-
canthion vulgare), showing the curious looped pseudopodia usual
among the Echinoderms.                    Figs. 27 and 28 are successive drawings of
a    group of uniting corpuscles from the same preparation.                              As in
fig. 17, the development of large pseudopodia from the completely
fused mass is evident.
      But it is among the Echinoidea* that the phenomena of corpuscular
fusion        occur on the most extraordinary scale.                   A good specimen of
Echinus         sphcera    furnishes perivisceral fluid enough to fill an ordinary
tumbler.            The fluid is at first homogeneous and of a uniform pinkish
g-rey tint, but rapidly becomes cloudy. The cloud contracts constantly,
and so becomes gradually darker and of more defined form, and in
the course of a few hours shrinks into a small brown pellet.                            When a
drop        of  this  fresh   fluid   is examined     in  the moist   chamber,    it is seen to
 contain, in addition to its coloured amoeboid corpuscles, the same two
 types of colourless corpuscles, the coarsely and the finely granular, as
 have just been described in Pagurus (figs. 15 and 16).                          Here too the
 clot is entirely due to the union of the finely granular corpuscles, which
 almost instantly run into small heaps, these into larger, and larger
 ones, and so on until we have a vast amoeboid mass, which rapidly
 differentiates into eudoplasm and ectoplasm, the former containing the
 nuclei and granules of the constituent corpuscles, and the latter, pro
 duced by the union of their hyaline ectoplasm, forming a broad clear
 margin, and sending out pseudopodia, sometimes blunt, but usually fila
 mentous. These pseudopodia frequently run out over such distances
  that an adequate idea of their extraordinary size could scarcely be
  given within the limits of the entire plate.
      The resemblance of all these cases of the fusion of amceboid cells
  taken from so many types of Invertebrata is too close to be accidental.
  All the evidence points to the conclusion that the clot which appears
  in any invertebrate corpusculate fluid is formed, always partly, and
  sometimes          wholly, by the fusion of the finely granular amceboid
  oorpnscles therein suspended, f                  Thus, while the blood of a lobster is
  still capable of clotting after removal of the corpuscles by filtration
   (Fredericq), the perivisceral fluid of a sea-urchin is not.

      t With     regard to the amoeboid corpuscles of vertebrates,     I have not yet been ablo
   to make      any  satisfactory  observations.    Ziegler has concluded    from his researches
   on the formation of giant cells in exudation liquids              (Exp. Untersuch. ueber d.
   If t-rkunft d. Tuberkeelmente, &c., Wurzburg, 1875) that a coalescence of amoeboid
   "-•oils does actually sometimes take place.

254        On Coalescence       of Amoeboid Cells into Plasmodia.               [Mar. IS.
    It is impossible to avoid comparing the above-described unions                          of
amoeboid cells with those occurring in the ordinary life-history of                      the
Myxomycetes,* and the resemblance is so complete that it seems                           not
only convenient, bat necessary to extend the term plasmodiitm to                         the
former.
    The formation of plasmodia was at first supposed to be peculiar to
the Myxomycetes, but several Rhizopods (Microgromia, Rhaphulwphryt,
Phonergates, &c.) have been described, in which a more or less com
plete cell-fusion has been observed, or perhaps, as I am disposed to
think, cell-fusion has been more or less completely observed.
    After comparing the descriptions and drawings of these formsf (see
Buck's figures of Phonergates, copied in the Plate, figs. 30 — 33) with
those of uniting corpuscles already given, the identity of the process
of coalescence in the two cases with each other, and with that of a
Myxomycete, will be sufficiently obvious.
    Finally, although much further observation is desirable, alike upon
the undifferentiated cells of Vertebrates and Invertebrates, and upon
the lowest plants and animals, it may be safely asserted that all the
evidence we possess points to the conclusion                        that the power of
coalescing      with    its fellows,  under    favourable    circumstances,     to form a
Plasmodium, is at any rate a very widely-spread, if not a general pro
perty of the amoeboid cell.
    The observations were chiefly               made last summer          at the Scottish
 Zoological Station at Stonehaven.

       Satellite." By G. H. Darwin, F.R.S. Received March 6,
       1880.
    In a series of papers read from time              to  time during the past two
years before the Royal Society, I have investigated the theory of the
tides raised in a rotating viscous spheroid, or planet, by an attendant
satellite, and have also considered the secular changes in the rotation
of the planet, and in the revolution of the satellite.                Those investi
gations were intended to be especially applicable                 to the case of the
earth and moon, but the friction of the solar tides was found to be a
factor of importance, so that in a large part of those papers it became
necessary to conceive the planet as attended by two satellites.
    The differential equations which gave the secular changes in the
system were rendered very complex by the introduction of solar
disturbance,       and    I  was unable to integrate them analytically ; th»
equations were accordingly treated by a method of numerical quadra
tures, in which all the data were taken from the earth, moon, and
sun.      This numerical treatment did not permit an insight into all the
various effects which might result from frictional tides, and an analy
tical solution, applicable to any planet and satellite, is desirable.
    In the present paper such an analytical solution is found, and is
 interpreted graphically.           But the problem is considered from a point
of view which is at once more special and moro general than that of
the previous papers.
    The point of view is more general in that the planet may here be
conceived to have any density and mass whatever, and to be rotating
 with any angular velocity, provided that the ellipticity of figure is not
large, and that the satellite may have any mass, and may be revolving
 about its planet, either consentaneously with or adversely to the plane
tary rotation.         On    the other hand, the problem here considered is
 more special in that the planet is supposed to be a spheroid of fluid of
 small viscosity ; that the obliquity of the planet's eqnator, the inclina

   Again, since C = %Ma2, and since C is unity, therefore J/=|/a2, where
M is estimated in the mass unit.
   Therefore Mm/(M+m) is unity, when M and m are estimated in
the mass nnit, with the proposed units of length, time, and mass.
   According to the theory of elliptic motion, the moment of momentum
of the orbital motion of the planet and satellite about their common
                          Mm           ,

                                                 Now it has been shown that the
                         M + tn
factor involving M is unity, and by (1) Oc2 = Q-l = ci.
   Hence, if we neglect the square of the eccentricity e, the m. of m. of
orbital motion is numerically equal to Q"* or c*.
   Let z=Q-*=c*.
   In this paper x, the moment of momentum of orbital motion, will
be taken as the independent variable.                In interpreting the figures
given below it will be useful to remember that it is also equal to the
square root of the mean distance.
   The moment of momentum of the planet's relation is equal to C» ;
and since C is unity, n will be either the m. of m. of the planet's rotation,
or the angular velocity of rotation itself.

Hpeed 2ra, which tide is known in the British Association Report on

The suffix m- to the symbols i and N there indicates that the equa
tions (80) only refer to the action of the moon, and as here we only
have a single satellite, they are the complete equations.                 N is equal to
jf/n0, so  that   ri0 disappears    from     the   first   and   second  of  (80) ; also
/u
   = l/««onol,   and  thus n0 disappears       from    the  third  equation.   P=cos»,
(,*=sini, and, since we are treating i the obliquity as small, P—\,
 Q=i; also X = Q/n; the e of that paper is identical with the /of the
present one; lastly f is equal to n^n^l, and since with our present
units s=l, therefore fi d^/dt = dQ~^jnQdt=dxj n0dt.
    With regard to the transformation of the first of (80) into (4) of
the present paper, I remark that treating i as small \PQ— \\Q.
 = ^((1 — 20/n), and introducing this transformation into the first of
 (80), equation (4) is obtained, except that i occurs in place of (i+f).
Now in the paper on the " Precession of a Viscous Spheroid " the in
clination of the orbit of the satellite to the plane of reference was
treated as zero, and hence        j   was zero ; but I have proved in a paper

 taken as the cosine and sine of i+j instead of i. Equations (5) and
 (6) are proved in § 10, Part II, and § 25, Part V of the unpublished

    The integrals of this system of equations will give the secular
 changes in the motion of the system under the influence of the
 frictional tides. The object of the present paper is to find an analy
 tical expression for the solution, and to interpret that solution geome
 trically.

    Equation (7) may also be obtained by the principle of conservation
 of moment of momentum.               The motion is referred to the invariable
 plane of the system, and however the planet and satellite may interact
 on one another, the resultant m. of m. must remain constant in

  which   the diagonal is   h (the resultant       m. of m. of the system), and of
  which the sides are n and x, inclined respectively to the diagonal at
  the angles i and,;', we see at once that

     If i and j be treated    as small    this reduces to (7).
     Again the consideration       of this parallelogram shows that
                           7i3  = »2 + x3 + 2nx cos (i +j) ,
  which    expresses   the  constancy       of moment      of momentum.       If  the
  squares and   higher powers of      i+j    be neglected,   this becomes
                                       h=n+x                                     (8).
     Equation (8) may also be obtained by observing that dnfdt + dxjdt—{),
  and therefore   on integration n + x is constant.          It is obvious from the
 principle of m. of m. that the planet's equator and the plane of the
 satellite's orbit have a common node on the invariable plane of the
 system.
    If  we divide equations (4) and (G) by (3), we have the following
 results : —

   When the integration of these equations is completed, we shall
have the means of tracing the history of a fluid planet of small
viscosity,    attended by a single satellite, when the system is started
with any given moment of momentum h, and with any mean distance
and (small) inclination and (small) eccentricity of the satellite's
orbit, and (small) obliquity of the planet's equator.               It may be re
marked that h is to be taken as essentially positive, because the sign
of h merely depends on the convention which we choose to adopt as
to positive and negative rotations.
    These equations do not involve the time, bnt it will be shown later
how the time may be also found as a function of x.               It is not, how
ever, necessary to find the expression for the time in order to know
the sequence of events in the history of the system.
    Since the fluid which forms the planet is subject to friction, there
fore the system is uon-conservative         of energy, and therefore x must
change in such a way that E may diminish.
   If the expression for E be illustrated by a curve in which E is the
vertical ordinate and x the horizontal abscissa, then any point on this
" curve of energy " may be taken to represent one
                                                               configuration of
the system, as far as regards the mean distance of the satellite.

Then such a point must always slide down a slope of energy, and we
shall see which way x mnst vary for any given configuration.       This
consideration  will enable us to determine the sequence of events,
when we come to consider the expressions for i, e, j, n in terms of x.
  "We have now to consider the further steps towards the complete
solution of the problem.
   The only difficulty remaining is the integration of the two expressions
in the first' and second of (14).     From the forms of the expressions
to be integrated,    it is clear that they mnst be split up into partial
fractions.    The forms which these fractions will assume will of course
depend   on  the nature of the roots of the equation as*— /t#3 + l=0.
   Some o' the properties of this biquadratic were discussed in a
previous paper, but         it will now     be necessary          to consider   the subject
in more detail.

where    Xs —    4\ — h3=0.
  By using the property (\5 —             /<)   (\3   +    7t)=4\, this expression may       be
written in the form

Its equation is 7(2=X(X2 — 4).
   It is obvious that OA=OA'=2.
   The maximum and minimum values of /r (viz., Tib, B'b') are given
by 3X2=4or X=±2/3».
  Then  Bi=B'6'=-23/3i + 4. 2/3*=(4/3»)2.
  Since in the cubic, on which the solution of the biquadratic depends,
h? is necessarily positive, it follows that if h be greater than 4/3' the
cubic has one real positive root greater than OM, and if h be less than
4/3', it has two real negative roots lying between O and OA', and
one real positive root lying between OA and OM.
   To find OM we observe that since 7i2 is equal to (4/31)2, and since
the root of Xs— 4X— h2=0 which is equal to —2/3* is repeated twice,
therefore, if e be the third root (or OM) we must have
whence (2/3,)2e=(4/3»)l!, and e or OM=4/3».
  Now OA=2; hence, if h be less than 4/3J, the cubic has a positive
root between 2 and 4/3', and if h be greater than 4/3', the cubic has a
positive root between 4/3* and infinity.
   It will only be necessary to consider the positive root of the cubic.
   Now suppose h to be greater than 4/3'.
   Then it has just been shown that X is greater than 4/3*, and hence
(X being positive) 3XS is greater than 1G\, or 4(\s— 4X) greater than
Xs, or 47(2 greater than Xs, or 27tX~3 greater than unit}'.
Therefore         + h)      -/T^2lx=5}2=                 -   {         + h)   ^2h\-,-l        }2.
Thus the biquadratic         has two real roots,                   which we may call          a and   1>.
  Then                      a=i(X*+fc)[l+ ^27/\-|-l],
                            b=i(Xt+A)[l- ^2/iX-l-l].
  It will   now be proved that a                  is   greater and       b    less than $h.

   Since the left-hand side is negative and the right positive, the left is
  less than the right, and therefore b is less than h.         \
      If, therefore, h be greater than 4/3', we may write

  where a — h, f   %h
                      — b are positive, and where a is negative.
      We now turn to the other case and suppose h less than 4/3*.                     All
  the roots of the biquadratic are now imaginary, and we may put

                                               7 is  y(\i + 7i).
     Then it only remains to prove that         7 is greater than fTt.

 but it has been already shown that in this                  case,  A, is less than 4/3*,
 wherefore 7 is greater than        \h.
     We may now proceed to the required integrations.
     First case where h is greater than 4/3*.
     Let           z+-7tx3 +  l = (z-a)(z-b)[(z-*)2 + /32],
 so  that the roots are a, b, «+/3«.

    Then since      j  tends to become constant when *= +              oo, and since
 3— 1=    y,   therefore when x is very large e tends to vary as«V.
    If x be very small      j  has a finite value, and i varies as x, and e varies
as x9.
   j, i, and   e  all become infinite when .r=b, and         i also becomes infinite
when x=h.
    This analytical solution is so complex that it is not easy to under
stand its physical meaning ; a geometrical illustration will, however,
make it intelligible.
   The method adopted for this end is to draw a series of curves, the
points on which have x as abscissa and i,j, e, n, E as ordinates.               The
figure would hardly        be  intelligible  if all the curves were drawn at   once,
and therefore a separate figure is drawn for i, j, and e ; but in each
figure the straight line which represents n is drawn, and the energy
Lrurve is also introduced in order to determine which way the figure is
to be read.       The zero of energy is of course arbitrary, and therefore
the origin of the energy curve is in each case shifted along the vertical
nxis, in such a way that the, energy curve may clash as little as"
possible with the others.
   It is not very easy to select a value of h which shall be suitable for
drawing these curves within a moderate compass, but after some con
sideration    I  chose A=2'6, and figs. 2, 3, and 4 are drawn to illustrate
this value of h. If the cubic X3— 4\ — (2'6)2=0, be solved by Cardan's
method, it will be found that X=2 5741, and using, this value in the
formula for the roots of the biquadratic we have
         x*-2-6    a* + l=(»-2-539)(*--826)[(s+-382)»+(-575)s].
   Hence      a=2539,         b= 826,      a=-     382, /3= f>75,   ^=195, and
4a1=2 356, 4^=4-496, *, =2-332,               ^  + ^=^771.

 the equations4— 2-6j;;, + 2=0, viz., a;=2'467 and z=ri03.           The max
imum and minimum values of e are given by the roots of the equation
x*— 2'6z+H=0, viz., 3=2-495 and x=l-0095.                The horizontal asymp
 totes for ijA and j/A are at distances from the axis of x equal to
exp. ('062x^1-) and exp. ( — -062x£ir), which are equal to T102 and
 •908 respectively.
    Fig.   2  shows the curve illustrating the changes of t, the obliquity of
the equator to the invariable plane.
    The asymptotes are indicated by broken lines ; that at A is given
by z ='826, and is the ordinate of maximum energy; that at B is given
by a:=2-6, and gives the configuration of the system for which the
planet has no rotation.       The point C is given by ;c=2-539, and lies on
the ordinate of minimum energy.            Geometrically the curve is divided
into three parts by the vertical asymptotes, but it is further divided
physically.
    The curve of energy has four slopes, and since the energy must
degrade, there are four methods in which the system may change,
according to the way in which it was started.           The arrows marked on
the curve      of obliquity show   the  direction in which  the curve must be
read.
    Since none of these four methods can ever pass into another, this
figure really contains four figures, and the following parts of the figure
are quite independent of one another, viz. : (i) from — oo to O ; (ii)
from A to 0 ; (iii) from A to C ; (iv) from + oo to C. The figures
•i and 4 are similarly      in reality four figures combined.     For each of
these parts the constant ^1 must be chosen with appropriate sign ; but
in order to permit the curves in fig. 2 to be geometrically continuous
the obliquity is allowed to change sign.
    The actual numerical interpretation of this figure depends on the
value of A. Thus if for any value of x in any of the four fields the
obliquity has an assigned value, then the ordinate corresponding to
that value of x will give a scale of obliquity from which all the other
ordinates within that field may be estimated.

              Diagram for Obliquity of Planet's Equator. — First case.
   As  a special example of this we see that,      if  the obliquity be zero at
any point, a consideration     of tho curve will      determine whether zero
obliquity   be dynamically   stable or not ; for if   the arrows on the curve
of obliquity be approaching the axis of -.r, zero obliquity is dynamically
stable, and if receding from the axis of         dynamically unstable.
   Hence from     ,«= + oo to B, zero obliquity is dynamically unstable,
from    —  qo to O and A to 0 dynamically stable, and from A to B, first
stable, then unstable, and finally stable.
   The infinite value of the obliquity at the point B has a peculiar
significance, for at B the planet has no rotation, and being thus free
from what Sir William Thomson calls " gyroscopic domination," the
obliquity changes with infinite ease. In fact at B the term equator
loses its meaning.     The infinite value at A has a different meaning.
The configuration A is one of maximum energy and of dynamical
equilibrium, but is unstable as regards mean distance and planetary
rotation ; at this point the system changes infinitely slowly as regards

 1880.]            History   of Planet and Singh Satellite.
time, and therefore the infinite value of the obliquity does not indicate
an infinite rate of change of obliquity.   In fact if we put »=Q in (1)
we see that dijidt= — iC^/S) sin 4/ However, to consider this case
adequately we should have to take into account the obliquity in the
equations for dnjdt and dxjdt, because the principal semi-diurnal tide
vanishes when      «=Q.
   Similarly at the minimum of energy the system changes infinitely
slowly, and thus the obliquity would take an infinite time to vanish.
   We may now state the physical meaning of fig. 2, and this interpre
tation may be compared with a similar interpretation in the paper on
" The secular effects of tidal friction," above referred to.
   A fluid planet of small viscosity is attended by a single satellite, and
the system is started with an amount of positive moment of momentum
which is greater than 4/31, with our present units of length, mass and
time.
   The part of the figure on the negative side of the origin indicates a
negative revolution of the satellite and a positive rotation of the
planet, but the m. of m. of planetary rotation is greater (by an amount
A) than the m. of m. of orbital motion.      Then the satellite approaches
the planet and ultimately falls into               it,
                                               and the obliquity always
diminishes slowly.    The part from      to A indicates positive rotation
                                          O
of both parts of the system, but the satellite    very close to the planet
                                                         is
and revolves round the planet quicker than the planet rotates, as in
the case of the inner satellite of Mars. Here again the satellite
approaches and ultimately falls in, and the obliquity always diminishes.
   The part from A to     Cindicates positive rotation of both parts, but
the satellite revolves slower than the planet rotates.    This     the case
                                                                        is
which has most interest for application to the solar system. The
satellite recedes from the planet, and the system ceases its changes
when the satellite and planet revolve slowly as parts of a rigid body —
that      to say, when the energy
         is                            a minimum.
                                         is            The obliquity first
decreases, then increases to a maximum, and ultimately decreases to
zero.*
   The part from infinity to        indicates a positive revolution of the
satellite, and from infinity to    B C
                                     a negative rotation of the planet, but
from     Bto  Ca positive rotation of the planet, which     slower than the

revolution of the satellite.      In either of these cases the satellite
approaches the planet, but the changes cease when the satellite and
planet move slowly round as parts of a rigid body — that       to say, when
                                                                   is

the obliquity diminishes,     ifnegative     increases.

the planet be nil, the term obliquity ceases to have any meaning, since

then, as the satellite approaches the planet, the inclination of the orbit
increases, or zero inclination is dynamically unstable.              In every other
ca»e the inclination will decrease, or zero inclination is dynamically

   This result undergoes         an important modification when a second
satellite is introduced, as will appear in the unpublished paper.
   Fig. 4 shows a similar curve for the eccentricity of the orbit. The
variations of tho eccentricity are very much larger than than those of
 the obliquity and inclination, so that it was here necessary to draw the

   ordinates on a much reduced scale. It was not possible to extend the
   figure far in either direction, because for large values of x, e varies as
   a high power of x (viz., y). The curve presents a resemblance to that
   of obliquity, for in the field comprised between the two roots of the
   biquadratic (viz., between A and C) the eccentricity diminishes to a
   minimum, increases to a maximum, and ultimately vanishes at C.

  This field represents a positive rotation both of tbe planet and satel
 lite, but the satellite revolves slower than the planet rotates. This part
 represents the degradation of the system from the configuration of
 maximum energy to that of minimum energy, and the satellite recedes-
 from the planet, until the two move round slowly like the parts of a
rigid body.
     In every other case the eccentricity degrades rapidly, whilst the
satellite approaches the planet.
    The very rapid rate of variation of the eccentricity, compared with
that of the obliquity would lead one to expect that the eccentricity of
the orbit of a satellite should become very large in the course of its

evolution, whilst the obliquity should not increase to any very large
extent.        But it must be remembered that we are here only treating a
planet   of     small viscosity, and it will appear, in the unpnblished paper
above referred to, that the rate of increase or diminution of the eccen
tricity is very much less rapid (per unit increase of x) if the viscosity
be not small, whilst the rate of increase or diminution of obliquity
 (per unit increase of x) is slightly increased with increase of viscosity.
Thus the observed eccentricities of the orbits of satellites and of
obliquities of their planets cannot be said to agree in amount with the
theory that the planets were primitively fluids of small viscosity,
            I
though believe they do agree with the theory that the planets were
fluids or quasi-solids of large viscosity.

figures 5, 6, 7.    There are here only two slopes of energy, and hence
these figures each of them only contain two separate figures.
    Fig. 5 illustrates the changes of t, the obliquity of the equator to
the invariable plaDe.
    In this figure there is only one vertical asymptote, viz., that corre
sponding to as=l. For this value of x the planet has no rotation, is
free from "gyroscopic domination," and the term equator loses its
meaning.
    The figure shows that if the rotation of the planet be negative, but
the m. of m. of planetary rotation less than that of orbital motion,
then the obliquity increases, whilst the satellite approaches the planet.
    This increase of obliquity only continues so long as the rotation of
the planet is negative.      The rotation becomes positive after a time, and
the obliquity then diminishes, whilst the satellite falls into the planet.
In the corresponding part of fig. 2 the satellite did not fall into the
planet, but the two finally moved slowly round together as the parts of
a  rigid body.
    If the revolution of the satellite be negative, and the rotation of
the planet positive, but the m. of m. of rotation greater than that of
revolution, the obliquity always diminishes as the satellite falls in to
the planet.

   Figs. 2 and 5 only differ in the fact that in the one there is a true
maximum and a true minimum of obliquity and energy, and in the
other there is not so. In fact, if we annihilate the part between the
vertical asymptotes of fig. 2 we get fig. 5.
   Fig. 6 illustrates the changes of inclination of the orbit. It does
not possess very much interest, since it simply shows that however the

rotation of the planet be positive or not, the inclination of the orbit

   And however the system be started with negative revolution of the
satellite, and therefore necessarily positive rotation of the planet, the
inclination of the orbit slightly increases.            Fig. 6 again corresponds
to fig. 3, if in the latter the part lying between the maximum and
minimum of energy be annihilated.

annihilated.
    These three figures may be interpreted as giving the various stabilities
and instabilities of the system, just as was done in the first case.
    The solution of the problem, which has been given and discussed
above, gives merely the sequence of events, and does not show the rate
at which the changes in the system take place.              It will now be shown
how the time may be found as a function of as.
    Consider the equation
/ is here the angle of lagtheof the sidereal     semi-diurnal tide of speed    2»;  :
then by the theory of              tides of a viscous spheroid, tan2/=2n/p,
where p is a certain function of the radius of the planet and its density,
and which varies inversely as the coefficient of viscosity of the
spheroid.*
    Since by hypothesis the viscosity is small,        / is a small angle, so that
sin 4/" may bo taken as equal to 2 tan 2/. Thus, sin 4-fja is a constant,
depending on the dimensions, density, and viscosity of the planet.
    It has already been shown that t2 varies as st-12, and 3 is a constant,
which    depends only on the density of the planet.             Hence, the above
equation may be written
                                    *MJ=K(»-Q),
                                        at
where    K  is a certain constant,       which it is immaterial      at present to
evaluate precisoly.
    Since n—h—x and Q=a>"s, we have
                                 Kdt=      -*"f%

    The determination of this integral presents no difficulty, but the
analytical expression for the result is very long, and it does not at
present seem worth while to give the result.             The actual scale of time
in years will depend on the value of K, and this is a subject of no
interest at present.
   It will, however, be possible to give an idea of the rate of change
of the system without actnally performing the integration. This may

     Among the results of          a large   investigation on which I have for
 many years been engaged in regard of the chemistry of the brain, T
 had been led to conclude that the so-called "protagon" of Oscar
 Liebreich is not a definite chemical body, but is a variable mixture of
 several bodies.        This conclusion of mine (which agrees with opinions
 expressed on the same subject by Strecker, Diaconow, and Hoppe-
 Seyler) was published by me in 1874,* and endeavours to controvert
it have since then been made, on several occasions, by Dr. Arthur
 Gamgee.f         Last summer, he brought before the Royal Society^ his
contentions        for the chemical individuality of " protagon "; and it
fortunately was in my power shortly afterwards to publish evidence,
which,     I  believe, those who will take the tronble to follow it will
find quite unanswerable,            that Dr. Gamgee's contentions were mis
taken^       Part     of my  evidence     to that effect consisted in showing by
quantitative analyses that Dr. Gamgee's so-called
                                                                 " protagon" con
tains 0'7 per cent, of potassium ; secondly, (hat in connexion with
trifling differences in the extraction process, the proportion of potas

from    a trace    to 1*6 per  cent.  ; thirdly,  that with the variable quantities
of potassium the quantities of phosphorus and other ingredients will
also vary.
    In the last published number, No. 200, p.            Ill, of the " Proceedings
of the Royal Society,"         I find that Dr. Gamgee has recently brought
the question again under notice of the Society, and that, in doing so,
he especially rests his case upon the following statement made by his

      As regards the bearing of Professor Roscoe's evidence on the
  question that has been raised before the Royal Society, and as regards
  Home other relations of the same question,           I  beg leave to submit to the
  Iioyal Society the following observations : —
         1.  On the Modifications     of the Spectrum    of Potassium which      are
                              effected by  Plunphoric Acid.
      It  is well known in spectroscopy that the best spectra of metals are
  obtained in the easiest manner by aid of their most volatile com
  pounds, such as chlorides ; and, on the contrary, that salts which
  are more or less fixed at high temperatures, such as the silicates and
 phosphates of alkalies and earths, give either no spectra at all or only
  very feeble spectra. Thus, if a minute particle of potassic bromide
 l>e   ignited in the aerated gas flame before the slit of the spectro
 scope, the spectrum of potassium is at once produced in the most
 brilliant manner : particularly the line in red is brilliant and sharply
 defined, while the gas flame to the naked eye shows the violet colour
 ing of potassium. But when a similar particle of potassic phosphate is
 ignited under similar conditions, the flame, instead of showing the
 violet colour of potassium, shows a greenish-yellow colour produced
by volatilised phosphoric acid : and in the spectroscope, at first, only
the continuous spectrum of phosphoric acid (not to be confounded
with the continuous spectrum of potassium) is               seen, till gradually, and
at a white heat,        a feeble potassium     line in red, with indistinct edges,
is perceived.
     Even a large bead of pure potassic phosphate, when ignited before
the slit of the spectroscope, never produces, even at white heat, any such
intense red potassium line as the smallest bead of potassic chloride,
potassic bromide, or potassic nitrate.             And, in contrast with the latter
salts, which volatilise quickly, the phosphate takes some time before
it is completely volatilised.
                                                                        c  2

    When such an indolent bead of potassic phosphate which has given
 a feeble potassium line in red, is dipped into syrnpy phosphoric acid
 and again ignited, the continuous spectrum of volatilising phosphoric
 acid is again at first obtained, the aerated gas flame to the naked eye
 is enveloped in a greenish-yellow mantle, and in the spectroscope the
 continuous spectrum of phosphoric acid only, stretching far into the
 bine, and without a trace of the potassium line in red, is seen.      Gradu
ally the bead flows again as a transparent glass,          and   then the red
 potassium line reappears in the spoctroscope though without ever
reaching the vivacity of the line produced by volatile salts.          If now
the bead have added to it a particle of a chloride — for example, «inc
chloride — and be again ignited, a lively potassium spectrum will be
Been in the spectroscope, i.e., the potassium goes away as chloride.
That double decomposition with the separation of the products takes
little more time than the volatilisation of a bead of potassic chloride of
about the same size.
    Evidently then, if it were intended to estimate from the spectro
scopic signs the concentration of a given potassic solution, it would
be necessary to take into account not only the intensity of the
potassium line produced during the volatilisation of the solution, but
also the length of time during which that line is perceived.          If solu
tions equally concentrated of potassic chloride and potassic phosphate
are similarly examined before the spectroscope, the phosphatic solu
tion is fonnd to give the feebler baud, but to give it for the longest
time ; and no spectroscopic observation with regard to such a solution
ran pretend to any validity for purposes of quantitative comparison
unless the observer be equally attentive to the duration as to the in
tensity of the phenomenon.
    Referring now, in the light of these considerations, to Professor
Roscoe's letter,     I wish first of all to point out that his observation,
when made with the carbonised "mass from 1 grm. of substance
corroborated my assertion that the substance contains potassium.
And   I  may add, by the way, that in my paper on which Dr. Gamgee
comments to the Royal Society,          I have given sixteen quantitative
           of  " protagon " and its congeners with regard to the
analyses                                                             quantity
of potassium      contained  in each ; having  made   each determination of
potassium     by ordinary gravimetric methods, and having weighed the
potassium     as platinochloride.
    Secondly, however,. Professor Roscoe estimates that the quantity
of potash contained in a gram of Dr. Gamgee's
                                                            "

by him from that substance as compared
potassium salt." This inference I think        it necessary to check by the
considerations     I have before stated.   Professor Roscoe states that    he

 1880.]      Modifications of     the Spectrum     of Potassium, §c.        281
            from                 "            "  a residue of 0 0278 grm. of
obtained           1  grm. of      protagon
metaphosphoric      acid, but   according  to  his  spectroscopic estimate, less
than f\s mgrm. of potassium.         What is the value of the latter half of
this statement when taken with the context of the other half ?
    Before Professor Roscoe could possibly obtain from such         a substance
as   he  seems   to   have examined      any spectroscopic evidence of the
presence of potassium, he would have had to drive away from his
platinum wire a relatively enormous amount of free phosphoric acid.
He would then have had some potassic phosphate left, which, as we
have seen, gives only a feeble and indistinct potassium band in the
red, even when a large bead is heated in the flame before the spectro
scope, and which, in so extremely small an amount as he must have
had,   would of necessity give a fallaciously weak reaction.
    Further, Professor Roscoe seems not only to have thus overlooked
the inhibitive or weakening influence of phosphoric acid in relation
to the spectrum of potassium, but has also omitted to give any objec
tive measures of the intensities which he purports to compare, has
moreover not recorded the length of time during which the compared
phenomena continued, and has not even named what was the
particular potassic salt used by him as a standard in his comparison.
    Apart, therefore, from the inherently small worth of spectroscopy as a
quantitative method, not even those precautions of which the spectro
scopic method admitted were employed by Professor Roscoe, and I
must therefore respectfully submit my opinion that his experiment is
of no practical value.

     Oh the Inorganic Bases awl Salts which are omul in combination with
                            the  Edicts of  the  Brain.
    Fremy, in his research on the brain published in 1841, stated that
the body which he had isolated and termed " cerebric acid," was
frequently combined with soda and phosphate of lime. Another sub
stance, which he termed " oleophosphoric acid," he assumed to bo
ordinarily in the state of soda salt, but sometimes combined in part
with phosphate of lime. He separated these bases and salts by dis
solving the mixture of the two bodies (cerebric and oleophosphoric
acid) in boiling absolute alcohol, which had been made slightly acid
bv sulphuric acid.       Sulphates of lime and soda remained suspended
mixed with some insoluble organic matter, and were removed by
filtration. The cerebric and oleophosphoric acids were in solution,
and deposited on cooling.         From the mixture oleophosphoric acid was
nxtracted by ether, which left the cerebric acid behind. Fremy further
found that cerebric acid combined with all bases, and must be con
sidered a true acid.       When heated with dilute solutions of potash,
soda, or ammonia it did not dissolve, but combined with each of these
bases.    The compounds were also obtained by mixing any of these

 282                           Dr.  J. L. W. Thudichum.                      [Mar.  1*,
 bases    with an alcoholic        solution of cerebric acid. Thus, he prepared
 the insoluble barium compound containing 7'8 per cent, of baryta.
    Bearing this experience of Fremy in mind during my researches on
 the chemical constitution of the brain, I invariably examined for
 inorganic ingredients all the educts which I obtained from the train.*
    Of K ephalin (the most important of the phosphorised ingredients
 of the brain) 10 grms. were dissolved in one litre of water, and
 after filtration precipitated by hydrochloric acid.                 The solution of
 hydrochloric acid and other matters filtered from the precipitated
 kephalin was evaporated to dryness.               A portion was then boiled with
solution of baryta, when traces of ammonia were evolved.                      The rest
 of the residue was then ignited in a platinum dish to destroy all traces
of organic matter.            The ash was but slightly fusible ; was only par
 tially  soluble   in water,     but was easily soluble in water slightly acidified
 by hydrochloric acid.           The solution with ammonia gave an abundant
 precipitate of earthy salts, and the solution assumed a deep blue colour.
 Precipitate and solution were separated by filtration.
    The precipitate dissolved readily in a little hydrochloric acid, forming
a  slightly red solution, suggesting the presence of iron, which was con
firmed by the sulphocyanide test.              In another portion of the solution
dilute sulphuric acid gave an abundant precipitate of gypsum, showing
presence of calcium.            In another portion the molybdate test showed
the presence of phosphoric acid. To the remaining portion a few drops
of ferric chloride were added, then sodic carbonate nearly to neutrality,
and, lastly, barytic carbonate.              The mixture was allowed to stand,
filtered, and the filtrate, free from excess of baryta by sulphuric acid,
was again filtered, and the filtrate, after supersaturation with ammonia,
gave a great precipitate with ammonic oxalate, showing presence of
much calcium.         The filtrate from this calcic oxalate on concentration,
and treatment with ammonia, ammonic chloride, and sodic phosphate,
gave the precipitate            characteristic   of magnesium.       The precipitate
produced as above described by baryta carbonate, was boiled with
excess of pure soda, and the filtrate was warmed with ammonic
chloride     ; only a slight turbidity ensued, so that          it may     be assumed
that aluminium was absent.
    The alkaline filtrate from the foregoing precipitate by ammonia was
tested for lime by oxalate, when a considerable precipitate was pro
duced, showing the presence of lime uneombimd with phosphoric arvl.
and which therefore must have been in combination with part of the
kephalin. The blue solution was again filtered from calcic oxalate,
which had been entirely precipitated, and was acidified with hydro
chloric acid. The copper was precipitated by hydrothion, the filtrate

This residue exceeded in bulk the bases previously removed. It was
fusible with ease, and on solidification became white and crystalline,
but interspersed with many red particles of ferric oxide. It was a
mixture of potassic and sodic chlorides, and of some ferric oxide, which,
owing to the presence of the chlorides, had escaped precipitation by

described at length in my researches above quoted,                       is,
                                                         at least in part,
combined with ammonium sodium, potassium, calcium, iron, copper, and
                             ,
calcic and magnesic phosphates.   This experience was repeated a great
number of times, and, in the aggregate, on several hundred grams of
dry kephalin.                                                                      ,
    In the following experiments myelin (the phosphorised ingredient
 which stands next in importance to kephalin in the chemistry of
 the brain)* was examined for inorganic bases, in order to obtain
some knowledge regarding their relative amounts and nature.               The
 myelin was dissolved in water, precipitated by hydrochloric acid, and
the acid solution separated by filtration.       The copper was removed by
 hydrothion, the filtrate evaporated to dryness, and the residue ignited
 in a platinum dish.       During this ignition much amnionic chloride was
given out, and its nature distinctly proved by condensing and analys
 ing it.
    The fused mass was dissolved in dilute hydrochloric acid, and the
solution so obtained treated with excess of ammonia.               The white
gelatinous precipitate      which    was  thrown down  was  scarcely coloured
 black by ammonic sulphide, indicating the presence of only a trace of
iron. The precipitate and filtrate were submitted to analysis, qualita
tive and quantitative, as follows: —
    'Flie precipitate was dissolved in dilute hydrochloric acid, the solution
was nearly neutralised by sodic carbonate, after addition of some ferric
chloride an excess or barytic carbonate was now added the mixture
         ;                                                                     ;
was shaken, allowed to stand, and then filtered.             From the con
centrated filtrate the barium was then removed by sulphuric acid,
and the filtrate was precipitated in the presence of excess of ammonia
by ammonic oxalate.            The oxalate so obtained was converted by
intense ignition       into   oxide,  which weighed U'1994 grm., equal to
U-1423 grm. calcium.           The filtrate and washings from the calcic
oxalate     were  treated  as  usual for the quantation of magnesium, and
there was obtained 05556 grm. magnesic pyrophosphate, equal to
01212 grm. magnesium. The precipitate which had been produced
bv ferric chloride, and sodic and barytic carbonates, was dissolved in

   The filtrate was proved to be free from magnesium and calcium.
The potassium contained in it was extracted in the usual manner, by
means of platinic chloride, giving 11'2766 grms. of the double salt
(2KCl,PtCl4) equal to 3 651 grms. potassic chloride, or P911 grm. of
potassium. The mother-liquor and washings were evaporated to dry
ness, and theplatinum was removed by extracting the ignited mass
with water acidified by hydrochloric acid. The extract so obtained
was evaporated to dryness and fused ; the residue weighed 3-45 grms.,
being pure sodic chloride equal to P356 grm. sodium.   The quantities
of sodium and potassium thus found were controlled by the analysis of
a separate part of the original solution containing their chlorides; and
on calculating from the residue obtained on evaporation there should
have been found a total quantity of chlorides = 7-09 grms. There m<
found potassic chloride = 3'651, and sodic chloride = 3'450 ; together.

  In the kephalin research, related above,   was proved that kephalin
                                                     it
was partly in combination with calcic oxide or lime, without any other
acid being united with that base. In the myelin research    was found it
that, in myelin, there may be in combination even a much greater
quantity of potash and soda than of lime.
  A third research was now made on the mixture of phosphorised ami
nitrogenised substances, which Fremy termed
                                                " ckrebric acid," ami
which later writers have termed
                                 " PROTAOON." This, after exhaustion
with ether, was redissolved eight times in hot spirit, and after filtra
tion reprecipitatcd on cooling.  It was pressed to remove all mother-
liquor, was then suspended in water and heated until           became      it

was now added, whereupon the organic matter curdled and con-
t racted;   was separated, and the acid solution was treated like the

giderable quantities of the same bases and salts as those obtained from
kephalin and myelin were isolated, but not examined any fnrther.
   It  had been ascertained in previous operations on these mixed phos-
phorised and cerebrin bodies, and was now again observed, that one
treatment with acid was insufficient to free them entirely from bases.
The bodies which had been treated with acid were, therefore, treated
with lead acetate solution in the cold, and were allowed to stand. The
liquid which formed was filtered from, and pressed out of the lead-
compounds, and on proper treatment yielded as follows : — sodium,
= 1"78 grm. ; potassium, = 1"185 grm. ; calcium, — 0 08 grm. ; and
magnesium, 0'02 grm.         The sodium was weighed as chloride ; the
potassium, 0"85G grm., ns bitartrate. and 0'32 grm. as platinic chloride;
the   calcium   as  carbonate   ;  and  the magnesium as pyrophosphate.
The respective preparations are herewith submitted for inspection.
   Curious facts which deserve notice are the following. When so-
called " protagon
                    " was
                            decomposed by baryta to obtain neurin, it was
observed that the platinic chloride salt of the base always contained
potassium.     When the neurin was combined with phosphomolybdic
acid, and carefully washed, and then again transformed into platinic
 chloride salt, it became free from potassium.         In both cases the salt,
 was crystalline, but the crystallisation was different in the two cases.
 The crystals containing potassium were most perfectly formed indivi
 duals, sometimes more than half an inch in length and breadth, and
 an eighth of an inch in thickness, while, on the other hand, the
 crystals free from potassium were bundles of needles, of lighter aspect
 and not admitting of angular measurement.            The experience shows
 that the platinic chloride compound of potassic chloride is dimorphous,
 and in one of its forms is isomorphous with the platinic chloride salt
 of neurin hydrochlorate.      It is further remarkable that the impure
 Lsomorphons   mixture   crystallised in well-defined individuals, while the
 pure salt crystallised in confused masses and in bundles of needles.
 The crystals of the perfect type, when powdered and burnt on a
 platinum wire in an aerated gas flame before the spectroscope, produced
 the line in red characteristic of potassium. This specimen is herewith
 submitted for inspection, as also a specimen of the salt free from
 potassium.
    The foregoing data may perhaps contribute to explain some of the
 discrepancies which have been found between different specimens of
 nenrin platinic chloride, and have caused the inconvenience of a
 number    of different formula? being attributed to neurin, namely,
 G5H15NO„ or C5HuNO, or C5H14N, or C5H12N. They may also explain
 why neurin from
                     " protagon " has been supposed to consist of a mix
 ture of two bodies, having respectively the formula? C5H16N02, termed
 oxyneurin, and C6H15NO, termed neurin. According to my own
 numerous analyses (Reports as above, No. VIII, p. 118, et scq.), the

 2*6           Modifications of   the Spectrum   of Potassium.    [Mar. 18,
principal ammonium base from the phosphorised substances has, after
purification by the phosphomolybdic process and combination with
hydrochloric acid and platinic chloride, invariably the composition
C,HuNO.
   The stoichiometric    relations of such a base, in its platinic chloride
salt, would  be doubly   disturbed   by the presence of potassium ; for not
only would a portion of the platinic chloride, namely that combined
with potassic chloride, be erroneously referred to neurin, but the entire
amount of platinum, if estimated, as is usual by combustion, would be
raised in apparent amount by the presence of the potassic        chloride as
an invisible impurity.
   The Albuminous Ingredient of the brain contains considerable
amounts of the usual salts, particularly calcic phosphate, of which the
calcium is obtained as gypsum, when the albumin is treated with dilute
sulphuric acid, and the solution of hemi-albumin is filtered from the
undissolved hemi-prote'iu and slowly evaporated.         By combustion of
the albuminous matter of the brain, all the usual salts and bases,
including copper, iron, and manganese, are liberated.
   The greater part of the soluble salts contained in the brain passes
into the water extracts, while the greater part of the insoluble salts,
such as phosphates of earths, remain with the albumin ; but a portion
of both remains with the phosphorised and nitrogenised principles, and
follows them into all their solutions in ether and alcohol. Only sulphates
have not been found in these latter, though they are present in the
water extracts.
   It follows that all educts from the brain have to be freed from the
salts or bases described before they can be subjected to quantitative
chemical examination ; and an error which seems to me to pervade all
analyses of the brain for inorganic ingredients hitherto is the follow,
ing.    When the brain is burnt in its entirety, the phosphoric acid
resulting from the destruction of the phosphorised compounds expels
sulphuric, hydrochloric, and carbonic acids, and comes to be considered
as an inorganic ingredient, the fact of its previous combination being
overlooked.    When the brain is freed from matter soluble in spirit
and ether, and the albumin and water extract alone are examined for
inorganic ingredients, the fallacy otherwise introduced by the phos
phoric acid in organic combination is no donbt avoided ; but the inor
ganic salts described above, as in combination with the phosphorised
and nitrogenised matters are overlooked and left out of consideration.
   A vast range of other organic analyses
                                               (animal and vegetable) for
inorganic constituents is no doubt affocted by the same
                                                             fallacy, and it
seems to mo that the right
                                 making of such analyses is a much more
complicated problem than has hitherto been believed.

 1880.]         On Magnetic    Circuits in Electric Machines.             287
 VI. " On Magnetic Circuits in Dynamo- and Magneto-Electric
     Machines. No. 2." By Lord Elphinstone and Charles
     W. Vincent, F.R.S.E., F.C.S., F.I.C. Communicated by
       Professor G. G. STOKES,         Sec. R.S.        Received March 10,
       1880.
   A large amount of magnetism is retained by the soft iron cores of
electro-magnets, when arranged so as to form a complete magnetic
circuit : and sparks and other indications of the passage of an
electric current can be obtained at the ends of the helix wires sur
rounding those soft iron cores, each time the masses of iron are
separated and the closed magnetic circnit opened.            In order to pro
cure a spark the breaking of the eircuit must be effected suddenly,
either by a jerk, tilt, or sliding movement.
   In the case of the 58 lb. magnet described in our former note, the
current that is capable of causing a spark, although only momentary
in duration, is found to be sufficient in quantity and intensity to
magnetize a small electro-magnet, weighing with its coils between
•">
   and     6lbs., enablingit   to sustain its own weight for any indefinite
time when suspended by its armature.
    When the armature of the small magnet       is   placed at the distance
of    of an inch from its poles, in such a manner as to be free to move,
the instant the armature of the large magnet       is  suddenly tilted or slid
off   it darts to them, the completion of the circuit of the small
 magnet being signalled by a smart click. The rupture of one closed
magnetic circuit     is  thus caused to produce another closed magnetic
circuit.
    But when the interval between armature and magnet, whose circuit
it  was intended to close, exceeded  \     of an inch, the former was not
 attracted with sufficient force to overcome the friction of the table
 upon which    it was resting.
    The mode of removing the armature              from the large magnet
 appeared to be of no moment, but the time occupied by the removal
 had much influence upon the amount of magnetic force manifested in
 the smaller circuit.     This was particularly the case    if there were an
 interval, no matter how small, between the armature and the poles of
 the magnet round which the electric current was sent.
    For example,    if  with an interval of         of an inch between the
 armature and the poles of the small magnet, the armature of the
 large magnet was slowly slid off, the magnetization . of the small
 magnet never rose to a sufficient intensity to draw its keeper to itself,
 whereas, when the sliding took place rapidly, the small armature was
 strongly attracted as above mentioned.
    The largest amount of magnetization      was bestowed upon the small

288              Lord Elphinstone and C. W. Vincent.            [Mar. 18.
electro-magnet    by the interaction, when it was held upright, its poles
being completely covered by a closely fitting armature.        And it was
also found   that when   thus  set up in preparation for the formation of
a closed magnetic circuit, the magnetization was produced by a much
slower motion of the large armature than when the small magnet had
its circuit partly open. When the circuit was completely closed, if
the large armature were twisted off by a slow equable motion, in such
a manner that both poles were uncovered at the same time, then the
small magnet could be made to sustain not only ita own weight
(between 5 and 6 lbs.) but an additional 3 lbs. also.
    During the passage of the electric current, obtained by the forcing
open of the closed circuit, the fall of magnetism in the large magnet
itself is checked, the direction of the magnetic polarity remaining un
changed, the current checking or opposing the fall being in the same
ilircction  as that from   the battery which caused the primary mag
netization.    If the ends of the helix wires are not connected together
this effect is not obtained.
    Electric currents, though of less intensity and quantity, can be
produced in the helices of electro-magnets, without altogether break
ing up the closed magnetic circuits. For instance, with the 58 lb.
electro-maguet, the circuit being completely closed by its armature,
and the helices being connected with a galvanometer, a very slight
pull applied to the armature produces a current of electricity giving a
considerable deflection of the needle in the same direction as the
battery current; and the stronger the poll the greater the deflection
of the galvanometer needle, up to the point at which the magnet is
lifted from the ground, after which no further motion of the needle is
produced, unless the magnet is subjected to additional strain. Thus,
hanging a 4 lb. weight upon the uplifted magnet, produced deflections
in the same direction as the pull on the armature, and on removal of
the weight produced reverse deflections.
    Trying the same set of experiments with a very small electro
magnet, so that we might proceed to absolute rupture of the closed
magnetic circuit without danger to the galvanometer, we found that
the addition of successive weights to the magnet while hanging sus
pended by its armature, produced successive deflections            of the
galvanometer, the needle coming to rest at zero after each addition,
as in the case of the large magnet.
    When the maximum weight which the magnet was capable of sus
 taining was reached, and a real movement of the armature com
 menced, the induced current in the helix of the electro-magnet       was
 very greatly increased by the addition of even the smallest weight.
    From these experiments it may be inferred that in like manner as
 •he passage    of an electric current round a bar of iron produces
 elongation of the bar, so the elongation of the bar produces in its

 1880.]           On Magnetic     Circuits in Electric Machine*.            28H
turn an electric current in the helix, which tends to strengthen the
magnetization ; and also that a magnet is absolutely stronger under
tension than when at rest.
    On the other hand, pressure on the armature, either continuous or
sudden and momentary             (a blow for example), causes an electric
current in the helices in the opposite direction to original magnetiza
tion, or in other words, against magnetization ; tending thereby to
weaken the power of the magnet.
    The 58 lb. magnet in closed circuit was hung by its armature, and
on afterwards connecting its helices with the galvanometer no current
could be detected, but on lowering it until it rested with its whole
weight on the ground a current in the direction of demagnetization
was produced, giving a deflection of 15°.            In the same way a current
in the direction of magnetization was obtained, giving a deflection of
15°, by the application of sufficient strain to lift the magnet off the
ground, and this result was invariable. The degree of swing, however,
depended upon the rapidity with which the magnet was either raised
or lowered.
    It may be remarked that whereas any very slight application of
force by pulling on the armature was sufficient to cause a current in
the helices giving a deflection of 5° to 10° of the galvanometer
needle, a great amount of pressure is necessary to produce a similar
deflection.      A. slight pull with the finger and thumb in the one case
was equal      to the pressure of a hundredweight in the other.
    By the momentary removal of the armature, the closed magnetic
circuit is broken, and though by its immediate restoration a new closed
circuit is formed, nevertheless the tension on the molecules of iron bv
 the magnetic stress is very      greatly reduced. Under these conditions a
 very slight pressure upon       the  armature produces a great swing of the
 noodle, whilst a pull produces scarcely any effect at all until actual
 movement of the armature takes place.
    If  the pressure on the armature is great and continuous, a point is
 soon reached at     which a slight pressure is no longer effective.
     The effects produced are somewhat different if pressure is applied
 unequally.      For instance : — A weight of 7 lbs. placed on the armature
 over the north pole of the 58 lb. magnet caused a current in the helices
 giving a deflection of 20° at the galvanometer.           The same weight on
 the south pole gave the same deflection in the opposite direction.
  Pressure with the hand produced like swings of the needle pro
 portionate to the force used, and the amount of swing can be easily
 controlled, and the needle brought to rest by judicious pressure on
 either pole of the magnet.
     If a lateral pressure   be applied   to one side of the armature between
  the poles,  and the needle swings sny      5° : on removal of the pressure, a
  current is produced      in the opposite   direction, and the reverse swiDg

in place of being        5°   will   be 8°, and so on   in proportion to the amount   of
force made use of.
   None of the above-mentioned   effects could be shown with the small
magnets under pressure    and it was not found possible to produce a
                                      :
recognisable current without actual movement of the armatures.
   Under certain circumstances the attractive force of electro-magnet*
in closed magnetic circuit is found to increase with lapse of time.         For
example   : — A   small   (J -shaped  electro- magnet    with limbs  6   inches
long, having a core of £-inch iron, and helices consisting of four layers
of No. 16 covered copper wire, when excited by four Bunsen cells,
supported as an armature a similar U -shaped iron bar, but without a
helix upon     it,
                 this latter remained firmly attached after the voltaic
 current had ceased, but the hanging on to            of an additional weight
                                                            it
of 3  lb.6  oz. instantly wrenched          away from the electro- magnet,
                                                it
and broke the closed magnetic circuit.
   The magnet was then re-excited, the armature being fixed to the
electro-magnet     by being held in contact with the poles whilst an
electric current, of a few seconds' duration, passed through the circu
lating wire. In place of immediately attempting to add any additional
weight, the two iron          were left hanging face to face, in the form of
                              JJ     's
the link of a chain, for twenty-four hours, at the end of which time
the weight of      3lbs.   oz. was hung on and snstained.
                               6                                  Forty-eight
hours later, an additional weight of         lbs. 10 oz. was carefully added,
                                                  3
making in all       lbs. snstained.
                     7                Twelve hours afterwards         lb. more
                                                                           1
was added, bringing up the entire weight to           lbs. beyond that of the
                                                            8
armature  ;  this was suffered to remain for five days, when the system
was taken to pieces.
   On a subsequent occasion the same magnet sustained an entire
weight of 10 lbs. beyond that of the U_fmaPe<l armature, the weight
sustained being reached by beginning with an amount well within
the sustaining power of the electro-magnet wire in closed circnit, and
increasing    by small additions made with intervening intervals of
              it
time varying from twelve hours to several days.
   Another and smaller    magnet was likewise experimented on this
                                   JJ                                          ;
weighed with  its coils lbs.  oz.  Its armature was a strip of soft
                                   3      6
iron completely covering the poles, and having a hook in the centre, to
which weights could be easily attached.
   This electro-magnet was excited by the passage, for a few seconds,
of the current from two one-pint bichromate cells.       On breaking
battery contact, the armature failed to sustain     lbs.  The electric
                                                                 4
current was again sent round the electro-magnet, and the armature
was pressed ngainst the poles, being carefully adjusted so as to cover
them completely, and at the same time to place the hook precisely                  i»
the centre, so that the pull should be fair and eqnal when a weight
was hung upon it. By this careful manipulation, on breaking con

1880.]           On Magnetic Circuits in Electric Machines.             291
tact with the bichromate cells, the closed magnetic circuit was found
capable of sustaining the 4 lb. weight.
    By successive additions of 2 oz. weights, made at intervals of a few
minutes, the weight hanging to the armature was raised to 5 lbs., after
which the attempted addition of 2 oz. caused the disruption of the
system.
    The experiment was repeated under similar conditions, but with
slightly extended intervals of time between the additions of the 2 oz.
weights. The magnet in closed circuit was made to hold 4 lbs.,
4^
     lbs., 4£ lbs., 4 lbs. 14 oz., 5 lbs. 2 oz., the time taken in all, for
the successive additions, being ten minutes.         The system was then
left for twelve hours, when by additions of 4 oz. at intervals of a
few minutes the weight sustained was increased to 6 lbs. 4 oz. Eleven
hours later, this was further increased to 7 lbs. C oz., and two hours
afterwards to 8 lbs. 2 oz.
    A still smaller electro-magnet, weighing with its coils 5 oz., and
having an armature consisting of a very thin slip of soft iron, when
excited by one of the bichromate cells, eould not be made when in closed
circuit to sustain    li lbs. at the moment of breaking the voltaic circuit.
It, however, sustained 1 lb. with ease. The latter weight was there
fore suspended, and the cell wires     removed after the closed magnetic
circuit was completed.         By successive additions of 2 oz. weights at
Bhort intervals of time (five minutes to ten minutes each), this small
magnet could be made to sustain 2 lbs. 2 oz., but the addition of 1 oz.
 beyond this weight at once separated the armature and magnet.            It
was thought that a longer interval of time should, as in the former
 instances, enable the magnet to sustain a still greater weight.     It was
 therefore brought into closed circuit, as before, and made to sustain
 2 lbs. 2 oz. in the manner just related, and was thus left for twelve
 hours.    Successive additions of 2 oz. were then made to the hanging
 weight    until  it reached 2 lbs. 14 oz. Twenty-four hours afterwards,
 4 oz. more were added, bringing the entire weight suspended to 50 oz.
    This small, soft iron magnet which, at the instant the voltaic current
 was withdrawn, was totally unable to sustain five times its own weight,
 was thus, by gradual growth of its magnetic force, enabled to hold ten
 times its cwn weight.
     In the course of these experiments it was remarked that the longer
 the period the soft iron remained in closed magnetic circuit the more
 magnetically ductile did its molecules appear to become. An electro
 magnet, which had been for a few days in closed circuit, could after
 rapture of the circuit be made to sustain weights in a fresh closed
 circuit at much shorter intervals of time than if it was magnetized,
 after being for some time with its poles uncovered.       The direction of
  the battery current with referance to the residual magnetism of the
 electro-magnets appeared to be of no moment.          A magnet which had

               On Magnetic Circuits in Electric Machines.       [Mar. 18,
been   left for somo time with its poles uncovered had less residual
magnetism after a momentary current had passed throogh its helices,
t ban another    magnet which had been in active closed circuit, even if
the battery current had, in the latter case, to overcome a considerable
amount of residual magnetism.
    We found, moreover, that soft iron magnets retain their residual
magnetism longer, and are capable of acquiring increased magnetiza
tion much more rapidly after having been bearing weights (thereby
keeping the iron in a state of strain), than if they have been left in
their normal condition and without bearing any weight at all.
    The conditions under which the closed magnetic circuit retains its
force arc not yet clearly established.
    With the 58 lb. magnet a succession of gentle taps struck vertically
with a wooden mallet upon the centre of the armature, while resting
 on the magnet in closed circuit, in a very few moments completely dis
 sipated the magnetic force so far as the sustaining power of the magnet
 was concerned.
    Removal of any portion of the weight suspended to the armature of
a magnet hung up in closed circuit likewise tends to dissipate the
force of the circuit. For example : — Half an hour after the removal of
 :i weight of 10 lbs., which had been suspended to the armature of a
  U magnet for twenty-one days, the armature fell off on receiving a
 slight touch. In another experiment, a U magnet, which was capable
 of sustaining 7 lbs., and which had actually been suspending 4 lbs.,
 was left for two months with the armature on onl}', the weight having
 been removed ; at the end of that time a very slight shake was suffi
 cient to cause the armature to fall off. Many other examples might be
 quoted to show that release from strain diminishes the magnetic force
 of the circuit.
    In these experiments, in which the closed magnetic circuits had
 given way, the soft iron had been in a state of strain from which it
 had been released by the removal of the suspended weights.             But
 when no weights were hung upon the armature, and the iron had
 never been in a state of magnetic tension, the closed magnetic circuit,
 so far from diminishing, increased in force.      The 58 lb. magnet was
 excited with a voltaic current so feeble, that although the magnet
 could be lifted by the armature in closed circuit, yet great care was
 necessary that the lift should be exactly vertical ; and very little force
 was required to slide the armature off the poles. After the lapse of a
 month the armature was so firmly held that the utmost exertion of
 manual force could not stir it by a sliding movement, and the whole
 magnet could be raised from the ground even if tilted as much as 15'
 from the perpendicular.
    The magnetism of the closed circuit of the 58 lb. magnet disappears
 alter repeated up ar.d down movements of either one or both of its

1880.]           Influence   of Electric Light  upon Vegetation.            293
helices, provided      the ends of the helix wires are connected together
either singly in two separate circuits, or together in one continuous
circuit. Every up or down movement of either of the helices produces
currents in the wires either for or against magnetization, which
currents apparently so disturb the molecules of the iron that the
fixity of their original magnetic direction is lost.
    In like manner as the movements of the armature, or the increased
or diminished tension of the iron, produce currents of electricity in
the helix wires surrounding the magnets : so the movements of the
helices produce currents of electricity which may either magnetize or
demagnetize the iron. With the 58 lb. magnet in closed circuit, the
two ends of one of the helices being connected to the galvanometer,
and the two ends of the other helix being connected with each other,
the latter helix is moved towards the armature, a current is produced
in the galvanometer helix which shows a fall of magnetization.               On
moving     the  same   helix away  from   the armature,  a current is  produced
in the direction of magnetization.
    In another experiment 30 yards of No. 16 covered copper wire,
with its ends connected together, and so coiled that it could be moved
 freely from pole to pole over the armature, was placed on one limb of
 the 58 lb. magnet and the closed circuit established.            Both helices
 were then brought into continuous' circuit through the galvanometer.
     On movement of the coil of wire from south limb to the north limb
 of the magnet, a current was produced showing an increase of mag
 netization.      On moving the coil in the opposite direction, i.e., over the
 north limb pole, and on to the south one, the current is reversed, and
 is in a direction which would cause demagnetization.
     It appears, therefore, that any interference with the lines of force
 about a magnetic circuit, means an interference with the magnetic
 circuit itself, and points to the possibility of building up magnetic force
 of magnets by the mere movement of wires in these lines of force,
 though the coils moved need not of necessity be connected with the
  helices surrounding the magnets.

        Light upon Vegetation." By C. William Siemens, D.C.L.,
        LL.D., F.R.S. Received March 18, 1880.

     When upon the 4th of March, presented to the Royal Society a
  paper on the above-named subject,         I was able to show by the result of
  experiment the effect of radiation from the electric arc in promoting
  the formation of chlorophyll within the leaf-cell of plants, and in
  favouring vigorous and continuous growth.
     I ventured to expresR an opinion that the ripening of fruit would

 294            Influence  of Electric Light upon Vegetation,    [liar.  18,
be accelerated by the same agency,       but proof thereof was then want
ing.    A continuation of my experiments has furnished interesting
 evidence that the electric arc is also efficacious in hastening the
ripening process in strawberries, and probably in nearly every descrip
 tion of fruit.
    Several plants of early strawberries in pots were divided as before
 into two groups, the one to be subjected to the action of daylight only,
 and the other to solar light during the day time, and to electric light
 during the night. Both groups of plants were placed below glass at
temperatures varying from 65° to 70° F., but those that were to receive
 daylight only were shielded from the effect of the electric light during
the night by matting.
    At the commencement of the experiment the strawberry plants
 selected were just setting fruit, being still partly in bloom.       After
 eight days the fruit on the plants exposed to electric light had swelled
very much more than on the others, some of the berries beginning to
show signs of ripening. The experiment was interrupted for two
nights at this stage, but after the electric light was resumed, very
rapid progress towards ripening was observable ; so that with four
days' continuous exposure to both day and electric light, the greater
number of the berries had attained to ripeness, and presented a rich
colouring, while the fruit on those plants that had been exposed to
daylight only had by this time scarcely begun to show even a sign of
redness.
    This experiment goes to show that the electric light is very effica
cious in promoting the formation of the saccharine and aromatic
matter upon which the ripening and flavour of fruit depends ; and
if  experience should confirm this result, the horticulturist will have
the means of making himself practically independent of solar light
for producing a high quality of fruit at all seasons of the year.
    Two strawberry plants are placed before the meeting illustrative of
the result here described.
    Although   I have shown that in employing a lamp of 1,400 caudle-
power a distance of 3 metres produces a maximum                   beneficial
result on vegetation, the effect is nevertheless very marked upon
plants at greater distances.       This influence at a distance was illus
trated in my experiments by the condition of three melon plants
towards the back of the house, which throve remarkably well for a
period of about a fortnight, during which the electric light was
placed in front of the house, at a distance of from 5 to 6 metres from
the plants.     The electric light was then removed in front of the other
end of the same house, thus depriving the plants in question of its
influence, since which time they have continued their growth, but
show a very decided falling off in size and colouring of the leaves that
have since formed.

    In reply to the questions that have been frequently asked regarding
 the cost of maintaining an experimental electric light of 1,400 candle-
 power, such as      I have used in these experiments,       I may state that the
 3 horse-power        Otto gas engine employed in driving the dynamo-
 machine, consumes nearly 900 cubic feet of gas during the night of
 12 hours, or 75 cubic feet an hour (including 7 cubic feet of gas
 employed by the igniting burner) which, at 3s. 6d. per 1,000 cubic
 feet, represents a cost of a little over 3d. an hour, or with the carbons
 bd. an hour.        This, however, does not include superintendence or
 incidental expenses, the amount of which must depend upon the
 circumstances      of each case.*

Dear Sie,
  I  have just received a copy of a paper by Professor Maxwell from
the "Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society," read April 11,
1878, " On the Stresses in Rarefied Gases." To this paper I fiud that
there is an appendix added in May, 1879, in the course of which he
refers to my investigation in the following words : —
   " This phenomenon, to which Professor Reynolds has given the
name of Thermal Transpiration, was discovered entirely by him. . . .
                     I
It was not till after had read Professor Reynolds's paper that beganI
to reconsider the surface conditions of a gas, so that what     I
                                                              have done
is simply to extend  to the surface phenomena the  method  which     I
                                                                  think
most suitable for treating the interior of the gas.    I think that this
method    is,
           in some respects, better than that adopted by Professor
Reynolds, while  admit that his method
                 I                         sufficient to establish the
                                                   is
existence of the phenomena, though not to afford an estimate of their
amount."
  As the abstract of my paper does not contain   sufficient account of
                                                        a

 what is in the paper to enable a reader to form a fair judgment of the
 relative merits of the two methods, I venture to request those inte
 rested in the subject to withhold their opinion until they have an
 opportunity of reading my paper. In the meantime        I  can only express
 my opinion that Professor Maxwell is mistaken in supposing that the
 results which are obtained from his method are more definite than
 those to be obtained by mine.
    His method only applies to a particular case, and the equation which
 he has given is identical with that which 1 have given for this parti
 cular case.
    The particular    case treated   by Professor Maxwell is the extreme
 limit — when the tube    is large as compared with the distances between
 the molecules ; he does not deal at all with the other limit — when the
 distances between the molecules are large as compared with the tube.
 Whereas     I have given definite values for the coefficients in both
 limits, as well as indicating the manner in which the coefficients vary
 between these limits.
    It so happens that the case in which the tube is large as compared
 with the molecular distances is one in which the results are too small
 to be experimentally appreciable, and hence Professor Maxwell's
 method does not explain any of the actual experimental results.
    In order to explain the experimental results obtained with porous
 plates, Professor Maxwell has reverted to Graham's assumption that
 fine plates act as apertures in thin plates, while the coarse plates act
 like a tube, an assumption which my experiments show conclusively to
 be unnecessary and erroneous, the only sensible action in either case
 being that of tubes, and hence the phenomena of porous plates is that
 of transpiration and not effusion.
                                        I remain
                                            Yours truly,

                           Note by the Communicator.
    In  communicating    the above letter to the Royal Society, in accord
ance with Professor Reynolds's wishes,       I would beg permission to add
a few    remarks.
    Professor Maxwell did not profess to treat more than the two
extreme cases, constituting what Graham called respectively transpi
ration and diffusion.      His statistical method applies, indeed, only to
the first of these limits ; but he has distinctly considered the second,
following a suggestion of Sir William Thomson's.          It is true that at
the first limit, as Professor Reynolds remarks, the results are too
                                                               T 2

small to be experimentally appreciable ; but this was distinctly stated
by Professor Maxwell himself, at the foot of p. 256.
                               I
   As to the second limit, must remark, in the first place, that can   I
not find that Graham made any assumption that porous plates act as
apertures in thin plates.      The result that the time of passage varies,
caeteris paribus, as the square root of the density in the case of fine
porous plates, was obtained by pure experiment;            and though he
could not fail to notice the accordance of this result with that of the
mere hydrodynamical passage through a small aperture, he has care
fully distinguished between the two. Nor can I agree with Professor
Reynolds in regarding the explanation given by Professors Thomson
and Maxwell of the phenomenon of thermal transpiration or thermal
effusion, whichever it be called, afforded by assimilating a fine porous
plate to a thin plate pierced by apertures of ideal fineness as erroneous,
even though it should be shown that such assimilation is unnecessary.
Professor Maxwell did not profess to treat in his paper the inter
mediate cases between the two extreme limits.
   Perhaps     I should mention, that the foot-note at p. 281 in Professor
Maxwell's paper was added as the paper passed through the press.            I
recollect noticing the thing as,, in my capacity of Secretary,      I looked
over the paper before sending it to be printed off, and considering
whether I should affix a date. As, however, it seemed to me to con
tain merely an explanation of an expression in the text, and as MaxwelL
who had carefully added the dates of fresh matter in other parts, did
not seem to have thought it necessary to do so in this case, I left it as
it was.     In a letter I received from him at the time, he informed me
that he felt very ill, and was hardly fit even to go through his own
 paper ; though a subsequent letter, in which he entered into some
scientific matters, was written in his usual cheerful style.         No one
had,    I believe, at that time any notion of the very serious nature of
his illness.

                                                    Discharges.
        By William Spottiswoode, D.C.L., LL.D., Pres. R.S., and
        J. Fletcher Moulton, late Fellow of Christ's College,
        Cambridge.      Received March 11, 1880.
                                   (Abstract.)
    This paper forms     a sequel to that published under the same title in
the " Phil. Trans.,"     1879, p. 165.   It describes a continuation of the
research into the nature and laws of the disruptive discharge, or elec

1880.]         On the Sensitive State  of Vacuum Discharges.           303
trie spark.     The methods of the earlier paper have been extended, and
others adapted to the new circumstances have been devised, in order
to carry the investigation into high vacua. In particnlar, independent
sonrces of electricity have been nsed for affecting the discharge,          ¦
whether in the sensitive or in the non-sensitive state ; and the results
have been confirmatory of the conclusions derived from the more
limited means formerly described.         Further, the effects of various
tubes containing discharges in the sensitive state upon a tube con
taining a discharge in the non-sensitive state have been observed
and   compared ; and the tube so used as a test has been called the
standard tube, and the method of its use the standard tube method.
By this means, principally, the laws of the discharge in comparatively
moderate vacua have been extended to high vacua.
    In the higher vacua, the phenomena of molecular       streams, and the
phosphorescence consequent on them, that have been studied and de-          .
scribed by Mr. Crookes, present themselves.        These derive great im
portance    for the purposes  of the present paper from the fact that in
high vacua the ordinary luminous discharge becomes so feeble in
appearance that it is often difficult to observe. Under these circum
stances the phosphorescence, which like the ordinary luminous effects
may exist either in a sensitive or in a non-sensitive state, forms the
best index of what is going on within the tube.       Much information as
to the nature and procedure of the discharge may be derived from the
mode of interference of one molecular stream with another, from the
direction and character of shadows cast by these streams, and by a form
of interference which has here been called that of virtual shadows.
    The conditions of pressure and of electrical violence, under which
phosphorescence is produced, have been carefully studied ; and it has
been found that, with a suitable adjustment of the discharge, the
phenomena are not confined to high vacua, but can be obtained under
pressures much exceeding those of ordinary vacuum tubes. The phe
nomena of these molecular streams have also been compared with
those exhibited by the projection of finely divided solid conducting
matter when heaped up over the negative terminal, with the view of
ascertaining the nature of the phenomenon and its position in the
discharge.
    At the close of the paper the authors have discussed some of the
general conclusions which they think may be fairly drawn from their
present researches.      First, as to the relative order of magnitude of

    Referring to a former Part (" Phil. Trans,," 1858, p, 43) the author
gives,' in the present, descriptions of subsequently received fossils of
 Megalania prisca, advancing the knowledge of that species of large
 extinct lizard.    Characters of the dorsal, sacral, and caudal vertebite,
 with those of a considerable portion of the skull, are detailed.          So
 much   of  the upper jaw   as is preserved  shows   the  species to have had
 that part sheathed with horn, as in the tortoise.       Upon the head were
 seven horns, three in pairs and one single ; they are defined as the
 " supraparietal," " supratemporal " and " post-orbital " pairs ; the
 single  and  symmetrical  horn is " nasal."
    In the comparison     of this character     with the known genera of
 lizards, the author finds the closest correspondence in the diminutive
 existing Australian species, Moloch horridiis, Gray. He concludes with
 remarks on the probable habits and conditions of extinction of the
 subject of his two papers.
    The cranial fossils were discovered by George Frederic Bennett,
 Esq., Corr. Member of the Zoological Society of London, in the bed of
 "King's Creek," Queensland, Australia ; and were transmitted to the
 author   by George Bennett, M.D.,     F.LS.

       Fonvtelle. Communicated          by the President.      Keceived
       April 15, 1880.
    I have the honour    to submit to the Royal Society of London an
apparatus   -which  I have invented, after having witnessed an experi
ment by M. Dieudonne Lontin.
    The original Lontin experiment consists in the rapid and continuous
rotation of a magnetised steel needle, placed under the influence of
the currents of a peculiar induction machine.
    The object of my apparatus is to give a movement of rotation in a
horizontal plane, not only to a needle, but to any moveable piece of
iron which is symmetrical in reference to its axis of rotation.      It is
consequently composed of (1) a vertical coil, which 1 have made rec
tangular, but is susceptible of receiving any form ; (2) a Buhmkorff
coil of a peculiar construction ; and (3) the axis of suspension.     This
piece   can  be  removed at pleasure, and another substituted, thus
demonstrating the form to be indifferent, if it is placed in equilibrium.
The coil may however be horizontal, and in that case the moveable
piece will rotate in a vertical plane.
    The apparatus has been constructed in order to work easily with
one Bunsen cell of 20 centims. height, or with one or two bichromate
of potassium cells.
    Above the frame is placed a horseshoe-magnet, supported by a
vertical axis, round which it can be placed in any particular azimuth
that may be required for the experiments.        This axis can be taken
away,    and the horseshoe-magnet    can be replaced by one or two or a
large number of bar-magnets, laid flat upon the frame. It is possible
also to place other bar-magnets underneath the frame, in a space
arranged for this purpose. It is possible also to place four magnets
laterally, two on each side of the frame, or to replace them by a
number of electro-magnets.
    To produce a continuous movement of rotation, the magnet3 do not
appear to be absolutely necessary, althongh they greatly increase the
velocity, and outweigh every chance of perturbation and uncertainty.
    But the motion without magnets presents peculiarities, which are of
great interest, and have led to an explanation, accepted by M. Lontin,
and which will be developed more fully hereafter.
    Under ordinary circumstances the moveable piece does not start by
itaelf, but requires an external impulse.
    Another peculiarity of this movement is that the direction of the
current can be altered without altering, in any respect, the direction of
the rotation, although sometimes it diminishes or increases the velocity.
But owing to the necessity of giving an impulse to the moveable

piece, these experiments are rather tedious, as it is necessary to wait
for some minutes before knowing with certainty whether the rotation
is due to electro-magnetic reactions or to the mechanical impulse.
   All the effects exhibited with magnets and moveable pieces of iron
have the advantage of being prodnced without the help of any external
force other than magnetical attraction working at a distance.   This it
is,
 I    venture to think, what renders them so really effective.
     When the moveable pieces are star-shaped, or composed     of a
number   of iron pieces insulated magnetically, they are not moved
by themselves, except when they occupy certain positions in relation
to the position of equilibrium of a magnetic needle under the action
of continuous voltaic current flowing through the coil.
     a
     Under the   same circumstances, the more arms the star possesses    the
more easily  itrevolves.  An even number of arms appears to be less
favourable to rotation than an uneven number.
     But the difference of the phenomena exhibited when there        is   no
magnet in operation      very striking, as there  isthen   definite direc
                         if is
                                                         a
tion of rotation, and     the moveable piece should be propelled in the
wrong direction, its velocity quickly diminishes, and the piece soon
rotates in the right direction.    If the magnet  is placed in a direction
perpendicular   to the  frame   the  rotationisstopped.
     A
     very small moveable piece has also been constructed so that    it   can
be placed  in different positions in the interior of the frame. The position
of the axis within the frame involves no difference in the direction of
the rotation, although the velocity can be in some degree altered, but
it   not very easy to ascertain the fact, the velocity being so great
     is
that very often the motion seems to be imperceptible to the eye. These
phenomena, which can be varied to any extent, as will be shown
hereafter, appear to be capable of a very simple explanation, by an
application of the laws of induction discovered by Faraday.
  The possibility of producing the same movement by means of
moveables of any form whatever, and notably of two spirals constructed
of a flat wire and wound in an opposite direction, appears to demon
strate that the rotatory action exercised individually on each molecule
                                 is
of iron, and that the total impulse must be regarded as the integral of
the individual impulsive actions.       This remarkable property appears
to furnish   a   very simple    means   of  completely explaining all the
circumstances of these curious phenomena by means of the known
laws of induction, and to dispense with having recourse to any new
hypothesis.    It    sufficient, in fact, to remark that the molecule of
                    is
iron acts in its movement of rotation in two different ways in each of
the two nearly equal currents of induction which successively traverse
the spirals, but the alternate appearances of which are separated
                         '
by very feeble intervals of time. In fact, during the whole continuance
of the two phases of rotatory movement which the galvanometric frame

brings closer together, each molecule of soft iron increases the intensity
of the current which affects          it,
                                   and which, independently of its real
direction, the author calls positive, in order to fix the ideas at the              ;

for the same reason,      called negative.
                                 is          In two other phases of its
movement the same molecule diminishes the intensity of the positive
current, which then tends to draw        back, and increases that of the

negative current, which turns       away from the frame.

exerted in the two phases of the movement, that               is,
                                                        in the total extent
of the plane described by the molecules, tend then to keep up the con
tinuous rotation, which progressively increases in speed until      reaches         it
that which corresponds to the absolute intensity of the attractions or
repulsions exercised by the currents induced by the energy of the
inductive current, the value of the friction of the resistance of the arc,

of a permanent magnetic centre, the movement            possible only in a

direction determined by its position and its nature.          The author
believes that this principle applies even to the action of the earth.
   When we change the position of the active pole in relation to the
axis of rotation, the rotation changes its direction but the pole of;
the magnet may be placed above or below, to right or left, without
the rotation changing its direction.   The two poles of bar or a horse- a
shoe-magDet combine to accelerate the movement when they are
placed in the direction of the frame but       ;we place the magnet in a

                   is
not to have the capacity of being magnetised and demagnetised to the
given extent, will remain insensible to these successive dynamic re
actions,     and consequently immoveable, and that             it       is necessary to
employ      the softest possible iron in the construction               of the moveable
objects.     The                   especially with the spiral, may evi

I    must not omit to mention also a number of other phenomena
which at least, in some respects, can be quoted in support of that
opinion which my friend, M. Lontin, considers also as being valid.

     If
     we take two spirals made of a similar iron ribbon, but curved in
an opposite direction, viz., the one to the left and the other to the right,
the velocity and direction of rotation are precisely the same under
similar circumstances.       This proves the action to be really molecular.
   This remarkable experiment may be made in a very striking form.
If we place a left-handed spiral to the left of the frame, and a right-
handed one to the right, or vice versa, at a distance sufficiently small
from the frame, the influence is felt, and the rotation of the two spirals
is obtained.     But they rotate in the same direction.   If the axis of the
spirals  be placed   so near to the  frame  that  a part of the solid is im
mersed in         the rotation may be very rapid indeed.

impossible    to  witness  that  experiment   without  coming  to  the con
clusion that           not unreasonable to believe that a motive power

comparable with that of other magneto-electrical         machines may be
obtained by taking advantage of these properties of the induction
current.
     This conviction            receives some       support    from the following curious
experiment.
     If        be placed on the top of the machine, after the removal
          a spiral
of the horseshoe-magnet,      rotates under the influence of the two bar-

magnets   placed  underneath.    The direction of rotation     in reverse        is
direction to the gyration of      moveable placed in the interior of the
                                            a
frame, but in the same as the moveable whose axis    placed outside.        is
   A very pretty experiment can    be  made  by placing a number of
moveables in these various positions, and to see them changing their
direction under the influence of active magnets, when the direction of
primary current of the coil    altered.     is
  Experiments have been tried to ascertain whether induced currents,
or even interrupted currents, can work the machine.      The results
appear  to have been affirmative, at least for the inducing current,
although the phenomena are less easy to produce. It has been acknow
ledged also that the velocity    increased by placing the condenser in
                                             is
communication   with the coil, and that the number of vibrations exerts
also a great influence.
   It easy to show that a magnetised steel star will not move
          is                                                                            if   it   is
magnetised up to saturation, and                  if
                                     incompletely magnetised                          it   works
like an ordinary star, but with a reduced velocity.
   A magnetic bar placed perpendicularly to the frame and within it
prevents the rotation of the moveable piece. But an iron bar placed    if             is
in the     same position,        it   seems to accelerate     it   at all events, the motion
                                                                   ;
seems to be a reversible one.                Here   the    direction of the primary current
isreversed and ceases almost to rotate or    stops entirely.  it
  All these varied experiments appear to be in conformity with the
theory already developed, but all these points, as well as many others,
require more mature consideration.

    Perhaps the best forms of the moveable piece are the spiral and
the copper disk, surrounded by a continuous ribbon of iron.
   No result was obtained with unmagnetisable substances, but the
experiments were not made with a sufficient degree of accuracy to
be deemed final.
    No attempt has been made either to ascertain whether the rotation of
the moveable pieces obtained by a motive power can produce alternate
currents in the coil, which appears to be very dubious, as the motion
is produced by the destruction of the symmetry which exists generally
between the two sides of a galvanometric frame.
    It  can be very easily proved that the frame is an excellent magneti
sing machine, and that the magnetisation takes place in the position of
equilibrium of a magnetised needle under a continuous current.            If a
needle is placed horizontally within the frame, the end which is sent
forward becomes magnetic, so that it is very easy to alter the mag
netism in any way which might be required.
    The induction machine which is presented has been reproduced
from one which M. Lontin had constructed for some special purposes,
described in a letter inserted in
                                        " Electricite "
                                                        (5th April last), and
the peculiarity of which is that inducing and induced wires have
a similar resistance.     But I understand that the resistance of the wire
going round the frame may be enlarged to four times its present value
without diminishing the velocity of the rotation in any sensible manner.
 So the actual conditions can be largely altered without interfering
 with the production of the phenomena under consideration ; and it
may be inferred that the motive power derived from them can be
greatly increased by these obvious alterations, although it is quite
impossible to state whether it can be made useful to any practical
 purposes.
    In concluding   this short preliminary notice,    I would venture to add
that the apparatus most nearly resembling mine is Faraday's disk,
 with this difference, that it is made of mica and worked by a f rictional
 electrical machine. The mechanical work produced is very small in
 either instrument.
    It  may be stated to the credit of the gyroscope that the work done
 by a man in turning the glass disk, is executed under the actual con
 dition by one Bunsen element of 20 centims. high ; so that in certain
 respects the action may be said to be wonderfully great.        But it must
 not   be forgotten that it is really Faraday's   disk which has paved the
 way in this new field of electrical researches ; and that certainly I
should not have taken advantage of the experiment shown to me by
M. Lontin, if I had not been acquainted with all the circumstances of
the disk rotation exhibited to me by your great natural philosopher so
 many years ago.

        March 4, 1880.
    In the year 1878 the Council of the Royal Society made       a  grant of
£50 from the Donation Fund, towards the expenses of carrying on an
investigation of the Caves of Borneo, which it was thought possible
might prove to contain remains both of palaxmtological and anthro
pological interest.     A similar grant was made by the British Associa
tion, and a Committee appointed ; and by the aid of private subscrip
tions a sufficient sum was raised to secure the services of Mr. Hart
Everett, whose report upon his investigations, extending over a period
of nearly nine months, is now enclosed.
    A preliminary report from the Committee,        together with one of
Mr. Everett's reports has already been submitted to the British
Association at its meeting in Sheffield, and has appeared in print.       It
was then pointed out that although the examination of these caves
had not, as was hoped, thrown any light upon the early history of
man in that part of the world, yet that the evidence obtained, though
negative in character, was not without value, inasmuch as the true
nature of the Borneo cave deposits had now been carefully ascertained
by Mr. Everett. His final report confirms             the opinion already
expressed.      It only remains to be added that with the exception of
the bones mentioned in the enclosed note by Mr. G. Busk, F.R.S.,
which have been placed in the Museum of the Royal College of
 Surgeons, the whole of the objects sent to England by Mr. Everett
 have been made over to the British Museum.          Accompanying this is
 Mr. Everett's first quarterly report, together with his map and
 plans, so that they may if thought fit be deposited in the archives of
 the Society, so as to be available, if necessary, for future reference.

at Semabang.        It reappears in the Tatan River near Bintulu, and
again comes to the surface in the Niah, Baram, and Linbang rivers,
in Brunei territory, and it is known to be largely developed in northern
Borneo.
   Where the original structure of the rock has not been obliterated
by metamorphic action, it is found to be crowded with organic
remains (encrinites, &c), but as these have never been examined by
palaeontologists, it is impossible to fix with any approach to exactitude
the age of the formation.        Its position relative to the other rocks of
the island is also not well determined.          It appears, however, always
to underlie the great sandstone-conglomerate formation which con
stitutes the major part of the highlands of north-west Borneo.
    The limestone hills nowhere attain to a greater elevation than
1,800 feet above the sea-level, at any rate in Sarawak, and they more
commonly vary from 300 feet to 800 feet in height.             In the Baram
district the Mulu Mountain is said to be limestone and to rise to a
                              I
height of 9,000 feet, but am not aware that it has ever been visited
by a European observer.         The hills invariably spring up steeply from
the low country, and the majority of them present lines of old sen-
cliffs which generally face to N. and N.W., i.e., towards the quarter
still occupied by the waters of the sea.            The rock itself is much
fissured   and jointed, and the hills in many instances        are absolutely
honeycombed with caverns.
    As is usual in limestone districts the drainage of the country is
 largely subterranean.      Owing to this fact, coupled with the heavy
 rainfall (the mean for the last three years was 165 inches at Kuch-
 ing), the land at the base of the hills is subject to freqnent flooding
 during the prevalence of the north-east monsoon, when the under
 ground watercourses are of insufficient capacity to carry off the water
 as fast as it reaches them. As an instance of the extent to which sub
 terraneous drainage with its consequent subterranean denudation has
 gone on in Sarawak, I may cite the Siniawan river, which passes
 beneath four distinct hills in its short course, and one of these hills —
 the Jambusan Hill — is pierced besides by at least three ancient river-
 tunnels of large size at varying levels.
                        2. T/te Caves and their Deposits.
    The total number of the caves examined by me has been thirty-two,
 of which two were situated in Mount Sobis, up the Niah river, and
 the remainder in Upper Sarawak Proper.            They comprised examples
 of tunnel, fissure, and ordinary ramifying caverns. Partial excava

tions were carried on in twelve of these caves. The deposits con
tained in them varied.       A few afforded nothing bnt thick accumu
lations of bats' or bird-guano still in process of deposition.         This
deposit was examined in three instances, and proved to be perfectly
barren, with the exception of a few of the bones of the bats and swifts,
to which it owed its production.        The commonest deposit in the caves
of Upper Sarawak was found to be an exceedingly tenacious, dark
yellow, homogeneous clay, which is sometimes crusted over with as
much as a foot of dry mortar-like stalagmite, and sometimes is itself
concreted into a kind of stony, pseudo-stalagmitic mass ; but more gene
rally it occurs in the form of simple wet clay lying immediately on
the limestone floors of the caves and without any other deposit above
it. It occurs both at the water-level and in caves 150 feet or more
above it.    Occasionally, as in some of the Bidi caves, it is mixed with
sand and fine water-worn gravel.          It is evidently derived from the
waste of the clay shales and soft felsitic porphyries which now make
up the lowlands in the vicinity of the limestone hills — worn fragments
of these rocks occurring in it.       I have very seldom met with organic
remains in this clay, notwithstanding that, in addition to my own
excavations,    I have always been careful to search for bones in the
debris left by streams running through the caves and carrying away
the softer parts of the deposit.      Such few remains as have presented
themselves indicate that the clay is of fluviatile origin. They com
prise bones and teeth of pig and porcupine, a large part of the skeleton
of a Chelonian reptile, and numerous land and fresh-water shells. A
prolonged search would doubtless reveal remains from time to time,
 but certainly not in sufficient abundance or of interest to warrant the
 cost of exploration.
    In addition to the guano and clay, there was found in four instances
 a regular series of deposits (in caves Nos. V, XIII, XXI, and XXXII),
 of which the following note represents the section, as generalised from
 the excavations in caves Nos. V and XIII.
    (1.) A surface layer of disturbed earth composed largely of char
 coal, rotten wood, and bamboos, with fragments of modern pottery,
 glass beads, recent bones, quantities of fresh-water shells (chiefly the
 common potamides), and other debris — being the relics left by the
 Dyaks, who camp temporarily in the caves when they are employed in
 gathering the harvests of the edible birds' nests, which is done three
 times annually.     This layer is, in some cases, a mere film, but about
 the entrance hall of No.   XIII  it was as much as a foot in thickness.
    (2.) A  talus of loam or clay mixed with earthy carbonate of lime,
 which locally forms a hard concrete, and crowded with the tests of
 many species of recent land shells, together with the bones, generally
 fragmentary, of various small mammals belonging chiefly to the order
 Rodentia.     This talus is composed, in great measure, of large angular

 1880.]         On the Exploration        of the  Caves  of Borneo.          313
 and subangular blocks of limestone.             In cave  No.  V  its summit   is
 nearly  50  feet above  the  floor  of  the cave.
    (3.) A stratum of river mud mingled with bat-guano, and with
 rounded masses of limestone and creamy crystalline stalagmite inter
 spersed.    The maximum thickness observed in the excavations was
 3 feet.   This stratum is crowded with the remains of bats, and also
 with those of larger mammals — all (as            I am led to understand) of
 genera now extant in Borneo.            The bones are almost invariably in a
 very  broken   condition, and    so rounded     and water-worn as to be past     .
 identification. As a sample of these bones has been examined in
 England, it is not necessary to speak more particularly of them here.
 In addition to the mammalian remains, the mud exhibits a miscel
 laneous assemblage of the remains of small reptiles (chiefly Chelonian),
 fish bones and scales, chelae of crustaceans, land and fresh-water
shells, leaves, &c, &c.      In the upper level of this river mud traces of
the presence of man are abundant.
    (4.) The yellow clay, more or less concreted into hard pseudo-
stalagmite, and containing casts of land shells, and bones and teeth of
 pig. In No. XIII, a narrow band of nearly pure stalagmite (about
 4 inches thick) intervenes between the river mud and the yellow clay.
 The latter deposit rests immediately on the limestone floor of the cave.
 It contains a few water-worn pebbles and fine gravel, and it has been
extensively denuded, prior to the introduction of the river mud
above it.
    The foregoing series of deposits is found, with wonderfully slight
variation, at points so distant from each other as Jambusan and Niah.
 At both places the floors of the caves which present it are at a level of
some 40 feet above the flat land at the bases of the hills.             All four
caves open on the face of a perpendicular cliff, so that their height
above the present valleys affords a gauge of the denudation of the soft
rocks in the vicinity of these hills since the introduction of the river
mud.
    The above are the principal kinds of deposits that are met with.
Apart from the evidence         as to   their slight antiquity afforded by the
mammalian remains, and by the fact of the presence of man in a fairly
advanced stage of civilisation in the particular instances examined, it
seems highly probable that the contents of all the Sarawak caves, at
least to a height of many hundred foet, will prove equally recent, and
for the following reason : The contents of the Sarawak caves must
have been accumulated since the date of the last submergence of
north-west Borneo, unless the subsidence of the land was very trifling
indeed.     But the submergence actually went on to a depth of 500
feet, and probably much more, as is abnndantly evidenced by the
indications of purely marine denudation on the inland hills ; and that
it was very recent in a geological sense may with fairness be deduced,

314      Messrs. A. H. Everett,     J.  Evans, and G. Busk.       [Apr. 15,
I think,   from the slight amount of differentiation which the present
Fauna    of  the island has undergone since its last connexion with con
tinental Asia, coupled with the rapid rate at which the Sarawak coast
is even now advancing seaward, which argues that the tract of land
now intervening between the sea and the limestone hills cannot he
of much antiquity.         The absence of any heavy floors of crystalline
stalagmite in the caves seems to add confirmatory testimony in this
direction, as does, perhaps, the absence of the large mammals of Borneo
(elephant, rhinoceros, tapir, and wild ox), from the north-west dis
tricts.   It may be worth remarking, that all the tribes of Land Dyaks
have most circumstantial traditions current among them on the sub
ject of a great subsidence of the land.
    With regard to the rate of accumulation of the cave-deposits in
 Sarawak, it seems probable that it would be in excess of that generally
 observable in the case of other countries, for the rocks are of an ex
 tremely decomposable class, and, as      I have noted above, the rainfall is
 prodigious.
    With respect to the possible future discovery of ossiferous deposits
 other than those mentioned above,       I  think it probable that such will
 be found.      They cannot, however, be very numerous in proportion to
 the number of caves.       The natives have been in the habit for many
 years past    of excavating the contents of the caves and fissures for the
 purpose of washing out the alluvial gold they afford.            The caves
 examined in this way are situated at all elevations up to 100 feet.
 Both Malays and Chinese set a value on fossil teeth, which they pre
 serve as charms or use for medicinal purposes ; nevertheless, they have
 never met with a regular ossiferous deposit in the course of their ex
 plorations.      Had they done so, it would have been certain to attract
 their attention. Bones and teeth have, however, been found from time
 to time, and of these I forwarded a sample to Mr. Evans, but many
  of them were evidently quite recent.
     In the event of other bone-beds being ultimately discovered in any
 part of Borneo, they will doubtless resemble generally the accumula
 tion of fluviatile debris described in caves V and XIII. At present no
 animals habitually use caves in this island in the same way as the
  caves of Europe were used by the large Carnivora as retreats to
  which to carry their prey, so that the rich assemblage of mammalian
 remains which characterises the old hyama deus of England cannot
  be looked for in Borneo.        On the other hand, the fissures which
  abound like natural pitfalls   over  the limestone country, and which in
  Europe have furnished deposits of bones, are in Borneo barren or nearly
  so, so far as my experience has gone.         The reason is to be found, I
  suspect, in the remarkably rugged and precipitous nature of the lime
  stone hills, which makes them practically inaccessible to the larger
  mammals, and in their dense coating of jungle, the matted roots of

which bridge over all the fissures to  a greater or less degree, and afford
a safe   passage to the smaller animals.
                          3. The Human Remains.
    Many of the caves present traces of the presence of man. Eleven
of the caves examined by me exhibited such traces, and 1 had infor
mation of five others. The cave exploration has, indeed, yielded traces
of man or his handiwork under three distinct sets of conditions,
viz., (1) in river gravel, (2) in the river mud of the Jambusan
cave, as mentioned in the preceding section, and (3) in the surface-
layers of various caverns in Upper Sarawak and at Niah.
     (1.) During my first exploration I discovered imbedded at the
bottom of a bed of river gravel exposed in a section on the left bank
of the Siniawan river, a single stone celt. It was forwarded to the
late- Sir C. Lyell with a note of the circumstances of its occurrence,
and was pronounced by him to be of Neolithic type.            It is the only
existing evidence, to my knowledge, of the use of stone by man for
the manufacture of industrial implements yet discovered in Borneo.
At present iron seems to be universally employed even by the rudest
 tribes.
     (2.) In cave No. XIII, scattered abundantly throughout the upper
 8  inches of the river mud, there occurred water-worn fragments of a
rather coarse but fairly well made pottery.        It was so fragmentary
and water-worn that it was impossible to distinguish of what kind of
utensils it had formed a part. Associated with it were a few marine
shells (Cardium, Cyprcea, and others), a single fragment of stone
apparently bearing marks of human workmanship,             pieces of burnt
bone, fresh-water shells (Neritina and Potamides) also bearing the
marks of fire, the tooth of a tiger cat, with a hole bored through the
base, a rude bone bead, and a few clean chips of quartz.            No stone
implements properly so called were observed, though carefully looked
for. These remains indicate the presence of a settlement of people at
some distance without the cave on the banks of the stream, which
formed the river mud deposit.      The quality of the pottery shows that
this people had attained a fair degree of civilisation. The presence of
the marine shells seems to imply that the sea coast was within easy
reach of the vicinity of the Jambusan Hill.         The remains generally,
although of slight interest except to the local archaeologist, belong to
a ruder stage of art than the following.
     (3.) The traces of man in the remainder of the eleven caves above
referred to consist of human bones, associated, in some instances, with
works of art. These remains occur always either just within or but a
few yards removed from the entrances of the caves.             The caves in
which they lie commonly open on the faces of steep mural precipices.

of not less than 100 feet above the valley.       The bones have belonged
to individuals of various ages, they are mostly fragmentary, and they
lie scattered on the surface, or but lightly imbedded in the earth
without reference to their proper anatomical relations. Their con
dition will be better judged from the sample sent than from any
description that I could give.      Occasionally fragments occur bearing
the marks of fire.      The works of art associated with them include
broken jars, cups, cooking pots, and other utensils of earthenware.
The pottery is of excellent make, and often glazed and painted.
Besides the pottery, beads and armlets of a very hard dark-blue glass,
pieces of iron, manufactured gold, and fragments of charcoal have
been met with.        Similar beads are in the possession of the Land
Dyaks at this day, but they can give no account of their origin.
     No tradition is extant among the natives with regard to these relics.
No tribes in Borneo make habitual use of caves either as domiciles, or
as places of sepulture, or for any other purpose.           The character of
the earthenware, however, and the use of iron and gold point to a
 very modern date indeed for the people who left these si^ns of their
 presence and hence the subject, though curious to a local geologist,
 does not call for any detailed remarks here.        It is very possible that
 the remains date    no farther back    than the Hindu-  Javanese occupation
 of Borneo, when this part of the island with Pontianak and Banjar
 were tributary to Majapahit, or they may be of Chinese origin — in
 either case quite recent.
                           4. Concluding Remarks.      ¦
     The general result of the exploration may    be summed up as    follows :
 — The existence of ossiferous caves in Borneo       has been proved, and at
 the same time the existence of man in the island with the Fauna, whose
 remains are entombed in these caves.            But, both from the recent
 nature of this fauna, and from the fact that the race of men whose
 remains are associated with it had already reached an advanced stage
  of civilisation, the discovery has in no way aided the solution of those
  problems for the unravelling of which it was originally promoted.        No
  light has been thrown on the origin of the human race — the history
  of the development of the fauna characterising the Indo-Malayan sub-
  region has not been advanced — nor, virtually, has any evidence been
  obtained towards- showing what races of men inhabited Borneo pre
  viously to the immigration of the various tribes of Malayan stock which
  now people the island.      Furthermore, the presumption that the north
  west portion of Borneo has too recently emerged above the waters of
  the sea to render it probable that future discoveries will be made of
   cave deposits of greatly higher antiquity than those already examined,
   has been strengthened.      Under these circumstances it seems advisable
   that cavern research    in  north-west Borneo should now be left to

 private   enterprise, and that no further expense should be hazarded,
 at any rate, until the higher parts of the island in the north-east may
 be conveniently examined.

 Sibaiyat range of limestone hills, situated up the right-hand branch of
 the Sarawak River, which will assist in giving an idea of the appear
 ance of the cliffs referred to. In the Stiiat Mountain similar cliffs
 rise sheer up from the plain to a height of 1,"200 feet.       I also inclose
 a sketch of that part of the Jambusan Hill known as Gunong Bak, in
 which are found caves V, XIII, and XXI. This sketch was made about
 three years after the jungle had been removed by a bush-fire, and it
 will serve to show how the Sarawak limestone has been worn and
 scarred by denudational agencies.

 subsidence of north-west Borneo reached a depth of not less than 500
 feet from the fact that the limestone hills between the upper part of the
 Sarawak River and the Samarahan exhibit traces of marine denuda
 tion equally with the hills situated nearer to the coast, although their
 bases are probably not less than 400 feet higher above the sea-level.
 Pebbles of cinnabar ore have been met with on the summit of the
 Busan Hills. The nearest deposit of cinnabar is that at Tagora, a
peak rising nearly 800 feet above the sea-level ot the base of tho
 Bofigoh Mountain, about eight miles to the southward.          It can hardly
admit of doubt that these pebbles were carried to the spot in which
they occurred when the Busan Hills were submerged beneath the sea,
and, as the hills vary in height from 400 to 500 feet, we have, in this
instance, almost demonstrative evidence of subsidence to the depth
which    I  have indicated as a probable minimum.

be cleared, the land may be observed to be literally studded with
masses of limestone, all fantastically worn, and varying from the
size of small boulders to that of craggy stacks, 30 or even 50 feet,
high. Sometimes two reefs will run out parallel from the hill, and

most striking form presented by the rocks are those of the

the even wash of sea-waves. The exact counterpart of these rocks and
of these inland cliffs may be seen in the Philippine Archipelago on the
present shores of the islands lying to the northward of Surigao. Such
peculiar assemblages of rocks cannot be referred to the action of
 streams varying their course, for the rocks surround every hill, large
and small, and besides, the action of the streams in the limestone
district of Sarawak is rather in the direction of cutting one definite
channel in the solid rock and keeping to it.      Still less could the heavy
tropical rains produce such results by their long- continued operation
over a rock-surface of unequal hardness.       Were there no other argu

               " Sarawak Coast    ....    advancing seaward." — The shore
line of north-west Borneo (Sarawak) appears to be gaining on the sea
steadily as a whole.    Whether the land is stationary and the gain is
due solely to the amount of sediment poured into the sea by an exten
sive river system, draining a country composed of rocks peculiarly liable
to rapid degradation by denudational agencies and exposed, at the same
time, to a rainfall equalled by that of few countries on the face of the
globe, or whether, in addition to the shoaling of the sea by the intro
duction of fluviatile debris, the land is at present undergoing a slow
elevatory movement, I do not feel prepared to decide.           Of the mere
fact of the recent increase of the land there is abundant evidence.
The coast between Lunder and Samarahan, and again, between Kalakat
and Igan, is a flat belt of alluvial soil, but just raised above the level
of the highest tides, and traversed in every direction by broad tidal
channels.    The belt extends inland from ten to thirty miles.          Cape
Sirik is its most prominent point, and, although it is composed of soft
alluvium, and is exposed to the fury of the north-east monsoon, blowing
down the whole expanse of the China Sea, this cape extends itself so
rapidly seawards that the subject is one of common remark among the
natives in its vicinity.   The Paloh Malanans have farmed close up to
the point for many years past, and they state the addition to the land
annually to average three fathoms.      One of the elder men pointed out
a distance of nearly two miles, as showing the increase within his
memory.     Numerous facts could be adduced pointing in the same
direction.

 follows : — " I do not know of any tribe that buries its dead in caves.
 Tana Nipa, of Tatan, was buried in a cave, but this was to secure him
 from his Dyak neighbours.         The Orang Kaya Sahgieng expressed a
 dying wish that he might be buried in Lubang Danan in Ba Koiat, bnt
 it was only in order that he might gain an additional claim to the cave
 in question, the ownership of which was disputed. The ' tailed men '
 between Mandai and Melani are said to live in caves."

    With the exception of portions of the lower jaw of a small pig, and
two or three detached teeth of the same animal, and some fragments
of pottery, the collection is composed entirely of human remains.
    The bones are all more or less fragmentary and vary very much in
condition, some appearing as if they had lain on the surface of the
ground, exposed to the weather, whilst others are partially encrusted
with a friable, argillaceo-calcareons stalagmitic deposit, admitting of
very easy removal.       None of the bones, though some are dry and
fragile, appear to be of any antiquity, and none adhere to the tongue.

     The remains are those of at least five individuals, differing a good
 deal in age and probably of both sexes, but this is not certain.      They
 include —
     1. Eleven or twelve portions of the skull, amongst which are four
 more or less perfect temporals, of which three belong to the right side.
 These bones are all distinguished by the large size of the mastoid pro
 cess ; in one only does any portion of the zygoma remain, which is of
 slender conformation.       The only other specimens belonging to the
 cranium are   —   1. The face, with a large part of the forehead and the
 orbits complete.       This fragment is remarkable for the great com
 parative width across the malar region, which amounts to about 5
 inches, whilst the vertical length of the face from the fronto-nasal
 suture to the alveolar border is scarcely 2^ inches.      The orbits have
 a transverse     diameter of 1""5, and a vertical of 1""25, giving an
 orbital index of "83. The nose measures l"-8x l"'l, affording a nasal
index of '61. The frontal overhangs the nasals very much, and the
frontal sinuses are well developed, but the orbital border is not thick
ened. The alveolar arch is almost perfectly semicircular and very
wide.     The bone is further remarkable for the great apparent depth of
the sphenoidal part of the temporal fossa, owing to the sudden bulging
of the squamosal. The specimen on the whole presents an exaggerated
Malay aspect.
    2. Another and the most considerable         of the cranial specimens
consists of the greater portion of a calvaria.   The entire face is wanting
below the frontal border of the orbits ; as is also nearly the whole of
the right side of the skull.       The calvaria is well formed and evenly
arched ; the forehead upright and rounded.            In the vertical view
 (norma verticalis) the outlino forms a regular broad oval.    The sutures
are all open and for the most part deeply serrated.        The chief points
to be noticed besides the above are (a) the enormous size of the
mastoid process, in a skull otherwise it may be said of delicate confor
mation ; and (6) the extraordinary condition of the foramen magnum,
 the border of which is so much thickened and elevated, as at first sight
 to convey the impression that the atlas was anchylosed to the occipital.
    The bone in the surrounding part of the surface is extremely thin and
 apparently atrophied, but there is otherwise no sign of disease.
    From its imperfect condition this calvaria affords no distinctive
 characteristics, but in one respect it agrees with the facial specimen
 above described, viz., in the remarkable bulging of the anterior part
 of the squamosal where it joins the alarsphenoid.
    The longitudinal diameter of this calvaria is 7" — its width 5 25, and
 height 57, the circumference being 20 inches.
     The other bones of the skeleton are represented by —
     1. A  clavicle   of small size and delicate mske, probably that  of   a
 female.

   2. Two or three fragments of the humerus, in one of which the me
dullary cavity is filled with root fibres. And in its posterior aspect
near the lower end there are three or four transverse cnts of slight
depth, and done as it would seem from the chipped appearance by
chopping with a sharp metallic instrument. There is also a deeper
incision on the external condyloid ridge immediately above the con
dyle.
   3.  An entire sacrum      and a portion    of the left os innominatum
probably of the same individual.
   4. A fragment of the right os innominatum         belonging to another
individual.
   5. Of bones belonging to the lower extremity, the collection includes
portions of four thigh bones, one with the lower epiphysis naturally
detached.     The tibia is represented by three specimens, none of which
present   anything  worthy of remark.      The only bone belonging to the
foot is a first metatarsal of small size.
   From the above it will be seen that these bones present nothing of
especial interest ; and with respect to the race to which they may have
belonged, the information they afford is very meagre.        On this point
all that can be said is that they may well have belonged to the Malay
type, but there is also no apparent reason why they should not have
been of Chinese origin. What tends to afford some support to this
supposition is the marked fulness or bulging of the squamosal in the
sphenoidal fossa, to which     I  have called attention, and which, upon
examination of the collection of crania in the Royal College of Sur
geons, I find is presented by several among the Chinese crania in a
more marked degree than in the other races to which my attention
was directed.

      F.R.S. Received March 17, 1880.
                         (Preliminary Statement.)
   In the year 1859   I made  the following experiments, For the purpose
of ascertaining whether visible movements, similar to those obtained
by passing an electric current through mercury and an aqueous
solution, could be obtained by passing a current through the surface
of mutual contact of two aqueous liquids alone : — " 1st. A definite layer
of oil of vitriol was placed beneath a layer of distilled water weakly
acidulated with sulphuric acid, and the terminal wires of a voltaic
battery immersed in the upper liquid ; no visible movements occurred
at the boundary line of the two liquids.
   "2nd. A dense solution of cyanide of potassium was placed in a small
glass beaker, a few particles of charcoal sifted upon its surface, and a
layer of aqueous ammonia, half an inch deep, carefully poured upon it.
A vertical diaphragm of thin sheet gutta-percha was then fixed so
as completely to divide the upper liquid into two equal parts ; the
vessel was placed in a strong light, and two horizontal platinum wire
electrodes, from sixty-six freshly charged Smee's cells, were immersed
one-eighth of an inch deep in the liquid ammonia on each side of the
diaphragm.     A copious current of electricity circulated, but no move
ment of the liquids at their mutual boundary line could be detected."
(See "Proc. Roy. Soc," vol. x, 1860, p. 235, par. 9.)
   Recently, also,  I  have made similar experiments, but in a much
more searching manner, in order to ascertain whether an electric
current, passing between two aqueous liquids, affects their diffusion
into each other. The essential difference in the form of these experi
ments from that of the above-mentioned ones was to concentrate the
action of the current upon a very much smaller surface of contact of
the liquids, and thus render any visible effect upon their diffusion
more manifest.

  1880.]       Dr. Ramsay.      On the  Critical State of Gases.          323
     After making several forms of apparatus, in order to obviate certain
 difficulties of manipulation which arose and were fatal to success,
 I   found that, when an electric current was passed between the
 surfaces of mutual contact of certain aqueous solutions of different
 specific gravities, the boundary line of contact of the two liquids
 became indefinite at tbe surface where the current passed from the
 lighter into the heavier solution, and became sharply defined where
 the current left the heavier liquid and re-entered the lighter one ; and
 that on reversing the direction of the current several times in succes
 sion after suitable intervals of time, these effects were reversed with
 each such change.       Also, in various cases in which the contiguous
 boundary layers of the two liquids had become mixed, the liquids sepa
 rated, and the line of separation of the two solutions became, by the
 influence of the electric current, as perfect as that between strata of
 oil and water lying upon each other. In rarer cases two such distinct
 lines of stratification appeared.      Other new phenomena were also
observed.
     As  I  have sought,   without success, for any record of previous
 discovery of essentially similar effects, and as it is evident that those I
have observed belong to a large class of similar phenomena, I beg
leave to take the earliest opportunity of submitting this brief state
ment to the Royal Society.

        February 26, 1880.
    In  a paper read before the Chemical Society, in May, 1879,        I gave
an account of a method of determining what is termed by Kopp the
" specific volumes " of liquids ; that was shown to be the volume of
liquid at its boiling-point, at ordinary atmospheric pressure, obtainable
from 22,326 volumes of its         gas, supposed to exist at 0°.       Being
desirous    of extending  these  researches,  with the  view of  ascertaining
                                                                I
such relations at higher temperatures, since April, 1879, have made
numerous experiments, the results of, and deductions from which               I
hope to publish before long. The temperatures observed vary from the
boiling-points of the liquids examined, to about 50° above their critical
points ; and in course of these experiments           I  havo noticed some
curions facts, which may not be unworthy of the attention of the
Society.
    It is well known that at temperatures above that which produces
                                          "
what is termed by Dr. Andrews the critical point" of a liquid, the

 substance is supposed to exist in a peculiar condition, and Dr.
Andrews purposely abstained from speculating on the nature of the
 matter, whether it be liquid or gaseous, or in an intermediate condi
tion, to which no name has been given. As my observations bear
directly on this point, it may be advisable first to describe the experi
ments I have made, and then to draw the deductions which appear to
follow from them.
   A piece of barometer tubing, about 3 inches long, was sealed at one
end and drawn into a capillary tube at the other ; after being filled
with methyl formate, it was exhausted, and after two-thirds of the
ether had evaporated, was sealed.         By this means all air was removed
from the tube, which contained merely the ether and its vapour. This
tube was placed in a hole, drilled in a large block of copper.                The
accompanying     wood-cut    shows  its  cross section.   The  block was   placed

in an inclined position,   so as to slope the barometer tube to an       angle of
about 30°.
   1. On applying heat the temperature of the copper gradually rose to
2210,5
        (corr.) ; during the rise the meniscus of the liquid gradually
became    less curved, and at the above-mentioned             temperature dis
appeared.     On cooling to 218° a mist was seen at the point where the
meniscus had disappeared, and the meniscus shortly afterwards became
again visible.
   2. Two similar tubes were prepared, one containing less and the
other more of the same ether; the point at which the meniscus dis
appeared in the former was 228°, and in the latter 215°.
   3. A piece of barometer tubing was bent into the shape —
and heated. At 250° the liquid had so expanded as to fill the whole
tube, although the temperature of the portion outside the heater could
not have much exceeded 100°, for it could be freely handled.                  The
liquid appeared in violent motion, and on cooling, before a meniscus
was observed, the lower portion of the tube became filled with mist.

1880.]       Dr. Ramsay.      On the  Critical State of Gases.          325
As soon as a meniscus was visible, the liquid boiled     so violently as to
give the appearance of a denser mist.
   4. A  tube of the shape shown was filled to the mark with methyl
formate and heated in an inclined position, the portion containing the
liquid being the lower.     The liquid, as usual, expanded, and at the
moment when the meniscus disappeared it nearly filled the lower half.
The Bunsen's burner below the copper heater was then withdrawn, and
on cooling, the liquid all condensed in the lower half.
   5. The last experiment was varied by tilting the heater after the
meniscus of the liquid had disappeared, so that that half which had
contained the liquid was uppermost. On cooling, the liquid condensed
in the upper half of the tube.
   G. The experiment was again varied by keeping the tube at a tem
perature a few degrees above the point where the meniscus vanished,
for half an hour. On cooling, an almost equal quantity had condensed
in each division of the tube. (During Experiments 4, 5, and 6 great
care must be taken to keep the heater from draughts of cold air,
otherwise unequal cooling results and distillation takes place.)
   7. It was noticed that that half of the tube containing liquid,
after the meniscus had vanished, appeared full, while the other
half of the tube seemed to be empty.        The refractive indices of the
fluid contained in the tubes were therefore different.            The por
tion of  the tube  containing liquid  was  shown   to be  a more powerful
cylindrical lens than the empty portion, for on focussing a spot behind
the tube with a microscope, the focus was shorter when the portion
which had contained liquid was placed between the microscope and
the spot than when the portion appearing empty was interposed.
   8. From experiments on the expansion of liquids above their boiling-
points, of which numerical details shall be given on a future occasion,
it appears probable that the specific gravity of the hot liquid, at the
temperature at which the meniscus vanishes, is identical with that of
the compressed gas evolved from the liquid. This has also been
noticed by Ansdell in two cases, viz., hydrogen chloride and acetylene.
   9. I am inclined to believe, from observations on the expansions of
liquids at high temperatures, although they were not expressly directed
to elucidate this point, that liquids above the temperatures at which
their menisci vanish are not uniformly compressible.        But as further
experiments    are necessary, I mention  this  opinion  with  some hesita
tion.
   From these observations    I would draw the following     inferences  : —

32 ii     Dr. Ramsay.       On   the   Critical State of Gases.   [Apr. 22,
When    a liquid is heated under pressure it expands, and at the same
time evolves vapour.     The vapour gains in specific gravity, while the
specific gravity of the liquid is rapidly diminishing.    The critical poird
is that point at which the liquid, owing to expansion., and the gas, owing
to compression, acquire the same specific gravity, and consequently mix
with one another. From the first experiment it is seen that, on cooling,
the liquid contracts more rapidly than the gas, and consequently
separates as a mist through the whole of the tube, and, from its
gravity, separates at the lower half. The second experiment shows
that when the tube contains a small amount of liquid the space left
for gas is larger, and consequently more vapour must be given off by
the liquid before enough gas can be compressed till it acquires the
same specific gravity as the liquid; the temperature at which the
meniscus disappears is consequently higher.       If the space left for gas
be smaller, the opposite is the case.    From the third experiment it is
seen that it is possible to raise the critical point of a liquid, provided a
portion be continuously cooled. Probably the average temperature cf
the two portions of the tube is about 220°. The fourth, fifth, sixth,
and seventh experiments demonstrate that by suitable means it is
possible to prevent, or rather to retard, the mixing of gas and liquid.
They then retain their several refractive indices.         If, however, time
be  allowed  for diffusion through  the capillary tube,  the  whole becomes
homogeneous, and the refractive indices of the fluids contained in
either portion of the tube are then identical.
                                              I
   I shall not refer to Experiment 8 until have made a more thorough
investigation of the subject ;   I venture to state, however, that it looks
probable that as long as gas is being compressed, pressure rises
gradually with decrease of volume, whereas, even above their critical
points, liquids are comparatively incompressible.         I am inclined to
think that carbonic anhydride, examined by Dr. Andrews, is abnormal
in this respect, but of this I am by no means certain.
   In conclusion, let me refer to a paper communicated to the Society
                                                              " On the Solu
by Messrs. Hannay and Hogarth last October, entitled
bility of Solids in Gases." Should the views of the subject suggested
by the above experiments be correct, it follows that these gentlemen
have observed nothing unusual, but merely the ordinary phenomenon
of solubility of a solid in a hot liquid. This view is borne out by
their own experiments.    They found that on reducing pressure, that
is,on allowing the liqnid to change to gas, the solid precipitated and
                                                                     ;
also on heating the tube containing the solution locally, that is, by
converting the liquid near the heated point into gas, precipitation
took place. I  have taken the liberty of repeating one of their ex
periments with  aslight modification.
  A tube shaped like that used in Experiment      after a small frag

ment of potassium iodide had been placed in the lower compartment,

1880.]     Dr. Ramsay.            On Hie   Critical State of Gases.      327
was filled with nearly anhydrous alcobol : and after rather more than
two-thirds of the alcohol had been evaporated under reduced pressure,
the tube was sealed. The lower portion of the tube contained a strong
alcoholic solution of potassium iodide, besides a small piece of undis
solved salt.    The upper portion of the tube was free from alcohol,
but its walls were encrusted with a thin crystalline film of potassium
iodide.   The tube was heated in a sloping position, the liquid being
in the lower half. After the meniscus had disappeared, the iodide in
the lower half of the tube dissolved, while the film in the upper half,
even in its thinnest portions, remained unchanged.     On cooling, very
sparkling crystals deposited in the lower half of the tube, but no
glittering crystals in the upper half.
   By repeated distillation the iodide in the upper portion of the tube
was washed down into the lower half, and when dry the sides of the
upper tube were quite bright and clean. The tube was again heated
in the same position to 20° above the temperature at which the
meniscus had disappeared.       On cooling the sparkling crystals again
appeared   in  the  lower tube, but not a trace in the npper tube. To
eliminate all possibility of mistake the experiment was repeated five
times with the same result, and finally the alcohol was distilled into
the upper tube ; it was then broken off, and its contents carefully
tested for iodine with sodium hypochlorite and starch-paste.      There
was not the faintest blue colour, and it is therefore certain that
potassium iodide is absolutely insoluble in alcohol vapour.
   It would be interesting to speculate on the condition of a fluid, of
which two portions possess the same specific gravity, but refract light
differently. Such speculations would, however, be premature in our
present knowledge of the subject.
   In conclusion,   I  may remark, that Messrs. Hannay and Hogarth
found that the absorption spectrum of coloured salts remains un
altered, even when the liquid in which they are dissolved loses its
meniscus.     Surely no clearer proof is needed to show that the solids
are not present as gases, but are simply solutions in a liquid medium.
                    (Received March 20, 1880.)
  Since the foregoing was written, Professor Stokes has been so kind
as to suggest in a letter to. Dr. Mills, some possible causes of error,
which may be briefly catalogued as follows : —
  1 . The tubes may have contained air.
  That this cannot       have    been   the case   is,
                                                    I  think, ensured by the
method   by which       they    were filled.   The tube was completely filled
with liquid, and the liquid made to evaporate out under a vacuum of
25 inches till its volume had become reduced to the required amount.
While the reduced pressure         was sustained, the tube was sealed at the

328          Dr. Ramsay.         On the   Critical State of Gases.     [Apr. 22.
base    of its capillary neck.         It is improbable that the liquids ex
perimented      on  dissolve  air,   for  when heated, no air-babbles can be
seen to escape.
    2.  The liquids may not have been quite pure ; they may not have
been absolutely free from water.
    The methyl formate used in the experiments presents no special
advantage but that of its meniscus disappearing at a comparatively
low temperature.        It was procured from Kahlbaum, and previous to
use    had   been  distilled over metallic sodium.       Its boiling-point was
absolutely constant.       Still, as treatment with sodium might have led
to the formation of some other compound of nearly the same boiling-
point, it was redistilled, in accordance with a suggestion of Professor
Stokes, and the first and last portions of the distillate were selected
for experiment.       Two tubes were filled to as nearly the same height
as could be judged by eye, one with the first portion of the distillate
and one with the last.           Both were heated at the same time in the
 copper heater, and were exactly similarly placed with regard to the
 thermometer.       The temperature of the heater having been raised till
 the meniscus had disappeared in both tubes, the source of heat was
 removed and the heater was allowed to cool.               The tube containing
 the first fraction gave the first symptoms of a cloud, or mist, at
 218-4 (corr.), and that containing the last fraction at 218"1 (corr.).
 The very slight difference is doubtless owing to the two tubes not
 containing exactly the same amount of liquid.
     To eliminate any source of error dependent on the use of methyl
 formate, two other substances were employed, viz., carbon disulphide,
  CS2, and carbon tetrachloride, CCl.t.          The former of these liquids was
 rectified five times over sodium, and then boiled at 487 (corr.).           The
 latter was rectified four times over phosphoric anhydride, and boiled
 constantly at 77'5 (corr.).
     They yielded the following results : —
                                     Tube more                 Tube less
                                   than half full.           than half full.

     These readings are given for the first appearance of a cloud in the
  tube on cooling, and differ from the temperature at which the meniscus
  disappears by being about half a degree lower.              They also do not
  represent extreme instances, for in the first cases the liquids do not
  entirely fill the tube, and in the second about half an inch of liquids
  remains in the tubes before it becomes impossible to distinguish liquid
  from gas.
     3.  Owing to too rapid rise of temperature, the tubes and the heater
  may    not  have been at the same temperature.

of four or five. The copper block, after being raised to the tempera
ture at which the meniscus of the liquid disappeared, was allowed to
cool till a cloud became visible, shortly afterwards followed by a
reappearance of the meniscus. The temperature was again raised, and
so on, readings being taken each time.      They never differed by more
than half a degree.     The tubes, therefore, must have possessed the
temperature of the heater.
   The experiments described in a former part of this paper, relating to
the difference of refraction shown by a liquid above its so-called critical
point, and the gas evolved from       it,
                                      were repeated with carbon tetra
chloride and carbon disulphide, and held good in both cases.           The
phenomena observed differed in no particular from those already
described.
  In   conclusion  few remarks on the liquefaction of the so-called per
                    a
manent  gases may not be deemed out of place. If the deductions from
the above experiments be correct,     follows that that form of matter
                                       it
which we call gas may be converted into liquid by pressure alone but the    ;
meniscus   will never become visible, for the process of change a gradual
                                                                       is
one.    To render the meniscus visible,      itnecessary to take advantage
                                                  is
of the fact  that liquids under such circumstances have       much greater
                                                                  a
coefficient of expansion by heat, and conversely a much greater coefficient
of contraction on withdrawal of heat, than gases. It, therefore, becomes
necessary to lower the temperature until the liquid by contraction
acquires a specific gravity greater than that of its gas, and then, and
not till then, does the phenomenon of a meniscus become observable.

weight, which occupied a large part of his leisure time during the
last three years. In this investigation he spared no pains to attain
as precise a result as possible, and aimed especially at the discovery,
and as far as possible removal, of sources of error connected with
the methods employed.           The following general principles were kept
in view : —
   1st. That each process should be as simple as possible, and should
involve  as little as possible of known liability to   error.
   2nd. That different and independent processes       should be resorted to
as the means of checking each other's results,          even though   it may
fairly be assumed that one is more advantageous        than another.
   3rd. That each process should          be carried out with quantities of
material   differing     considerably   from each other in successive ex
periments.
   4th. That only such other atomic weights Bhould be involved as
may be counted among those already known with the nearest approach
to accnracy.
   The must scrupulous care was taken in the purification and exami
nation of all the reagents used, and, as far as possible, vessels of
platinum or of hard porcelain were substituted for those of glass.
   In the author's first series of experiments, the alumina was de
termined which resulted from the ignition of a known weight of
ammonium alum.
   In the second series, a solution        was made of a known weight      of
bromide of aluminium, and was very exactly precipitated by a solution
of nitrate of silver, and the weight of bromide of aluminium com
pared with that       of the silver required    for forming   the solution of
nitrate.
   In the third    series, bromide of aluminium was used for the prepara
tion  of pure   alumininm,     by reduction by sodinm ; a carefully weighed
portion of the pure aluminium was dissolved in a solution of caustic
soda, and the hydrogen         given off was estimated by volume ; or else
burnt, and the weight of resulting water determined.
   In the following epitome of the results, A, B, C denote groups of
experiments under each series, the experiments of each group differing
only in the      quantity of material operated on, while the different
groups differ   in  the particular preparation used, or in some feature of
the method.       Thus in Series I, A was made with alum dried by
exposure to air for two hours ; B with alum dried by exposure for
twenty-four hours. In Series II, A, B, C were made with successive
portions of a distillate of bromide of aluminium. In Series III, A was
made by estimating the hydrogen by volume, B by estimating by
weight the water resulting from its combustion.          Only the number of
experiments in each group, the mean result from the group, and the
 probable error of the mean, are here given.

   In view   of the gradual loss of water which crystallised ammonium
alum has been shown to undergo on exposure to the air, the author
considers that of these various sets of experiments, Series I, B, is
entitled to least confidence. He is inclined to attach most weight to
Series III, A, since the method used was very simple in principle,
the determination of one of the two quantities concerned was rendered
very exact by the great volume occupied by the hydrogen, the com
parison was made directly with the standard element in our system of
atomic weights, and not through the intervention of any other sub
stance -whose atomic weight must be assumed, and the agreement
of the results among themselves is particularly good.
    The general mean from all the thirty experiments, if all be included,
is Al= 27-032, with a probable error for this mean of +-0045.                If
Series   I, B, be excluded, the mean of all the remaining twenty-five
experiments is Al=27'019, with a probable error of +'0030.
    The general result adds, the author hopes, aluminium to the, un
fortunately still limited, list of those elementary substances whose
atomic weights have been determined within the limits of precision
attainable with our present means of experiment.
    This result also adds one to the cases already on record of the
numbers representing carefully determined atomic weights approaching
closely to integers, and leads the author to say a word on the recon
sideration of " Prout's Law." Taking the following 18 elements as
the only ones of which the atomic weights may be fairly considered as
determined, with reference to hydrogen, with the greatest attainable
precision, or   a near approach thereto, namely oxygen, nitrogen,     chlorine,

I   V.    " On the Height of the Aurora Borealis." By Warren De
          La Rue, M.A., D.C.L., F.R.S., and Hugo W. Muller,
          Ph.D., F.R.S. Received April 22, 1880.
   Our experiments on the electric discharge, which have been already
published in the
                  " Phil. Trans." and the "
                                             Proceedings of the Royal
Society," enable us to state with some degree of probability the height
of the Aurora Borealis, when its display    of maximum brilliancy, and
                                                           is
also the height at which this phenomenon could not occur on account
of the great tenuity of the atmosphere.
   In Part         III
               of our electric researches, " Phil. Trans.," p. 159, vol. 171,
we have shown    that the least resistance to the discharge in hydrogen
isat a pressure of 0-6"42 rnillim., 845 M after this degree of exhaustion
                                                       ;
has been reached, a further reduction of pressure rapidly increases the
resistance.   When the exhaustion has reached 0"002 ruillim.,       M, the           3
discharge only just passes with       potential of 11,000 chloride of silver
                                              a
cells (11,330 volts)      the highest exhaust we have been able to
                               ;    at
obtain (and which     we believe has not been surpassed),      namely,
0-000055 millim., 0'066 M, not only did 11,000 cells fail to produce                            a
discharge,         but even a 1-inch         spark from an induction coil could not
do so.
   Although we have not experimentally determined the pressure of
least resistance for air, we have ascertained that while the discharge
occurs in hydrogen at atmospheric pressure between di.sks      22 inch           0
distant, they require to be approached to 0-13 inch to allow the dis
charge to take place in air.       We may therefore assume that the
pressure of least resistance for air              is
                                            0-379 millim., 498      6   M.
                                   22
     At   a   height of 37'67 miles above the          sea level, the atmosphere           would

 1880.]            On the Height   of the Aurora Borealis.               333
have this pressure (neglecting change of temperature), and therefore
the display at this elevation would he of maximum             brilliancy and
would be visible at a distance of 585 miles.
    The greatest exhaust that we have produced, 0'000055 millim.,
O066 M, corresponds to a height of 81"47 miles, and as 11,000 cells
failed to produce a discharge in hydrogen at this low pressure, it may
 be assumed that at this height the discharge would be considerably less
 brilliant, especially in air, than that at 37'67 miles, the height of maxi
 mum brilliancy.
    At a height of 124T5 miles the pressure would be only 0"00000001
 millim., O'OOOOl M, and it is scarcely probable that an electric dis
 charge would occur with any potential conceivable at such a height.
    The colour of the discharge varies greatly with the tenuity of air or
other gas with the same potential. Thus in air at a pressure of 62
millim., 81579 M, the discharge has the carmine tint which is so fre
quently observed in the display of the Aurora ; this corresponds to an
altitude 12-4 miles, and would be visible at a distance 336 miles.        At
a pressure of T5 millims., 1974 M, corresponding to a height of 30'86
miles, the discharge becomes salmon coloured, having completely lo3t
the carmine tint. At a pressure of 0'8 millim., corresponding to
33-96 miles, the tint of the discharge is of a paler salmon colour, and
as the exhaust is carried further it becomes a pale milky white. The
roseate and salmon coloured tints are always in the vicinity of the
                                                              2 a 2

   The following Papers were read : —
        I. " Note     on the Spectrum of Carbon."            By   J. Norman
                Lockyer, F.R.S.          Received April 8, 1880.
    In the    year 1878 *   I  communicated to the Royal Society a paper in
which the conclusion was drawn that the vapour of carbon was present
in the solar atmosphere.
   This conclusion was founded upon the reversal in the solar spectrum
of a set of flutings in the ultra-violet.f            The conclusion that these
flutings were due to the vapour of carbon, and not to any compound of
carbon, was founded upon experiments similar to those employed in the
researches of Attfield and Watts, who showed that the other almost
exactly similar sets of flutings in the visible part of the spectrum
were seen when several different compounds of carbon were exposed
to the action of heat and electricity.            In my photographs the ultra
violet flutings appeared under conditions in which carbon was the only
constant, and      it seemed therefore reasonable to assume that the flutings
were due to carbon itself, and not to any compound of carbon.
    Professors Liveing and Dewar have recently on several occasions
called this result in question. Professor Dewar, in a paper received by
the Royal Society on January 8, 138,0, writes as follows : — ¦
    " The almost impossible problem of eliminating hydrogen from
masses of carbon, such as can be employed in experiments of this
kind, prove conclusively that the inference drawn by Mr. Lockyer as
to the elementary character of the so-called carbon spectrum from an
examination of the arc in dry chlorine, cannot be regarded as satis
factory, seeing tJuit undoubtedly hydrogen was present in the carbon^ used
as the poles."
    Subsequently,       in a paper received by the Royal Society on
February 2, Messrs. Liveing and Dewar wrote as follows : —
   •  "  Proc. Roy. Soc.," vol. 27, p. 308.

336                          Mr.    J. N. Lockyer.                     [Apr. 2!»r
    " Mr. Lockyer
                      (' Proc. Roy. Soc.,' vol.       27, p. 308) has recently*
obtained a photograph of the arc in chlorine, which shows the series of
fluted bands in the ultra-violet, on the strength of which he throws
over the conclusion of Angstrom and Thalen, and draws inferences as
to the existence of carbon vapour above the chromosphere                  in the
coronal atmosphere of the sun, which, if true, would be contrary to all
we know of the properties of carbon.             We cannot help thinking that
these bands were due to the presence      of a small quantity of nitrogen."  f
    It will be seen that on January 8 Mr. Dewar alone attributed the
flutings to hydrocarbon, while on February 2 Mr. Dewar, associated
with Mr. Liveing, attributed them to a nitrocarbon.
    In the latter paper Messrs. Liveing and Dewar published some expe
riments on the spectra of various carbon compounds, and from their
observations they have drawn the conclusion that the set of flutings
which I have shown to be reversed in the solar spectrum is really due
to cyanogen, and that certain other sets of flutings shown by Attfield
and Watts to be due to carbon are really due to hydrocarbon.
    As Messrs. Liveing and Dewar do not controvert the very definite
conclusions arrived at by Attfield, Morren, Watts, and others, I can
only presume that they have taken for granted that the experimental
work performed by these men was tainted by the presence of impuri
ties, and that it was impossible to avoid them.                I have therefore
thought it desirable to go over the ground again, modifying the expe
rimental method so as to demonstrate the absence of impurities.
 Indeed, I have started upon a somewhat lengthy research, and have
taken a large number of photographs under various conditions, so that
to reduce them all will be a work of time.              I beg permission, there
fore, in the meantime, to submit to the notice of the Society an experi
ment with a tube containing CC14, which, I think, establishes the
conclusions arrived at by prior investigators.            And I may add that it
is the    more   important  to settle   the  question,   as Messrs. Liveing and
 Dewar have already based upon their conclusions theoretical views of
 a kind which appear to me calculated to mislead, and which I consider
 to have long been shown to be erroneous.
     As my results, to which I now draw attention, simply endorse former
 work, it is important to state that former work somewhat at length
 and in the words of the authors.
     The prior work of Attfield (in 1862) will be gathered from the
 following extract from his paper (" Phil. Trans.," vol. 152, p. 221
 et  seq.): —
     " On recently reading Swan's paper by the light that Professors
 Bunsen and Kircbhoff       have thrown on the subject, I came to the con
 clusion    that these bands must be due to incandescent carbon vapour ;

 that, if so, they must bo absent from flames in which carbon is absent,
 and present in flames in which carbon is present ; that they must be
observable equally in the flames of the oxide, sulphide, and nitride as
in that of the hydride of carbon ; and, finally, that they must be
 present whether the incandescence be produced by the chemical force,
 as in burning jets of the gases in the open air, or by the electric force,
 as when hermetically sealed tubes of the gases are exposed to the dis
charge of a powerful induction coil. . . .
    " To establish the absolute identity of the hydro- and nitro-carbon
 spectra,   excluding  of course the lines due to nitrogen, they were
simultaneously brought into the field of the spectroscope : one occupy
 ing the upper, and the other the lower half of the field.
    " This was readily effected after fixing the small
                                                         prism, usually sup
plied with spectroscopes, over half of the narrow slit at the further
 end of the object-tube of the instrument.            The light from the
oxyhydrocarbon flame was       now   directed up the axis of the tube by
reflection from the little prism, while that from the oxynitrocarbon
flame passed directly through the uncovered half of the slit.       A glance
through the eye-tube was sufficient to show that the characteristic
lines of the hydrocarbon spectrum were perfectly continued in the
nitrocarbon spectrum.       A similar arrangement of apparatus, in which
the hydrocarbon light was replaced by that of pure nitrogen, showed
that the remaining lines of the nitrocarbon spectrum were identical
with those of the nitrogen spectrum. In this last experiment the
source of the pure nitrogen light was the electric discharge through
the rarefied gas.
    " The above experiment certainly seemed to go far towards proving
the spectrum in question to be that of the element carbon. Never
theless, the ignition of the gases having been effected in air, it was
conceivable that hydrogen, nitrogen, or oxygen had influenced the
phenomena.       To eliminate this possible source of error, the experiments
were repeated out of contact with air.        A thin glass tube 1 inch in
diameter and 3 inches long, with platinum wires fused into its sides,
and its ends prolonged by glass quills having a capillary bore, was
filled with pure dry cyanogen, and the greater portion of this gas then
removed by a good air-pump.         Another tube was similarly prepared
with olefiant gas.      The platinum wires in these tubes were then so
connected with each other that the electric discharge from a power
ful induction-coil could pass through both at the same time. On now
observing the spectra of these two lights in the simultaneous manner
previously described, the characteristic lines of the hydrocarbon
spectrum were found to be rigidly continued in that of the nitro
carbon.     Moreover, by the same method of simultaneous observation,
the spectrum of each of these electric flames, as they may be termed,
was compared with the corresponding chemical flames, that is, with

 338                             Mr,  J. N. Lockyer.                      [Apr. 29,
 the oxyhydrocarbon         and oxynitrocarbon jets of gas burning in air.
 The characteristic lines were present in every case. Lastly, by similar
 inter-observation       a few other lines in the electric spectrum of the
 hydrocarbon were proved to be due to the presence of hydrogen, and
several others in the electric spectrum of the nitrocarbon to be caused
by the presence of nitrogen
     " The spectrum under investigation having then been obtained in
one case when only carbon and hydrogen were present, and in another
when all elements but carbon and nitrogen were absent, furnishes, to
my mind, sufficient evidence that the spectrum is that of carbon.
    " But an interesting confirmation of the conclusion just stated is
found in the fact that the same spectrum is obtained when no other
elements but carbon and oxygen are present, and also when carbon
and sulphur are the only elements under examination.                And first with
regard    to  carbon    and   oxygen.    Carbonic  oxide   burned in air gives a
flame possessing a continuous spectrum.             A mixture of carbonic oxide
and oxygen burned from a platinum-tipped safety-jet also gives a more
or less continuous spectrum, but the light of the spectrum has a
tendency to group itself in ill-defined ridges.         Carbonic oxide, however,
ignited by the electric discharge        in a semi-vacuous tube, gives a bright
sharp spectrum.           This spectrum was proved, by the simultaneous
method of observation, to be that of carbon plus the spectrum of
oxygen.      With regard to carbon and sulphur almost the same remarks
may    be  made.     Bisulphide of carbon vapour burns in air with a bluish
flame. Its spectrum is continuous.             Mixed with oxygen and burned
at the safety-jet, its flame still gives a continuous spectrum, though
more distinctly furrowed than in the case of carbonic oxide ; but when
ignited by the electric current its spectrum is well defined, and is
that of carbon plus the sulphur. That is to say, it is the spectrum of
carbon plus the spectrum that is obtained from vapour of sulphur
when ignited by the electric discharge in an otherwise vacuous tube.
    " Having thus demonstrated that dissimilar compounds containing
carbon emit, when sufficiently ignited, similar rays of light, I come to
the conclusion that those rays are characteristic of ignited carbon
vapour, and that the phenomenon they give rise to on being refracted
by a prism is the spectrum of carbon."
   Tho only reference to this admirable work, in which vacuum tubes
and the electric discharge were largely employed, which               I can find in
Messrs. Dewar and Liveing's paper is the following :           —  " The spectrum
of hydrocarbon burning in air* has been . . . described                   ....   by

courants, en faisant arriver au centre de la flamme du cyanogène un
courant d'oxygène très-pur (cette condition est indispensable) on voit
se produre un des plus beaux effets de combustion possible, et cette
expérience    est certainement     une des plus magnifiques qu'on puisse
réaliser sur la combustion       des  gaz. Il se produit, an milieu de la
flamme rosé-violâtre du cyanogène, une boule d'un blanc vert éboulis-
sant qui rappelle la lumière électrique produite par le courant de la
pile entre deux charbons de cornue.         Si le spectroscope est dirigé sur
cette brillante lumière, on aperçoit, avec une splendeur merveilleuse,
 le même spectre de la partie bleue des flammes hydrocarburées.            Ainsi
donc c'est du charbon seul, mais à l'état de vapeur, qui forme cette
boule brillante qui plus loin, par son union avec l'oxygène, va passer a
l'état d'acid carbonique.     Du reste ce spectre n'est pas seul ; avec lui
on voit, mais très-effacé, le spectre spécial du cyanogène, et celui-ci
tend de plus en plus à disparaître à mesure que l'oxygène arrive
avec plus d'abondance et brûle de mieux en mieux le cyanogène.
Quant au spectre de l'azote, on ne l'aperçoit pas dans cette vive
lumière.     Le magnifique éclat de ce beau spectre, le plus beau qu'il
m'ait   été donné de voir, permet de bien comprendre         l'aspect creusé et
ombré avec une teinte croissante qu'on remarque dans les parties qui
n'ont pas de raies brillantes, et même entre ces raies."
    Four years later Dr. Watts took up the question, and in 1869 his
work was thus summarised by himself : * —
    " This spectrum
                      (that consisting of the flutings in question) may
be obtained from the flame of any hydrocarbon, though in many cases,
owing to the faintness of the spectrum, only some of the groups can
be recognised.     In the flame of an ordinary Bunsen burner <5and e

detected.
    " This spectrum is proved to be that of carbon, inasmuch as it can
be obtained alike from compounds of carbon with hydrogen, with
nitrogen, with oxygen, with sulphur, and with chlorine.         I have obtained
it, namely, from each       of  the  following compounds       : — Olefiant gas,
cyanogen, carbonic oxide, naphthalin, carbonic disulphide, carbonic
tetrachloride, amy lie alcohol, and marsh-gas."

   I now come to my own experiments.
   The tube to which I have already referred is shown in the diagram :
a and B are platinum wires for passing the spark inside the tube ; e is
a small tube into which carbon tetrachloride was introduced ; it was
drawn out to a long narrow orifice to prevent the rapid evaporation of
the liquid during the exhaustion of the tube.        The tube was bent
upwards and a bulb blown nt c in order that tbe spark might be
                 TO coil '{                             TO SPRiHSCL
examined   with the tube end-on,  as it is found that after the spark has
passed for some time a deposit is formed on the sides of the bulb
immediately surrounding the platinums, thus obstructing the light.
After a vacuum had been obtained the tube was allowed to remain on
the Sprengel for a long time, in order that the last traces of air might
be expelled by the slow evaporation   of the liquid.
   The carbon tetrachloride was prepared by Dr. Hodgkinson, whe
very kindly supplied me with sufficient for my experiments.
   On passing the spark without the jar in this tube, the spectrum
observed consists of those sets of flutings which, according to Messrs.

1880.]               Note on   the Spectrum     of  Carbon.               341
Liveing and Dewar, are due to hydrocarbon, and the set of flutings
which is reversed in the sun, and ascribed by Messrs. Liveing and
Dewar to cyanogen, also appear in a photograph of the violet end of
the spectrum.      On connecting a Leyden jar with the coil and then
passing the spark the flutings almost entirely vanish and the line
spectra of chlorine and carbon take the place of the flutings without
cither a line of hydrogen or a line of nitrogen being visible.
   As a long experience has taught me that these tubes often leak
slightly at the platinums after they are detached from the pump, I
took the occasion afforded by a visit of Dr. Schuster to my laboratory
while the experiments were being made to get my observations con-
finned. He has been good enough to write me the following letter,
and to allow me to give it here :
                                                                 " March 21.
   " My dear Lockyee,     — The following is an account of the experiment
which   I saw performed in your laboratory on Monday, March 15 : —
   "A tube containing carbon tetrachloride was attached to the
Sprengel pump. As exhaustion proceeded the air was gradually dis
placed by the vapour of the tetrachloride.          The electrodes were a few
millimetres apart.     If the spark was taken without a condenser in the
vapour the well-known carbon bands first discovered by Swan in the
spectrum of a candle were seen with great brilliancy ; I also saw the
blue band which yon said was identical in position with one of the
blue bands seen in the flame of cyanogen or in the spectrum of the
electric arc. When the condenser and air-break were introduced thin
spectrum gave way to a line spectrum in which            I could recognise the
lines of chlorine.    The lines of nitrogen were absent, not a trace of the
principal double, line in the green being scon. The hydrogen line ELx(C)
was faintly visible when       I first observed the spectrum, but it got
gradually weaker and finally disappeared altogether.            When this line
was no longer visible the condenser ivas taken out of circuit again, and
the same   carbon   bands  were   seen  as  before.   These bands, therefore,
show themselves with       great brilliancy when a strong and powerful
spark  does  not reveal the presence either of hydrogen or nitrogen.
                                        " (Signed) Arthur Schuster."
   This result, which entirely endorses the work of Attfield and Watte,
has been controlled by many other experiments.            I have also repeated
Morren's experiment and confirmed it, and I have also found that the
undoubted spectrum of cyanogen is visible neither in the electric arc
nor in the surrounding flame.
   I hope to show in the complete paper that the various difficulties
which have always been acknowledged to attend observations of this
substance may in all probability be due to the fact that the sets of
carbon flutings represent different molecular groupings of carbon, in

342                 Note on  tlie Spectrum   of  Carbon.         [Apr. 29,
addition to that or those which give us the line spectrum, and that the
tension of the current used now brings one set of flutings into promi
nence, and now another.
   I have so often taken occasion to refer with admiration to the work
                                 I
of Angstrom and Thalen that shall not be misunderstood when           I say
that their conclusions, to which such prominence         is given,  and  on
which such great stress is laid, by Messrs. Liveing and Dewar, rests
more upon a theory which has been shown to be false since the labours
commenced and analogy than upon experiment.
   Their work, undertaken at a time when the existence of so-called
" double spectra " was not established upon the firm basis that it has
now, and when there was no idea that the spectrum recorded for ns
the results of successive dissociations, gave the benefit of the doubt in
favour of flutings being due to compounds, and it was thought less
improbable that cyanogen or acetylene should have two spectra than
that carbon or hydrogen should possess them.
   These views were accepted by myself until years of work and ex
perience had shown them to be untenable, and later researches have
thrown doubt upon the view that the fluted spectra of aluminium and
magnesium are entirely due to the oxides of those metals instead of to
the metals themselves — and this is the very basis of the analogy which
Angstrom and Thalen employed.
               I
   From what have shown it will be clear that the consequences drawn
in the following paragraphs* by Messrs. Liveing and Dewar from the
assumed hydrogen-carbon bands are entirely invalid.
   " Tho similarity in the character of the magnesium-hydrogen
spectrum, which we have described, to the green bands of the hydro
carbons is very striking.    We have similar bright maxima of light,
succeeded by long drawn-out series of fine lines, decreasing in in
tensity towards the more refrangible side.       This peculiarity, common
to both, impels the belief that it is a consequence of a similarity of
constitution in the two cases, and that magnesium forms with hydro
gen a compound analogous to acetylene.         In this connexion the very
simple relation (2 : 1) between the atomic weights of magnesium and
carbon is worthy of note, as well as the power which magnesium has,
in common with carbon as it now appears, of combining directly with
nitrogen.   We may with some reason expect to find a magnesium-
nitrogen spectrum.
   " The interest attaching to tho                 of the constitution of
                                        question
comets, especially since the discovery by Huggins that the spectra of
various comets are all identical with the hydrocarbon spectrum,

which our experiments point.         Provided we admit that materials of the
comet contain ready formed           hydrocarbons,      and that oxidation may
take place, then the acetylene spectrum might be produced at com
paratively low temperatures without any trace of the cyanogen spec
trum or of metallic lines. If, on the other hand, we assume only the
presence of uncombined carbon and hydrogen, we know that the
acetylene spectrum can only be produced at a very high temperature,
and if nitrogen were also present that we should have the cyanogen
spectrum as well.       Either, then, the first supposition is the true one,
not disproving the presence of nitrogen, or else the atmosphere which
the comet meets is hydrogen only, and contains no nitrogen."

    Although a large share of attention has been given to the elucidation
of the causes which influence the amount of carbonic acid present in
 the atmosphere during the day, no systematic observations with
 referenceto the relative quantities present in the air of the land during
 the day and the night appear to have been undertaken since the well-
 known experiments of the younger De Saussure at Chambeisy,*
 upwards of 50 years ago (1820-30), and a similar set by Boussingault
                                                         J
at Paris.t a few years later, until M. Truchot took up the question in
 1873.     But the results thus obtained cannot            be said to be altogether
satisfactory.
    On the other hand, the question as to the existence of a diurnal
 variation in the amount of carbonic acid in sea-air may be said to have
 been fully worked out and set at rest by the careful and extensive set
of observations made some years ago by Dr. Thorpe§ on the air of the
Irish Sea and Atlantic Ocean. His results went to show that no
appreciable diurnal difference exists.
    As regards a diurnal variation in the case of land-air, the results of
De Saussure are somewhat contradictory ; and latterly, what he him
self considered as " one of the most remarkable results in the whole
                                                                     "
range of his inquiries — the discovery of a distinct diurnal variation in
the amount of carbonic acid — has been regarded as but very imper
fectly established.

from experiments extending over the previous four or five years, in
1828. Among these were nine day and an equal number of night
observations.        The latter showed an excess of 0-726 vol. of COj in
10,000   vols,  of air over those of the day, and it was upon this some
what limited basis that he was led to affirm the existence of a diurnal
variation.     His exact figures are, for the day, 5'037 vols., and for the
night, 5764 vols. C03 in 10,000 of air.
   In 1830 he published a further set of results, among which were
some experiments not made with the primary object of establishing
this variation, but for the purpose of finding the difference between
the amounts of carbonic acid in the air of a town (Geneva) and of
the open country.*           There were in all 13 such experiments extending
over parts of two years (1827-28), eight of which had reference to the
day and five to the night. Upon examining these a diametrically
opposite result to his former one is obtained.                  The mean of those
made in the country gives, for the day, 4"45 vols., and for the night,
4-02 vols. C02 in 10,000 of air ; thus showing an excess of 0-43 vol. in
favour of the day.
   The experimental evidence as to the existence of a diurnal variation
in the amount of atmospheric carbon dioxide was therefore incon
clusive, and     I  accordingly undertook, at Dr. Thorpe's suggestion and
with his collaboration, to carry out a series of observations with
direct reference to the question at Grasmere in Westmoreland,
during the summer and autumn of 1879.
   Up to this time the state of our knowledge concerning a diurnal
variation in the amount of atmospheric carbon dioxide may be said to
be comprised in the following statement.

 1880.]       in  the  Amount  of Carbon Dioxide in        the  Air.          345
    The method of estimation which I employed consisted in absorbing
the carbonic acid from a known volume of air by means of baryta
water of known strength, the amount of carbonic acid so absorbed
being determined by titrating the alkaline fluid with a standard acid
solution, 1 cnb. centim. of which was approximately eqnal to 1 mgrm. of
 C02.    This method is generally known as Pettenkofer's, but it is worth
noting that it had been used by Dalton as far back as 1802.*                 It is
particularly   well   adapted to  the   end  I   had  in  view,    for it is not
merely the most expeditious of the processes hitherto devised, but it
allows of the observations being made under strictly comparative
conditions.
    The observations to which this communication refers were made in
a garden at Grasmere sitnated at the foot of a hill some 1,300 feet or
 1,400 feet high, and which lies only a few feet above the level of the
adjacent lake, which is 208 feet above that of the sea.
    They were commenced on the 21st July and continued to the 25th
 October ; the whole summer and autumn being of an exceptionally
 wet and sunless character.     It was originally intended to pursue the
observations "de die in diem
                                 " until a sufficient number were
                                                                        obtained
 to furnish a trustworthy average for comparison ; but the "weather
 proved such as to render this, if not impracticable, at least undesir
able owing to the difficulty, especially at midnight, of filling the jars
 with air in the open without at the same time admitting a few drops of
 rain also, even although the greatest care was used in the operation.
    Whenever, therefore, any such danger, owing to the state of the
 weather seemed imminent, and that there was therefore a chance of
 the erroT so occasioned creeping into the experiments, the observation
 for the particular time was abandoned.        In some instances by slightly
 varying the times chosen for the observations (noon and midnight) it
 was found possible to include some that otherwise must, for the fore
going reason, have been omitted.        And, with but few exceptions, the
slight differences as to time observable in the accompanying tables are
to be attributed to this canse.
    The place chosen for collecting the air for examination was a nook
on the lawn upwards of 100 feet from the house and almost
entirely surrounded by trees, shrubs, and flowers ; the plants being
chiefly the following, namely : pine, yew, holly, laurel, hawthorn,
mountain    ash, rhododendron,    geranium, rose, phlox, and azalea.
    The air was taken at from four to five feet from the ground and
always, with one or two exceptions noted in the tables, at the same
place.    On two or three occasions it was taken near a conservatory,
by well lighting the interior of which it was possible to dispense with
the lamp otherwise employed when filling the jars at night; and thus

346           Prof. G. F. Armstrong.      Diurnal Variation     [Apr. 29,
it was possible to ascertain whether any errors were being introduced
thereby.
    The jars used for collecting the air were the ordinary spice jars of
the confectioners,   but of a somewhat unusually large size and with
mouths sufficiently wide to readily admit the hand for cleansing and
drying. The latter was effected by means of clean linen cloths specially
kept for the purpose.     The mouths of the jars were easily and tightly
closed with Jennings' tin and india-rubber capsules.
    The jars employed were four in number, and were distinguished as
A, B, C and D. Their available capacities were as follow : —
          A=14,260 cub. centims.         B=14,845 cub. centims.
           C=14,905 cub. centims.        D=13,385 cub. centims.
    The quantities of air experimented upon are thus very considerable ;
indeed the jars are by far the largest hitherto employed in similar in
vestigations since De Saussnre used a globe of 34 litres ; while they
are nearly double the capacity of those used by Dr. Thorpe in his
Atlantic and Irish Sea experiments.
    The increased quantity of air thus taken for examination should, it
will be seen, tend to enhance the value and accuracy of the results,
 since the possibility of detecting any differences that may exist in the
amounts of carbonic acid present in the air during the day and at
night is thereby greatly increased.
    The mode of 611ing the jars, the interiors of which were previously
carefully dried and polished, was partly by blowing the air into them
 with a large pair of ordinary kitchen bellows and partly by violently
 tossing them to and fro ; but a test experiment showed that the
 latter means was alone sufficient for the purpose.
    Baryta water, the strength of which was frequently tested, was used
 to absorb the carbonic acid, and 75 cub. centims. were introduced into
 each jar.    This quantity was chosen to allow of a duplicate titration
 of 25 cub. centims. in each experiment.
     After being filled with air and the baryta water added, the jars
 were well shaken and rolled on their sides so as to cover their internal
 surfaces with the baryta solution, and they were then allowed to stand
 not less than four hours.     Several test experiments showed that this
 time was sufficient to effect the maximum absorption of the carbonic
 acid so attainable.
     Two jars at least were filled at each observation, and wherever the
  results from one jar only are noted in the tables the omission is due to
 some accident either in the filling, or at a subsequent stage of the
  experiment.
     The exposure of the baryta water being completed, the contents of
 each jar were quickly decanted into a stoppered bottle and allowed to
  stand until the liquid was perfectly clear.  And this was found to be a

  point   of importance, inasmuch as the precision with which the
  titration point can be fixed is largely dependent upon there being no
  carbonate in suspension.
     The acid used in titration was a standard solution of sulphuric as
  used by Dalton, 1 cub. centim. of which was equal to 1 mgrm. of
  carbonic acid.     This was substituted for the oxalic acid as recommended
  by  Pettenkofer   owing to its greater stability.
     The point of neutrality was ascertained by means of a dilute alco
  holic solution of pure aurin ; a definitely measured quantity being em
  ployed in each titration.
     The results thus obtained and set forth in the following tables,
  fully establish the existence of a diurnal variation in the quantity of
  carbonic acid, the night average exceeding that of the day by 0-34
  cub. centim. in 10,000 of air; the quantities respectively being very
  nearly in the ratio of 90 to 100.          These figures are, as will be seen,
  based upon 53 day and 62 night experiments ; there being 27 com
  plete day and 29 complete night observations.
     The details of the experiments contained in the accompaying tables
  are arranged in the following order : —

    On looking over the day experiments, the averages, it will be seen,
are low as compared with those of the older experimenters, the final
average being only          2-96   vols, of carbonic acid in 10,000 vols, of air.
But it     is extremely       interesting to compare this result with those
obtained      by Schulze       at Rostock*    during the years 1868-71.      His
figures   are, as averages      : —

C02 as against 2-96 vols. C02 in 10,000 of air obtained in the present
instance ; a difference, that is, of only 0 04 vol. C0.2 in 10,000 of air.
This close correspondence            between the results is important on
account of the method of determination pursued being essentially the
same in each case, with the exception that Schulze employed jars of
only 4 litres capacity as compared with 14 litres in the present case.
   But what is chiefly interesting in this comparison arises from the
fact of these low averages obtained by Schulze having been attributed
to the contiguity of Rostock, where the experiments were made, to the
sea.    They approximated so closely to Dr. Thorpe's Atlantic results*
for the day, namely, 3'011 vols. C02 in 10,000 of air, that their
lowness was generally regarded as being duo to the influence of sea-
air, and this solution has been the more forcibly urged also owing to
the fact that,   in using a modern method of determination, an average
of 347 similar experiments made at Duhmef by Fittbogen and
 Hasselbarth, has been found to give as much as 3"34 vols. C03, and
17 other determinations            made by Henneberg at Wcend, near
 G6ttingen,J 3 2    vols.   C02   in 10,000 vols, of air, while Truchot has
 obtained considerably      higher figures still.
   A similar explanation might with equal plausibility be applied to
 the low results more recently obtained by Reiset§ in the open country
near Dieppe. For, although he employed the more perfectly absorbing
method of the aspirator and Woulfe's bottles, and for the remainder
followed Pettenkofer's plan of determination, yet, as a mean of 92
 experiments made between September, 1872, and August, 1873, his
average is only 2-942 vols. C02 in 10,000 of air. This result, it will be
 seen, agrees in a still more remarkable manner with that arrived at in the
 Grasrnere experiments, the difference between the two averages being
only 0'018 vol. C02 in 10,000 of air. But the sea-air explanation can
scarcely be so confidently relied upon in the latter instance as in some
of the others.     Rostock and the place at which the air was collected
near Dieppe, are both close to the sea, the one on the embouchure of the
Nebel, and the other not more than 5 miles from the coast. Grasrnere.

on the other hand, is     fully 20 miles distant from the sea along the
most direct line that can be drawn. From this, then -we may infer
that there may possibly be other causes which tend to reduce the
amount of carbonic acid present, supposing, that is, that the results in
question do materially differ from the normal state ; an assumption
which, as regards the open country, has not yet been clearly esta
blished.
    The most distinct climatological peculiarity of Grasmere may be
said to be its rainfall, which, during such a year as last when the
observations in question were made, might have risen to 120 or 130
inches, and it is situated, moreover, within 6 or 7 miles of a point on
the Sty-Head Pass which has the largest rainfall in the British Islet,
an average, that is, of 175, or in bad years such as last, of 200 inches
per annum, while the general average for Great Britain is under
30 inches.     A glance at the temperature columns in the tables will
 show how frequently the point of saturation was practically reached
 during the observations.
    It is hardly possible, however, that the diminished quantity of the
 carbonic acid is due to the solution of this gas in rain-water.     It is
 well known that the amount of any gas absorbed by water is a function
 of the pressure which it itself exerts ; and it may be readily shown
 that the actual pressure of the carbonic acid in the atmosphere is far
 too small to exert any sensible influence upon its amount in the air.
 If this explanation, therefore, of a diminished quantity of carbonic
 acid is no longer available, may we not possibly turn to the operation
 of such an exceedingly active vegetation as is found in some parts of
 the English Lake District as a more feasible cause of any observed
 reduction in its amount ? For we are not without evidence, as some
 further experiments shortly to be described as well as those of
 M. Reiset, near Dieppe, appear to indicate, that this may after all be
 the chief disturbing agent.
    But to return to the point of chief importance in connexion with the
 experiments at Grasmere, the unquestionable evidence, that is, they
 afford of an appreciable diurnal variation in the amount of atmospheric
 carbonic acid.
    The only results with which, in reference to this point, it is worth
 while to compare them, are those of M. Truchot made at Clermont
 Ferrand, Auvergne, in 1873. With these, although they agree as to the
 main fact of the existence of a diurnal difference, they nevertheless
 disagree considerably as to its amount.
    M. Truchot, for instance, as shown by the table (ante, p. 344),
 has detected a diurnal variation in air taken in the neighbourhood
 of vegetation and in sunshine — in a position that is presumably
  identical with that in which the Grasmere observations were made —
  of as much as 2'34 vols. C02 in 10,000 of air, whilo in a position even

 354     Diurnal Variation of Carbon Dioxide in          the  Air.    [Apr. 29,
 unsurrounded    by vegetation the diurnal difference        is as high as 0"64
 vol. C03 in 10,000 of air. These results compared          with that obtained
 at Grasmere — a diurnal variation, namely, of 0'34         vol. C03 in 10,000
 of air — seem to point to some cause of variance           unconnected with
 either climate or local conditions.
    And now that the existence of a diurnal variation may be said to
 be fully established, the question as to upon what the difference
 observed depends still remains to be answered.            That in the main it
 is due to plant action seems more than probable.        And in order to lest
 the accepted theory that plants absorb carbonic acid during the day
and exhale it at night — to establish which must clearly be a first step
 in the evidence in proof of a connexion between vegetable activity and
a diurnal variation in the quantity of atmospheric carbon dioxide — a
short series of experiments, ten in all, was made at Grasmere con
currently with those an account of which has already been given.
    But before entering into a description of these it will be useful to
refer to the somewhat recent experiments of M. Reiset* already
mentioned, which were made in the neighbourhood of Dieppe in 1873,
inasmuch as they directly bear upon the point in question.                  He,
using Pettenkofer's   method  with   aspiration, found    that, in air taken  in
the daytime over a field of red clover in the mouth of June, there were
only 2'898 vols. COs in 10,000 of air present as compared with 2'915
vols, in air taken simultaneously in the open ; and that in the air over
a barley field in July, there were only 2-829 vols, as compared with
2"933 vols, in that of the open ; or a reduction in the air taken over
the crops, in one case of 0-017 vol. of carbonic acid, and in the other of
0"104 vol. in 10,000 of air as compared with that taken in the open.
 Nevertheless, in a leafy coppice he - obtained what at first sight
appeared to be somewhat contradictory results.             In this position the
air gave a larger quantity of carbonic acid than that simultaneously
taken in the open. That taken in the coppice was found to contain
2 997 vols, in 10,000 of air, while that of the open only yielded 2"902
vols, in the same quantity of air.       The explanation of this seeming
anomaly may possibly be found in the fact of a diminished quantity of
light existing within the coppice.
    For the purpose of the supplementary experiments to which refer
ence has been made, a fine and healthy young geranium plant was
selected, due regard being had to the extent of its leaf-surface.          This
was suspended day and night alternately in a jar of air sufficiently
large to contain it, the mouth being closed as already described by
one of Jennings' capsules.
    The times chosen for the experiments were from 7 a.m. to 7 p.m.
for the day, and from 7 p.m. to 7 a.m. for the night. When the plant

was removed from the jar, baryta water was introduced and well
shaken, and after standing a sufficient time to effect the absorption of
the carbonic acid was titrated in the usual manner.
     The results    obtained    were   highly interesting, but it would not
at present     be prudent to speak of them except in general     terms.    It
will suffice to say that the experiments showed that if the plant did
not actually absorb carbonic acid during the day, it exhaled none ;
while at night large quantities were so got rid of — thus fully sub
stantiating the generally accepted view of the matter in point.
   As a mean of seven night experiments made between 23rd August
and 29th September, there were 1218 vols. C03 in 10,000 of air
found in the jar. The largest quantity present was 14-9 vols., and the
least 9'13 vols, in 10,000 vols, of air. The former was at an early
period of the experiments, the latter towards their close when the
plant had lost a few of its leaves and was beginning to show a dimi
nished activity generally.
   Summarising the results contained in this communication,it may be
stated —
   (1.) That the normal amount of carbonic acid present in the air of
the land is distinctly less than that usually stated, and that it does
not exceed 3-5 vols, in 10,000 of air.
   (2.) That plants absorb carbonic acid during the day and exhale it at
night, and that vegetation, therefore, affects the quantity of carbonic
acid      present in the air, decreasing    it by day and increasing    it at
night.
   (3.) That from this cause there         is,
                                         during that part of the year
when vegetation       active, at least 10 per cent, more carbonic acid
                      is
present in the air of the open country at night than during the day.
 III.      " Measurement of the Actinism of the Sun's Rays and of
               Daylight." By Dr. R. Angus Smith, F.R.S.
                               (Preliminary Notice.)
   When examining the air of towns and the effect of smoke and fogs,
I have often wished for a very simple chemical method of measuring
the total light absorbed by these gases, vapours, and floating solids.    I
do not undervalue the work of others, but        Ithink I  have obtained a
process promising good    results with   great simplicity, althoughI  dare
say   itintroduces its own class of difficulties.
     1.The fundamental fact     that when iodide of potassinm in solution
                                 is
is treated with nitric acid, so small in quantity as to cause no change
of colour in dull diffused light,    change takes place when the same

356               Dr. R. A. Smith.         Measurement     of the       [Apr.  29,
mixture is brought into clear light ; iodine is set free and the solution
becomes yellow.
   2. The amount of iodine freed can be titrated with great exactness
by the use of hyposulphite, as is well known.
   In these two facts lies the whole process, the first is the new part,
the second makes the first quantitative, and its use is of course part
of the novelty.
   3. It is known that strong acid liberates iodine.             Weak acid does
so after a long time, but    the   process is hastened by light.
   4. Heat even to the boiling point does not act so well as light
(experiments being made in sealed tubes to prevent loss of iodine, and
with a considerable volume of air).
   5. Heat assists the action of light.
   6. A solution may be exposed day after day so as to give the
accumulated effect of sunlight, in a measurable condition at the end
of the time.
    7. The solution of iodide of potassium as hitherto obtained is subject
to change. An old solution, that is, one nearly a month old, was found
more sensitive than a new one in all cases tried.
   8. The result of No. 7 is, that a certain allowance may require to be
made for this, in those cases where the periods of observation with one
solution are long.
   9. The amount of allowance to be made for temperature                    is not
made out.      It is not certain that any is required in the cases when
weak acid is used. The weather has not allowed any combined action
of great light and heat, but with heat and light in the rays from an
electric light with a parabolic reflector, the action was very rapid.
   10. Specimens of experiments (prospective at first).              It was found
convenient to use a solution of 2 grms. of iodide of potassium, after
wards changed to 1 grm., in 100 of water, and to use half of this for
an experiment, i.e., 50 cub. centims. of the solution, which may be
called  A.
    A nitric acid solution having an acidity equal to 1 per cent, of
sulphuric anhydride was made ; this may be called B. Only very
small portions of    B were added to A.
   The following experiments were made in wide loosely corked and
half filled test tubes, and here are early trials : —

   It  was suspected that not only did the iodide solution change by
keeping, but the nitric acid also, weak as it was. Indeed                     I  had once
a mode projected of measuring light by the decomposition                          of nitric
acid or nitrates, but       I did     not expect this to take place in such weak
solutions.
   To avoid this change, sulphuric acid was tried with the following

photometric process, with special capacities to be developed in time.
I  may add that I did obtain better results at the window of my house
than at the laboratory at the same time, the latter being nearer the
centre of the town ; thus the process has done the duty it was in
tended for, although only once tried for this special purpose.               I  am
looking to it as an agent specially for the examination of climate, but
of course it may have many uses.               This process does not aim at
delicacy, but at accumulation          of effect. I have not spoken of a
standard ; the results are only comparative, but the process may be
made to supply its own standard.

     The temperature of the solutions exposed to light =13° C, kept in
 darkness =22° C. The iodine volatilized by heat was found to be so
 little that it might be neglected here.
     The strength of solutions and the kind of acid to be used may vary.
 Similar results may be got by using bromide of potassium, but it is less
 delicate.    The surface exposed and other questions require attention.

    This table shows the degree of credit attaching to the several groups
of observations, and proves (what         I did not anticipate) that the fatigue
produced by small weights         is  as definite as that produced by large
weights.
    The interpretation of these observations by means of the Law of
Fatigue is thus found.
    When the arm is extended horizontally, the muscles of the shoulder
joint keep it in position ; and, at the same time, the scapula and its
muscles and surroundings are raised by the reaction ; so that the arm
and scapula equilibrate     by means of equal and opposite couples acting
round the centre of the glenoid cavity.             If, therefore, to denote the
weight held in the       hand,  and   a  denote  the  weight, which, if held in
the hand, would represent the sum of the couples of the arm and
scapula and surroundings about the centre of the glenoid ; then it is
plain that the total work done by the muscles before fatigue stops
the experiment must be proportional to (w + a)t, where t is the whole
time of the experiment.        The rate of work is evidently proportional to
                                        W + {X
Therefore, by the Law of Fatigue we have

304          Elementary Principles in Animal Meclvanies.              [Apr. 29,
   It  appears to be highly probable that, in all cases, the most useful
work  will be done when the resistance to be overcome is eqnal to the
weight of the limb itself, estimated as applied at the same distance
from the centre of motion as the resistance or weight.
   I  attempted, in the following manner, to check the value found
for a, the equivalent of the arm and shoulder, estimated at the middle
of the hand.
   Dr. Macalister, closing his eyes, had his arm suspended to a balance
by a string looped round the middle of the hand, and the weight of
the suspended arm, allowed to hang " dead," was measured by weights
placed in the opposite scale.
   After many trials, I found the weight to be 5 lbs. with a possible
error of 2 ozs., or + 0'125 either way.
   To find the effect of the shoulder, 1 measured the horizontal distance
of the centre of gravity of his scapula from the centre of his glenoid
cavity, and found it to be 3^ inches, while the distance of the middle
of his hand from the same centre was found to be 22 inches.
   The weights lifted with the scapula were thns estimated : —
                     Muscles.*                                ozs.

   To this must be added about one-third more, to represent fat, fascia,
tendons, and skin, or 8'65 ozs., making altogether 34 60 ozs.
   As these weights were all obtained from dead subjects, we must add
somewhat more than one half,f to bring the weights up to the
standard of the living subject, which makes altogether over 51'90 ozs.
   Adding to this the weight of the average fresh scapula, 4'5 ozs., we
have, finally for the total weight applied at the centre of gravity of the
scapula, 56'40 ozs., which, when reduced to the corresponding weight
                                                 3'5
held in the palm of the hand, gives 56'4x         _=8'97 ozs.=0-56      lb.

1880.]          On the Absence  of Potassium in Protagon.            365
at 22 inches  from the centre of the shoulder joint, we obtain for the
value of a,
                   a=5-561bs.±0-125    (probable error).
   This result agrees remarkably     well with the result «=5'681bs.,
obtained by calculations founded on the Law of Fatigue, from the
long series of observations detailed in this note.
V. " On the Absence of Potassium in Protagon prepared by
      Dr. Gamgee."      By H. E. Roscoe, LL.D., F.R.S. Received
      April 29, 1880.
   Protagon is stated by Gamgee to contain no potassium. Thudichum,
on the other hand, asserts that this body contains from 0*7 to 1*6 per
cent, of this metal.
   In order to ascertain the quantity of potassium contained in pro
tagon prepared by Gamgee, 5 grams of this material was completely
burnt, leaving a residue of 0-177 gram, consisting chiefly of meta-
phosphoric acid. On precipitating the potassium in the usual way,
and on decomposing the platinochloride, a residue of O003 gram of
platinum was obtained ; this corresponds to a percentage of 0'0236 of
potassium   on the protagon employed.
   Spectroscopic experiments, made upon solutions of the chloride and
phosphate of potassium, and upon a solution of the latter salt with the
addition of the relative quantity of phosphoric acid present in the ash,
according to the above analysis, convinced me of the correctness of
the conclusions contained in my letter printed on page 113, vol. 30,
of the " Proceedings of the Royal Society."
   The Society adjourned over Ascension      Day to Thursday, May   13.

   In   a previous paper ("Proceedings," vol. xivii, p. 410) we com
municated experimental results relating to the phenomena which
present themselves in the ventricle of the heart of the frog, when
mechanically or electrically excited.    Our present purpose is to report
what has been done during the past winter towards the further eluci
dation of the snbject.

   By the term " excitatory state we mean, as in our former com
munication, nothing more than the condition which is produced in
any excitable structure (whether in plants or animals) by excita
tion. So far as it has been as yet investigated, this state is charac
terised (1) by the appearance of electromotive            properties in the
excited part, which did not exist before excitation, and cease to

exist as soon as its effect is over; (2) by diminished excitability
(showing itself in the suspension or diminution of the power which
the structure before possessed of responding to a second excita
tion)    ; (3) by the fact that it is propagated from the part first excited
to contiguous parts at a rate which is different in different structures,,
and in the same structure at different temperatures.                 Hitherto the
relations of these three facts have been chiefly studied in the excitable
tissues of the higher animals.          Our investigations lead us to conclude
that they are equally characteristic of the excitatory state in plants.
We attach great importance to them, as being the only outward and
visible signs by which the hidden process of excitation constantly
reveals itself. For those more obvious changes which, in the con
tractile structures, follow excitation, are wanting in those which are
merely excitable, and thereby lose their value as characteristics.
     It was from the first apparent that the physiological relations of the
 three kinds of phenomena which admitted of investigation, viz., those
of electrical change, of diminished excitability, and of propagation,
 could only be learnt by the use of exact methods for the determination
 of the order of occurrence and duration, i.e., of the iime-rebitions of
 each. For this purpose the means were then wanting ; the first step
 was to contrive and construct the instrument, of which the description
has just been given.          The rheotome was completed in April, 1879,
 since which time the observations now communicated have been made.
     Shortly after the communication of our last experiments. Pro
 fessor Engelmann made a valuable addition to the researches*
 previously published by him on the electrical phenomena of the
 excitatory process in the ventricle of the heart of the frog. The
 most important of his results and conclusions are as follows : —
 (1) In 47 out of 78 preparations, investigated with the aid of
  Bernstein's rheotome, it was found that, when the surface of the
 separated ventricle ("ventricle-apex preparation") was excited by the
  passage of a single induction shock between platinum electrodes in
 contact with its surface and not more than a millimeter apart, the
  surface being led off, as in our experiments, by two contacts at
  unequal distances from the seat of excitation, the nearest of the two
  led-off surfaces (2 millims. distant), became first negative, then
  positive to the other (5 millims. distant). Thus the variation assumed
  the character of a
                             " Doppehchwanl-ung," i.e., it consisted of two
  phases of opposite signs.        In the remaining 31 instances, all that was
  observed was that the nearer contact became at once negative, and that
  its negativity gradually subsided. /2) In 33 experiments in which the
  same method was employed, the means of the deflections of the
  galvanometer, corresponding to the first four-tenths of a second after

excitation, were recorded graphically in      a curve of  which the abscissae
express    the times,  the ordinates   the deflections.    This curve shows
that, in the 33 preparations, the first phase began 0"'06 after excita
tion, and rapidly attained its maximum ; that the reversal of sign took
place at 0"-26, the contacts becoming finally equipotential at 0"-5. In
10 similar      experiments, in which the nearest contact was only
1  millim. from the seat of excitation, the interval of time between
the    excitation and the beginning of the variation was much
                                                 "                      " is

understood by Engelmann to mean that each part of the muscular
substance of the ventricle becomes, for a moment during excitation,
negatively electromotive (vorubergehend negativ electromotorisch wirk-
tatn), and that this negativity is propagated from the seat of excitation
in all directions." The rate of propagation was estimated as probably
50 millims. per second.
   It is to be noticed that the researches of Engelmann refer exclusively
to the first half- second after excitation, and that he has taken no
account of the phenomena which occur later; and, further, that his
observations are, as regards this first period, in the main in accordance
with the statements contained in our former paper. His interpretation
of them is however different, for phenomena to which we apply the
term initial are regarded by him as constituting the whole process.
   1. Time-relations of the Excitatory Variation in the Uninjured Heart.
— By the term excitatory variation we mean the succession of elec
trical changes which manifest themselves galvanometrically as the
result of excitation, when the surface of the ventricle is led off at two
points. The method of observing these changes is as follows : — The
preparation rests on the carefully lacquered surface of the upper end
of a brass box of cylindrical form, the axis of which is vertical.
Through this box water flows at 10° C. Of the two contacts by which
the ventricle is led off, one (to) is close to the apex, the other (/) near
the base, on the ventral aspect. The two platinum wire electrodes,
by which the induction shocks pass for excitation, are insulated up to
their tips, which are 1 millim. apart. They are in contact with the
surface of the ventricle at the apex. The arrangement of the galvano-

galvanometer (G).

                                      is closed, and the slider of the
compensator moved until the needle    of the galvanometer is at zero :
this having been done, K is opened and the rheotome set in motion,
when it is found that its revolutions are without effect on the galva
nometer.
   The binding screws connected with the outer pools of the rheotome
are connected with the key         from one of the blocks of which a wire

closing   induction   currents, to one pole of a Grove's battery of two
cells, the other wire leading to the opposite pole. The terminals of
the secondary coil of the induction apparatus are connected with the
exciting electrodes in such a way that the rotations of the rheotome,
each of which makes and breaks the primary current of the induction
apparatus, are without effect on the preparation, excepting when the
key   V    opened for the purpose of making an observation.

   If it is desired to investigate more minutely a part of the variation,
as  for example, the changes which take place in the first four-tenths
of a second, a table is used in which the rheotome readings for twenty
periods ending respectively at 0"-02, 0"-04, 0"-06 and so on, after ex
citation, are recorded.      The following table exemplifies the kind of
result so obtained, the period of closure being 0"*1.

   These readings show that in the particular preparation investigated
(which may he taken as a representative one) the state of negativity
of the contact m did not last more than 0"'06, and culminated before
a tenth of a second had elapsed after excitation.
    Whenever the surface of the ventricle is led off in the way ahove

                                     the same results are obtained.       We
are therefore justified, first, in repeating the statement contained in
our last paper, viz., that the electrical effect of excitation manifests
itself iu two phases, an initial and a terminal one, which have
opposite signs     and, secondly, in adding to our previous statement,
                     ;
that the initial     separated from the terminal phase, by a relatively
                         is

pare this result with that of Professor Engelmann, observed in a
similar way,       will be at once seen that although the interpretation
                    it
may be different, our observations are in accordance with his, so far as
they relate to the same period. The whole of the phenomena recorded
by him belong to the beginning of the 1st second. The beginning
of the period of equipotentiality          regarded by him as the end of
                                                         is
the excitatory effect. To us the absence of galvanometric effect during
this period, which we designate the isoelectrical interval,            merely                        is
the expression of the fact that both contacts are       in the same degree of
excitation.

on the cooler surface, and a series of rheotome observations                                 are made
during the 2nd second, it is observed that the deflections of the ter
minal phase are diminished.                          In the contrary case they are increased
and begin at an earlier period ; so that, at a time at which the sur
faces m and           / were       before isoelectrical,         the surface m is now positive
to/.       To produce these effects                   a difference between the temperatures
of the chambers of only 3° is sufficient.                          That which exists between
the led-off surfaces is obviously much less.
     If, in the manner described in our previous paper, the surface of the
ventricle is temporarily warmed by the passage for a second or two of
a voltaic current through a platinum wire fixed in the neighbourhood
of one of the contacts — say the contact m — similar but much more
considerable effects are produced, which, when observed with the aid
of the rheotome, exhibit the characters shown in the table.

     The table represents, first, the results of a series of preliminary
observations,           showing the electrical state of the surfaces during _ten
successive periods after excitation when their temperatures                                       were
equal     ;  and,      secondly,         ten   series   of  observations       relating   to the  same
ten periods, showing the condition of the same surfaces at various
 intervals of time after warming. We learn from it (1) that in the
 unexcited state the revolution of the rheotome, i.e., the closure of the
 galvanometer circuit, is without effect on the needle, whether the tem
 peratures of the two surfaces are equal or not ; (2) that in the excited
 state    the needle remains unaffected during the isoelectrical interval
 only     in    case the temperatures are equal.                         If they are unequal the
 warmer of the two tends to become positive to the cooler, the electrical
 difference between them increasing and diminishing with the difference
 of temperature.                 It is to be noticed that this effect manifests itself
 first at the end of the isoelectrical interval, over which i£ gradually
 extends as the difference of temperature increases.
      3. Time-relations of the Variation in the Injured Ventricle. — In our
  former paper we gave an account of the influence of slight injuries of

1880.]           Experimental Researches            :  Heart of the Frog.                   379
the surface in modifying the phenomena of the excitatory variation.
The rheotome has enabled ns to add very considerably to our knowledge
of these modifications.           The effect of all injuries, whether chemical or
mechanical,       in so   far resemble each other, that in all cases the injured
surface tends during the whole of the excitatory period to become
positive to the uninjured. The degree in which this effect manifests
itself varies in the same direction with the degree of injury.                            If the
injury is very slight, such for example as is produced by touching the
surface with a camel-hair pencil, which has been dipped in 10 per cent,
solution of salt, and then drained with filter-paper, the change which
follows resembles that of slight warming.                          The end phase begins
earlier, and its deflections are increased.                      If it is produced by ap
proaching the platinum loop a little too near, the effect is similar, but
begins earlier and lasts longer, so that the isoelectrical interval is
much reduced in duration.                If the led-off surface (t») is completely
 destroyed, as by touching it instantaneously                      with the hot wire after
 having removed the electrode, and then renewing the contact, it is
 found that the whole isoelectrical interval is, as it were, filled up,
large positive* deflections being obtained with the rheotome through
out the whole excitatory period, with the exception of the first tenth.
 This is well seen in the following table, in which we have given the
 means of the deflections recorded when the galvanometric circuit was
 closed for ten successive periods of two-tenths of a second.                         By com
 paring these numbers with those given in Table III, it will be seen
 that whereas, in the partially warmed ventricle, the temporary effect
 produced culminates early in the 2nd second, the more lasting effect
 produced in the injured ventricle reaches its maximum about the
 middle of the 1st second.

     4. The Period of Diminished Excitability. — Since the researches of
M. Marey,| in 1876, it has been known that the excitability of the
ventricle is diminished during the period of systole, Marey showed
that if the ventricle is excited by an induction shock of just sufficient
strength to evoke a response, the excitation is followed by a period of
                      j
    * WhenOTer the words " positive " or "                     "  are used absolutely, the state

   diminished excitability, during which it will not respond to a shock of
   the same intensity. This he termed the " refractory period ;" he
   further found that if the induction shocks were strengthened,                   a
   second response could be obtained after a shorter interval, but that
   in this case the interval between excitation and response was
   increased.
      For the purpose of obtaining information        as to the time-relations of
  these phenomena, we adopt the following method : — For one of the
   wires leading from the battery to the primary coil of the du Bois
  induction apparatus, two are substituted, of which one passes through
  the central, the other through the peripheral pools of the rheotome.
  The primary circuit is thereby closed, and immediately afterwards
  opened twice in each revolution ; the intervals between the two excita
  tions can be varied at will. The closing shocks being cut off in the
  way before mentioned, the rheotome is set so that the two opening
 shocks follow each other at an interval of two seconds.              If the ven
 tricle is at 10°C, and the distance of the secondary from the primary
 coil such that the excitation is just sufficiently strong to produce a
 contraction, it is usually followed by a second. If the interval between
 the two excitations is shortened by the tenth of a second, the second
 excitation is fruitless.    If now the temperature of the preparation is
 increased by a single degree, a response occurs which in its turn is
 abolished by taking another tenth off the time interval, and so on.
 Proceeding in this way we obtain the clearest possible demonstration
 of two facts, namely, (1) that the duration of the period of diminished
excitability agrees pretty closely with that of electrical activity, and
 (2) that it is similarly affected by changes of temperature.
     5. Bate of Propagation of the Excitatory Wave. — It has already been
 stated that the rate of propagation of the " Beizwelle," i.e., of the
 excitatory electrical disturbance, was estimated by Engelmann to be
 50 millims. per second.       His observations, indeed, give a less rate
than this, but for good reasons, which he has stated, he thinks that
they require correction.      We have been able by the following method
to show that the estimate is considerably below the mark. The heart
is led off as usual at the base     (/)   and near the apex (m), and excited
at the apex (x), and care is taken that the contacts as, m, and
the same straight line.      A third non-polarisable electrode is in con
                                                                         /  are in
tact with the surface at m' between m and /, and 4 millims.
 from m.*      The time after excitation, at which the first effect, i.e.,
the first negative deflection is observed, is determined at m and vi,
by rheotome observations, in which the galvanometer circuit passes
through m and m alternately (for which purpose a switch is used).
    • These measurements could not have been carried out had we
                                                                   not possessed a
few gigantic specimens of B. esculenta, from the Platten See in Hungary.     These
we owed to the kindness of Professor Goltz.

   1880.]         Experimental Researches         : Heart  of the Frog.             381
   Two parallel series of results are obtained, which when                  set off as
  ordinates on the same time-axis exhibit the characters shown in the
  figure. Our results show that in a fresh preparation at 12°, the
  excitatory wave is propagated at a rate of about 130 millims. per
  second. It will be noticed that the rapidity with which the electromo
  tive force of the initial phase attains its maximum, renders it possible
   to make this observation with great exactitude.
                                          Fio. 2.
     The figures above the line denote degrees of the scalo of the rheotome ; those
  below, lOOths of   a second measured from the moment of excitation ; those in the
 Tertical column degrees of the scale of the galvanometer. The ascending line to the
 left shows the deflections observed when the galvanometer circuit was opened at
 38, 40, 42, and so on of the scale of the rheotome, the preparation being led off at
 m an&f. The similar line to the right shows the corresponding deflections at 50, 52,
 and so on, when m' was substituted for m and the excitation wave had 4 millinia.
 further to go. The records represent the means of two observations taken as soon
as possible after each other.     It is reckoned that in these instances the 4 millims.
 were accomplished in the time corresponding to 11 divisions of the rheotome scale,
 i.e., in 0 032 second.
     The facts which have been stated in the preceding paragraphs are
consistent with the following theories : —
     1. Every excited part is negative to every unexcited part, so long as
the state of excitation lasts. 2. The local duration (brtliche Bauer,
Engelmann) of the excitatory state, i.e., the time it lasts in each
structural element, is measured by the time-interval between the begin
ning of the initial and the beginning of the terminal phase of the
variation.
     As regards the second of these propositions, we are in dis
agreement with Professor Engelmann, who attributes to the excita
tory process in the ventricle of the frog's heart a duration of
only two-tenths of a second. We conclude, from our own observa
tions, that its duration is nearly two seconds at the temperature at

382           Experimental Researches      : Heart  of the Frog.    [May    13,
which most of our experiments were made, namely, at 10° or 12° C.
This conclusion is, indeed, the only one which the facts admit of,
for, inasmuch as the total duration of the variation is over two
seconds, and the time occupied in the propagation of the excitatory
wave from apex to base is one-twentieth of a second at most, it is clear
that it must last, at the part furthest from the seat of excitation, as
long as l"-9.
   When both contacts are at the same temperature, and in all other
respects under the same conditions, the local duration of the excitatory
state is the same at both, consequently, it begins and ends earlier at >,/
than at /, the initial and terminal differences expressing themselves in
the initial and terminal phases of the normal variation.
    When one contact is warmer than the other, the local duration of
the excitatory state is less in the warmed than in the nnwarmed
surface.       Consequently the terminal interval, i.e., the time dnring
which the excitatory state at         /  overlaps that at to, is longer.   The
terminal phase of the variation begins earlier, and its deflections are
larger.
    If  the surface at to is slightly injured, the local duration at the
injured surface is diminished in the same way as when its temperature
is increased.       The effects, indeed, are indistinguishable ; but if the
injury    is  of such intensity as to destroy the snrface, its most prominent
¦effect  is to diminish its electromotive activity.         Consequently, the
activity of the contact     / is unbalanced, and expresses itself in the large
deflections which are exemplified in Table III.
    In general, it is observed that in the injured ventricle the total
 duration of the variation is less than in the same preparation before
 injury. We are not as yet in a position to offer an explanation of
¦this  fact.

    Condition of the Surface of the Ventricle in the Besting Heart. — It has
already been repeatedly stated that the surface of the ventricle, so
long as it is absolutely uninjured and at the same temperature in all
 parte, is isoelectrical.      Any inequality as regards the mechanical,
chemical, or thermal conditions to which the surface is exposed, is
accompanied        by corresponding electrical differences1, which are of the
following      nature  :—
    If a platinum wire, warmed by the passage along it of a voltaic
•current, is brought into the neighbourhood           of a led-off surface, the
¦effect invariably produced is to render that surface positive to the
 other.      If the warming is continued for a few seconds only, the effect
 promptly subsides.        If it is continued, the needle also returns to zero,
 but continues to move to the negative side. If, as soon as this
 second effect has been produced, the wire is withdrawn, it also

1880.   J   Dr.  J. Burdon-Sandevson.         On a New Rheotome.        383
subsides,    but very slowly. The nearer the wire, and the longer it
remains hot, the greater the electrical difference produced, and the
longer the time required for its subsidence. Corresponding results are
obtained by touching the surface, in the manner before described,
with a camel-hair pencil, containing solution of common salt. The
immediate result is to render the surface so acted upon positive to the
other surface. Here, as before, the effect rapidly subsides. If now,
the application is repeated or a stronger solution is used, the first
•effect is the same, but it is followed by a slow deflection   of the needle
 in the opposite direction.
    It is important to notice that, in both modes of acting on the
surface of the ventricle, the primary effect (that of increased " posi-
         " of the warmed or
 tivity                        slightly injured surface) is, when measured
 iu electromotive force, inconsiderable.      After warming, we have never
observed a greater difference than 0-003 volt.        When the solution of
 salt is used the effect may amount to as much as O'OOl volt. The sub
 sequent negative effect varies according to the extent and degree of the
 injury, and may, as stated in our former paper, amount to from two to
 three hundredths of a volt.
     Another question relating to the physiological condition of the
 resting heart is that of the influence of temperature on its excita
 bility. We have estimated the excitability of the ventricle by measur
 ing, at different temperatures, galvanometrically, the strength of the
  weakest induction shock by which a response could be evoked, and
  have arrived at the general result that, when the temperature is raised
 from 10° C. to 30° C, the excitability increases by one-third or one-
 sixtieth for each degree. The suggestion offers itself that the two
  new facts which have been stated, viz., the slight positivity of the
  warmed surface and the increased excitability are correlated, but it is
 of no value, excepting as an indication for further experiments.
     The full account of the experiments, of which the results are shortly
 •communicated above, will be published in the "Journal of Physiology."

   In each of these instruments, as also in the instrument now to be
described, two independent circuits, one of which may be called the
exciting circuit, the other the galvanoscopic, are successively closed
and immediately afterwards opened by a mechanism of such a nature
that the time-interval between the two closures and (as regards the
galvanoscopic circuit) the duration of the period of closure may be
varied according to the purpose of the observation, and accurately
measured.     In the fall rheotome each of the times required is deter
mined by the measurement of the distance which a falling weight
passes through in the interval between the first and second event, as.
e.g., between the closure of the exciting and galvanoscopic circuits and
between the closure and opening of the latter. In Bernstein's rheotome
time     measured in terms of the rotation-time of a wheel, which
           is                                                                                  is

                a

In this plate are cut eight pools, of which the forms are shown in the

    The fixed circular plate above described is surrounded by a moveable
annular plate of the same material and thickness, which also has eight
excavations or pools, all of which can be brought into communication
                                   Fio. 1.
by means of an annular trough of mercury by which they are sur
rounded.     To the outer edge of the annular plate is fixed a graduated
circle of brass, which revolves with it. Against this circle works a
tangent screw, each turn of which corresponds to a single division of
the graduation ; this screw is furnished with a divided milled head
and can be thrown out of gear when necessary by the auxiliary screw,
in a manner which will be readily understood from the drawing. The
vertical axis carries at its upper end a pulley, by means of which it is
connected with a motor, and can be made to revolve at any desired
rate.   Above the pulley is a platinum wire, the end of which is bent
downwards so as to dip into an annular pool of mercury, which is in
metallic connexion with the horizontal bar, and thereby with the iron
plate and the binding screw B'. The vertical axis also carries three
arms, of which one is longer than the other two ; the longer arm carries
at its end the vertical screw g ; this screw is prolonged at its
lower end by an amalgamated gold wire, the end of which dips into
the mercury contained in the external pool, as the axis rotates.     This
am is insulated at c, but is connected with the axis, and thereby
through the annular pool above described with the binding screw B'.
 As the external pools are connected through the arm h with the bind
ing screw B, B and B' are in communication whenever the screw g
 is in contact with the mercury in any of the pools.     Each pool is fur
 nished with a vulcanite stop, by which it is thrown out of communi
 cation with the external pool. In the drawing all are thus out of
communication excepting one.
    The two shorter arms are in metallic connexion with each other,
 but are insulated from the axis by a collar of vulcanite d. One of
 them carries a screw e, which like g ends in a gold wire, of which the
 tip is amalgamated ; the other carries a similar screw /, and is so
 constructed that the screw/ can be moved radially (i.e., in a vertical


1880.]       On the Chemical Conqwsition      of A leurone- Grains.      387
plane which contains the axis of rotation) to any required distance
from the axis.      The two arms meet each other at an angle of 45°.
    From the form and arrangement of the internal pools (see fig. 1)
it is evident that whenever the screw e is in contact with any of the
pools b, b, b, b, the screw    / mast be in contact with the pools a, a, a, a
(see   fig. 2), and farther  inasmuch   as / is nearer the axis than e, the
times at which       e makes and breaks contact with the pool b must
respectively precede and follow those at which contact with the pool
a is made and broken by /. Consequently the time during which
both are in contact (i.e., daring which the circuit G G' is closed) is
determined solely by the duration of the immersion of /, and can be
varied by altering its distance from the centre.
    When it is desired to use the rheotome for investigating the effects
of series of excitations recurring at short intervals (tetanus of muscle
 or nerve), all the pools are equally filled with mercury.
    Their equality must be tested by interpolating each set of pools in
 the circuit of a Grove's cell, which also includes a recording chrono
 graph ; if the chronographic record shows that the durations of the
 contacts are not perfectly equal, the error must be corrected by adding
 or subtracting mercury.         For investigating the effects of single
 excitations, only one of the external and one couple of the interual
 pools are used.
    The drawing (fig. 2) shows the arrangement of the apparatus as
 used in the investigations made by Mr. Page and myself of the elec
 trical phenomena of the ventricle of the heart of the frog. The
 instrument is set so that the external contact g is broken at a moment
                                                        /
 which immediately precedes the immersion of : consequently the
 galvanometer circuit 0 0' is open at the moment of excitation, but
 closed immediately after, remaining closed so long as        / is immersed.
 By means of the tangent screw, the interval between the opening of
 the exciting circuit B B', and the closing of the galvanometer circuit
 G G', can be varied at will.

  I gave an account of an investigation of the aleurone-grains        of the
 blue lupin. The following is an abstract of the results arrived at
  by the investigation of the grains of some other seeds by the same
  methods    : —

          II.  The Aleur one- Grains of the Peony (Pseonia officinalis).
      a. Microscopical   Observations.   — In accordance with the researches
 ¦of  Pfeffer (" Jahrb. f.  wiss. Bot.," viii, 1872), the grains were fonnd
 to be readily soluble in distilled water, the only proteid substance
 remaining in the cells being the matrix, which, like that of the lupin,
 is insoluble in dilute acids and alkalies.          They also dissolve in 10 per
 cent, and in saturated NaCl solutions.            Their solubility is unaffected
 by previous treatment with either ether or alcohol.
     b. Chemical Observations. — The watery extract of the seeds (which
 has only a very faint acid reaction if a relatively large quantity ol
 water is used) becomes turbid on boiling, and it gives all the reactions
 of a fluid holding proteid substance in solution.               If it be boiled,
 evaporated     to small bulk,  and    then  filtered  into alcohol, a dense pre
 cipitate is formed.       The substance precipitated readily dissolves in
 distilled water, and the solution gives the reactions characteristic of a
 solntion of peptones.       The substance does not dialyse. It is probable,
 therefore, that it is identical with the soluble proteid detected in the
 seeds of the lupin, which I provisionally termed Hemialbumose.
     This substance is readily precipitated from its watery solution by
 the addition of a small quantity of acetic acid.                The precipitate
 differs, however, from the original substance in that it is only slightly
 soluble in distilled water : it is more soluble in solutions of alkaline
carbonates, and it dissolves completely in dilute solutions of the
 alkalies.    In this respect it resembles acid-albumin (syntonin) .
     If the seeds, after extraction with water until the filtrate gives only
a very faint xanthoproteic reaction, be treated with 10 per cent. NaCl
solution, a fluid is obtained which gives a dense precipitate on boiling,
a precipitate on dilution with water, and on saturation with NaCl.
     Further, if the seeds be extracted with saturated NaCl or MgSOt
solution, a fluid is obtained which gives a slight turbidity on boiling,
but no perceptible turbidity on dilution.
    From these observations, it appears that the aleurone-grains of the
peony consist of one proteid soluble in water (hemialbumose), and of
another, insoluble in distilled water, but soluble in 10 per cent. NaCl
solution, and precipitable from its solution by boiling or by saturation.
This latter body corresponds in these respects with the substance
found in the seeds of the lupin, and termed vegetable myosin.
    It  seems probable that the grains of the peony contain no substance
(or, at most, a very small quantity of it) analogous to the vegetable
vitelliD, which occurs in the grains of the lupin, and which is soluble
in saturated NaCl solution.
III.    The Aleurone-Grains    of  the Castor    Oil Plant (Bicinus communis).
    a. Microscopical   Observations. — When mounted in alcohol, the grains

1880.]        On the Chemical   Composition    of Aleur one- Grains.         389
are seen to be ovoid bodies        which present no indication of a com
plex   structure  ; occasionally a rounded mass may be distinguished at
the more pointed end.
    On the addition of water, the whole grain increases in size and
becomes clearer, in consequence, apparently, of the solution of a part
of its substance.       It is then seen to consist of the rounded mass
before mentioned, the globoid, and of a large crystalline body, the
crystalloid, which are imbedded in a more or less spherical mass of
proteid ground-substance.
    The action of water is not affected by previous treatment of the
grains with either alcohol or ether. The following results show that
the solvent action of NaCl and MgS04 solutions is profoundly modified
by such treatment.
    1. Grains treated with ether : —
    a. The ground-Bubstance dissolves readily in 10 per cent. NaCl
 solution, and partially in saturated NaCl or MgS04 solution.
   /9.  The crystalloid dissolves very slowly in 10 per cent. NaCl solu
tion,  but   it  quite insoluble in saturated NaCl or MgS04 solution.
                  is
    y. The whole grain dissolves readily in 20 per cent. NaCl or MgSOj
 solution.
   2.   Grains treated with alcohol (or with alcohol and ether) —    :
    a. The ground-substance       dissolves readily in 10 per cent. NaCl
 solution, and partially in saturated NaCl or MgS04 solution.
   y3.  The crystalloid dissolves slowly in 10 per cent. NaCl solution,
 but entirely and at once in saturated NaCl or MgS04 solution.        If the
 grains, after treatment with alcohol, be washed with water, the crys
 talloids lose their solubility in saturated NaCl or MgS04 solution, but
 regain  it on further treatment with alcohol.
    7.  Both   the ground- substance and the crystalloid dissolve very
readily in 20 per cent. NaCl and MgS04 solutions; the crystalloid dis
solves more readily after treatment with alcohol than           itdoes after
treatment with ether only.
   b.  Chemical Observations. — If crushed seeds be treated with water,
after the oil has been extracted from them by alcohol or ether, a fluid
is obtained which gives a precipitate on boiling. The filtrate, after
evaporation to small bulk, gives      a   precipitate on being poured into
alcohol. The substance precipitated           isreadily soluble in distilled
water    ; the solution gives the reactions characteristic       of    fluid
                                                                         a
holding peptone in solution. The substance does not dialyse.              In
these particulars      resembles the substances found in the seeds of the
                        it
lupin and of the peony, and     it  may therefore be also termed hemial-
bumose.      It probably this substance which seen to be dissolved
                   is                                is
when the grains are treated with water under the microscope.

sists of hemialbumose and of two globulins, of which one               soluble      is
and the other insoluble   in  saturated  solution of NaCl   or  MgS04.    The
crystalloid consists of a globulin, which          soluble in 10 and 20 per

MgSO.j   solutions.
         Additional Remarks          on the Aleurone- Grains       of   the   Blue Lupin.
   After the foregoing results had been obtained,    became necessary   it
to complete the investigation of the grains of the lupin by ascertain
ing the action upon them of saturated NaCl and MgS04 solutions.
I    found that the grains dissolved readily in both these fluids, and
that their solubility was not affected by treatment with alcohol. The
solution, in quantity, gives a precipitate on boiling and on dilution.
                                       General Remarks.
  The three kinds of aleurone-grains                    which have been investigated

solves very slowly in 10 per cent. NaCl solution.

those of the lupin in saturated NaCl or MgS04 solution.          In the

neutral salts in the cells suffice to bring the globulin into temporary
solution, so as to cause the entire disintegration of the grains. As
regards the lupin,        clear that the globulin of which the grains

  principally consist is a vitellin, and possibly the formation of a preci
  pitate which takes place during the saturation of the 10 per cent.
  NaCl solution may be attributed to a conversion of a part at least of
  the vitellin into a myosin.
     In the course of my observations it became evident that alcohol,
  contrary to the generally received opinion, does not render the vege
  table globulins insoluble in solutions of neutral salts.* All the above-
 mentioned reactions are given by aleurone-grains which have been in
 alcohol for a very considerable time. The grains of Ricinus, for
 example, after having been in absolute alcohol for more than a year,
 give the same reactions as fresh ones. This is true of the globulins,
 not only whilst they exist in the form of aleurone-grains, but after
 their extraction ; thus, the precipitate obtained by diluting a 10 per
 cent. NaCl extract of Ricinus seeds was quite soluble in 10 per cent.
 NaCl solution after having been for a month in alcohol.
     The action of alcohol upon the crystalloids of Ricinus is remarkable
 in that it renders them readily soluble in saturated NaCl or MgS04
 solution. That they are otherwise quite insoluble in these fluids is
 proved by the fact that I have kept quantities of crystalloids in excess
 of the saturated solutions for months ; if some of these be treated for
 a few minutes with alcohol, they can be seen under the microscope to
 dissolve at once in these solutions.      It is of interest to note that        if,
after treatment with alcohol, the crystalloids be washed with water,
they lose their solubility in these saturated salt solutions, and that they
only regain   it after being again treated with alcohol. Alcohol appears,
in this case, to convert     a substance which       isinsoluble in saturated
salt solutions into one which         soluble,
                                     is         that       is,

    The crystalloids of Musa Hillii and of Musa Ensete (for this material
also I am indebted to Dr. Schimper) are remarkable for their insolu
bility.    They swell-up slightly, but do not dissolve in solutions of
neutral salt3 of various degrees of concentration and in 1 per cent.
Na3C03 solution.      They swell-up considerably, but do not dissolve in
dilute HC1.      They swell-up and dissolve partially in dilute KHO.
They therefore, probably consist of some relatively insoluble albuminate.
    Wben treated with 10 or 20 per cent, solution of NaCl or MgS04,
the crystalloids of Sparganium ramosum swell-up considerably, and
the central portion dissolves, leaving the external portion of the
crystalloid as a thick-walled vesicle ; on the addition of water, a
granular precipitate is thrown down inside the vesicle. The process
of solution is the same when the crystalloids are treated with 1 per
cent. NatjC03 solution, but dilution with water does not, in this case,
produce a precipitate inside the vesicle.      The central portion of the
crystalloid dissolves also when they are treated with saturated NaCl
solution, but the swelling-up is less considerable. The vesicle dissolves
readily in dilute KHO, and in dilute (-4 per cent.) HCl. These
crystalloids, therefore, consist of two substances, a vitellin, forming
 the central mass, and an albuminate, forming the outer portion. This
albuminate may be probably regarded as having been produced by an
 alteration of the globulin of which the whole crystalloid doubtless con
 sisted originally.
    It appears that no dofinite relation exists between the crystalline
 form and the solubility of the crystalloids in solutions of neutral salts.
 According to Schimper (loc. cit.) all the crystalloids which      I   have
 examined belong to two systems, the regular and the hexagonal.
    1. Hexagonal rhombohedra : crystalloids of Musa, Sparganium,
 Bertholletia, and the artificial crystals obtained from Bertholletia.
    2. Regular tetrahedra : crystalloids of Ricinus, Viola, Linum, Cucur
 bita, and the artificial crystals obtained from Cucurbita.
    In all cases I found the aleurone-grain to be invested by a peri
 pheral layer (Hullm-embran), which is apparently insoluble, and which,
 as Pfeffer suggests, contributes to form the proteid network or matrix
 which remains in the cells after the more soluble portions of the grams
 have been dissolved out.

with the researches of Hammarsten (" Ueb. das Paraglobulin,"

   In conclusion, I would add a few remarks to those which I made in
my former communication with reference to the relation between the
globulins and the hemialbumose existing in seeds and the various
bodies, such as conglutin, legumin, <fcc, which Ritthausen has ex
tracted from them.          I therein expressed my concurrence with Weyl's
opinion     that these    caseins   are the products of the alteration of the
globulins effected by the alkaline solutions used in extracting them.
I                                        I
   still maintain this view, but think now tbat it is only a partial ex
planation. My observations, more particularly those on the peony,
make it clear that a considerable proportion of these caseins is hemial
bumose precipitated by the dilute acetic acid which is used in Ritt-
hausen's method for throwing down the caseins from the alkaline
extracts.

        Dr. W. Roberts, F.R.S. Received April 15, 1880.
    "We were requested a       few months ago by Dr. W. Roberts to verify a
statement, recently made by Musculus and De Mering, that maltose is
a product of the action of an aqueous extract of pancreas upon starch-
paste.      During the prosecution of the inquiry, and while following
up certain lines of experiment which suggested themselves from time
to time, we have, besides fully confirming the results of the above-
mentioned observers, ascertained certain facts which we believe are of
some physiological importance in elucidating the still very obscure
processes of animal digestion and nutrition.
                       I. Hydrolytie     Action of the Pancreas.
    The first observation upon the amylolytic action of the pancreatic
secretion appears to have been made by Bouchardat and Sandras* in
the year 1845. The general functions of the gland were more fully
studied in 1856 by Claude Bernard,f and a few years later by Cohn-
heim (" Virchow's Archiv," 28, 241, 1863). DanilewskiJ in 1862, and

isolated a soluble amylolytic ferment from the pancreas, the former
observer by acidifying the aqueous infusion with phosphoric acid and
precipitating with lime ; the latter by the glycerine method first
described by Wittich.
  Hiifner found that the isolated body, which was still doubtless
impure, contained 14'95 per cent, of nitrogen, but a less quantity of
carbon and a greater quantity of oxygen than an ordinary albuminoid.
   Until recently it has always been taken for granted that the fermen
table sugar produced by the action of pancreas upon starch-paste is
dextrose.   Nasse, however, in 1878 (" Pfliiger's Archiv f. Physio
logic," 14, 473), attempted to show that the fermentable and cupric-
oxide reducing    body, obtained by the action of saliva upon starch, is a
 specific sugar which  he calls ptyalose, and that the action of pancreatic
juice appears to result in the production of the same body. Nasse did
not isolate this hypothetical sugar, nor even approximately determine
its specific rotatory power, but relied mainly upon its non-reduction of
Barfoed's solution, and its doubling in reducing power on boiling with
dilute acid, as evidence of its non-identity with dextrose.
   In the early part of last year Musculus and De Mering published an
important memoir (" Bull. Soc. Chim.," 31, 105), upon the action of
diastase, saliva, and pancreatic secretion upon starch and glycogen.
   They concluded from their experiments that the fermentable sugar
produced in all these reactions is a mixture of maltose and dextrose.
 We have shown in a recent communication to the Chemical Society
                                          " Liebig's Ann.," 199, 245), that
(" Journ. Chem. Soc," 1879, 1, 648;
dextrose can certainly not be included amongst the products of the
action of malt-diastase upon starch.      The experiments we are about to
describe will however afford ample proof of the correctness of that
portion of the above statement of Musculus and De Miring referring to
the action of pancreatic extract.
   Our experiments were made either with the aqueous infusion of the
gland, or with the actual tissue itself in a finely divided state.
   The first method is by far the most convenient, and is the one which
we generally adopted when studying the action of the pancreas, but       it,
will be seen that certain tissues can produce under some circumstances
hydrolytic effects which their aqueous infusions are incapable of exer
cising.
   With a clear aqueous infusion of the gland the course of experiment
did not differ materially from that which we employed when investi
gating the action of malt-diastase upon starch (loc. cit.'). As a rule
the infusion had no power of reducing cupric-oxide, hence      it  was not
necessary to apply any correction to the quantity of cupric-oxide re
 duced by the transformation products.
   In cases where the transformation was effected by the actual tissue
itself, this was previously dried very rapidly in a current of air at

1880.]      Hydrolytie Ferments of Pancreas and Small Intestine.           395
35°C, a process which could easily         be carried out without decomposi
tion taking place.         The dried tissue was used with a given volume of
the experimental liquid containing a known quantity of the carbohy
drate.    The volume of the liquid was kept constant during the experi
ment, and the small increase in solid matter due to hydration was taken
into consideration.         Far more accurate results are obtained by this
method than by attempting to estimate the correction for the total
solids by digesting a given weight of the tissue in a given volume of
water. In the latter case the solvent action of the water upon the
tissue always differed somewhat from the solvent action of the solution
of the carbohydrate employed.
    When a clear infusion of pancreas, obtained by acting for several
hours upon one part of the finely divided pancreas of the pig with
five parts of cold water, is added to starch-paste at 40° C, complete
limpidity is produced with extreme rapidity, and in from ten to
fifteen minutes iodine ceases to produce any reaction for soluble starch
or erythrodextrin. Careful observations at different periods of the
reaction showed unmistakeably           that the transformation    in its first
stages does not differ in the least from transformations of starch-paste
made at 60° C. with aqueous malt-extract, which has not been pre
viously heated to a higher temperature.           When the specific rotatory
power of the transformation products has reached [*]>3-86, 162°-5, the
capric-oxide reducing power is found to be k 49 — 50.            When about
3 cub. centims. of the pancreatic infusion have been used for everv
grain of starch, the time occupied in fully bringing about this
change    is from forty to fifty minutes. The liquid now contains
maltose, and an     achroodextrin having all the properties of our achroo
dextrin  f.
    The maltose was proved to be identical with that obtained by the
action of malt-extract by isolating it in its characteristic crystalline
form, and by determining its specific rotatory and cupric-oxide re
ducing powers.
    The composition of the matter in solution at this point is
                              Maltose             80-8

    On continuing to digest the liquid at 40° C, the values of           and *

extract.

from organic life, the starch-products yielded on analysis the following

The united evidence afforded by many such experiments as the above
proves conclusively that the prolonged action of a pancreatic infusion
yields results differing materially from those obtained under similar
conditions with malt-extract. With malt-extract the hydrolytic effect
upon the starch-products, after No. 8 equation is reached, is confined
entirely to the conversion of the achroodextrin into maltose, the latter
body being the final product of the reaction.        On the other hand, an
aqueous infusion of pancreas, whilst converting achroodextrin into
maltose, sensibly hydrolyses the maltose to dextrose.
   In order to put this important point of difference between the
action of malt and pancreatic extract beyond all doubt, a solution of
pure maltose was digested with an infusion of pancreas, in just the
same manner as maltose had, on many previous occasions, been treated
with malt-extract.
   100 cub. centims. of a solution of maltose, containing 5'813 grms.
of substance, were mixed with 20 cub. centims. of a clear aqueous
infusion of pancreas, the infusion being added in successive portions of
5 cub. centims. each.     Temperature of digestion 45° C.
   In four hours the optical activity of the solution had fallen from
Mra-8* 150°0, to Ms-sa, 148°7; and after sixteen honrs to [a]3.M,
1350-1   ; the value of « at the end of this time having risen from 61 to
67-3.    The composition deduced from these latter numbers is
                           Maltose             83'8
                           Dextrose            162

   This experiment, repeated many times, always gave the same re
sults, thus proving that the amylolytic agent of the pancreas is capable,
as stated by Musculus and De Mering, of slowly converting maltose

1880.]     Hydrolytic Ferments of Pancreas and Small Intestine.       397
into dextrose,   a property which is not shared by malt-diastase.    Both
malt-diastase    and pancreatic-diastase   have, however, the property of
hydrolysing the lowest achroodextrin of the series, a fact which we
have proved by submitting to their action the isolated and purified
achroodextrin £ .
    A series of experiments was now made with the object of ascer
taining if the pancreas contains any ferment capable of inverting
cane-sugar.     It will be remembered that a cold aqueous infusion of
malt possesses this property to a limited extent. The first experi
ments were made by digesting solutions of cane-sugar at 40° C, with
25 per cent, of an aqueous extract of pancreas (5 of water to 1 of
pancreas). As long as the solutions remained free from bacteria we
 never observed even the slightest inversion of the cane-sugar, the
specific rotatory power of the solutions remaining constant through
out the experiment.      If the digestion was carried on for a length of
time sufficient to develop organic life, and a sensible evolution of gas,
a marked inversion of the sugar set in, a result which is not however
attributable to any soluble ferment derived from the pancreas.
    From some observations made at a later period of the inquiry it
seemed possible that the gland-tissue itself might have an effect which
was not shared by its aqueous infusion. An experiment was conse
quently made in which the finely divided pancreas itself was digested
with the cane-sugar solution.      Here again, however, as in the former
case, absolutely no inversion took place.
    J. Bechamp, in his experiments upon the action of various tissues
upon starch-paste and cane-sugar, states that the pancreas has a very
slight invertive action upon cane-sugar (" Les Microzymas," p. 68).
 In an examination of the details of his experiments, however, it is
clear that he only obtained evidence of invertive action after the gland
 had been in contact with a sugar solution for several days, and in no
cases without the previous appearance of bacterial life, to which doubt
less the effects are attributable ; the invertive action of some of these
organisms being almost as well marked as that of the Saccharomyces.
              II.  The Hydrolytic Action of the Small Intestine.
    Claude Bernard first called attention to any distinct hydrolytic
action of the small intestine.    He found that a solution of cane-sugar,
 inclosed within a portion   of the intestine ligatured above and below,
or placed in contact with an infusion of its mucous membrane, speedily
acquired the property of reducing a cupric solution.
    Bernard found this property common to the small intestine of the
dog, pig, rabbit, rat, and various other animals, and looked upon the
invertive action as one of the most important functions of the succits
entericus.
    The observations made from time to time upon the amylolytic action

of the secretions of the small intestine are somewhat conflicting.

of the small intestine of a living animal, obtained an albuminous
secretion which he found had no action upon starch, and with this
observation Funke agrees. On the other hand, Masloff (" Unters.
Physiolog. Inst. Heidelberg" [2], 1879, p. 290), Frerichs, and Busck
(" Virchow's Archiv," xiv, p. 140) state that the small intestine has
the power of transforming starch.
   When commencing to investigate the hydrolytic action of the small
intestine of the pig, we made nse of an aqueous infusion of the tissue,
made by acting upon one part of the well-washed and finely-minced
intestine with five parts of water for from ten to fifteen hours.
   Such an aqueous extract was prepared from three different portions
of tho intestine.
   (1.) A portion of the duodenum immediately below the glands of
Brunner.
   (2.) The agminated Peyer's glands (Peyer's patches) cut from the
jejunum.
   (3.) Portions of the jejunum and ileum not containing any of the
agminated Peyer's glands.
   20 cub. centims. of the clear filtered infusion made with each of the
above portions of intestine were added to 100 cub. centims. of a cane-
sugar solution containing 4-557 grms. of sugar per 100 cub. centims.
On digesting for three hours at 40° C, and allowing subsequently to
stand in the cold for twenty-four hours, scarcely a trace of inversion
was found to have taken place.
   The action of equal quantities of the various infusions upon starch-
paste was scarcely more marked ; about 3 grms. of starch, in the form
of starch-paste, being employed in each case, at a temperature of
40 — 45° C. After digestion for sixty minutes, none of the samples
of starch-paste showed any signs of limpidity. After sixteen hours,
No. 1 was found limpid, but contained only soluble starch ; No. 2
was perfectly limpid, and contained a little erythrodextrin ; whilst
No. 3 was absolutely unacted upon, the gelatinisation being still as
perfect as at the outset of the experiment.
   The pig, from which was derived the intestine used in the above
experiments, had been killed after fasting for thirty-six hours.        It
occurred to us that the absence of any well-marked amylolytic action
might   be due to this fact, and that a different result would probably
be  obtained  by infusing an intestine in which the various glands had
been more recently active.    In order to test this, an animal was killed
about two hours after administering a liberal allowance of barleymeal.
In this case the aqueous extract of the small intestine possessed a
somewhat greater action upon starch than in the previous experiment,
but the transforming power was still very feeble, more than two hours

being required for the production of limpidity in the starch-paste con
taining the most active of the three portions of the intestine, which
was in this, as in the former case, the region of the jejunum and
ileum containing the Peyer's patches.
   It is possible, as was first shown by Berthelot, to obtain a clear
aqueous infusion of ordinary yeast, which is capable of exercising
a very decided invertive action upon cane-sugar.      The action of this
aqueous infusion     is,
                      however, feeble when compared with the inversion
produced by actual contact of the yeast-cells themselves.
   Reasoning from this fact,     seemed to us probable that, in the case
                                    it
of the intestine, far    more  pronounced hydrolytic results might be
expected from acting with the tissue itself, than from merely using its
aqueous infusion.    This was found to be the case.
   In the following experiments the different portions of the small
intestine, after thorough and prolonged washing, were dried rapidly
in a current of air at 35° C, and were divided into very fine shreds,
which were immersed directly in the solutions under examination.
The intestine was taken from a pig of eight months old, killed during
the period of digestion.
   The solution of cane-sugar employed contained 3'020 grms. of sugar
per 100 cub. centims.
   To every 100 cub. centims. of the solution were added grms. of the             5
finely divided dry intestine. Temperature of digestion, 40° C.
   All the determinations were made by the optical method.

        Action of various portions of the Small Intestine upon Starch.
   The action of the tissue of the small intestine npon starch-paste, as
upon cane-sugar, is decidedly more energetic than that of its aqueous
infusion.     Limpidity of the 6tarch-paste is, however, not rapidly
brought about, and when produced, the resulting soluble starch is
very stable, and resists any sensible hydrolysation for a considerable
time.
    Strictly comparative     experiments upon the amyloljtie power" of
the    various parts of     the intestine were made in the following
manner     : —
    30 grms. of potato-starch were gelatinised with 1000 cub. centims.
of water, and 1 cub. centim. of malt-extract was added to the resulting
starch-paste after cooling to 60° C. The moment limpidity was pro
duced, the further action of this trace of malt-extract was arrested by
boiling. The liquid, filtered perfectly bright on cooling, and containing,
besides soluble starch, only a trace of erythrodextrin and maltose, was
analysed; its specific gravity, optical activity, and cupric-oxide reducing
power being determined.          The solution was divided into portions
measuring 100 cub. centims., into each of which were immersed 5 grms.
of the dried and finely divided intestine.        The various experimental
liquids were digested     under   exactly similar  conditions, in the water-
bath at 40° C.
    The portions of the intestine taken were as follows, the animal from
which they were derived being a young pig, killed during active
digestion of starchy food.
    (1.) A portion of the duodenum taken immediately below the
pylorus, and containing numerous Brunner's glands, which were very
apparent in this case owing to active digestion being in progress at the
time of the animal's death.
    (2.) Lower portion of the duodenum not containing any Brunner's
glands.
    (3.) Agminated Peyer's glands taken from the jejnnum.
    (4.) Portions of the jejunum not containing any Peyer's patches.
    (5.) Portions of the ileum, taken at the distance of a few inches
 from the ileo-C8Bcal valve.
    The solutions gave the following iodine reactions, the dilute iodine
solution being slowly added in each case up to an excess ; thus ensuring
 the detection of any erythrodextrin.
    After digestion for fifteen minutes — all deep blue — no production
 of erythrodextrin.
    After thirty minutes  — a very slight production of erythrodextrin in
 all.
    After forty-five   minutes  — all gave   a violet reaction.    From the
 larger amount of iodine solution requisite        to produce a permanent

  proceeding more rapidly in this than in any of the other solutions.
     After three and a-half hours — Nos. 1 and 2— deep violet reaction.
  No. 3 contained only a trace of unconverted soluble starch, and no
  erythrodextrin.

  Nos. 1 and 2.
     After the digestion for three and a-half hours at 40°, and lying in
  the cold for sixteen hours longer, the various liquids were fully
  analysed.     The corrected results are here given : —

 The question now arises — has the dextrose obtained in these experi
  ments passed previously through the stage of maltose, or has it been
  derived more directly from the starch ?
     Direct evidence, as well as that furnished by analogy, points
 strongly to the former proposition being the correct one. We have
 seen, in four out of five of the experiments, that the soluble starch
 resisted very persistently the hydrolytic action of the ferment. Where
 this resistance to transformation was least strongly marked, as in the
 experiment with the Peyer's glands, a little maltose was found.
    The conclusion seemed a fair one that we had here to deal with a
 remarkable hydrolysing agent, differing, in its relative action upon
 starch and starch-products, from that of any other known ferment, of
 its class ; an agent which is in fact capable of hydrolysing maltose
 with greater ease than soluble starch.
    On further experiment this surmise proved correct.
    All portions of the small intestine exert at 40° a     rapid hydrolytic action
 upon maltose; an action, however, which varies in intensity in different
parts of the intestine, and is far more energetic than that of a similar
portion of the intestine upon starch-paste, soluble starch, the higher dextrin*,
 and even cane-sugar itself.
    After thoroughly washing the small intestine of a pig, the portions
of the jejunum containing the agminated Peyer's glands were cut out,
rapidly dried at 35°, and cut into fine shreds, 5 grms. of which were
immersed in 100 cub. centims. of a solution containing 3-107 grms, of
pure maltose.
    The mixture was digested at 40° for sixteen hours, and at the end
of that time  it was found that the maltose had been entirely converted into a
dextrose which possessed the same specific rotatory power and cupric-
oxide reducing power as ordinary dextro-glucose, with which it was
doubtless identical.
   All portions of the small intestine exert, cateris paribus, a much
more rapid and complete action upon maltose than upon cane-sugar,
and the hydrolytic effect of the agminated Peyer's glands upon either
of these carbohydrates is far greater than that of any other portion of

the small intestine, either for equal weights or for eqnal areas of the

   We have satisfied ourselves of the truth of these statements by
numerous experiments.

   These    experiments, in conjunction with those upon cane-sugar,
described at p. 399, prove that the activity of the small intestine upon
saccharose is slow and incomplete, when compared with its power of
converting maltose into dextrose ; and also that, while the conversion
of maltose into dextrose under the action of the intestine ferment is
as continuous and uninterrupted a process as is its conversion by
dilute sulphuric acid, the invertive action upon cane-sugar is decidedly
limited, the action being either arrested or proceeding with extreme

no means clear, and the subject requires further investigation.
    Claude Bernard, who first demonstrated the existence iu the small
intestine of a soluble ferment capable of inverting cane-sugar, con
sidered that in this property resided one of the most important
functions of the succus entericus.      By injecting a solution of cane-
sugar into the veins and cellular tissue of animals he demonstrated
that this carbohydrate, after traversing the system, is eliminated
•weight for weight in the urine, without undergoing any modification
or assimilation.     In order that cane-sugar shall be assimilated by the
animal or vegetable economy, it must first be inverted. The seat of the
invertive action is in the small intestine itself.
    If this function of the small intestine has the importance attributed
to  it by Bernard, it is in the highest degree probable that the relatively
far more active maltose-hydrating        ferment,  coexisting with the in
vertive ferment, must possess some considerable physiological value.
    It must be remembered that, under natural conditions, the amount
 of cane-sugar which an animal is called upon at any given time to
 assimilate is very small when compared with the amount of products
 derived directly from starch.
    We cannot consider, under these circumstances, that so well-marked
 and striking a function of the small intestine as that of converting
 maltose into dextrose can bo useless to the animal economy.            The
 most probable explanation is that maltose is incapable of assimilation
 in its unaltered state, but has first to be broken down to the smaller
 moleculed dextrose, just as cane-sugar, prior to assimilation, is con
 verted into the chemically less complex dextrose and levnlose.      This is
 rendered the more probable from the known similarity of composition
 of maltose and cane-sugar, both bodies belonging to the class of
 sugars represented by the formula OjoHjjOh.
     Whether maltose is capable, under any circumstances, of being
 directly assimilated is a question, the solution of which we must leave
 in the hands of experimental physiologists.      Probably a series of care
 fully conducted injection experiments, similar to those made by
 Bernard with cane-sugar, would yield the desired information. It
 is true that the estimation of maltose in urine would be attended with
 greater difficulties than the estimation of cane-sugar, but these diffi
 culties are by no means insurmountable.
     It will be remembered that the action of artificial pancreatic juice
 upon gelatinised starch is very rapid, the transformation products in a
  short time containing 80 per cent, of maltose, which is but very
  slowly and partially converted into dextrose by a continnance of the
  reaction.    The active agent of the small intestine, on the other hand,
  while exerting    but little action upon gelatinised   or soluble starch,

 1880.]     Hydrolytic Ferments of Pancreas and Small Intestine.            405
converts with great readiness maltose into dextrose.              Thus we see
that   in the transition  from  colloidal starch to highly diffusible  dextrose,
the hydrolytic actions of the pancreas and small intestine are mutually
dependent and complementary to each other, neither one set of actions
alone being sufficient.
    The small intestine      does not contain    a very active   amylolytic fer
ment, because it is seldom or never called upon to act upon unaltered
starch, the first portion of the work being completed by the pancreatic
 secretion. Briicke (" Wien. Sitzungsber.," 65 (3), 126), when experi
menting upon dogs fed with amylaceous food, found that the soluble
starch and erythrodextrin which were produced in the stomach at once
disappeared on passing the pylorus, under the rapid action of the pan
creatic juice.
    We have now to consider more fully the part played by the three
different sets of glands of the small intestine in bringing about the
 hydrolytic effects which we have described. These glands are known
as — (1) the glands of Brunner ; (2) the glands or follicles of Lieber-
 kiihn ; and (3) the glands of Peyer.
    Brnnner's glands occur only in the duodenum.                They are most
 numerous immediately below the pylorus, and resemble closely in
 structure the salivary glands, or minute portions of the pancreas.
 When a portion of the duodenum containing these glands is mace
 rated in water, the liquid becomes extremely viscous, owing to the
 extraction of the special glandular secretion.            This effect is best
 observed by taking the duodenum of an animal which has been killed
 during digestion.       The viscid secretion, resembling in appearance
 submaxillary or sublingual saliva, has but a very slight amylolytic
 action.     The portion of the duodenum containing the glands has only
 a very slight invertive action upon cane-sugar, but a somewhat more
 decided hydrolytic action upon maltose.
     The glands or follicles of Lieberkiihn consist of tubular depressions
 in the mucous membrane of the intestine, and are generally supposed
 to secrete the succus entericus, to which, however, the Brnnner's glands
  must also largely contribute.       Since Lieberkiihn 's follicles are pretty
  evenly   distributed  throughout    the whole of the small intestine, and the
  hydrolytic effect of equal areas of the intestine varies very much in
  different parts, it is evident that these glands play no very important
  part either in the inversion of cane-sugar or in the still more active
  hydration of maltose to dextrose.
     We believe that the variable hydrolytic action of the different
  regions of the small intestine is mainly if not entirely due to the rela
 tive frequency of the glands of Peyer.            The solitary Peyer's glands
  occur most scantily in the upper portion of the duodenum, and here
  the hydrolytic effect is by far the least. As the solitary glands in
 crease in number the action of the intestine becomes more strongly

 marked, and finally the regions of the jejunum and ileum containing
 tho agminated glands, or Peyer's patches, are the portions of the in
 testine which exert the most pronounced            hydrolytic effect upon
 maltose, cane-sugar, and starch.     These glands consist of small ovoid
 masses of adenoid tissue, embedded in the mucous membrane, and
 enclosing vast numbers of leucocytes.         The glands are in intimate
 relation both with the vascular and lymphatic systems, each follicle
 being penetrated by blood-vessels, and surroanded by lymph sinuses
 which are in connexion with the lacteals of the villi.
    The function of the Peyer's glands is by no means established. The
 opinion held by physiologists up to a few years asjo that they discharge,
 by occasional rupture an intermittent secretion into the intestine,
 appears now to be abandoned in favour of the view that they are in
 strumental in absorbing material from the blood and chyle, which
 they elaborate and again transmit, in a modified form, in part to the
 portal blood, and in part to the lacteal system.
    The property which the glands undoubtedly possess of hydrolysing
 maltose to dextrose, and of so rendering the starch products of the
 pancreatic digestion more fitted for nutrition, is probably one of these
 special functions of elaboration.
    Our work on these matters has been necessarily restricted to the
 chemical side of the subject, and we must now, lest we should incur
 the charge of overstepping our metier, leave further observations in
 the hands of physiologists.
    The following are the main points which we consider have been
 established by our experiments : —
    (1.) The action of artificial pancreatic juice upon starch-paste or
soluble starch at 40° C. is, in the earliest stages of the reaction, similar
to that of unheated malt-extract acting at 60° C. and under, the com
position of the starch-products      becoming comparatively stationary
when 80'8 per cent, of maltose has been produced.
    (2.) Both malt-diastase and pancreatic-diastase        are capable of
hydrolysing the lowest achroodextrin      to  maltose.
    (3.) Pancreatic-diastase  is capable, by  long continued action at 40°,
of slowly but sensibly converting maltose into dextrose, a change
which malt-diastase ia incapable of effecting even under the most
favourable   circumstances.
    (4.) Neither artificial pancreatic juice, nor the tissne of the gland
itself contains any ferment which is capable of inverting cane-sugar.
    (5.) The small intestine is capable of hydrolysing maltose, of in
verting cane-sugar, and of acting feebly as an amylolytic ferment.
    (6.) The action of the tissue of the small intestine in bringing
about these changes is far greater than that of its mere aqueous
infusion, and differs materially in different regions of the intestine.

   the  small intestine is independent of the relative frequency either of
   the glands of Lieberkiihn, or of those of Brnnner, bat appears to be
   correlative with the distribution of Peyer's glands.
      (8.) In the transition from colloidal starch to readily diffusible and
   easily assimilated dextrose, the actions of the pancreas and of the
   Peyer's glands are mutually dependent and complementary.
      The pancreas readily breaks down the starch to maltose, but is
   capable only of a very slow conversion of the resulting maltose to
   dextrose.     The Peyer's glands on the other hand, whilst almost
   powerless upon starch itself, take up the work at a point where the
   pancreatic juice almost ceases to act, and so complete the conversion
   of starch into dextrose.

I.   " On some Thermal Effects of Electric Currents."                     By
      William Henry Preece, General Post Office. Communi
      cated by Professor Stokes, Sec. R.S. Received April 28,
       1880.
   I  have been engaged for some time past in experimenting on the
thermal effects of electric currents, but the final results of those experi
ments are not sufficiently ripe at present to justify my bringing them
before the Royal Society.      I have, however, obtained one result which
I believe  to be sufficiently novel to justify a short preliminary note.
   The most striking facts elicited by these experiments are :
   1. The extreme rapidity with which thin wires acquire and lose
their increased temperature.
   2. The excessive sensibility to linear expansion which fine wires of
high resistance evince.
   Now as the rate of heating, and therefore of expansion and contrac
tion, varies very nearly directly as the increment or decrement of the
currents, when these variations are very small, it occurred to me that
if a long wire of small diameter and high resistance were attached to
a sounding board, or to the centre of a disk (such as one of those used
for telephones and phonographs) and it formed part of a circuit con
veying telephonic currents, sonorous vibrations ought to be repro
duced.
   The sketch shows the arrangement         of the apparatus    used for the
experiment.
   A was a stout base of mahogany, on which a brass support C was
attached so that it could slide and be fixed at any distance from D.
   D was at first a disk of thin paper, and then of thin iron.
   P was the wire experimented upon whose loose ends were connected
to terminals on the wooden       base, so as to be inserted   in the circuit
containing a microphone transmitter M and a        battery B of six bichro
mate of potash cells in another room out of hearing.
   A platinum wire of 0'003 inch diameter and six inches long from p
to p' was first used, and the sonorous effects were most marked and

 encouraging,   when the microphone transmitter M was spoken into.
 The articulation, though    muffled, was clear, and words could easily
 be heard.
    1. Experiments were first made to determine the length which gave
the loudest sound and the clearest articulation, and, after repeated
trials with every variation of length from one inch to six feet, it was
found that a wire six inches long gave the maximum effect.
    2. Experiments were then made to determine the diameter of the
wire that gave the best effect, and after repeated trials with every
gauge drawn from O0005 inch to O'OOo inch, it was found that wire of
the diameter O'OOl inch gave the best effect.
   3. Experiments were then tried with wires six inches in length and
O'OOl inch diameter of different materials, viz., gold, iron, aluminium,
silver, copper, palladium, and platinum, and they came out in tho
following order of merit : —
                   Platinum                      Very clear.
                   Aluminium                     Very variable.
                   Palladium                     Clear.
                   Iron                        . Clear.
                   Copper                        Faint.
                   Silver                        Faint.
                   Gold                          Very poor.
   4. The effect of mechanical     strain was tried.    It was found not to
vary the effect.     When once the requisite tension, which varied with

410           On some Thermal Effects   of Electric Currents.   [May 27,
each metal,   was obtained, further tightening np did not vary the
clearness or loudness of articulation.
   Gold would scarcely bear the tension required to reproduce sonorous
vibrations, bence its low position.
   5. Very thin carbon pencil, '0625 inch diameter, was tried under
compression and under tension, but no effect whatever was experienced
unless a bad joint was made, when at once a faint microphonic effect
was apparent.
  6.   No sibilant sounds whatever could be reproduced.
  7.  That the effect was due to heating and cooling was shown by the
fact that it was possible to increase the current to such a strength as
to render the temperature of the wire sensible to the tonch, and then
to make its elongation and contraction by low sounds evident to the
eye.
  It   thereforeappears from these experiments that wires conveying
those currents of eleotricity which are required for telephonic purposes
expand and contract as they are heated and cooled, and as the varia
tions in the strength of the current are small compared with the
strength of the current itself, the expansion and contraction vary in
the same ratio as the condensation and rarefaction of the air particles
conveying the sonorons vibrations which produced these vibration*.
   The mechanical changes, or molecular vibrations in the wire, due
directly or indirectly to telephonic currents, which result in the
reproduction of sound, bear a close analogy to the mechanical changes
due to the direct transmission       of sound, but with this important
difference, that while   the vibrations   due to sound are progressive
along the wire, and their velocity is low and easily measured, those
due to thermal effects are practically instantaneous, and therefore affect
simultaneously the whole length of the wire.

currents were passed through    it,

    Graham Bell found, in 1874, that a simple helix without an iron core
emitted sounds, and (in 1876) that very distinct sounds proceed from

  II. " A Preliminary Account of          the Reduction of Observation
         on Strained Material, Leyden Jars, and Voltameters."               By
         John Perry and W. E. Ayrton. Communicated by Pro
        fessor G. G. Stokes, Sec. R.S.          Received April 17, 1880.
     It has been shown by Dr. Hopkinson that, if two Leyden jars be
  made    of the same glass, but of different thicknesses : —
     1st.  If  they be charged with the same difference of potential for
 equal times, discharged for equal times, and then insulated, that the
 residual charge will, after equal times, have in both cases the same
 difference of potential.
     2nd. That residual charge is proportional to exciting charge.
 These propositions may be included in one law — the superposition of
 simultaneous forces is applicable to the phenomena of residual charge.
 All the investigations in Dr. Hopkinson's paper in the " Transactions
of the Royal Society," vol. 167, part 2, serve tojprove this law, and, so
 far, they support the theory of residual charge, which we owe to the late
 Professor Clerk Maxwell. We should, therefore, be inclined to think
that one of the best methods of investigating the relation between the
relative powers of different glasses to possess residual charge would
be simply to charge jars made of these glasses for the same great
length of time, discharge for the same short intervals, and insulate,
measuring in each case the time increase of soaking out of the residual
charge.       Whatever the thickness of the glass or the amount of the
original charge, we know that the same glass will always give the
same proportion of residual charge at the same times from insulation.
Any change of the state of the glass caused by heat would be shown
as a change on the curve of increasing              residual charge.    There
seems to be no doubt that this method wonld give what may be called
a measure of the specific power of producing residual charge pheno
mena of the glass experimented on.
    In this way, since 1875, we have obtained a considerable number of

412              Profs. John Perry and W. E. Ayrton.               [May 27r
curves    for residual charge in condensers of different dielectrics at
different temperatures, and so we may say that we have measured the
power of producing residual charge phenomena in the substances
experimented upon in different states, and this power, which we call
our " residual-charge-function," ought, according to Dr. Hopkinson,
to be constant for the same substance at the same temperature.        Thus,
if vi is the residual charge at the time after insulation, and if V was
                                          t
the original long continued charge, »<-5-V is our residual-charge-
function for the time t, which we may designate by F*. Of course, it
is evident that if F't is our function for a different dielectric, then
F(H-F'/ is not necessarily the same as F*'H- F'<- ; in fact, the residual-
charge-function is only completely specified when a table is given of
its values at different times after insulation. We have used the same
name and symbol in the experiments we have been simultaneously
making during the last five years on strained wires and beams, and
on voltameters and magnets, and of course there is always the difficulty
experienced by Dr. Hopkinson with his more complicated function
"
  -tyt" which renders it necessary to give a table of values instead of
only one value of the function. Thus, for two particular kinds of
glass, Dr. Hopkinson finds —
                               fr(5)-B
                               y/(5)-B
whereas
                              Pm~~-B=-6'
showing how with the same two glasses the ratio is affected by varying
the time from 5 to GO. Again, also in his investigation of the influ
ence of temperature on residual charge in the same glass, he finds
that at 175° F. the values of           13 and          13 are respectively
0'38 and 0"034, with a ratio one to the other of 11   ; whereas the values
of  these  functions  at 108°  F. are 0'155 and  0-05   respectively with a
ratio one to the other of 3"1. This method of measurement is subject,
therefore, to exactly the same objections as the easier method of which
we have spoken ; in fact, we are not aware that hitherto any method
has shown itself to be better than actually giving the curves of rise of
potential after insulation, or the curves of change of current during
charge and discharge of a condenser.        This is the method which we
have found the easiest for the discussion of such phenomena, and we
may direct attention to such curves for voltameters in a paper com
municated     by us to the Society of Telegraph Engineers, and which
appeared in their Journal, vol. v, 1877, Nos. 15, 16, p. 391. Curve
EFGG' there shown, in fig. 4, p. 396, is especially interesting, as we
see  from it that if a voltameter with dilute sulphuric acid be charged

platinum plates of the voltameter through a resistance, and finally the

the plates gradually rises, presenting phenomena exactly like the
soaking out of the residual charge in a Leyden jar that has been in
sulated after being discharged for a short time.                        ,

where v is the difference of potentials of the two surfaces of the
condenser, and u the current flowing into or from the condenser at
the time t, for it is quite evident that if his theory be correct these
constants completely determine the residual charge phenomena of the
substance.    The difficulty in obtaining these constants has involved
us in a very large amount of labour, and we have only yet reduced a
small number of the curves we have experimentally obtained during
the last five years ; in addition we have found that many of our ex
periments will have to be repeated with somewhat different conditions
for the investigation to be regarded as complete. But some of the
results already obtained from this reduction are of interest.    Thus, in
one set of observations, we have tried to determine the constants from
curves of the soaking out of the residual charge of a Leyden jar dis
charged for a very short time, having been previously kept charged
for so long a time in a room of nearly constant temperature, that no
loss was observed during two or three days, that is, the jar may be
regarded as possessing almost infinite insulation.
   The Leyden jar employed for these experiments was that of a
Thomson's quadrant electrometer, and the measure of its charge was
determined from the deflection produced in the needle of the electro
meter itself when the electrodes of a Latimer Clark's constant cell
attached to the electrometer quadrants were reversed.         In reality
three such cells in succession were used in order to detect any irregu
larity in the cells themselves.   The Leyden jar was first rather highly
charged, and then left with the replenisher untouched for some days
until the loss of charge from day to day became imperceptible.       The
readings obtained with each of the three Clark's cells were then accu
rately taken, when one of them being left on the electrometer elec
trodes the Leyden jar was discharged for a very short time and then
insulated ; the soaking out of the residual charge was now measured
by taking time-readings of the increase of deflection produced by the
constant cell.     To allow for alteration of zero of the electrometer
arising from alterations of its charge frequent reversals of the cell

were taken.   After some minutes the right and left readings due to
the reversal of the cell could be observed on the ordinary scale placed
two metres away from the electrometer ; but at the commencement of
the insulation after discharge, the soaking out was far too rapid to
allow of numbers on the scale being read, consequently the following
device was employed to allow of our obtaining the early part of the
curve with accuracy.     In the slit of the lamp were two cross-wires,
an image of which by means of the mirror in the electrometer and of
an auxiliary lens was formed on a cylinder 13 centims. in diameter
and 100 centims. in length, revolved fairly rapidly by clockwork
around a horizontal axis. The comparatively rapid motion of the
image of the cross-wires was then accurately followed by an observer,
who with a pencil dotted its position from to time on a sheet of paper
wrapped round the revolving cylinder.        On unwrapping the paper
the dots made by the pencil enabled the curve of rise of potential to
be drawn accurately from the beginning in each case.

make the present paper too long to describe in full the slightly wavy
natnre of the actual curves connecting v and t obtained in our experi
ments.    That the variations are mainly due to slight fluctuations in
the temperature of the room is seen from our finding a diurnal period
in the waves.    Indeed, we have found that small       changes of tempe
rature very materially    affect all the phenomena    with  which we deal
in this paper. But there is something more in these small waves than
can be explained by changes of temperature, and possibly the solu
tion (2) of the differential equation may have some coefficients which
are sine and cosine functions of tbe time.        A study of the constants
on Professor Maxwell's theory ought      to tell whether

the solution of equation (1) when v is kept constant, from actual
observations of the current flowing into a condenser from a battery
with a constant electromotive force. The curve for u, just like the
curve described above, possesses a slight waviness, and when this is-
neglected its simple logarithmic nature subsequently          to a certain
period of time is very striking.
   In former papers read before this and other Societies we have given
our reasons for believing that the phenomena of polarisation in volta
meters, nnder the action of an electromotive force insufficient to pro
duce disruptive discharge in the liquid, that is rapid and visible
decomposition, are of exactly the same nature as the phenomena
exhibited by condensers having glass or other solid dielectrics.       And
we think that if our analogies fail for greater electromotive forces it is
because rupture of a solid dielectric introduces instantaneously entirely
different conditions.    An examination of the following reductions,
which   we give as  a sample of the observations of current flowing into
and out of a voltameter containing ordinary water and charged with
one Minotto's cell (which has an electromotive force less than will
produce visible decomposition), will show that there is a striking
adherence to the logarithmic law, and that we here add another
analogy to those we have already given between condensers with
liquid and with solid dielectrics.

    After the deflection had diminished from 690 to 195 in rather more
than three hours, the Minotto's cell was suddenly removed, and the
voltameter discharged      through the galvanometer, the terminals of
which at the same moment were reversed,         so that the deflections for
discharge should be on the same side as those for charging, in order
to somewhat diminish the swinging of the needle.
   The general differential equation (1) when applied to the discharge
carve thus obtained by experiment, leads to the solution—

   The reason why the exponentials                  in the equation connecting
currents and time when charging differ from those connecting
currents and time when discharging the voltameter, is as follows : —
K r is the resistance of the battery, galvanometer, connexions, 4c,
but excluding the resistance of the voltameter itself, then —
                                               r
where   V is the electromotive force of the battery, and v that of the
voltameter, at any time t during the charging —

which when substituted in the general differential equation, enable the
integration to be effected.            But during the discharge after the
removal of the battery, if r' is the resistance of the galvanometer, con
nexions, Ac, but excluding that of the voltameter itself, then —

Consequently the constants in the differential equation, and therefore
the exponentials in the equations of our curves, must be different.
   Guided by this, we have arranged in our later experiments that r

and   r' should be both very small,   so that the exponentials   in the equa
tions both of the charge and discharge curves should       be the same.
  When a beam or wire is suddenly bent or twisted, the forces pro
ducing the strain being maintained constant, it is known that the
strain increases with the time, and if the forces suddenly cease to act,
that the strain does not altogether disappear at once, but diminishes
gradually.     This strain w, we have found can, like differences of
potential and current, be most easily expressed as the sum of
certain exponentials of the time.       There are other analogies with
condensers.     Rapid  tremors given  to  a strained body, our experi
ments show, cause it to attain its ultimate state more rapidly ;
one example of this is the more rapid soaking out of the residual
charge in a Leyden jar, as noticed by Dr. Hopkinson; our curves
connecting w and t for strained beams, like those connecting v and
I in condensers, or u and t in voltameters, we find to be of a
slightly wavy nature, and to be all similarly affected by change of
temperature.     Like several other experimenters, we have found that
the strain in a body at any time depends not only on the forces acting
upon the body at that time, but also on all the forces which havo
acted on the body during all previous time ; so that, for instance, if
a beam fixed at the ends has been loaded negatively for some time,
if this load be removed and a positive load applied and soon taken off,
the beam may be found to have a negative deflection ; or again, if a
current be sent for some time through a voltameter in one direction,
and then reversed for some time, and finally the battery removed, the
discharge from the voltameter, through a galvanometer, will, in cer
tain cases, first be found opposite to the latter charging current, but
subsequently it will become nought, and then become the opposite of
the first charging current, this experiment being best seen with
electrolytes having a certain amount of rigidity. Similar phenomena
are also evidenced with iron under magnetisation, and Dr. Hopkinson's
experiments on Leyden jars also lead to similar results.
   We have consequently, while investigating the results we have
experimentally obtained during the last few years with strained sub
stances, been led to construct the following theory, which is analogous
with that of the late Professor Clerk Maxwell for Leyden jars.
  A  perfect fluid is such that the only stress which can exist at any
small interface which may be drawn in the fluid is a stress normal to
the interface, and hence if the fluid is contained between two parallel
planes which have a motion in their planes relatively to one another
there is no force required to cause this motion, or to maintain      in   it,
the case of a perfect fluid. If the fluid    a gas or a vapour, we can
                                              is
calculate the force which would be required to maintain  given relative

velocity of the plates, and our students have obtained experimentally
some materials (not yet published) for the calculation of such forces
when the fluid is water. If the fluid is tar, or a mixture of tar and pitch,
in any proportion, or even if it is the more solid substance pitch or
sealing-wax, we find that although the viscosity is almost infinitely
greater than in the case of water, still the phenomena exhibited are
exactly the same.       And just as experiments on water enable ns to exa
mine best some phenomena exhibited by viscous substances, so experi
ments on sealing-wax       enable us to make the best examination   of other
phenomena.
    When external forces suddenly act on a viscous fluid (and we know
that all substances, whether solid, liquid, or gaseous, come under the
head of " viscous fluids,"), tending to cause strains in the material, we
can calculate in the well-known way the strains and stresses.        If  the
forces do not alter, and if the shape of the body varies very little with
time, the stresses do not alter, but the strains increase according to
a law —
                                    v ds
                                    x=rw
where     X  is the stress at any interface, s the con-esponding strain,
 t the time, and     r a constant. Of this strain, if the part which was
suddenly produced, and which is suddenly removable, is /, then —
                                    X=lcf,
k being the coefficient usually given in books to connect the corre
 sponding stress and strain.
     During the increase of strain, mechanical   energy is being converted
 into heat, through the agency of internal friction or viscosity at the
 rate —
                                      •v ds
                                      Xdi
 per unit time.
     If the external forces are not kept constant, the stresses X alter,
 and also the strains ; the second relation given above remains the same,
  but the first becomes —
                                                  •
                                 x=4(.-/).
  Now the first and last relations constitute our hypothesis ; we have
  arrived at it by analogy, and not yet by experiment.       We know that
  for the motions of pendulums, &c, in air, this law holds, and as the
  velocity or — - is less and less, the law is found to be more and more
                dt
  true.   For the motion of steamships it is usual to assume the law —

where n varies from 2 to 2-28, but as motions in water become slower
and slower, n becomes more and more nearly equal to unity. In the
following investigation, we assume that the rates of deformation of the
materials, after the first instant, are so slow, that n always equals
unity.     Our hypothesis is exactly analogous with Ohm's law in
electricity  ;  and just as Ohm's law has only been proved for metallic
conductors of electricity, so our hypothesis is only known to be true
for gases and liquids.         All the analogies which we have observed
cannot be discussed in this short paper, but they are such that we are
led to believe that if our hypothesis proves to be untrue for materials
subjected to small strains, then Ohm's law will prove untrue for
currents of electricity in bad conductors.      It will be seen that it leads
to the conclusion that just as there are no perfect insulators of elec
tricity, so no material, however rigid it may appear to be to us, can for
an infinite time resist the effect of even small forces tending to change
its form.

the same as that we have employed in the analogous cases for Leyden
jars, voltameters, &c. The wavy nature of some of the curves we have
experimentally obtained connecting strain and time in strained beams,
indicates that perhaps the equation given above may have imaginary
roots, and that possibly there may be terms in our solutions of the

 jars has   been tested, and we   find the same kind of confirmation. For
 example, the following    is one  of the many experiments we tried : —
                                September,  1877.
    A    circular  glass rod 128 centims.          long, 0'832 centim. in
  diameter, rested on two knife edges 117 centims. apart, and was
  loaded with a weight of 400 grms. hung at its centre.              The de
 flections of the rod were observed by a ray of light coming from a
 rigidly fixed lamp, falling on a mirror rotated by the bending of the
 rod, and reflected on to a rigidly fixed vertical scale. To prevent
 errors arising from slight alterations of the position of the flame, it
 was always focussed so that the image of two cross- wires fixed in the
 lamp slit and formed by a fixed lens always occupied the same position,
 when not reflected by the mirror attached to the deflected rod, and it
 was the position of this image, after being reflected by this mirror,
 which was observed on the vertical scale. After the beam had been
 loaded for 145-55 hours, observations of the increasing deflection being
 taken all the time, the load was removed.        For several hours after the
 load had been removed, the actual observations themselves needed
 very little correction by drawing a curve, afterwards the slight wavi-
 ness of the true curve    due to changes of temperature had to be elimi
 nated.     In the several tables of observations of loaded and relieved
 beams (each experiment lasting two or three weeks), we have given
 the temperature of the room at the time of making the observation.
    By the method of reduction adopted, we find that during the recovery
of the rod from t equal 20, to t equal 240 (1=1"25 houre) the curve is
almost purely logarithmic, and we find by calculation that
                          w1=10-6 + 224-79«-<mn«J
and the column of values of (to~w{), in the following table shows that
this expression satisfies the observations, very accurately for a very
 long period, namely, 220 on our scale of time, or 275 hours. Taking
these numbers, we have calculated           the next term in the solution of
the differential equation, and find that
so that the last column of the table shows the inaccuracy         of the as
sumption —
                   w=10-6 + 22479<r0°1296< + 1387rOTUM,
an inaccuracy which is of very little importance from
                               f=2-4 to 4=240,
and even this inaccuracy we have found is to some extent due to the
fact that the temperature of the room was steadily falling at that time
from 26° C. to 21° C.

   There   cannot be mnch doubt of the fact, that electric induction
through dielectrics, and magnetisation of iron, are really phenomena of
stress and strain, and it is probable that the correctness of Ohm's law
when applied     to dielectrics is dependent on the theory of continued
strain, which we have just given, and which we are attempting to
prove.    In addition to experiments such as we have described, we
have been making others to find whether beams which are kept in a
state of strain rise in temperature through internal friction, which is
of course analogous with electric resistance, and in addition to see
whether    a soft steel magnet     acted upon by a constant current also
rises in temperature ; but hitherto these heating effects, if they exist,
have been too small for our instruments to detect.            In speaking of
beams we refer especially to glass beams ;    a beam  of  sealing-wax would
probably    under the   same   circumstances  perceptibly   rise in tempera
ture.
   As a further example of the reductions which we are describing in
this paper, we give a table of observed and calculated values of the
diminishing deflection of a glass fibre, which had been twisted for some
days, and then released.       The fibre was 85 centims. long, of a mean
diameter of 0 034 centim. suspended vertically, so that its upper end
could not turn in the support, and carrying a weight of 211-6 gnns.
Attached to this weight was a vane dipping into water to diminish the
rapidity of the swings.
   The untwisting of the vertical glass wire was observed by the re
flection of a ray of light, coming from a fixed lamp, by a mirror rigidly
attached to the wire at its lower extremity.        The spot of light, or
rather the image of the cross-wires in the lamp slit, moved over a
horizontal semicircular scale graduated in millimetres, and one metre
in radius, with the mirror turning at its centre.          An arrangement
similar to that employed in our deflected beam experiments was used
to obviate errors arising from difference of position of the flame of the
lamp on different days.
    The mirror and the weight having been kept twisted through a
right angle for about a week, the deflecting couple was suddenly re
moved, and time readings of the diminishing deflections taken.         As at
first the deflection diminished with considerable rapidity, and as in
addition the spot of light described a series of oscillations about the
varying mean position, the system of registration we employed was as
follows : — The position of the spot of light on the scale at the end of
every swing was observed as accurately as possible, and the time re
corded by simultaneously pressing down the key of a " break circuit
chronograph."      From these successive time observations of the swings

about a varying mean position, the true curve was drawn in accordance
with a method mathematically developed by us.*
   The reduction of this curve by the method previously explained
leads to the equation
                             w1=72-8 +     35-55€-oo569<)
where    itj is the deflection, and t the time from the moment of remov
ing the deflecting couple, the unit of t being 20 seconds. Several of
the earlier observations have been omitted in the following table, as it
is not until after 40 seconds that the above equation represents ac
curately the torsional strain.          From this time, however, until the end
of the experiment, the equation is very accurate.

   As  a further example of the reduction    hy our method of the results
of observation, we give five tables of experiments made with a special
form of voltameter devised so as to enable experiments to be made
with a gas-freed liquid, or a liquid more or less saturated with any
particular gas, and with the platinum plates previously free from gas,
or made to occlude any special gas.     The voltameter itself was some
thing like the upper part of a Geissler's mercury pump ; that is, by
lowering a column of mercury the electrolyte could be lowered from
the platinum plates, leaving them in a vacuous space.       The electrolyte
of course commenced to boil, and to rapidly free itself from gas. By
a valve this gas was allowed to escape, on again raising the mercury
column, and the liquid above it. This operation being repeated a
number of times, the liquid being left for a considerable period under
the vacuous space towards the end of the operation, a large portion of
the gas in the liquid could be removed.         In order to remove the gas
occluded in the platinums they were not, as is usual in voltameters,
made in the form of plates, but each was a platinum spiral, the two
ends of which protruded to the outside of the voltameter.        By means
of a small Grove's battery, each of these spirals could be made red hot
in the vacuous space produced when the electrolyte was lowered, anil
thus a voltameter was obtained with gas-freed platinums in a gas-
freed liquid, or by subsequently bubbling through a stream of a par
ticular gas, with platinums in a liquid, with more or less at will of
that gas occluded.
   As these platinum spirals presented but a small surface, and as they
were necessarily some little distance apart, the currents charging and
discharging such a voltameter, when only one Minotto's cell was em
ployed, were rather small, so that it was necessary to employ a fairly
delicate reflecting galvanometer.    From the first elongation of the
spot of light on charging or discharging the voltameter, we could
calculate the time integral of the current in the first half swing of the
needle, and the subsequent time readings of the diminishing deflection
were ascertained by an experienced observer, dotting with a pencil on
the horizontal cylinder revolving uniformly (referred to at .the com
mencement of the paper) the limits of the excursions of the spot of
light in the successive swings about the varying mean position, the
locus of which was subsequently drawn in by our method already
referred to.
   In  the following table  w is the observed current flowing into the
voltameter to charge it at the time t, from the moment of applying one
Minotto's cell ; the voltameter contained distilled water well freed
from gas, and the platinum spirals were kept red hot for some time in
the vacuous space, before immersion in the liquid.      The solution of the
general differential equation leads to

which from the following table, it will be seen accurately represents the
 charging current from t equal 7 to t equal 25. After the current had
 flowed into the voltameter for 1 hour and 7\ minutes, the cell was re
moved, and the voltameter discharged through the galvanometer, the
 connexions of which were simultaneously               reversed, so that the dis
charge      deflection might   be   on the same    side  as the charge deflection,
and therefore less swinging about of the needle produced at the moment
of discharge. In the second of the following tables u is the discharge
current at a time t from the commencement of the discharge, and u' is
calculated from the equation
                                 u'=30-90e-°-05s8',
which accurately represents the discharge current from t equal 5 to t
equal 25. The two exponents in the solutions of the differential equation
for the current flowing in during charge, and the current flowing out
during discharge, are
                            -0-06245* and -0-0553*,
which, considering that the resistance of the galvanometer, battery,
and connexions could not be neglected in comparison with that of the
voltameter itself, are remarkably nearly equal to one another, being
both — Q'QQt to two places of decimals.
    When it was desired to measure the time integral of the discharge
current during the first half swing of the galvanometer needle, rather
than the deflections, a short time after the commencement of the dis
charge the galvanometer was short circuited for a sufficient length of
time before the Minotto's cell was removed for the needle to come to
rest at zero.

   These equations, as has been seen, give with considerable accuracy
the actual value of the current flowing into the voltameter at any
moment during the greater period of the charging in the different
cases.   The difference between the curves of charge in the different
cases is partly due to the different state of the distilled water and the
platinums, and partly to the level of the mercury on which the water
rested being slightly different in the different cases.     To remove the
possibility of this  latter cause of  variation in the curves, the construc
tion of the voltameter was altered, so that the level of the mercury
under the water was always so far away from the bottom of the plati
num spirals, that any slight alteration in the level did not at all affect
the curve of charging, or discharging.        We refrain, however, in this
preliminary note    from   giving any  of the reductions of the curves we
have experimentally obtained with this improved form of voltameter.
   We may remark that the methods usually taken for measuring the
resistance of liquids are quite misleading if there is any analogy be
tween voltameters and condensers with solid dielectrics. For instance,
on our assumption, the constant terms in the above expressions for a,
measuring, as they do, the current after a great time has elapsed,
really represent the ratio of the electromotive force of the battery to
the total resistance of the voltameter and connexions, and therefore
their reciprocals are measures of the several resistances. We need
hardly mention that in ordinary experiments the current is measured
for as short a time as possible, " to avoid polarisation, as it is said."
For small values of the time the current flowing into a volta
meter, or liquid condenser, is very great, and in our opinion may be
regarded as nearly infinitely great ; for the first rapid rush of elec
tricity is due to charging the voltameter as a condenser is charged ;
and if this rush is not quite instantaneous, it is because the electro
motive force charging the voltameter does not immediately reach its
constant value.    But just as the potential of the end of a cable sud
denly attached to a battery will acquire its maximum value more and
more rapidly as the resistance of the battery and connexions is made
less and less, so by making the resistance of our single element used
to charge the voltameter less and less, and by measuring the time
integral of the current flowing in for shorter and shorter periods of time,
that    by using galvanometer needles of more and more quickness of
         is,
vibration,    better and better approximation to the static capacity of
               a                                                           a
voltameter      arrived at. And we found that when we had reduced
               is
the resistance of our single cell to O04 of an ohm, by using in this
single cell a zinc plate having 15 square feet in area, the more and
more carefully we made the experiments, the more and more nearly
did the first discharge of a voltameter, which    always less than the
                                                    is

is because the true conduction current is so much greater propor
tionally in water than in glass. In certain experiments, which we
hope to have the honour of describing fully in a future paper, we have
been able to make an approximation to the time integral of this con
duction current during the small times of first charge and discharge,
and by subtracting it from the measured charge, or adding it to the
measured discharge, we have obtained what we may reasonably call
the true induction charge in a voltameter. "We mention this now since,
although years ago Mr. Cromwell Varley referred to the electrostatic
capacity of voltameters, the investigation of this instantaneous charge
has been neglected, because this charge is small compared with the
residual one, just as the important investigation of the residual
charge in Leyden jars was for a long time not carried out, because
the residual charge was small compared with the instantaneons

III. " On    the Structure and Development            of the Skull in the

                                 (Abstract.)
    Some of the work brought forward in this paper was in hand before
the first part was in print.    That initial piece of work dealt only with
the formation of the skull in the common frog, but it was followed by
                                                                  "
another which appeared in the " Philosophical Transactions in 1876,
                                                                     "
which treated of the skulls of the common and of the " aglossal        toads.
   Of the latter types only two kinds are known, viz., the nailed toad
of the Cape (Dactylethra), and the monstrous toad of Surinam (Pipa).
All the bulk of the Batrachia are included in the sub-group " Opis-
thoglossa," these have a tongue, and in most cases it is free hehind and
not in front ; the " Proteroglossal
                                      " Batrachia are
                                                        very few in number,
and the character itself (as Dr. Giinther informs me) is not well
pronounced.
   I  have now worked out the skull, in one or more stages, in about a
tithe of the known species, and in my second paper in both of the
aberrant   (" aglossal ") types ; in them this was done in various stages.
   I  am not aware that there is any
                                            " order " of any " class " in the
Vertebrata where so large a percentage of species has been, or indeed,

 need be,  worked out, either in the skull or in any other part of their
 organisation.
    That which calls for it here is the great and unlooked-for poly
 morphism of the species ;    I may explain this by saying that the skull,
 in really important modifications, differs more in the species of some
 of the genera than it does in the orders of some of the classes.     As an
 instance, it would be no easy thing to find a malacopterous fish differing
 from an acanthopterous type, in deep-seated essential matters, so much
 as the common toad does from the other native species, viz., the Natter
jack; and the common frog has only about half as many cranial
 elements as the bull-frog of North America.
    If the metamorphosis of a single species be worked out exhaustively,
 it gives a raDge of structural characters which rises up from a larval
 creature on the level of the lamprey, to a reptilian form, not far
 below the Chelonia,   and evidently related (obliquely, not genetically)
 to  that " order."
    Moreover, whilst the " opisthoglossa
                                             " have larvas with suctorial
 mouths, and a guasi-petromyzine structure altogether, the larvas of the
 " aglossa " need only to be arrested as larvae, and to acquire a dense
 bony armature to be very close counterparts of the most bizarre forms
 of the ganoids of the    "old red sandstone," such    as Pterichthys and
 Coccosteus.
    The Batrachia show some remarkable things in their metamorphosis,
 both as to the size their larvas obtain, and the time during which
metamorphosis is taking place.
    In the bull-frog (Rana pipiens) the larvas attain the length of about
 5 inches, and take two or three years for their transformation ; they
may be hindered in this, and be made to take twice that time.             In
these the larvas bear a moderate relation, as to size, to the adult
form, which may be 7 inches long, although tail-less.
    But in a frog from the neotropical region (Pseudis) scarcely larger
than our native form, the tadpole attains the length of nearly a foot,
the tail acquiring a breadth of 4 inches.
    As zoologists well know, it is easy to procure tadpoles of this species,
but very hard to get an adult.      I  am of opinion that the adult con
dition is not attained until after many years ; and it suggests itself to
me that this species may be the not remote descendant of a type which
did not finish its anural metamorphosis.
    On the other hand, some of the neotropical forms have very small
tadpoles.    Bufo chilensis, a large toad, has them about half the size of
those of our common native Batrachia, and the newly-metamorphosed
individuals are no larger than a house-fly.

     These tadpoles, which never see the light as such, have wide months
(not suctorial), and so also have the tadpoles of the other waif of the
sub-order " Aglossa," viz., Dactylethra. In that kind, however, the
larvae     become large, and are a long while undergoing their transfor
mations, which take place in the water, according to rule.
     In the skull of the adults much variation is evidently due to the
 different size to which the species attains ; some, as the bull-frog, are as
 large as the common Greek tortoise, others grow scarcely larger than
 a bluebottle fly. As a rule, these small kinds show two kinds of modi
 fication — they are apt to retain certain larval characters, and they are
 apt to acquire generalized characters, such as do not normally appear
 in this group, which is very remarkable for the fewness of the parts or
 elements composing the adult skull.
      Some of the large forms, as Bana pipiens, have many investing
 bones in their skull, such as must be looked for again in archaic and
  extinct types, whilst others, as Oeratophrys and Calyptocephalus, have
                         that is dense, extended, and almost " ganoid ;
                                                                               "

  this kind of skull, however, is found in middle-sized types also, as in
  Pdobates and Nototrema.
      In  the terminal suctorial mouth   of the larva of the Opisthoglossa,
  the mandibular pier, and its free " ramus " are carried to the front of
  the head. After transformation, in the larger kinds, the gape is
  carried behind the head, as in the crocodile ; it can be' guessed how
  much modification such a change as this will necessitate.
      But it is evident that   a low suctorial  fish, such as the tadpole    is,
  must have altogether a totally different kind of skull and skeleton to
  that of an active, noisy, intelligent, more or less terrestrial reptile, such
  as the frog becomes.
      This necessarily great change involves some very curious and
  instructive anachronisms, so to speak, in the appearance of various
  parts and organs.
      A low suctorial fish would have no fenestra ovalis nor stapes, and in
  the tadpole it is some time before these appear.
       The low (urodelous) Amphibia have, in most cases, the upper
  hyoid element suppressed, sometimes it is present, serving as a rudi
  mentary " columella auris."
       In most Batrachia this part does not appear until after transforma
  tion, and in some kinds not at all. This part especially shows how
  the individual is gradually changed, and makes it clear why so many
  variations should occur in genera and even species.

   gically, taking in the results of my earlier observations, already pub
   lished in the " Philosophical Transactions."

 less,  I am able, after many years of labour, to give an account of
 the adult skull in seventy kinds, and of the larval — in one or several
stages — in a good number of the species.
    The illustrations are, for the most part, put in    a similar manner in
all the plates ; and, as to size, I have not made the skulls of the dwarf
kinds much less than those of the large types.
    I  am satisfied that these figures and descriptions       will be found
useful,    not merely for comparison of the types of larval and adult

light upon, and in turn be illuminated by, all that we can learn of
the structure    and development     of the skull in the other types     of

    With regard   to the geographical  distribution of the Batrachia, tbere
are many things of importance        which   I  have rather hinted at than
expressed in this paper.
    There is a sort of fades or character about the allied types of any
great geographical      region which makes me satisfied that certain
external characters repeat themselves again and again in different
parts of the world.
    Thus, the types of frogs that have dilated toes are evidently more
nearly related to those with pointed toes of the same region than
they are even to the broad-toed types of some distant region.
    I should be inclined to derive the narrow-backed tree frogs of
Australia from the sharp-toed fiogs of the same region ; the same with
those of India, and the same with those of the nearctic and neo
tropical territories.
    The true frogs (" Ranidro") of India have many things in common,
as also have the true frogs of North America ; the same may be said of
the sub-typical frogs, or " Cystignathidee."
    On the whole, the European and Indian territories yield the highest
kinds ; Australia and South America the lowest and most generalized.
IV. " On      the Relation of the Urea to the Total Nitrogen of the
        Urine in Disease.       No. I."     By W.     J.  Russell, Ph.D.,
       F.R.S., and Samuel West, M.B. Oxon. Received May 6,
        1880.
    In the valuable series of papers upon the excretion of urea, com
municated by Professor Parkes to the Royal Society, he showed that
in health 90 per cent, of the nitrogen in the urine, was eliminated in
the form of urea.      It seemed to us of considerable interest and im
portance to ascertain whether in disease this statement still held good,
or whether, as indeed seemed probable, under altered conditions,

nitrogen might not be excreted in some other form.             With the view
of determining    this  point, the following  experiments    were undertaken.
    The cases upon which the observations were made fall into two
groups — the first, a series taken at random from the hospital, the
patients suffering from various diseases, and being under various con
ditions as regarded diet, muscular exertion, &c. In the second series,
the patients were healthy, and placed under conditions as far as
possible constant, the amount of diet being fixed, and the patients at
                             '
absolute rest.
    The quantitative estimations were made in the following way. The
nitrogen in the urea was determined by the process which we have
previously described,* in which the urea is decomposed by sodic hypo-
bromite, and the volnme of nitrogen evolved is measured.               At first,
the total nitrogen   was   determined   by the   soda-lime   process, but find
ing that in some cases this method was untrustworthy, we abandoned
it, and in all the following experiments the total nitrogen was esti
mated by burning the residue with oxide of copper, and measuring
over water the volume of nitrogen obtained.             This volume was of
course afterwards corrected for temperature and pressure.
     In most cases, 5 cub. centims. of the urine was used. This was
very slightly acidulated by adding a small crystal of pure oxalic acid,
and evaporated as rapidly as possible in a small basin on a water-bath,
nearly to dryness. The residue was thoroughly incorporated with
oxide of copper, introduced into a combustion tube, and the basin
thoroughly cleaned with fresh portions of oxide.
     In order to ascertain whether any loss of ammonia occurred during
 the evaporation, control experiments were made by adding, without
 previous evaporation, a second sample of 5 cub. centims. of the urine
to oxide of copper already in a combustion tube, and proceeding
 with the combustion slowly, but in the ordinary way.                The same
 amount of nitrogen was obtained by both processes.
     Although the determination of the nitrogen was the special object of
 our research, we thought it well in each case to complete the analysis
 by determining the amount of solid matter in solution, and from it
 approximately the amount of organic and inorganic matter, as well aa
 the amount of chlorine, and the specific gravity.
      To determine the solid matter in solution, 5 cub. centims. of the
 filtered urine was evaporated to dryness in a small light platinum dish,
 and heated to 110— 120°, till the weight remained constant.                The
 residue varied very much in appearance, sometimes it was hard and
 granular, at others remaining in a sticky condition.
      The residue was heated to dull redness over a lamp, and what
 remained we have called inorganic residue. It was found in some
 cases impossible to completely burn away all carbonaceous matter

                                                                2  i 2

without raising the temperature to such a point that chloride of
sodium would be volatilised.           The weight, however, of carbon remain
ing in these cases was exceedingly small.              The amount of chlorine in
the urine was ascertained by dissolving this residue in water, and
adding a standard solution of silver nitrate.
    Obviously, these latter determinations are not of the same degree of
accuracy as are those of the nitrogen.             Still they strikingly point out
the variations in the composition of these urines, and give important
comparable results.
   The first series (Table I), consisting of twenty-three observations,
falls -into several small groups.         The relation of the urea-nitrogen to
the total nitrogen was, in all cases, calculated out in percentage
amounts (the total nitrogen being taken as 100), and the mean of
each group of observations given.
    The first group (Table       II)  consists of six cases of pneumonia, and
in these the urea-nitrogen represents 90 per cent, of the total nitrogen.*
   The second, of two cases of jaundice, with two determinations in
each. The mean of the first giving 85" 7 per cent. ; of the second, 90-2
per cent.
   The third, of two       cases  of albuminuria, in which the mean is 86 per
cent.     In these observations, the albumen was previously precipitated
and removed. In a third case the determination was made without pre
viously removing the albumen. In this latter, the percentage was 6o-6.
   The fourth group consists of a collection of cases of various kinds.
One of pyaemia, one of typhoid fever, rheumatic fever, acute dysentery,
pleurisy, hepatic abscess, and leucocythsemia, two of erysipelas, and
two of diabetes, making eleven in all.            The mean percentage of them
all is 93 8.
   The lowest percentage in this first series is found in the cases of
albuminuria, and of jaundice, a fact of interest as bearing upon the
place of production of urea.
   The second series consists of eighteen determinations made upon
three cases, in which the diet was fixed, and the patient in a condition
of absolute rest (cf. Table III).
   These give a mean of 90-l per cent.              The mean of all the cases in
the two series is 89'3, or, if the cases of albuminuria and jaundice be
excluded, 91 -3 per cent., and this agrees almost exactly with the
results of Professor Parkes' experiments, in which the mean arrived
at is 91 per cent.
   If a calculation       be made from the tables given in books of the
amounts of the urinary constituents in a normal urine, the urea is found
to represent about 96 per cent, of the total nitrogen, or if allowance

   These figures are taken from the tables (Table          given in theIII)
second series of cases, and the variations are not due to altered con
ditions, for the patients were all at absolute rest, and upon a constant
diet. If, then, such variations occur when the conditions are constant,
they will certainly be not less where the conditions vary.*
   Such variations render     necessary to be specially cautious in draw
                                      it
ing conclusions from the results of a few experiments, and may explain
the great difference in the observations of different investigators.
   Besides the nitrogen, we determined, as we have already stated, the
solid residue, the ash, and the chlorine. Of the chlorine, little can be
said. Its variations are inexplicable, for although they in part depend
upon the amount of chlorine ingested in the food, they seem subject to
other influences which we do not at present comprehend.
   The same may be said of the solid residue, and of the ash, and we
can do little more than point to the great and irregular variations in
the amount of each, which the tables show.

may therefore be safely regarded as the measure of the total nitrogen,

   Note. — An exception to this, of course, is found in the rare cases of
acute yellow atrophy of the liver, but even in these cases it is doubtful
whether the replacement of the urea by leucin and tyrosin is a con
stant phenomenon.          In one case,* which clinically presented the
features of acute atrophy of the liver, and in which, post mortem, the
liver was found in the condition of acute fatty atrophy, the area was
still normally formed, leucin and tyrosin being absent.

non-nitrogenous food. The second by reducing the ordinary diet to
the lowest possible limit compatible with health.              To the first objec
tion may be      made   that   the experiments      are  violent, and cannot be
long maintained, and that they subject the body to most abnormal con
ditions.    Such violence to the ordinary chemistry of the body produces
its evidence in the excretions.       The nitrogen in the urine under these
circumstances varying       even   more   irregularly and widely than under
normal    conditions, and the short possible duration of the experiments
rendering the conclusions drawn, from the small number of observations,
unsatisfactory.
   From all these objections the second course of investigation is free,
no violence is done to the body, and the observations may be prolonged

ad   libitum.      And here two courses are open, both of which lead in the
same direction,         though starting from opposite sides. The one which
consists   in   taking, as Playf'air and Edward Smith have done, the
minimum diets upon which life has been sustained, and estimating in
them the amount of nitrogen present.                  The other in reducing the diet
to the lowest possible limit until physiological equilibrium is estab
lished, and then estimating in the urine the amount of nitrogen ex
creted.     It is this latter course which we have followed.
    The three cases we have examined were patients suffering from the
same affection, viz., aneurism, a disease which produces mechanical
rather than constitutional symptoms, and in these cases, so long as the
treatment was carried on, produced no symptoms at all, so that for
all practical purposes the patients may be regarded as healthy men.
They were all placed under the conditions of the most absolute rest,
not being allowed to sit up in bed, or even indeed to feed themselves.
Their diet was then reduced till it was found that the health was
suffering, and then increased until a condition was reached, which may
be called one of
                        " clinical equilibrium," when the health so far as could
 be determined clinically was perfect.
   The condition of clinical equilibrium being reached, the amount of
nitrogen in the food was determined by direct analysis.
   In two of the cases the diet consisted of ten ounces of solids and
ten ounces of liquids, distributed as follows : —
       Meat   . .. .               4 ozs.             Water                 4 ozs.
       Bread   . . .           •    3  „              Wine                  3  „
       Potatoes     .                                 Tea,                  3  „
       Butter.    . .
                                  10 ozs.                                 10 ozs.
    By calculation          from Partes'       tables, this should yield 6"3 grms.
of nitrogen.          Analysis    gave a somewhat higher number : in the first
determination 7-07, and            in the second 6'95. Cf. Tables IV and V.
    In the third case the          diet was 8 ozs. of solids and 8 ozs. of liquids,
 distributed in the same          proportion.      This by calculation from the pre
 ceding analysis should give about 5'6 grms. of nitrogen.
    The analysis of the urine was made in the way described in the pre
 ceding paper.          The tables give the result of 17 determinations.
    Comparing now the amount of nitrogen ingested in the food, with
 the amount obtained from the urine, we find (Table V) : —
                                          Nitrogen ingested.      Nitrogen in urine.

   In all the    cases the amount       in the urine is in slight excess of that
in the food,      so  that we may fairly regard all the nitrogen here ob
tained as representing tissue waste, for there was no surplus in the
food to increase the amount in the nrine.
   We obtain      as the mean      of these three  cases   _- = 7"87,

mately 8 grms., which we therefore are justified in regarding as
the minimum amount of nitrogen a healthy adult man excretes per
diem. This is equivalent to 17 grms., or 260 grains of urea.
   The weights of the patients could not of course be determined, but
the first two weighed it is supposed about 140 lbs., the third about
130 lbs., at the time of the observations, which was in each case
after the dieting had lasted already three or four weeks, the total
durations of the treatment being about ten weeks.
   It is interesting to compare with these observations the results ob
tained by the other methods of the investigation above Teferred to.
    *I. Ranke repeated upon man the experiments which Bischoff and
Voit had conducted upon the dog, and among them are two series of
observations which illustrate the subject at present under considera
tion.
    In  the first no food at all was given, and the patients were kept at
rest.
    In one case 8 grms. of nitrogen were passed, in a second 10, and
in a third 8'6. In a fourth case the amount was as low as 6f. And
in another series of observations upon himself, Ranke found the amount
passed in two starvation days to be 8 and 8'6 grms.
    Nicholson made three estimations in the case of starving prisoners,
and found as the mean of three days 8"6 grmsj.
    Many other observers have noticed the rapid fall in the amount of
nitrogen excreted during starvation.

    But the short duration of these experiments makes it probable that
the minimum was not reached.
    We have then 8 grms. as the mean of the only reliable determi
nation at our command of the nitrogen excreted in the urine during
 starvation.

   II.  Upon a strictly non-nitrogenous          diet the observations   are not
numerous      : —
                             Ranke found    8 grms.,*
                           and Von Franque     7' 5 grms.
   TIL Professor Playfair attacked the question from another side,
by collecting from various sources the minimum diets upon which
man could live, and to which he gave the name of subsistence diets,
and by calculation the amount of nitrogen contained in them.                 This
method gave him as a mean 9'2 grms., but his patients were none
of them at absolute rest, but were performing during the day a certain
amount of work.f Edward Smith in the same way by calculation
from the diets of the spinners during the cotton famine found a some
                                                      J
what larger amount of nitrogen (12 grms.), which agrees with the
amount of nitrogen contained in Playfair's second class of small diets,
but in all these cases the effect of muscular exertion is not eliminated.
   IV. Unruh gives a series of three observations upon hospital patients
kept at rest, and placed upon a restricted diet. Unfortunately he
gives little description of the diet, except that it was fever diet, and
consisted of beef-tea or broth, with an egg or two.
   In the first, a case of cancerous obstruction, the amount of nitrogen
was 8 grms. (17-5urea).           But this case is not altogether satisfactory
from the amount of wasting accompanying this disease.
   The other two were cases of syphilis placed upon fever diet, and
kept at rest for the sake of the experiments ; the first passed 8"6
grms. (18"6 urea), the second 7-5 grms. (16'2 urea).
   The mean of these three        cases is 8 grms. (17'5 urea).
   The general results of the various series of observations             may be
roughly tabulated thus : —
   I. Starvation. 8 grms.
   II. Non-nitrogenous food. 8 grms.
   III.   Subsistence diet.     9  grms.
   IV.   Insufficient diet.     8 grms.
   V. Clinical equilibrium.         8 grms.
   A remarkable coincidence, considering the variety of the methods
employed, and the different conditions under which the determinations
were made.
   We may therefore conclude that the minimum               amonnt of nitrogen
excreted by a healthy adult man is on the average 8 grms. in the 24
hours, this being equivalent to. 17'5 grms., or to 260 grains of urea.

       1880.
    In a preliminary notice, which the Royal Society has done me the
honour of publishing in the " Proceedings," I gave a very ohort
sketch of the work I have done which led me to a reaction whereby
hard crystalline carbon has been produced.         I have now the honour of
laying a detailed account of the methods and results before the Society.
As far back as September, 1879, I was searching for a solvent for the
alkali metals, and tried experiments with many liquids and gases, but
invariably found that when the solvent reached the permanently
gaseous state chemical action ensued. This was the case even with
hydrocarbons, the metal combining with the hydrogen and setting free
the carbon.      Paraffin spirit, boiling at 75°, was first used in experi
menting, and the spirit contained a considerable amount of olefines ;
but even these unsaturated hydrocarbons seemed to be split up in like
 manner.     The experiments were conducted in thick tubes from 1 to
 1*5 millims. internal, and 10 to 15 external, diameter, and made of
 hard glass.    In some cases when the carbon was set free, a consider
 able proportion of the hydrogen seemed to have combined with the
 higher olefines and paraffins, rendering them gaseous, most of the gas,
 however, being formed by the reaction discovered by Thorpe and
 Young, where     a high paraffin splits up into lower olefines and paraffins.
 This reaction,   I would remark in passing, is not always the only one to
 take place, as a mixture of lower paraffins and olefines on being heated
 under very high pressure sometimes yield a small quantity of a higher
 or even nearly solid paraffin, as well as gaseous products.      An attempt
 was made to obtain solid paraffin in quantity by this method, but only
 traces were obtained white enough for use.
     The alkali metal which decomposes the hydrocarbon retains a quan
 tity of pure hydrogen, which may be seen by exhausting it by the
 Sprengel pump.        A piece of sodium was exhausted in the molten
 state l'or  five hours by the Sprengel pump, and when no more
 hydrogen had been evolved for an hour, a piece was placed in a tube
 with paraffin spirit and heated for two hours, and when a considerable
 quantity of carbon was deposited, as much of it was removed as could
 be   conveniently obtained and again exhausted, when 32 times its
 volume of hydrogen was extracted from it.          This was repeated several
 times, and quantities of hydrogen, varying from 17 to 25 times the
 volume of the sodium, obtained.        The carbon deposited on the tube is
 of a hard scaly nature, and when the sodium is slowly oxidized and

dissolved in water, some very hard scales of carbon are often obtained.
This was then the reaction on which my work was built. As potassium
is a metal of stronger affinities,      I thought that an examination of its
action on paraffin would yield somewhat better results, but in this             I
was disappointed.     Sometimes its action was very great, but it seemed
to combine with some of the substance in the tube, and formed black
compounds,     having no hard carbon amongst them. Some of the
experiments did yield a little, but on the whole it was not so good as
sodium. Lithium was next tried and yielded results which were much
more hopeful.      When the same paraffin spirit was used the lithium
floated on it, but by melting the metal in the bottom of the tube it
adhered to the sides, and did not float to the top unless any portion
became detached.        The appearance shown by lithium is sometimes
very   beautiful,  a small    globule of the metal when it has liquefied
showing, before it begins to act energetically upon the hydrocarbon, a
very beautiful play of colours.          After this has gone on for a little a
more rapid reaction sets in as the temperature rises, and carbon is
deposited somewhat more plentifully.            Sometimes a piece of the metal
will float until it becomes coated with carbon and it then sinks. The
carbon so obtained is harder than when sodium is employed, and will
often scratch glass easily.         I  thought that if     I could by increased
temperature dissolve the nascent carbon in the metal I might obtain
diamond ; but after very many trials           I did not succeed in doing so.
Many of my scientific friends who had witnessed my experiments
thought that a gaseous solvent for carbon might be found, and as this
was the direction of my general work,              I abandoned these metallic
experiments and went into a more direct examination of the question
of gaseous solution. As by far the greater number of substances with
which we are acquainted are found by the intervention of water and
are only soluble in water,     I  thought that an examination of the solvent
effects of water under different circumstances would be likely to yield
important results.     I found   that hard glass tubes resisted the action of
water after it had passed its critical point for a time sufficiently long
to enable an observer to see whether any great change had taken place
in the solution contained in the tube. By these means it was found
that many chlorides, sulphates, and nitrates were as soluble in water-
gas as in water, if not more so, and that at least no sudden change of
solubility was observable at the critical point.             By such a process,
however, only qualitative results could be obtained, and a series of
experiments was tried, using various volumes of water with a fixed
proportion of silica in iron tubes, and the solvent power of the water
estimated in a more accurate manner.             An account of this work will,
I hope, be laid before     the   Society shortly ; in fact, as soon as I have
the necessary time for completing the work and writing it up.                The
general   result  obtained   from     these  experiments    was that the solvent

power of water was found to be determined by two conditions :
1st. Temperature or molecular vis viva; and 2nd. Closeness of the
molecules on pressure, which seems to give penetrative power.           From
these observations it will be seen that if a body has any solvent action
on another and does not act upon it chemically, such solvent action
may be indefinitely increased by indefinitely increasing the        tempera
ture and pressure of the solvent. In nature, the temperature         has been
at one time higher than we can obtain artificially, and the          pressure
obtained by a depth of 200 miles from the surface is greater        than can
be supported by any      of the materials  from  which  we  can form  vessels.
It will thus be seen that, whereas in natnre almost unlimited solvent
 power could be obtained, we are not as yet able to reproduce these
 conditions artificially.    Could pressure alone increase solvent power
 then much might be done, but pressure only acts by keeping the mole
 cules close together when they have great vis viva, and this latter is
 only obtained by high temperature.
      As glass tubes were quite out of the question when a red heat and very
 high pressure were required, iron tubes were resorted to, and a series
 of attempts made to dissolve carbon by various gaseous solvents. The
 difliculty of closing iron tubes as compared with glass tubes caused me
  to try various methods, which I shall describe here. Tubes were made
 of strong hydraulic tubing, 20" long, 1" thick, and            bore.   These
  were fitted with a plug, screwed with a strong screw fitting very well.
  There was placed in the tube some powdered charcoal from which all
  the inorganic matter had been removed by immersion in hydrochloric
  and hydrofluoric acids and washing with water, and then sufficient
  paraffin spirit to fill the tube two-thirds of its volume.        The plug
  was screwed in with a lute composed of silicate of soda and man
  ganese dioxide, but after heating the tube in a reverberatory fur
  nace for four hours it was found to be impossible to remove the plug,
   so the end had to be bored out.      There was neither liquid nor gas in
   the tube, the luting having leaked.      Another tube similarly filled was
   fitted with a plug with a copper washer, the end of the tube, plug,
   and washer being polished, but this also leaked and no result was
   arrived at. Baryta, clay, asbestos, and other substances, wet with sili
   cate of soda, were all tried with the same result — leakage.        A silver
   washer kept comparatively tight, but only on one occasion.           It was
   thus seen that screw-closing would give no reliable results, so another
    method was tried.    A ball of iron, fitting the tube tightly, was placed
    in it after the materials had been introduced.       The end of the tube
    was then narrowed by compression between rollers and turned smooth
    inside. The iron ball was then drawn up by a wire attached and luted
    by silicate of soda and fine manganese dioxide.      It was expected that
    the pressure would only serve to make the closing more secure, but, on
    heating, the iron yielded and the ball was driven out with a loud

explosion.    After trying several other methods of closing — outside
screwing and filling the mouth with molten metal on the top of a clay
                                    I
plug being amongst them — came to the conclusion that nothing
would suffice but welding up the open end. This has been, when
carried out efficiently, invariably successful, and in all my later experi
ments   I have used it alone. It requires great skill on the part of the
workman, and it is only one man in a hundred who can perform the
operation with invariable success. The furnace used in these experi
ments was a reverberatory one, 6 feet long (internal measurement) and
 2 feet broad  ; fire-place,    15 inches ; bridge,    9 inches     ; hearth, 4 feet.
 The roof sloped down towards the flue and          the spent gases had exit at
 the level of the hearth, thus carrying the          flame down as it receded
from the fire, in order to have the hearth          of one temperature.          The
                   mi
 walls were 13 inches thick, and the roof            formed of 4-inch fire-clay
covers.
    Three tubes, 20" x 1" x        bore, were filled as follows       : —

    On heating them in the reverberatory furnace, No. exploded before
a visible red-heat had been obtained, so the temperature was not
allowed to rise any higher, and Nos.        II  and   III  allowed to lie for four
hours and then slowly cooled. On being bored open next day, No.                    II
contained a little scaly carbon, but No.       Ill  contained almost none, and
nearly all its liquid had been converted into gas, which rushed out on
boring it open. It was noticed by the workmen that the inside of the
                                                         I
tube was harder to bore than the outside, and thought, as found out       I
afterwards rightly, that the iron had been carbonised and converted
into steel.   It seemed, then, that the free carbon had been taken up
by the iron. The same two tubes were welded up again, rather more
than half -full of liquid, and slowly heated, but before they came to as
high a temperature as they had been subjected to formerly, they ex
ploded together. Two more were filled, welded, and heated, but again
they burst simultaneously.         It appeared, then, that those tubes were
too weak, so two were made 20" X 2" x \" bore. On trying to weld them
when two-thirds full, the liquid got hot, and gave off enough vapour
to carbonise the white-hot plug and made a bad weld, so that they
had to be kept cool by trickling water upon them immediately below
the hot part. Several tubes were lost in closing before the workman
became deft enough at closing them.             Two were at length obtained
well closed, and were heated, but again, before a red-heat was reached,
they exploded simultaneously, smashing the roof of the furnace.                    It
seemed on examining the tubes that one          had    gone off first, and strnck
the other such a blow as caused it to burst, as one had a mark near the

middle as from a blow with a hammer, and was bent a little.                   It
became plain, then, that two should not be heated together, at least
where they might strike each other on explosion.         Then, again, as the
                                        I
iron took up the carbon set free, considered that the reaction might
be favoured by adding some carbon to the liquid in the form of lamp
black, so that the liquid would be kept always saturated.             A tube,
20"   X 2" x     bore was filled, as before, to about three-fourths of its
volume,     and about half a gram of lamp-black added.              This was
heated to just below a red-heat for six hours and allowed to cool slowly.
On being cut open there was a considerable yield of scaly carbon, and
the sodium, on being dissolved, left a few pretty hard scales, along with
ferric oxide, spongy iron, &c. This was encouraging, and another tube
was filled in the same way, but it burst on heating.         An experiment
was then tried with paraffin spirit and lamp-black alone, only about
2 grms.    of lamp-black being added to the tube, three parts filled with
hydrocarbon.       This experiment went successfully, and on opening the
tube after the outrush of gas it was found that nearly all the lamp
black had been absorbed by the iron. This showed that my conjecture
was right about the disappearance of the carbon.         Two divisions were
then built upon the furnace-hearth, so as to divide it into three spaces,
and three tubes of the above dimensions, and filled as follows, were
put in them : —

   On heating, No.       II  burst with a loud explosion, but did not harm
Nos.    I  and  III, but on opening these next day they were found to
have leaked, so that there may have been no pressure inside them at
the time. Other two, two-thirds filled with liquid and solids as above,
also burst ; but as    I  was absent   I  do not know at what temperature
they were.
    It seemed plain that the tubes were much too frail, and although
they were made from
                            " Lowmoor " iron, well hammered, and the
                                                                           tube
bored out of the solid, they invariably burst lengthwise, showing a
reedy structure.      I  determined then to try tubes on the coil principle ;
so two were constructed out of the toughest bar iron, made solid, and
bored out afterwards.         The dimensions were 20" x 2f " x       and they
were heated to a just visible red-heat, and contained 3 grms. sodium,
 £ grm. lamp-black, and two-thirds full of paraffin spirit.          The heat
was kept up eight hours, and the tubes allowed to cool in the furnace.
Both kept tight, and yielded some hard scaly carbon, but nothing else.
 One was tried with lithium, and a better yield of carbon obtained, and
 it was also harder. Two more tubes of the same dimensions, with
lithium, burst, and so were lost. It now became evident that much

stronger tubes were necessary for this reaction, or that some other
reaction would require to be found.
    Iwould here mention a fact which, although not directly connected
with our subject, is of great interest to students of chemical physics.
When introducing the alkali metal into the tube it was often necessary
to push it down with a rod, and in one or two cases when               I
                                                                   had mis
laid the iron rod for the purpose I used a glass rod, of which the end
had not been rounded by fusion.      In consequence, some small particles
of glass became detached, and being lead glass they were heated to
such a temperature that they were softened, and in some cases com
pletely melted by the heat. Whenever this had taken place the piece
of glass had cavities in       it,
                              and these cavities were partially filled with
liquid or compressed gas, generally with a portion of each. In the
same piece of glass the bubbles were of different size, and often filled
to different heights with liquid, just as we find liquid carbonic acid
and water filling in different proportions the cavities in the same quartz
crystal. How these cavities in the glass are formed, and how the
liquid gets into them,      cannot at present determine, but even little

liquid was even worse to work with than the hydrocarbon, as on coming-
into contact with the hot iron it burnt it away at once, and as the tube
was of great diameter it was extremely difficult to keep the lower part
cool.     For welding it had to be arranged so that it was standing in a
tub of ice, and the top projecting through the bottom of the forge,
and heated until it was at a welding heat, with as little delay as
possible.     When a tube was obtained welded up solid it was heated to
 a dull red-heat for 14 hours, and allowed to cool ; on opening the tube
there was a very great out-rush of gas, and the carbon was to a certain
 extent dissolved, and some minute portions of it very hard.                       Still,
 under the microscope it presented little difference in appearance from
 the wood charcoal employed, some of the features, however, being
 obliterated, and it had a bright appearance.               Another tube of the same
 dimensions and contents was closed up                in the same manner, but after
 eight hours' heatiug it burst with a loud explosion.                I had noticed that
 a tube which had         been  once   used   and   been  partially carbonised would
 not stand a second heating, and for this reason                I had no belief in the
 power    of  cast-iron     or steel  to  withstand    the   great pressure at a red-
 heat. Nevertheless, as many of my friends had urged upon me to try
                       I                                                    "

 these materials,
 filled two-thirds of its volume with bone oil distillate and carbon, and
 then welded up.          We succeeded after a little trouble in making a good
 weld, and the tube was then slowly raised to a dull red-heat in the
 furnace.     It had not been heated for more than an hour when it ex
 ploded with a great noise, and knocked dowu the back and one of the
 ends of the furnace, leaving the whole structure a wreck.                     The tube
  had broken     into    small   fragments,     and   was   quite unlike  the  malleable
  iron tubes which generally tore up. Thinking that it was perhaps a
  bad casting,   I  tried another, but it leaked all over, and emptied itself
  before the temperature was nearly up.                   A third tube of the same
  material   burst    like   the  first, but   as I  had   built up the furnace with
  large blast-furnace blocks, it was not blown down. Cast-iron being
  inadmissible, experiments were then made with steel. I had several
  tubes made of this material by the best firms in the kingdom — made
                                                                                       —
  by the three methods, Bessemer, Siemens, and the crucible method
   but they had the same           faults  as  cast-iron, although to a less degree.
   The difficulty in making a good weld in cast-iron and steel tubes makes
  their employment in such experiments as these a matter of incon
   venience.    Out of five tubes made of steel, some of which were made
   of the very toughest material manufactured by Messrs. Cammell and
   Co., only one held in the substance completely.                 Three burst in the
   furnace,  and   one    had  leaked    by  its  porosity.    The  top of the furnace,
   by the continued shocks of explosions, fell in at the bursting of the
   last of the steel tnbes.        The continued strain on the nerves, watching
   the temperature of the furnace, and in a state of tension in case of an

explosion, induces a nervous state which is extremely weakening, and
when the explosion occurs it sometimes shakes one so severely that
sickness supervenes.
    It appeared that as the bone oil had so hardened           the carbon,  if it
acted upon nascent carbon it might harden it so much as to produce
diamond. An experiment was accordingly tried in which bone oil
 distillate and paraffin spirit were mixed, so that when an alkali metal
was made to act npon it the decomposition of the hydrocarbon might
yield carbon which would be crystallized by the action of the nitro
genous liquid.         The proportions used were 90 per cent, bone oil, and
 10 per    cent, paraffin spirit, with lithium as the metal.      The tube used
was a coil-tube of Lowmoor iron, 4 inches in external, f -inch internal
diameter, and 24 inches long.           Three grms. of lithium was employed,
and the tube filled three parts of its length with the mixed liquids,
 a little lamp-black added, and welded up.            It was heated 14 hours
 to a dull red-heat, and then bored open. A very high pressure was
 found to exist inside the tube, and as the material was at the other end
 of the tube it was removed by a long punch.              It was found to be a
 mixture of carbon and lithium compounds, with some cyanides.              Some
of the carbon was very hard, but could be crushed by agate, and would
not scratch it ; but there was mixed with it (as with many of the other
experiments) a few grains of silica. This was, perhaps, introduced in
the welding, as a little silica had to be employed here, and a little may
have been added with the lamp-black, which was never quite free from
sand or other accidental impurity.         The silica particles were easily re
moved by placing the substance on the stage of the microscope, and
 examining by polarized light, when all the particles which showed
 rotary power were removed.
    The results obtained by the use of the two liquids being so much
more satisfactory, further experiments were undertaken in this direc
tion, and a series of four tubes filled with varying proportions. The
tubes had the dimensions 20" X 3f " X              bore, and had 3 grms. of
lithium introduced into each and then filled as follows : —

    These were heated separately in the furnace, with the result that
Nos.    I   and   III   burst, and Nos.   II   and IV withstood the pressure.
No.    II   on being bored open gave off a great volume of gas, but on
removing the contents nothing but lithium compounds and soft carbon
was obtained.         No. IV also evolved much gas, but the solid matter
was very hard and contained some hard particles of carbon, but no
diamond.        It seemed therefore probable that some such proportion of

ingredients might yield successful results, and another series of five,
ranging from 30 per cent, to 10 per cent, of bone oil distillate, was
prepared, but not one of them gave any results.  One by one the tubes
exploded, and the furnace had to be reconstructed at the fourth experi
ment.   I thought Ishould either have to abandon the attempt or begin
experiments of a very expensive nature, using large tubes and a large
furnace, as 20-inch tubes of a greater diameter than 4 inches could
not be closed when three parts filled— at least by welding.  As some
                                        I
of them, however, seemed to stand, determined to make some further
trials with the apparatus    I   had at my disposal ; so another tube,
20"x4"x|" bore was filled, using 4 grms. of lithium and a mixture
of bone oil, carefully rectified, 90 per cent., and paraffin spirit 10 per
cent., using these proportions because       I
                                             had never had any results
with a high percentage of bone oil, the tubes so filled having burst.
The tube was closed with great difficulty, being three-parts full of
liquid, and then heated to a visible red-heat for fourteen hours, and
allowed to cool slowly.     On opening the tube a great volume of gas
was given off, and only a little liquid remained.     In the end of the
tube which had been the upper end in the furnace, the tube lying
obliquely, there was a hard smooth mass adhering to the sides of the
tube, and entirely covering the bottom.              I
                                            As had never obtained all
the solids in one piece before, I wished to examine       it,
                                                          and so had the
other end of the tube cut off, exposing the hard mass. It was quite
black, and was removed with a chisel, and as       appeared to be com

material were extremely hard not resisting a blow, but hard other
wise.   On looking closer,I     saw that these were mostly transparent
pieces imbedded in the hard matrix, and on triturating them            I
obtained some free from the black matter.        They turned out to be
crystalline carbon, exactly  like diamond.     shall
                                                 I   describe further on
the analyses, &c., but will here go on with the account of my further
experiments.    Two tubes were filled in the same manner as the last,
but one burst on heating, and the other had leaked so that there was
no reaction.    Two more tubes were prepared, but were spoiled on
welding,  and  on cutting off the carbonised portion the remainder was
too short to work.     After much trouble three tubes were obtained,
well closed, in which the three alkali metals were inclosed with liquid
containing 20 per cent, bone oil and 80 per cent, paraffin.     All three
stood, and, on opening, only the" potassium one had leaked to any
extent.   The results were not good, however, the sodium tube con
taining only soft scaly carbon, and the other two very little better.
The reaction did not seem to have proceeded in the same manner in
the lithium tube as before, as the mass was soft and friable.       Still,
lithium seemed to yield the best results, so     was adhered to in the

  further experiments.      A list of disasters now awaited me. Eight
  tubes failed through bursting and leaking, and one of the explosions,
  when two were being heated together, destroyed a part of the furnace
  and injured one of my workmen.        Besides this, two tubes were spoiled
  in welding. However, I had four experiments after this, all with
  standing the pressure, and in one of these, with 10 per cent, bone oil
  and 90 per cent, paraffin spirit, a small quantity of diamond was found.
  The contents of this tnbe were different from the other successful one,
  being much looser and not in the same hard mass as the first. In
  another series of six experiments two were at first thought to have
  been successful, but I afterwards found that one of them was not so,
  the transparent matter being siliceous, but insoluble in cold hydro
  fluoric acid, although it dissolved on boiling. The uncertainty and
  great expense involved in nsing these forged coils of iron with tubes
  bored out of the solid induced me to again try steel, and Messrs.
  Cammell and Co. having prepared some tubes for me,           I tried them,
  but with the same results — they exploded into fragments at a red-
  heat.   And herein they are much more dangerous than coiled tubes,
 because the latter seldom fly into fragments, but just tear open a little.
 A further unforeseen danger in nsing steel tubes was discovered. One
 which had stood the heating very well was being bored, and when the
 inner skin was cut so that the gas rushed out, the whole exploded,
 endangering the life of the workman who was boring, but as he was
 standing at the end of the tube and the pieces flew laterally he was
 not hurt.    I  have performed over eighty experiments, and have only
obtained three results of a successful nature. The identification of the
 crystalline pieces as carbon was easy enough, but I have been anxious
 to find whether they are pure carbon or a compound with some other
element, and to that end the following experiments were conducted.
     A portion of the substance from the first successful experiment was
weighed out after it had been freed from all foreign matter adhering
to it, and placed in a very small platinum boat made of a strip of thin
foil, the ends of which were wrapped round two stout platinum wires
which were sealed into a wide glass tube. The carbon particles were
transferred to this boat after being weighed, and the tube connected
by india-rubber stoppers with an oxygen gasometer on the one side
and a series of potash bulbs on the other. The oxygen was dried over
solid caustic potash before entering the tube, and again after leaving
the potash bulbs.       The carbon (14 mgrms.) having been weighed out,
the potash bulbs were weighed, and a current of oxygen passed
through the apparatus, and the platinum wires connected with a
battery strong enough to heat the foil to a bright red-heat.         After a
few minutes     the oxygen   was  stopped  and  the  bulbs weighed, when it
was found that they had gained 1 mgrm. On repeating this operation
no gain was found, the moisture having been entirely driven off by the

460            On Hie Artificial Formation of the Diamond.       [May 27,
first treatment.    The carbon was now placed in the boat and a slow
current of oxygen started, then the bulbs connected and the current
made to pass through the platinum until all the diamond had been
burnt, when the current was stopped and the oxygen allowed to pass
for fifteen minutes more, when the bulbs were detached and weighed.
They were then reconnected and the gas passed for other ten minutes
to find whether all the carbonic acid had been expelled and reweighed.
They weighed 0"2 mgrm. less than before. The numbers were as
follow : —

    This gives a composition of 97'85 per cent, of carbon, which is a
pretty fair approximation to pure carbon.         However, to determine
whether or not this was not the case, some further experiments were
tried. A small quantity of the carbon was placed on the platinum
boat and burnt in oxygen without any of the gas being allowed to pass
out of the apparatus, and the mixed gases so obtained transferred to a
eudiometer, and the carbonic acid and oxygen absorbed.        It  was then
found that a residue amounting to about 3 per cent, by volume of
the carbonic acid was left unabsorbed by alkaline pyrogallate solution.
This proved to be nitrogen.         A blank experiment was done, but it
gave only    a minute  bubble  of nitrogen. Another experiment was per
formed with the following results :     —
           Total volume                        183-7°
           After absorption of CO„             148-5°   C02= 352

    This plainly shows that nitrogen was present from some cause or
 another, and as every precaution was taken in transferring the gas
 from one vessel to another, and as the blank experiment showed
 nothing,   I  am inclined to believe that the carbon, or at least some
 portions of it, contained nitrogen chemically combined. The numbers
 above given are degrees on the eudiometer tube, and are not more
 than one-third of a cubic centimetre each. Their exact value was of
 no consequence in the experiment, and the tube was only calibrated by
 comparing one part with another, and not with an absolute measure.
    From the fact that no diamond was found when nitrogen compounds

 were absent, and from the fact that the mixed product (for only a
 portion of the 14 mgrms. was clear diamond) contains nitrogen,                I  am
 inclined to believe that it is by the decomposition of a -nitrogenous
 body, and not the hydrocarbon, that the diamond is formed in this re
 action.   The experiments are, however, too few, and the evidence too
 vague, to draw any conclusions, as there are even very few negative
 experiments from which anything can be learned, most of the results
 being lost by explosion.      I intend, when my other work — which laid      I
 aside for the diamond experiments — is finished, to begin a series of
 experiments on the decompositions of carbon compounds by metals, to
 find whether a more easily controlled reaction may not be discovered.

                                          Spectrum of Carbon." By
         Norman Lockyer, F.R.S. Received May 11, 1880.
     The preliminary discussion of a considerable number of photo
 graphs of the spectra of various carbon compounds has brought to
light a relationship which         I  think may be worthy of notice in the
 Proceedings ; it was noticed orally in connexion with the paper read
before the Society on April 29th.
    A comparison of the photographs of the various carbon compounds
observed under various conditions enabled us to isolate the lines in the
blue and ultra-violet portions of the spectrum (wave-lengths 4300-
3800).
    In this manner the constant lines seen in the photographs of the
spectra of CC14, C10H8, CN, CHI3, CS3, C03, CO, &c, have been
mapped, and the coincident lines and flutings thus marked.
    The phenomena thus seen with more or less constancy are a blue
line, with a wave-length of 4266 ; a set of blue flutings, extending
from 4215 to 4151 ; and another set of ultra-violet flutings, which
extend from 3885 to 3843 (all approximate numbers).

 battery)   from carbon poles in an atmosphere of chlorine, the bine
 flntings alone are visible, while, when the spark is similarly photo
 graphed, the ultra-violet flntings and the blue line (4266) are also
 visible, while the blue flntings become fainter.
     From this we may assume, in accordance with the working hypo
 thesis of a series of different temperature furnaces, as set forth in the
 paper of December, 1878 (see fig. 1), that the different flutings and
 the line correspond to different temperature spectra, the blue flntings
 to the lowest and the blue line to the highest temperature, while the
ultra-violet flutings occupy an intermediate position.

  Spectra of the hypothetical substance in intermediate furnaces, assuming that the
                       Tapours are not completely dissociated.
    According to this working hypothesis, there should be a series of
heat-levels forming a perfect gradation between the spectrum which
contains the blue line alone and that which contains the blue flutings
alone (fig. 2).
    In comparing     the spectra of carbon under different conditions, I
find this to be true. The blue line never appears in conjunction with the
blue flutings, wiless the ultra-violet flutings are also present.         In other
words, the highest     and  the  lowest   hypothetical temperature spectra are
never visible together without the spectrum of the intermediate               hypo
thetical temperature.
    But this is not all.      By placing the spectra of the substances at
different heat-levels, so to speak,     I  am enabled to construct a diagram
which not only indicates the mere presence or absence of the lines and
their relative intensities, but shows that there exists a perfect grada
tion between the spectrum which contains the line alone and that
which contains the blue flutings alone (fig. 3).               I would point out
that there is nothing theoretical in this diagram.              All the heat-levels

    This map       I   submit, therefore, bears out the hypothesis of differences
of temperature indicated above, for it is seen that, while the blue line
gradually thins out, the ultra-violet flutings appear first and grow in
intensity.        As these increase, the blue flutings become visible, and
further       as the latter augments and the line disappears, the ultra
violet flutings gradnally die out altogether.
    It is philosophical to infer from these observations not only that the
line and flutings in question are produced by carbon, but that the blue
line (4266), since it is visible at the highest temperature, corresponds
to the most simple molecular grouping we have reached in the experi
ments, and the flutings to others more complex.

 Dear Peofessoe Stokes,
      In introducing the discussion on Mr. Spottiswoode and Mr. Monlton's
                   "
 paper on the Sensitive State of Vacuum Discharges," at the meeting
 of the Royal Society on April 15th, Dr. De la Rue, who occupied the
 chair, good-naturedly challenged me to substantiate my statement
 that there is such a thing as a fourth or ultra-gaseous state of matter.
      I  had no time then to enter fully into the subject ; nor was I pre
 pared, on the spur of the moment, to marshal all the facts and reasons
 which have led me to this conclusion.            Bat as I find that many other
scientific men besides Dr. De la Rue are in doubt as to whether matter
 has been shown to exist in a state beyond that of gas, I will now
 endeavour to substantiate my position.
      I  will commence by explaining what seems to me to be tho constitu
tion of matter in its three states of solid, liquid, and gas.
      I.  First  as to Solids : — These are composed of discontinuous      mole
cules, separated from each other by a space which is relatively large —
possibly enormous— in comparison with the diameter of the central
nucleus we call molecule. These molecules, themselves bnilt up of atoms,
                                                                 I
are governed by certain forces. Two of these forces will here refer
to — attraction and motion. Attraction when exerted at sensible dis
tances is known as gravitation, but when the distances are molecular it
is called adhesion and cohesion. Attraction appears to be independent
of      absolute   temperature  ;   it increases   as the distance   between the
                                                                   2 l2

molecules diminishes  and were there no other counteracting force the
                              ;
result wonld be a mass of molecules in actual contact, with no mole
cular movement whatever — a state of things beyond our conception —
a state, too, which wonld probably result in the creation of something
that, according to our present views, would not be matter.
   This force of cohesion is counterbalanced by the movements of the
individual molecules themselves, movements varying directly with the
temperature, increasing and diminishing in amplitude as the tempera
ture rises and falls.   The molecules in solids do not travel from one
part to another, but possess adhesion and retain fixity of position about
their centres of oscillation.    Matter, as we know            it,
                                                           has so high an
absolute temperature that the movements of the molecules are large in
comparison with their diameter, for the mass must be able to bear              a
reduction of temperature of nearly 300° C. before the amplitude of
the molecular excursions would vanish.
   The state of solidity therefore — the state which we are in the habit
of considering par excellence as that of matter— merely the effect on
                                                         is
our senses of the motion of the discrete molecules among themselves.
   Solids exist of all consistences, from the hardest metal, the most
elastic crystal, down to thinnest jelly.     perfect solid would have no
                                                A
viscosity, i.e., when rendered discontinuous or divided by the forcible
passage of a harder solid,       wonld not close up behind and again
                                  it
become continuous.
   In solid bodies the cohesion varies according to some unknown factor
which we call chemical constitution hence each kind of solid matter
                                          ;
requires raising to   different temperature before the oscillating mole
                          a
cules lose their fixed position with reference to one another.   At this
point, varying in different bodies through   very wide range of tem
                                                     a
perature, the solid becomes liquid.
  II. In liquids the force of cohesion    very much reduced, and the
                                                is
adhesion or the fixity of position of the centres of oscillation of the
molecules       is
              destroyed. When artificially heated, the inter-molecular
movements increase in proportion as the temperature rises, until at
last cohesion    broken down, and the molecules fly off into space with
                     is
enormous velocities.
    Liquids              property of viscosity — that
                possess the                               to say, they offer
                                                              is
a   certain opposition to the passage of solid bodies     at the same time
                                                              ;
they   cannot permanently    resist such opposition, however slight,   con
                                                                        if
tinuously applied.     Liquids vary in consistency from the hard, brittle,
apparently solid pitch, to the lightest and most ethereal liquid capable
of existing at any particular temperature.
    The state of liquidity, therefore,   due to inter-molecular motions of
                                        is
a  larger and more tumultuous character than those which characterise
the solid state.
    III.   In   gases the molecules fly about   in every conceivable direction.

 1880.]      Mr. W. Crookes.        On a Fourth State of Matter.       471
 with constant collisions and enormous and constantly varying velocities,
 and their mean free path is sufficiently great to release them from the
 force of adhesion. Being free to move, the molecules exert pressure in
 all directions, and were it not for gravitation they would fly off into
 space.    The gaseous state remains so long as the collisions continue to
 be almost infinite in number, and of inconceivable irregularity.      The
 state of gaseity, therefore, is pre-eminently    a state dependent on col
 lisions. A given space contains millions of millions of molecules in
 rapid movement in all directions, each molecule having millions of
 encounters in a second.       In such a case, the length of the mean free
 path   of the  molecules  is exceedingly small compared with the dimen
 sions of the containing vessel, and the properties which constitute the
 ordinary gaseous state of matter, which depend upon constant colli
 sions, are observed.
     What, then, are these molecules ?       Take a single lone molecule
 in space.     Is it solid, liquid, or gas ?   Solid it cannot be, because
 the idea of solidity involves certain properties which are absent in
 the isolated molecule.       In fact, an isolated molecule is an incon
 ceivable entity, whether we try, like Newton, to visualize it as a little
hard spherical body, or with Boscovich and Faraday, to regard it as
a centre of force, or accept Sir William Thomson's vortex atom.        Bat
if the individual molecule is not solid, a fortiori it cannot be regarded
as a liquid or gas, for these states are even more due to inter-molecular
collisions than is the solid state. The individual molecules, therefore,
must be classed by themselves in a distinct state or category.
    The same reasoning applies to two or to any number of contiguous
molecules, provided their motion is arrested or controlled, so that no
collisions occur between them ; and even supposing this aggregation
of isolated non-colliding molecules to be bodily transferred from one
part of space to another, that kind of movement would not thereby
cause this molecular collocation to assume the properties of gas ; a
molecular wind may still be supposed to consist of isolated molecules,
in the same way as the discharge from a mitrailleuse consists of
isolated bullets.
    Matter in the fourth state is the ultimate result of gaseous expan
sion.    By great rarefaction the free path of the molecules is made so
long   that the hits in a given time may be disregarded in comparison
to the misses, in which case the average molecule is allowed to obey
its own motions or laws without interference ; and if the mean free
path is comparable to the dimensions of the containing vessel, the
properties which constitute gaseity are reduced to a minimum, and
the matter then becomes exalted to an ultra-gaseous state.
    But the same condition of things will be produced if by any means
we can take a portion of gas, and by some extraneous force infuse
order into the apparently disorderly jostling of the molecules in every

direction, by coercing        them into a methodical   rectilinear movement.
This  I have shown to    be the case   in the phenomena which cause the
 movements of the radiometer, and        I
                                         have rendered such motion visible
 in my later researches on the negative discharge in vacuum tubes.
 In the one case the heated lamp-black and in the other the electrically
 excited negative pole supplies the force majeure which entirely or
 partially changes into a rectilinear motion the irregular vibration in
 all directions ; and according to the extent to which this onward move
 ment has replaced the irregular motions which constitute the essence
 of the gaseous condition, to that extent do I consider that the mole
 cules have assumed the condition of radiant matter.
    Between the third and the fourth states there is no sharp line of
 demarcation, any more than there is between the solid and liquid
states, or the liquid and gaseons states ; they each merge insensibly
one into the other.      In the fourth state properties of matter which
exist even in the third state are shown directly, whereas in the state
of gas they are only shown indirectly, by viscosity and so forth.
    The ordinary laws of gases are a simplification of the effects arising
from the properties of matter in the fourth state ; such a simplification
is only permissible when the mean length of path is small compared
with the dimensions of the vessel. For simplicity's sake we make
abstraction of the individual molecules, and feign to our imagination
continuous matter of which the fundamental              properties— such as
pressure varying    as the  density, and  so forth—   are  ascertained by ex
periment.     A gas is nothing more than an assemblage of molecules
contemplated from a simplified point of view.           When we deal with
phenomena in which we are obliged to contemplate the molecules
individually, we must not Rpeak of the assemblage as gas.
   These considerations lead to another and curious speculation.          The
molecule— intangible, invisible, and hard to be conceived — is the only
true matter, and that which wo call matter is nothing more than the
effect upon our senses of the movements of molecules, or, as John
Stuart Mill expresses   it, " a permanent possibility of sensation."      The
space covered by the motion of molecules has no more right to be
called matter than the air traversed by      arifle bullet can be called lead
From this point of view, then, matter        but a mode of motion
                                             is                     ;   at the
absolute zero of temperature the inter-molecular movement would
stop, and although something retaining the properties of inertia and
weight would remain, matter, as we know           it,
                                                   would cease to exist.

 II. " On      Bacterium foetidum : an Organism associated with
        Profuse Sweating from the Soles of the Feet." By GEORGE
        Thin, M.D. Communicated by Professor Huxley, Sec. R.S.
        Received May 12, 1880*
                                       [Plate  6.]
     The feet of certain individuals are characterised by a peculiar
 powerful and foetid odour. This odour, although it is usually believed
 to be connected with the sweat from the feet, is really connected with
 the moisture that soaks the soles of the stockings and the inside of
 the boots.     The moisture, which comes from the skin of the soles, espe
 cially from that of the heels, has no offensive smell whilst it is
exuding, but it rapidly acquires the characteristic odour when taken
np by the stocking.
     The fluid is not pure sweat, but is an admixture of sweat with
serous exudation from the blood.            This admixtnre occurs in persons
whose feet sweat profusely, and who, from much standing or walking,
acquire an erythematous or eczematous condition of the skin of the
soles, the local erythema or eczema being favoured by the softening
and macerating effect of the sweat on the epidermis.                 That the fluid
is not sweat is shown by its reaction. In the case which furnished me
with an opportunity for investigation the reaction with litmus paper
applied to the wet heel was very faintly alkaline, the fluid in the
stockings and on the inner surface of the sole of the boot being more
decidedly, but still faintly, alkaline. At the same time the sweat on
other parts of the body was acid.
     When a small portion of the sole of the wet stocking was teased
out in water, the drop of water was found to be swarming with minute
spherical bodies, many of them being in pairs, fairly equal in size and
refracting light uniformly. Clusters or colonies of them were lying on
hollow parts of the cotton fibres. These bodies I shall in this paper
call micrococci, implying by that term no more than that they were
spherical, that they were found singly and in pairs, and that they were
capable of development. No rod-shaped bacteria were found in the drop.
    Having made more than one examination, and finding the micrococci
always present,        I inoculated with them a drop of pure vitreous
humour, and placed it over a cell prepared in the usual manner.                   The
cells were kept at a temperature of from 96° to 98° F., and within
twenty-four hours appearances were observed which showed that the
micrococci (or spores) were developing after the fashion in which the
spores of the Bacillus anthracie are known to develop.                   In order to

study more conveniently the different forms assumed by the organism
when nnder cultivation, it was grown for successive generations in
pure vitreous humour, contained in pure test glasses, and kept at
96° to 98° F.
   The glasses, fitted with glass caps, and covered by a larger protecting
glass, were placed on small glass squares and purified by being kept at
a temperature over 300° F. for about two hours.        The flasks for the
vitreous humour were protected by carbolised cotton wool and simi
larly heated. The vitreous humour was obtained by collection from ox
and sheep's eyes.     It was squeezed through fine muslin, and intro
duced with proper precautions to a pure flask, which was then placed
for half an hour in boiling water. All the apparatus used and the
method of experimenting       were modelled after those described by
Mr. Lister in a paper on the lactic fermentation in the twenty-ninth
volume of the " Transactions of the Pathological Society of London."
It was ascertained that milk, vitreous humour, and turnip infusion, so
prepared and protected by the carbolised cotton caps, kept free from
organisms and retained their natural appearance and taste for periods
extending over six weeks.
   A  second generation of the organism, which for convenience      I may
call Bacterium fcetidum, was obtained by placing a small piece of the
wet stocking in one of the test-glasses, charged with pure vitreous
humour.     This and all the succeeding generations were cultivated at a
temperature    which varied    between   9-4° and 98° F.   The successive
generations were obtained by inoculating pure vitreous humour, with
requisite precautions.
   In twenty-four hours the surface of the vitreous humour was always
found covered with a delicate scum, which in forty-eight hours was
compact and tolerably resistant.
   In the scum of one day's growth and in the fluid below it organisms
were found as cocci, single and in pairs, in transition stages towards
rod formation, as single and jointed rods, and as elongated single rods.
Many of the rods were actively motile.
   The compact scum of two days' growth was sufficiently resistant to
be removed in an unbroken sheet.         When disturbed by the needle it
fell to the bottom of the glass. It was found to contain all the forms
found in the twenty-four hours' growth, and in addition long unbroken
rods in transition stages towards the formation of chains of spores.
   Spores were also found lying beside the empty and partially empty
sheaths from which they had been discharged.             Groups of single
spores and pairs, identical in size and appearance with those which
had come to maturity in the sheaths, were found mixed up with rods
in all phases of development.
   As no individual coccus or rod was kept under continuous observa
tion, the process of growth can only be inferred by comparing the

  1880.]          Dr. G. Thin.     On Bacterium foetidum.              475
  various forms with each other, and thus tracing the successive stages
  in the development.
     Examples of these different stages were drawn (Plate 6), and with
 the assistance of the figures     I shall endeavour to describe what     I
 believe to be the order of succession.
     The first stage is undoubtedly the production of a pair from a single
 coccus.    The individuals of the pair were sometimes found so closely
 associated that there was no independent movement in each member,
 in some a distinct movement of each could be observed, whilst in others
 the union was so loose that there was a perceptible distance between
 them, and they oscillated round each other, connected undoubtedly by
 a band of union which with the microscope       I employed was not dis
 tinctly visible.
    The next stage I take to be that in which the whole body is wedge-
 shaped, the round brightly refractive coccus being found in the thick
 end of the wedge. Another phase which is probably the successor of
 the preceding one, is the appearance of a canoe-shaped figure with the
 bright coccus in the centre. In one of these canoe-shaped bodies
 Mr. Knowsley Thornton and myself observed two of the bright refrac
 tive bodies in active oscillation in the centre of the canoe ; one and
 then two being successively visible according to their relative position.
 The canoe-shaped envelope itself was motionless (the preparation was
 a permanent one sealed in diluted Goadby's solution), and Mr.
 Thornton was able to draw it with the camera. (See fig. 2, a, b.)
    Other appearances connected with the early stage of development,
 and probably following the wedge and canoe-shaped figures, show the
organism developed into a staff-shaped body, containing two elements
of very different refractive power. The coccus element is still distinct
and is brightly refractive, the other element is very slightly refractive
and is seen as a dull shade, with however perfectly distinct outlines.
    The latter element it may be convenient to term protoplasm, using
the word merely to express the idea of an element which is distinct
from the coccus and the sheath. The relative positions of the coccus
or cocci and the protoplasm are various.
    The coccus may be at one end of the rod, two cocci may be in the
centre close together with a prolongation of protoplasm on either side,
or a central rod of protoplasm may have a coccus at either end.
(Fig. 2.)
    In the next stage we have the formation of the rods characteristic
of bacteria. The distinction between the coccus and the protoplasm
becomes lost, although transitions are found in which faint differences
of refraction still betray the two elements. At this stage, in the
donble flail-shaped rods, the one member sometimes refracts differently
from the other, the development being evidently in a different stage.
The numerous two-, three-, and four-jointed rods attached to each

other by a yielding elastic substance, which is very faintly refractive,
complete the metamorphosis from the coccns to the rod.
    The development of the rod appears to take place in two directions.
In the one there is a formation of small segments whose fate it       seems
to be to be set free from      each other (fig. 6) ; whilst in the other s
formation of spores is introduced by a series of preliminary changes.
The latter process begins by a lengthening out of the rod, which is
frequently found of great comparative length.          (These long rods are
naturally   liable to be broken   in  the preparation, but an idea of their
length may be formed from fig 5, a.)
    After the rods have attained a certain length, the protoplasm
divides into separate portions in the tube (fig. 5, 6, c).          Minute
refractive spheres then appear in the separate portions, but are also
found occasionally in a long rod before the protoplasm has separated
into segments (figs. 7, a, and 8, a). The delicate wall of the tube
remains in the meanwhile entire.
    The next stage is represented by tubes, in which the spores are so
densely packed, that they almost touch (fig. 8, 6), the wall of the tube
being, however, still visible.
    Two appearances, which were seen during the examination of
fresh specimens, but were not noticed in the permanent             prepara
tions, have not been drawn.          I several times observed tubes filled
 with spores, in which faint narrow lines of different refraction crossed
the tube between the spores, giving the impression of the existence of
a hyphen.       I also several times observed tubes partially emptied of
their spores, the escaped spores lying beside the empty tube, and
resembling in every respect the spores still present in the portions
 of the tube which had not ruptured.
    Amidst the mass of rods and tubes in all the different stages which
are found in the scum, were found dense masses of micrococci.        When
they were set free by manipulation, and sufficiently isolated to be
accurately observed, they were found singly and in pairs (fig. 9), and
resembled in size and appearance, not only the spores which were
observed in the ripe tubes, but those which were found in the meshes
of the stocking.
    Several cultivations were made in turnip infusion from the original
stock and from various generations of the vitreous humour stock. No
                                                         I
regular notes were taken of these cultivations, but can state that the
 bacterium whilst it grows in turnip infusion grows less actively than
 in vitreous humour.       It took from three to five days (at the same
temperature at which the other cultivations were made) before a per
ceptible scum appeared on the surface of the fluid, and then the scum
 was not so thick as after a cultivation of half the time in vitreous
 humour.      All the lengths of rod formation were found, but in none
 of  the preparations examined did I find spores either in the long rods

or free in the fluid. In many of the long rods segmentation of the
protoplasm, by which rod-shaped masses of equal length were formed,
was observed, the delicate tube wall being continued from one segment
to the other unbroken.               The observations were not sufficiently ex
tended to determine whether the bacterium forms spores when culti
vated in turnip infusion, but they suffice to show that if it does occur,
it occurs much less actively than when the cultivation is in vitreous
humour.
    That the foetid odour of the stocking is due to the development of
the bacterium was shown by the characteristic foetor being repro
duced in the cultivation glasses, although the strength of the odour
diminished in successive generations.                The fluid of the fourth genera
tion still smelt powerfully, and was at once recognised by several
persons who had smelt the original piece of stocking ; the fluid of the
eighth generation still had the characteristic smell, but had it so feebly
that although at once recognised by myself and the patient from
whom the stocking had been obtained, it was not considered distinctive
by a third person who had recognised the smell of the fourth genera
tion. Mr. Lister, to whom I mentioned this fact, informs me, and
authorises me to state, that he has made an analogous experience with
the Bacterium lactis.              This bacterium, after being cultivated in
successive generations in urine, although it still retains its capacity to
induce the lactic fermentation, possesses it in a less degree than when
it has been grown in milk. The vitreous humour in a similar way
would seem to be a less favourable medium for the Bacterium fcetidum
(in so far as the production of the peculiar odour is concerned) than
in the mixture of sweat and serum in which it develops in the
stocking.

III.   " On the State of Fluids at their Critical Temperatures."
       By J. B. Hannay, F.R.S.E., F.C.S.                       Communicated by
       Professor G. G. Stokes, D.C.L., &c, Sec. K.S.                          Received
       May 24, 1880.
   In carrying out the investigations            which    I  commenced some years
since npon the phenomena presented by the flow of different liquids
through capillary tubes, the question as to what constitutes a liquid —
that is in what way it differs from a gas, and how the great variance
of the microrheometrical laws for the two fluids can be explained — again
and again presented         itself to me. Seeing that solids are soluble in
gases   as  well   as  in liquids, one of the chief differences supposed to
exist between the two states has disappeared ; and                  I have    been com
pelled to adopt as the only definition of a liquid, that            it is a fluid which
has cohesion.       Professor James Thomson, F.R.S., has suggested to
me the use of the term contractility, instead of cohesion, and this
term admirably defines the liquid state, but as it suggests (in a
distant way perhaps) a voluntary power, and is used in connexion'
with organised structures, I shall retain the term cohesion at present.
We have then the two states of fluids, first, the gaseous, in which the
vis viva or heat energy of the molecules has entirely overcome
cohesion, or their mutual attraction, and they are prevented from
grouping ; and second, the liquid where the attractive power is greater
than the vis viva, and the molecules are enabled to group themselves,
but still are in sufficient motion to prevent the grouping from being
permanent, hence we have cohesion, but no rigidity.                      We do not yet
know that all solids are not also fluids, as many of them are known to
flow, but this may be from other causes, but we know that the solid
state is characterised by so much cohesion as to produce more or less
rigidity.     The most interesting point in the consideration of a liquid
is that at which it approaches to the gaseous state, where its cohesion
disappears, and we have what Dr. Andrews has termed the -critical
point, which is the termination of that property which distinguishes
a liquid fluid from a gaseous fluid, or in other words the liquid be-

  1880.]        State  of Fluids at their  Critical Temperatures.           479
  comes a gas. But a question arises. To observe this disappearance of
  the cohesion of a liquid, it is requisite that it should have a free surface,
  and this free surface has till now only been obtained by arranging the
  pressure that a portion of the fluid is in the gaseous state, and this
  only occurs at one pressure. Now, when the temperature of a liquid
  is raised while it is retained under very great pressure, so that it never
  has a free surface, but is always retained fitting the vessel, does the
  liquid still lose its cohesion, and become     a gas at the same tempera
  ture ; or, as the pressure is increased, does the temperature at which
  the cohesion of the liquid is overcome, also rise ? In the former case,
  the limit of the liquid state would be an isotherm, in the latter, a con
  tinuation of the boiling line. To determine which is the object of the
  work here described.
      With proper precautions, the loss of cohesion or capillarity can be
  noticed very accurately, and the level of the liquid in a fine capillary
  tube, seen to coincide with the plane surface of the liquid just before
  the final disappearance of the line of demarcation. One of the precau
  tions to be taken is to obtain equable temperature, and while in my earlier
   experiments,   I  used a double air-bath, and considered this sufficient to
   obtain good results, I subsequently found that by the use of a triple
  bath of copper, every trace of irregularity of temperature disappeared,
   and   I obtained results in which the line of division was admirably
   clear  and sharp, and never became broad and hazy as in ordinary ex
   periments.     Another precaution to be taken is to have pure liquids,
   and this at first sight might appear to be an easy matter, but         I find
   that in transferring a portion of a pure liquid to a tube, the momentary
   exposure to air, especially in the vicinity of the hands, hydrates the        ,
   liquid sufficiently to render the line of demarcation rounded, and show
•  a slightly greater refractive power in the lower part of the tube after
   the critical point has been passed. In the case of liquefied gases, such
   as carbon dioxide, ammonia, sulphur dioxide, and nitrous oxide, which
   are easily dried, the line is beautifully sharp, and the disappearing
   point easily noted. Alcohol cohobated over caustic lime for a week
   and transferred to a tube without contact with air, shows the dis
   appearance of the line with great sharpness, and immediately after
   no difference in refractive power can be detected between the upper
   and lower portions.      The least trace of moisture is sufficient to show
   such a difference.      Whenever I notice any difference between the
   upper and lower portions after passing the critical point,     I attribute it
   to moisture or other impurity, as careful treatment always removes
   the difference in density.     In many organic liquids there is always a
   difference at the critical point, and sometimes before reaching this
   temperature,     they form several layers, each having a different
   critical point as they seem to give rise on heating to new compounds,
    or form polymeric compounds having different critical points. Besides,

many organic compounds cannot be entirely freed from impurity, as
they retain it even on repeated distillation. In the following experi
ments, therefore, such organic componnds were never used, and only
perfectly anhydrous alcohol, or carbon disulphide,* or gases which can
be obtained anhydrous, C02, S02, and NHS, being chosen.        The ap
paratus       used for obtaining     pressure     was that described    in a former
                                                      " On the Solubility of Solids
paper   (" Proc. Roy. Soc," No. 201, 1880,
in Gases").    In order to determine, then, whether increased pressure
applied above the critical point, would have the effect of reducing the
gas to a liquid, as might easily be supposed, since the rates of expansion
of gas and liquid become alike at the critical point, a new form of ex
periment was resorted to. It had been noticed that it was easy to
determine whether the tube were filled with liquid or gas, by simply
reducing the pressure somewhat quickly, when, if there were liquid
 present, it boiled, while if the contents were entirely gaseous, simple
 expansion was the result.       The boiling only takes place when the
 pressure is reduced so far as to be a little under the vapour pressure at
 that temperature, in other words, boiling cannot be observed, unless
 there exists a free surface, and this free surface cannot be obtained with
 the liquid alone above the " critical pressure."    By the introduction of
 a quantity of hydrogen gas over the liquid, a free surface is obtained
 at any pressure, and the mixture of hydrogen and alcohol vapour being
 of so much Jess density than the alcohol, it remains divided from it by
 a line of demarcation for some time after the latter is undoubtedly
 gaseous.    Now, let us see what takes place on lowering the pressure.
 When the temperature is even only 1°C. below the critical point, when
 the pressure is sufficiently reduced, the alcohol boils, showing that it
 still has cohesion, but if the temperature be 1° above the critical point,
 the fluid only expands, and no boiling is seen at any pressure, from 50 '
 up to 200 atmospheres.       Here the fluid above the critical point has
 just as free a surface as below      and we see that the last trace of the
                                          it,
 liquid condition has disappeared.        The line dividing the mixture of
 hydrogen and alcohol vapour from the pure alcohol          quite sharp, for
                                                                    is
 a short time, and on altering the pressure,          moves up and down
                                                            it
quite freely, and possesses exactly the same appearance and properties
as hydrogen over carbon dioxide in a bell-jar.f
   Thus we see that the liquid state seems to come to an end, and the
gaseous state to supervene quite independent of pressure.
  *   Even this, in later experiments,   has been found to dissociate   slightly.   (.Tune 14,

 t   The experiments must be done quickly, before the alcohol has time to dissolve
the hydrogen to any great extent, and the temperature must be equal all through the
apparatus, otherwise mixture takes place and these phenomena are not seen. Experi
ments on mixtures obtained by shaking are in progress, but in these the critical
point    much altered.

   There is another mode of experimenting which illustrates this even
more strikingly.         A quantity of alcohol with hydrogen over it was
raised  to a  temperature of 228° to 230° under a pressure of 120 atmo
spheres, and the pressure and temperature maintained for five hours,
when it was seen that the line of demarcation was in the same place,
and as sharp as before, and on lowering the pressure, the liquid boiled,
showing that it had not mixed with the gas. The temperature was
now raised to 240°, and the pressure as before, at 120 atmospheres, and
at the end of a quarter of an hour, instead of a sharp line of demarca
tion there was only a faint, broad indication of a change of density near
the middle of the tube, and at the end of an hour all mark of a
difference had disappeared, the two gases having mixed.                      Doubtless,
the mixture was not yet uniform, but it had proceeded sufficiently far
to show that the two were miscible.                  Here we see plainly, that a few
degrees below the critical point, the substance was undoubtedly liquid,
 and a few degrees above, undoubtedly gaseous.                   The experiment was
repeated at 200 atmospheres' pressure, the temperatnre being 220° and
 240° , with precisely the same result, and                I  have since repeated it
 several times.      This   shows    that the limit of the liquid state depends
 upon temperature, and not upon pressnre.
    The method of examining the loss of cohesion of a liquid by means
 of a capillary tube was also applied at any pressure by the introduction
 of a permanent gas over the liquid, as in the foregoing experiments.
 This was done as follows.
    In the working tube of the pressure apparatus A, a small piece of
 capillary tubing B, was cemented by fusing a minute piece of silicate
 of soda between it and the side of the tube. The liquid C, which was
 in this case carbon disulphide, was placed in the tube over the mer
 cury, and readings taken of the height of the liquid in the capillary
 tube.    In order that the same liquid should be used in both cases,
 and the experiments thus rendered strictly comparable, the point of
 A was broken off, and a quantity of pure dry nitrogen introduced.
 Pressure was then applied, and the capillarity noted, the temperatdre
 raised, and the result again noted.              The following table illustrates the
  results obtained. The capillary heights are arbitrary numbers of the
 cathetometer : ten experiments were done in each case.

  both cases, the one at 80 atmospheres and the other at 194, the capil

laiity disappeared.    This again shows that pressure has little or no
effect upon the cohesion of a liquid, and that it is reduced to zero at
about the same temperature notwithstanding the pressure.
   It would appear, then, that the boiling line does not extend beyond
the critical point, but that the critical point lies upon an isothermal,
which is the limit of the liquid state.
   I have examined several liquids and liquefied gases, including
COo, NH3, S02, N30, CS2, CC14, CI, CH40, C2H10O, and C2H60, and I
find that the capillarity disappears at or near the critical point, and
pressure does not cause it to reappear.
   I have also measured the rate of decrease of capillarity with tempe
rature, but have not yet had time to reduce the arbitrary readings to
actual measurements to find whether or not any systematic        relation
exists.   I shall bring this work forward at some future time.
   I  have still another method of examination to bring before the
Society.    An apparatus was arranged with the tube for experimenting
with the liquid bent at an obtuse angle, as shown in the sketch.
The liquid was contained in the upper part, A, inclosed by the mer
cury, B ; while the lower part, C, inclosed in the apparatus, was filled
with nitrogen or other permanent gas. On applying pressure the
nitrogen is compressed into small space, and by gently tapping the

1880.]        State of   Fluids at their Critical Temperatures.          483
tube is made to rise to about D, where       it rests against the upper side
of the slanting part of the tube.             When the      temperature  and
 pressure required were reached the tube was gently tapped, when
 the bubble of nitrogen passed round the bend up into the fluid at A.
 If the fluid be in the liquid state, the bubble shows a meniscus ; but if
 the fluid be gaseous, the bubble instantly diffuses into the inclosed space,
 showing that the fluid has no cohesion or has assumed the gaseous
 state.   The same results were obtained as before. When the tempe
 rature was below the critical point the contents of the tube were liquid,
 and when over that temperature the reaction was always gaseons,
 notwithstanding the variations of pressure.
    I think that we have in these experiments evidence that the liquid
 state ceases at the critical temperature, and that pressure will not
 materially alter the temperature at which . the cohesion limit occurs.
 Dr. Andrews has, indeed, indicated his belief that such was the case ;
                   I
 but as far as am aware, there has been till now no direct experi
 mental proof of the fact.        When the line dividing the fluid from the
 gas,  and  the  difference  in height outside and inside the capillary tube
 disappear, it cannot be said that this proves the total absence of
 ¦cohesion, but only that the cohesion of the two portions of the fluid
 becomes equal ; and it is only if the gas or vapour has no cohesion that
 we can say that the portion which formed the liquid has none either.
 But by the introduction of a third substance, which, when the experi
 ments are done quickly, acts only on one side, it seems, from the
 results observed, that the condition of the surface of demarcation
 depends mainly, if not entirely, upon the lower or liquid portion of
 the fluid. The critical points of liquids are thus truly the absolute
  boiling points, as has been aptly said, and are closely comparable to

upon the mean velocity of the molecule.

       G. Stokes, D.C.L., &c, Sec. R.S. Received May 24, 1880.
   In  a  former paper* it was pointed out that a solid dissolved in
a liquid was not deposited from solution when the liquid passed
through the critical point into the gaseous state, and the conclusion
drawn that solids are soluble in gases. I have shown in another
paper f that it is probable that after a Uquid passes its critical point it
becomes a vapour or gas, and this quite independent of pressure, and
that the cohesion limit for any one substance lies more in the direction
of an isothermal line than a continuation of the boiling bne.                  Before,
however, I had carried out that work,             I  determined to make sure that
a truly gaseous state had been reached, and the fluid containing the
solid was raised to 150° above its critical point, and the gaseous solu
tion expanded to nearly twice its liquid volume, and still the solid
remained in solution.         In these circumstances it was found that non
volatile solids were retained in solution in truly gaseous menstrua. In
the second paper referred to, I have pointed out some of the difficulties
which beset such an investigation ; and when it is remembered that only
air-baths can be used, the temperature being over 200° and sometimes
over 300°, and that very many liquids dissociate under these tempera
tures, it will be seen that conclusions should be drawn only from sub
stances perfectly free from suspicion.              All the experiments, therefore,
which I have performed in iron tubes cannot bear on a discussion in
this matter ; and I shall defer going into the natural minerals formed
artificially from aqueous solution at a red-heat till another paper. For
high temperatures glass does not do, as every variety of it is easily
decomposed by water ; but by the use of rock crystal blocks                     I have
obtained some results of interest where the action of the water can be
seen.     However, I intend in this paper to treat in a fuller manner of
 work touched upon in former papers. One of the first pieces of work I
set about to finish was to determine whether or not the critical points
 were altered by the introduction of a solid into solution.
    In a former paper it was thought that the critical point of alcohol

containing potassic iodide in solution was higher than pure alcohol,
bnt subsequent experiments determined me to go into the matter again.
The cause was this. I found that absolute alcohol if exposed to air
for a very short time takes up sufficient moisture to alter its critical
point   ;   and   I
                  considered that in preparing the solution of the iodide
some moisture       might have been introduced.    The experiments were
repeated      in the following manner. Some common absolute alcohol
was placed in a flask with caustic lime, freshly burned, and cohobated
for a week. The flask was then fitted with the arrangement shown in
the diagram.    The tube connected with the drying arrangement is
turned up at the lower end, so that the exit tube may be slipped into
it. A current of air desiccated over sulphuric acid is passed through
this for some time, and the tube A then slipped out of the recurved
end in the flask, turned round so as to clear  and pushed down till
                                                   it,                                it
is below the level of the desiccated alcohol, which          is   forced up into
the experimental tube sealed or connected to A.              In this way, any
quantity of alcohol, which has never been removed from contact with
lime, can be introduced into the working tube.      A portion of fused
potassic iodide placed  in the experimental tube before the experiment
enables a saturated solution to be prepared out of contact with air
when the liquid      sealed up.
                      is          Twenty experiments were done with
pure alcohol, and twenty with alcohol saturated with potassic iodide.

the iodide      more soluble, or did its solubility increase more rapidly
•with temperature,      I  have no doubt that its effect upon the critical
point would be much more pronounced.
    By performing a large number of experiments               I came to the follow
ing conclusions     : — 1st. The gas must have a certain density before it
will act as a solvent, and when its volume is increased more than twice
its liquid volume its solvent action is almost destroyed. 2nd. Retaining
the volume the same, the higher the temperature the greater the
solvent power.        This was determined by placing an excess of iodide in
the tube and raising the temperature to a given point and maintaining
it for an hour or so, then noting portions still undissolved, raising the
temperature again, and watching the effect till a temperature was
reached when all the salt dissolved.          As the increase in the solnbility
in potassic iodide is very slight, it takes a considerable rise to have
any apparent effect. Thus we see that two conditions are requisite,
molecular closeness and vis viva.          We see from this that the liquid
condition of fluids has very little to do with their solvent power, but
only indicates molecular closeness. Should this closeness be attained
by external pressure instead of internal attraction, the result is that
the same or even greater solvent power is obtained ; greater because
of the greater activity of the molecules so compressed. That this is
the case is seen well in the case of hydrogen, which, when compressed
by a pressure of 1,000 atmospheres, measured by the hydrogen mano
meter, dissolves potassium, sodium, and lithium.                 The experiment is
done in this way.        A piece of the metal is placed in the end of the
tube, and the dry hydrogen below it. The pressure is then applied, and
after twenty or thirty minutes the mercury near the metal will be
found to be solid amalgam.          This is at the ordinary temperature ; but
should the temperature be raised to 100°, the mercury becomes solid
in a few seconds. I intend to apply still higher pressures, and attempt
to dissolve harder metals. This is a case of purely gaseous solution,
the hydrogen being at a very great distance from its critical point.
     The conclusions arrived at in a former paper have been called
in question in a paper by Professor Ramsay, and                         I   would ask
 permission to point out some errors into which I think the author
 has fallen.     He says : — " When the tube contains a small amount of
 liquid the space left for gas is larger, and consequently more vapour
 must be given off by the liquid before enough gas can be compressed
 till it acquires the same specific gravity as the liquid, the temperature
 at which the meniscus disappears is consequently higher." * It is diffi
 cult to understand how the author came to such a conclusion, unless
 he was thinking of the amount of heat required to form more vapour,
 and confounding calorimetry with thermometry.                  His conclusion, as it
 stands, is at variance with all the experiments and conclusions of the

 many eminent workers in the field. It would lead to the result that the
 boiling point of a homogeneous liquid would vary with the amount of
 space over the liquid, and that the vapour tensions of liquids as deter
 mined by placing some over the mercury in a barometer, would vary
 with the amount of liquid used.             This no doubt would           be   true of
 a mixed liquid whose constituents           have different      boiling points, but
 cannot be said of a homogeneous             liquid.     I had often noticed that
 the critical point of a carefully dried     liquefied gas was the same whether
 observed at the top of the tube or at the bottom ; but any impurity or
 moisture would cause the critical point observed at the bottom to be
 high, as it would be concentrated in the last portions of the liquid.
 Since   Dr. Ramsay's paper was published            I  have again gone over this
 ground, and to prevent mistake         I    used the same liquid in the same
 tube, varying its volume so as to make the disappearance of the
 division take place near the top or bottom of the tube ; and here give     I
 a series with alcohol and carbon dioxide with the results.

   In   these experiments every precaution was taken in purifying the
 substances, but the bath used was the old double one, otherwise
closer observations might have been made. They prove exactly what
was known before, and what Dr. Ramsay denies, that a homogeneous
liquid has a fixed boiling point, whether that be the absolute boiling
point (critical point) or a lower one.           I find that liquefied gases give
the best results to illustrate this, as they are more easily obtained pure
and dry.     I  have tried ammonia and sulphur dioxide with the same
results. Several ethers, especially oxalate of ethyl and methyl, failed
to give the same temperature at top and bottom, a difference of
several degrees often occurring. This, I have no hesitation in saying,
is due to impurity or to alteration of the liquid at the elevated tem
perature.     It is difficult to conceive how it could be imagined that the
ratio of a homogeneous liquid to the size of the vessel containing it
could influence the tension or density of its vapour.                 As experiment
and theory point to the fact that at the same temperature the vapour
of the same liquid must have the same tension and density, irrespective
of the size of the containing vessel.
   In another place, Dr. Ramsay says : — " From the first experiment
it is seen that, on cooling, tho liquid contracts more rapidly than the
                        " Whereas, even above their critical
gas." In another,                                                      points, liquids

are comparatively incompressible." A fluid is homogeneous above its
critical temperature, and it seems useless to theorise on the compressi
bility of a subject not known to exist. Besides, in these statements he
makes temperature and pressure act in different ways.          Compared
with gas,  the liquid is more sensitive to heat, but again compared with
gas, the liquid is comparatively    incompressible.   The author says :—
" Carbonic anhydride, examined by Dr. Andrews, is abnormal in this
respect, but of this I am not certain."      I must say all the bodies I
have examined are also " abnormal." Dr. Ramsay's idea of the critical
point  is,that   it the temperature where their densities being equal, gas
                      is
and liquid mix       but the entire absence of capillarity, showing no
                      ;
difference in the cohesion of the upper and lower portions of the fluid,
and the fact that we have two portions of the same chemical com
pound at the same temperature, under the same pressure with the
same density, would    prove to any ordinary mind that they are
identical, as have shown them to be in the paper already referred to.
             I
  Dr. Ramsay seeks to explain the solubility of solids in gases by
         "
saying these gentlemen have observed nothing unusual, but merely
the ordinary phenomenon of the solubility of a solid in a hot liquid."
His former explanation would not hold here however, as the liquid
holding a solid in solution would have a greater density than the gas,
and so would not mix.        Besides, suppose his explanation were true,
it would still prove the solubility of solids in gases, because, were the
solid not soluble in the gas,      would be precipitated when the Hq^d
                                  it
mixed with the gas, as we know takes place when a solntion                     is
mixed with a liquid in which the dissolved body         insoluble. Again,
                                                          is
according to Dr. Ramsay's theory, the higher the temperature the
less the solvent power would be, but the opposite             the case. He
                                                               is
attributes to me the idea that, because a solid       dissolved in a gas,
                                                         is                    it
is gaseous   ;but     never supported that idea. Let us now consider
                      I
Dr. Ramsay's repetition of my experiment with potassic iodide. The
solubility of the iodide in alcohol    very low
                                           is      in 40), and
                                                    (1             increases
                                                                    it
very slowly with temperature, yet, when he caused a solution saturated
just below the critical point to assume the gaseous condition, he
evidently expected a very sudden increase in the solvent power, and
such not being the case, he concludes that solids are not soluble in
gases.   Then, the tube was only one-third full, and the pressure in
a case of that sort would be so low that the solvent power would be
very weak. When Dr. Ramsay repeats the experiment with more
liquid, and raises the temperature sufficiently, he will see that the
solvent power      not altered in passing the critical temperature.
                  is
   An important point, which           sometimes lost sight of,
                                           is                           that,
                                                                         is
although the pressure      is independent of volume as long as the two
states of fluids exist together, whenever the critical
                                                             temperature      is
passed, the fluid in the vessel which contains the greatest amount

of liquid will develop the highest pressure on raising the temperature.
When, therefore, a tube contains a small amount of liquid, although
below the critical temperature, it develops as much pressure as a
tube nearly full, yet on passing that point it may not have sufficient
molecnlar closeness to exhibit solvent power, the cohesion existing
below the critical temperature giving it sufficient closeness there.
Hence, with a small quantity of liquid, the phenomenon is seen of
a liquid depositing a solid (which it held in solution) at the critical
point, but redissolving it again, when a certain increase of tempera
ture gave it sufficient vis viva to compensate for its want of density.
With a larger volume of liquid, the solution being the same, no
deposit takes place.
   Then, as to the asserted difference in refractive power.           I have had
an apparatus made specially       for  this  purpose and,   when  the liquids are
pure, there is not the slightest difference in refractive power between
the upper and lower layers.          Liquids which may be pure at low tem
peratures may give rise to new products at higher temperatures, and
thus produce a different result.      I  have not my determinations reduced
yet, but will publish them shortly. They are done with a glass prism,
with thick sides, and the results are reliable ; but Dr. Ramsay's tube
may have varied more than his liquids.               In another paragraph he
says  : — " It would    be  interesting   to  speculate   on the condition of a
fluid of which two portions possess the same specific gravity, but
refract light differently." How have the two portions the same specific
gravity when one is always left at the bottom of the tube ? I don't
think any clearer proof is required to show that it is an i^npurity,
or a product of decomposition at the high temperature, and its greater
refraction also proves its greater density.              Dr. Ramsay was very
careful to expel    all air, and  evaporated     the liquid to less than half its
volume, thus concentrating the denser impurities in the remaining
portion, and as momentary exposure of a pure liquid to air slightly
hydrates   it, we have conditions which suffice for producing the mixed
liquid required for the results we observed. Lastly, Dr. Ramsay
          "
says — Surely no clearer proof
     :                                is    needed to show that the solids arc
not present as gases, but simply as solution in a liquia medium," than
that they retain the same spectrum as in the solid state.                 We do
not want proof that they are present in the gaseous state, which               is
very different from being dissolved in gas.  a
   In another paper,  I      have shown that there can be no liquid above
the critical point, as     thisis  the termination of all properties which
distinguish  a  liquid from a gas, so that a fluid has only one state above
that temperature.        Solution of solids    is  (when chemical action does
not come into play) a function of all fluids, the requisite conditions
being molecular closeness and thermal activity.

      Liveing, M.A., F.R.S., Professor of Chemistry, and J.
      Dewar, M.A., F.R.S., Jacksonian Professor, University of
      Cambridge.       Received May 2(5, 1880.
   In  a " Note   on the Spectrum of Carbon," read before the Society on
April   29, 1880,  Mr. Lockyer has in the first place alleged that we have
advanced within a very short period inconsistent opinions as to
spectra of compounds of carbon ; he has next implied that we have
given an nnfair representation of the history of the carbon spectrum,
and, lastly, has directly challenged the correctness of some of the con
clusions we have drawn from our experiments.              We propose in this
paper to reply to him on the historical questions, and in another paper
to deal with the experimental evidence which he has produced in con
travention of our conclusions.
   That the inconsistency alleged has not really existed in our opinions,
will be seen by any one who reads the          first passage referred to as it
appeared    in  the  published
                                " Proceedings of the Society "
                                                                       (vol.  iix,
p. 87), which stands as follows : —
   " The well-nigh impossible problem of eliminating hydrogen from
masses of carbon, such as can be employed in experiments                  of this
kind, proves conclusively that the inference drawn by Mr. Lockyer as
to the elementary character of the so-called carbon spectrum from an
examination of the arc in dry chlorine, cannot be regarded as satis
factory, seeing that iindoubtedly hydrogen was present in the carbon* a)id
in all probability nitrogen in the chlorine."
   Mr. Lockyer has quoted the confidential, uncorrected, proof instead
of the published paper which had been issued before Mr. Lockver's
paper was read. In the published paper a clause, accidentally omitted
before, and no way altering the general drift of the passage, had
been inserted to make the sense clearer.           The paper from which he
quotes deals with the chemical interactions taking place in the
arc between the matter of the poles and the constituents of the
surrounding atmosphere.          It is there demonstrated that specially
purified carbon poles continue to produce in dry air cyanogen com
pounds, and that hydrogen always forms an essential ingredient of
such poles.       No reference was made in this paper to the specific
origin of any flutings in the spectrum of the arc, the sole question
under consideration being the possible existence of carbon compounds
in the electric arc taken in dry chlorine, on the non-existence of which
 Mr. Lockyer bases his proof of the elementary character of the carbon
spectrum.      That part of the paper from which the quotation is taken
related particularly to the combination of nitrogen with the carbon of

the poles, and the final clause added in the published paper accords
with    it.
     There is no inconsistency between the opinion there expressed and
that subsequently given in the paper " On the Spectra of the Com
pounds of Carbon with Hydrogen and Nitrogen ;" and that such a
charge could have been made is due only to Mr. Lockyer's having quoted
the ¦uncorrected proof.
     To come to the omissions we have made in reference to the work of
others. The complaints appear in such remarks as the following,
 which we extract from Mr. Lockyer's paper : —¦
     " As Messrs. Liveing and Dewar do not controvert the
                                                               very definite
conclusions     arrived  at  by Attfield, Morren, Watts, and others,  I  can
only presume that they have taken for granted that the experimental
 work performed by these men was tainted by the] presence of impuri
 ties, and that it was impossible to avoid them."
     " The only reference to this admirable work, in which vacuum tubes
 and the electric discharge were largely employed, which      I can find in
 Messrs. Dewar and Liveing's paper is the following : — " The spectrum
 of hydrocarbon burning in air has been . . . described           ....    by
 Attfield."
     It was not our intention to give a complete historical account of
 what had been done previous to the date of the paper by Angstrom and
 Thalen (" Nov. Acta Reg. Soc. Upsal.," 1875), as in that paper they had
 discussed the observations of experimenters who had been engaged on
 this subject before that time. Nor had we any desire to avoid or con
  trovert, or take anything for granted, in the work of early investiga
 tors.    We merely passed over for the sake of brevity such work as had
  not stood the test of subsequent investigation.   We could hardly accept
  Dr. Attfield's work, however good for its time, as authoritative, seeing
  that his experiments were made, as he allows (" Phil. Mag.," 1875), with
  very imperfect appliances, and evidently without his being so well
  aware as we now are of the nicety required in regard to the purity of
  his materials.    In fact, he found no distinction between the spectrum
  of carbonic oxide and that of hydrocarbons, and found the lines of
  nitrogen in the spectrum of the flame of cyanogen.
     We can hardly be charged with ignoring Morren's work, for we
  have referred to it again and again.       The particular passage quoted
  by Mr. Lockyer     embodies   observations  and conclusions which are at
  variance with those of Pliicker and Hittorf, as well as of Watts ; and
  are substantively discussed by us in our paper.
     Dr. Watts' position with reference to this subject deserves very
  special consideration, as he has perhaps directed his attention to it
  more continuously and laboriously than any other investigator.        And
  as his publications have extended over a long period of years, it is-
  clear that a grave injustice is done him if his early work be selected

for quotation instead of the maturer product of his latest study.        This
kind of selective quotation does not represent the true scientific spirit.
   The quotation from Dr. Watts' paper (" Phil. Mag.," 1869) which
Mr. Lockyer prefaces by this remark — " His work was thus sum
marised by himself," — has in reality no reference to a complete summa

tion of his experiments, but has solely to do with the typical form of
the first carbon spectrum, that obtained when defiant gas and oxygen
are burnt together in an oxyhydrogen blowpipe jet."          That this is the
correct view of Dr. Watts' position, the following extracts will show :—
" The spectrum obtained from cyanogen varies with the mode of pro
duction. The flame of cyanogen in oxygen exhibits 7, c, and € ; the
red group is replaced by a series of bands which show an opposite
character to the rest of the spectrum, inasmuch as each band is
brightest at the most refracted edge. If cyanogen be burnt in air in
stead of in oxygen these bands are more numerous, extending nearly
to c and replacing 7, which is then not to be seen.           Instead of the
group/ we have two very       brilliant groups of  lines, f,  which includes
seven lines, and 0, which is composed of six lines."
    The two very brilliant groups of lines which are referred to as f and
6 by Watts, and which distinguish the flame of cyanogen, are two of
the sets of channelled groupings which we, in our paper on " The
Spectra of the Compounds of Carbon with Hydrogen and Nitrogen."
referred to a compound of carbon with nitrogen. Further on, in the same
                                               "
paper of Dr. Watts, the following occurs : — In comparing the spectra
of fig. 1, we notice that the changes take place at the ends of the spectra,
the central groups, 7, £, c, remain substantially the same.        If we pass
from the spectrum of the olefiant gas-flame to that of the cyanogen-
flame, we find the change at the blue end of the spectrum consisting
in the disappearance of the group/ and its replacement by the groups
f  and 0. The group

    On the ground of observing these two characteristic groups of lines
f  and  0 (our seven blue and six violet nitrocarbon bands) in the spark
 spectra of carbonic oxide, cyanogen, and naphthaline, Dr. Watts was
entitled at the time to infer that they must be due to the common
element carbon.       Dr. Watts has, however, made many experiments on
the carbon spectrum since the date of that paper, and to neglect to
take into consideration papers published by him since 1869 is to mis
represent his position.         In the " Phil. Mag." for 1874, he wrote in a
 "Note on the Carbon Spectrum" as follows : — " In the ' Phil. Mag.'
for October, 1869,        I  described four different spectra as spectra of
carbon.     One of them was the ordinary spectrum from hydrocarbon
flames, first described by Swann ; the second was the spectrum ob
tained from vacuum tubes inclosing carbonic oxide, carbonic anhy
dride, or olefiant gas ; the third was the spectrum of the Bessemer
flame ; and the fourth, the high tension spark in carbonic anhydride
or carbonic oxide.
     I
   " have since shown
                                 (' Phil. Mag.,' 1873) that the Bessemer flame
spectrum,    instead   of  being a spectrum of carbon, is the spectrum of
manganese oxide ; and          I   have had now to add the result of recent
observations, which show that the second spectrum also is due, not
to carbon itself, but to some oxide of carbon.          This spectrum was held
to be a spectrum of carbon because it was common to compounds of
carbon with hydrogen and with oxygen.
   " have now found that it is not given by spectral tubes inclosing
     I
olefiant gas if special care be taken to exclude all traces of oxygen.
           . We have therefore only one spectrum which can be proved
to be due to carbon — that, namely, which is common to the flame of
olefiant gas or cyanogen, the electric discharge in cyanogen or carbonic
oxide at the ordinary pressure, and to the electric discharge in vacuum
tubes inclosing cyanogen, olefiant gas, or hydrocarbons, such as benzol."
   We infer from this, that the groups f and 0 (our seven blue and six
violet nitrocarbon bands), which are certainly not common to all the
spectra here enumerated, are not included in the one spectrum which
Dr. Watts at that time assigned to carbon. However that may be, it
is unnecessary to say more about it here, for we have quoted enough
to show that Dr. Watts' conclusions, in 1869, were not so certain that
they could now be quoted as authoritative against the inferences drawn
from later observations, and that we did our subject no injnstice in
making no more particular allusions to them than we did.
   But, further, after describing an experiment with carbon tetra
chloride, Mr. Lockyer says: — "This result, which entirely endorses
the work of Attfield and Watts, has been controlled by many other
experiments." If we may assume that the work of Attfield and Watts
cyanogene, qui est remarquable par l'eclat vif des raies, n'est pas pur, mais mele
des raies des carbures d'hydrogene, dont le splendeur est encore plus magnijique."

  alluded to is that described in the previous quotations, it is not a little
  remarkable that Mr. Lockyer's experiments should so
                                                                    " entirely en
  dorse" what Watts himself has shown to have been in part erroneous.
     Lastly, we cannot allow Mr. Lockyer's assertion that Angstrom
  and Thalen's conclusions "rest more upon a theory which has been
  shown to be false since the labours commenced, and analogy, than
 upon     experiment,"    to remain uncorrected.          Their conclusions are
 eminently    inductions   from   experiments    carried  on, as they say, during
 several years, of which the most important are particularly described.
  Many of the experiments which led up to their conclusions had been
 previously published by Thalen in 1866 (" Arsskrift, TJpsala "), in a
 paper in which he correctly described and distinguished the spectra of
 hydrocarbons, of oxide of carbon, and of carbon respectively, and
 besides described the spectrum of the spark between carbon poles in
 nitrogen.     This paper is an admirable sample of good experimental
 work, and its perusal, together with the later paper of 1875, leaves
 no doubt that, whatever       theories they may have held, Angstrom and
 Thalen relied mainly on experiment and observation to prove the
 soundness of their conclusions.
     In conclusion, Mr. Lockyer introduces a reference to a former work
 of ours on the magnesium-hydrogen              spectrnm, and to a theoretical
 deduction regarding the interactions which might produce the cometie
 spectrum, making the following remark : —

     " From what have shown it will be clear that the consequences
 drawn in the following paragraphs by Messrs. Liveing and Dewar
 from the assumed hydrogen-carbon bands are entirely invalid."
     As this opens out a question entirely beside that in band, de
 pending on the validity of the premises from which Mr. Lockyer draws
 his conclusion, we prefer to deal with it when we discuss, in our next
 paper, the spectra of carbon compounds and the experimental evidence
Mr. Lockyer has adduced in support of such assertions.

     " On   a review of the whole series of observations, certain points
 stand out plainly      In the first place, the seven blue, the violet, and
 nltra-violet bands, characteristic of the flame of cyanogen, are con
 spicuous in the arc taken in an atmosphere of nitrogen, air, nitric oxide,
 or ammonia, and they disappear, almost, if not quite, when the arc is
 taken in a non-nitrogenous atmosphere of hydrogen, carbonic oxide,
 carbonic acid, or chlorine.* These same bands are seen brightly in the
 flames of cyanogen and hydrocyanic acid, but are not seen in those of
 hydrocarbons, carbonic oxide, or carbon disulphide.             The conclusion
 seems irresistible that they belong to cyanogen ; and this conclusion
 does not seem to us at all invalidated by the fact that they are seen
 weakly, or by flashes, in the arc or spark taken in gases supposed free
 from nitrogen, by reason of the extreme difficulty of removing the last
 traces of air.    They are never, in such a case, the principal or pro
 minent part    of the spectrum, and in a continuous experiment they are
 seen to fade out in proportion as the nitrogen is removed.             This con
clusion is strengthened by the observations of one of us, that cyanogen
 (or hydrocyanic acid) is generated in the arc in atmospheric air in
 large quantity."
     The observations and experiments which we have since made all
 tend to confirm the correctness of the foregoing induction, while they
 help to remove the apparent inconsistency of some recorded observa
 tions with oar conclusions.          More particularly they explain the
 appearance of the bands which we, in common with Angstrom and
Thalen, have ascribed to a compound of carbon with nitrogen, in some
cases in which nitrogen had been supposed to be absent, by showing
the sensibility of the spectroscopic test for nitrocarbon compounds
under varied circumstances, and the consequent necessity for some
thing more than ordinary care in the preparation of materials and con
duct of experiments, if inferences dependent on the presumed absence of
nitrogen (or hydrogen, as the case may be) are to be drawn from them.

     The accompanying        diagram    (fig. 1) shows approximately the
relative position of the bands in that part of the spectrum of the
flame of cyanogen fed with a jet of oxygen which is more refrangible
than the Fraunhofer line F. Only those bands which are less re
frangible than the solar line L have been before described, but photo
graphs show another set of two shaded bands slightly less refrangible
than the solar line N accompanied by a very broad diffuse band of less
intensity on the more refrangible side of N ; also a strong shaded band,
which appears to be absolutely coincident with the remarkable shaded

in different gases. The arc examined in different fluids also supports the original
conclusions.

band in the solar spectrum, which has been designated by the letter P ;
and near this, on the more refrangible side, a much fainter diffuse band,
which also seems to coincide with a part of the solar spectrum sensibly
less luminous than the parts on either side of it. This spectrum is
remarkably persistent at all temperatures of the flame. Watts found
that it did not disappear when the flame was cooled down as much as
possible by diluting the cyanogen with carbonic acid ; and we have
found that it retains its characters when the cyanogen is burnt in
nitric oxide. The flame in the last case must be one of the hottest
known, from the large amount of heat evolved in the decomposition of
cyanogen and nitric oxide, namely, 74,500 and 43,300 units per molecule
respectively. There is in the case of cyanogen, as in the case of so many
other substances, a difference in the relative intensities of the different
parts of the spectrum of the flame at different temperatures, but no
other change of character ; and we are unable to confirm the observa
tion of Watts, that cyanogen burning in oxygen gives only the bands
which we assign to hydrocarbons.        It is true, that in the upper part
of the flame where much or all of the cyanogen is oxidised or decom
posed the spectrum is continuous, but at the base of the flame where it
is issuing from the nozzle we have always seen the nitrocarbon bands,
both when the cyanogen is burning in oxygen and when it is burning
in nitric oxide.                       .
   On the theory that these groups are the product of an exceptional
temperature in the case of the cyanogen flame, it is inconceivable that
they could disappear by combustion in oxygen, instead of in ordinary
air. Our observations accord with the statement of Morren, Pliicker,
Hittorf, and Thalen, that a cyanogen flame, fed with oxygen, when it is
intensely luminous, still yields these peculiar groups.     We have found
these peculiar groupings in the flame when it had      a current of oxygen
in the middle, and was likewise surrounded outside with oxygen.
There is nothing remarkable in observing only a continuous spectrum
from any hydrocarbon or nitrocarbon by using excess of oxygen, as we
know from Frankland's experiments that carbonic acid and water
vapour at the high temperature of flame under compression gives a
continuous spectrum.     In fact, this is what we should anticipate, pro
vided intermediate, and not the final, compounds are the active sources
of the banded spectrum.
   Each of the five sets of bands shown in the diagram is attended on
its more refrangible side by a series of rhythmical lines extending to a
considerable distance, not shown in the diagram, but easily seen in the
photographs.
    Coal gas burning in oxygen gives no bands above that near G within
 the range of the diagram, fig. 1, nor are the visible cyanogen
 bands seen in the flames of many organic compounds containing com
 bined nitrogen ; but beyond this our photographs show a spectrum

of   a character    quite different from that at the less refrangible end.
The most remarkable part of this spectrum is a long series of closely
set strong lines, filling the region between the solar lines R and S,
and ending abruptly with two strong lines a little beyond S. These
are lines of various intensities, not regularly arranged so as to give
shaded bands like those in the less refrangible part of the spectrum.
Beyond these lines there is another large group of lines, not so strong
or so closely set, but sharp and well defined.           It will be a work of
time    to examine     in detail this very striking and peculiar spectrum ;
at present we can only indicate its general character.           We are not yet
sure whether it is produced by pure hydrocarbons, or may not be due
to impurities such as sulphur in the coal gas.*

    Wo have conducted the experiments with carbon tetrachloride with
great care, and numerous repetitions on account of the prominence
given to an experiment with this compound by Mr. Lockyer in a recent
" Note on the                             "
                  Spectrum of Carbon, communicated to the Society, and
because our results in every case differ from those which he obtained.
    The form of sparking tube employed was similar to that used by
¦Salet, and is shown in the annexed diagram, fig. 4.          This was attached
 by thick rubber tubing to a straight glass tube of which one half,
about 6 inches long, was filled with phosphoric anhydride, and the
 other half with small fragments of soda-lime to prevent any chlorine
 from the decomposition of the tetrachloride by the spark from reaching
 the pump.       The pump was connected by rubber tubing to that end of
 the tube which contained soda-lime.          The tetrachloride used had been
 prepared in our own laboratory from carbon disulphide, and frac
 tionated until it had a constant boiling point of 77° C.                Sufficient
 of it was introduced into the sparking tube to fill nearly one quarter
 of the bulb at the end, and the whole interior of the tube thoroughly
 wetted with it in order to facilitate the removal of the last traces of air.
    * Since this passage was written we have found reason to believe that this ft-
 markable spectrum is due not to any carbon compound, but to water.     As this tatf*
 it beyond the scope of the present paper, we purpose dealing with it hereafter in s
 separate communication.    June 8, 1880.

    The Sprengel pump employed differs slightly from those in common
 use.   The reservoir is a globe funnel (a, fig. 5), and the valve formed by
 a glass rod (b) with a conical termination ground into the neck of the
 funnel.    This rod at its upper end passes into an iron ferule (c), which,
 by means of a screw and a small frame fixed at the top of the globe,
 can be raised or lowered at pleasure.        A little below the globe the
 tube expands, and the lower part of the tube enters this expansion,
and terminates upwards in a narrow tube of platinum, round which the
glass is fused. By this means the mercury is continually drawn from
the centre of a mass of mercury, and there is less chance of air descending
with it.     Moreover, as the exhaustion proceeds the part of the tube h,
above    the level of the fall k, becomes vacuous, and is an effectual trap
for any air which may be sucked down with the mercury from the
globe.     The necessity for such a trap is apparent, for when the pump
has been in continued use for two or three days there is always a small
bubble of air collected in h.

    When the tube containing the tetrachloride had been so far exhausted
that little but condensible vapours were pumped out, the bnlb was
heated so as to fill the apparatus with vapour of tetrachloride, the
pump still going, and this was repeated as long as any incondensible
gas was extracted.      Sparks were then passed through the tube for a
short time, the pump still being kept going.          After a short time it
was unnecessary to keep the pump going, as all the chlorine produced
by decomposition of the tetrachloride was absorbed by the soda-lime.
On now examining the spectrnm, no trace of any of the bands we
ascribe to nitrocarbons could be detected, either by the eye or by photo
graphy, however the spark might be varied.              The violet lines of
chlorine described by Salet were more or less visible, coming out
brightly when a condenser was used. Several tubes were treated in this
way, and many photographs taken, but always with the same result :
no trace appeared of either the seven blue, the six violet, the five ultra
violet, or of the still more refrangible bands of the cyanogen flame.     It
is true that all the photographs showed three lines in the ultra-violet,
but these do not at all closely resemble the nitrocarbon bands, they
are not shaded like the nitrocarbon bands.          The least refrangible of
the three is coincident with the middle maximum in the ultra-violet
set of five bands, but the other two do not coincide with other of these
maxima.      When a condenser is used these three lines come out with
much greater intensity, and two other triplets appear on the more
refrangible side, as well as other lines. In order to compare the
positions of these lines with the cyanogen bands, we have taken several
photographs of the spark in tetrachloride simultaneously with a cyano
gen flame, the latter being thrown in by reflexion in the usual way.
Wratten and Wainwright's instantaneous dry plates were used, and
gave a strong picture of the cyanogen flame after three seconds' ex
posure, but in order to ensure getting a picture of all the lines which
the spark could produce, we gave an exposure of three minutes to the
spark. Not one of many photographs so taken showed any traces of
the cyanogen bands. The general character of the violet part of the
spectrum of the spark in carbon tetrachloride taken without a con
denser, but not the exact position to scale of wave-lengths of all the
lines, is shown in Diagram 1, fig. 2.    Fig. 3 of the same diagram shows
the brightest of the additional lines which come out with the use of s
condenser.      Photographs of sparks taken in hydrochloric acid Bhowed
a precisely similar group of ultra-violet lines, so that we have no
 doubt that the three lines which our photographs show amongst the
 five ultra-violet nitrocarbon bands are due to chlorine.
    A bulb tube was next partly filled with tetrachloride, the end drawn
 out to a long narrow neck, and the tetrachloride boiled out in an oil-
 bath (150° C.) so as to expel all air, and the tube sealed off. This
 tube likewise showed no nitrocarbon bands.

1880.]       On the Spectra  of the Compounds    of Carbon, fyc.     501
   A   bulb was then blown in the middle of a piece of narrow glass
tubing, and platinum wires sealed into it ; some carbon tetrachloride
was introduced into the bulb, and a current of hydrogen passed through
the tube at atmospheric pressure ; when the air was judged to be
expelled sparks were passed by means of the wires in the bulb, but no
nitrocarbon bands could be detected. In this case the rapid deposit
of carbon soon brought the observations to a close, but the result was
the same as before.
   Solid trichloride was next tried. It was introduced into a tube
similar to that described above in the first experiment with tetra
chloride, and treated as the tetrachloride had been, the trichloride
being mostly sublimed over into the small bulb shown in fig. 4, b.
The trichloride was found to behave as far as the spectrum is con
cerned very much as the tetrachloride had done. It gave no nitro
carbon bands at all.
   Having satisfied ourselves by repeated trials that pure carbon
chloride if free from nitrogen does not give any of the bands we
ascribe to nitrocarbon compounds, our next step was to determine
whether the addition of nitrogen would bring them out, and if so what
quantity of nitrogen would make them visible.        For this purpose we
first loosened the binding of the rubber tube connecting to the pump a
sparking tube containing tetrachloride, and found to give no nitro
 carbon bands, and, after letting in very little air, immediately closed
it again. On now passing the spark the six violet bands at once ap
peared, and soon became quite bright, the seven blue bands were not
 seen immediately the air was admitted, but they too were in a short
time well seen.
    After trying some other experiments of a similar kind which indi
cated that a very small quantity of nitrogen was sufficient to develope
the nitrocarbon bands in one of these tubes, we introduced a minute
fragment of bichromate of ammonia, carefully weighed, and wrapped
in platinum foil, into the neck of one of the sparking tubes containing
carbon tetrachloride, connected the tube to the Sprengel pump, and
removed the air as before.     On examination of the spark with the
spectroscope   no trace of any nitrocarbon bind could be detected.      A
pinch-cock was now put on the rubber tube, and the bichromate was
heated by a spirit lamp to decomposition (whereby it is resolved into
nitrogen, water, and oxide of chromium). On now passing the spark
the six violet bands were well seen. There was no change in the condi
tion of the coil or rheotome, so that the spark was of the same character
as it had been before when no nitrocarbon bands were visible, and the
change in the spectrum cannot be attributed to any change in the
spark.    The weight of the bichromate was between "0005 and '0006
grm.   ; and the nitrogen this would evolve would fill just about     of a
cubic centimeter at atmospheric pressure.        The tube held 30 cub.

 centims., so that vapour of carbon tetrachloride when mixed with     ^
 part of its volume of nitrogen, gives under the action of the electric
 spark the nitrocarbon bands distinctly. Other similar experiments
 confirmed this result.    It is worthy of remark that the nitrocarbon
 bands were not seen instantaneously on the admission of nitrogen into
 the tube, but were gradually developed, as if it was necessary that a-
 certain quantity of nitrocarbon compound should be formed under the
 influence of the electric discharge and accumulated before its spectrum
 became visible.
               Spark Discharge in  other Compounds of Carbon.
     Some carbon bisulphide was introduced into another tube, which
 was drawn out to a long narrow neck, and the carbon bisulphide
 boiled out in an oil-bath at '200° C, and the tube sealed off.    In the
 spectrum of the spark taken in this tube no nitrocarbon bands,
 either blue or violet, could be detected however the discharge was
varied.
    A similar  tube, containing benzol and similarly treated, showed no-
 trace of the nitrocarbon bands.
    Another tube, containing naphthaline, previously well washed with
dilute sulphuric acid, dried and resublimed, was attached to the
 Sprengel pump, and treated as the tubes with tetrachloride had been.
The spark in this tube likewise showed no nitrocarbon bands.        After
a time the tube cracked, and then the nitrocarbon bands made their
appearance, and on setting the pump going a good deal of gas was
pumped out.        When the air had again been pretty completely
exhausted, the nitrocarbon bands no longer showed, but gradually
reappeared again as air leaked through the crack.          Another tube,
containing   a  mixture  of  naphthaline and benzol, showed   no trace of
the nitrocarbon bands.
    The observation of the nitrocarbon bands in the spectrum of the
spark in naphthaline was one of the reasons which led Watts at one
time to ascribe these bands to carbon only. Naphthaline is not well
adapted to be the snbject of a test experiment in this case, for, from
its mode of preparation, it is liable to be contaminated with nitro
genous bases ; and the tension of its vapour at ordinary temperatures
is so small that, unless the supply is kept up by heating the tube, the
spark soon so far decomposes it that the spectrum is reduced to that
of hydrogen only.     It appears, however, from our experiments, that if
the naphthaline is sufficiently purified and freed from air it does not
furnish the nitrocarbon spectrum.
    As Watts laid much stress on the occurrence of the nitrocarbon
bands in the spectrum of the spark taken in carbonic oxide at atmo
 spheric pressure, though they do not appear in carbonic oxide at
 reduced pressures, as a proof that these bands were due to carbon onlyr

 we have made a series of careful experiments with carbonic oxide
 at atmospheric pressures.
    In our first experiments with this substance the gas was made by
 the action of sulphuric acid on dried formiate of sodium.         The dried
 formiate was placed in a flask (fig. b) fitted with a rubber stopper,
 throngh which passed the tube of a globe funnel, with a stop-cock for
 the admission of the sulphuric acid, and an exit tube for the gas. The
 latter was plugged with asbestos to catch any liquid drops which
 might be thrown up, and was connected by a thick rubber tube to a
 tube of the form shown in fig. 6. That part of this tube marked a
 was filled, one-half with soda-lime to catch acids, and the other half
 with phosphoric anhydride to catch moisture ; the gas, after passing
 through this tube, was burnt as it issued from the narrow opening at b.
The spectrum of the spark was observed through the small bulb blown
on the end. The sulphuric acid was introduced gradually through the
funnel, and the stream of gas allowed to pass through the tube for
a long time. Sparks were passed between the wires, and the spectrum
observed from time to time.         At first the six violet bands were well
seen, and the seven blue bands faintly ; but gradnally, as the air
became more completely expelled, the blue bands disappeared entirely,
and then the violet bands so far died out that it was only by manipu
lating the coil that they could be made visible, and then only very
faintly indeed. A bubble of air, estimated by the length of the tube
it filled to be about        of the volume of gas in the flask and tube,
was now introduced through the funnel, and almost immediately the
bands reappeared brightly.       As the stream of gas however continued,
they   again  gradually died  away until they were represented only by a
faint haze. It was subsequently found that each introduction of fresh

504                    Profs. Liveing and Dewar.               [June  10,
acid into the flask was attended with a marked increase in the bright
ness of the nitrocarbon bands, which died away again when the
current of gas was continued without fresh introduction of acid. On
testing the acid it was found to contain, as is frequently the case with
sulphuric acid, a small quantity of oxides of nitrogen.     Tbia quantity
was, however, so small that the amount of nitrogen introduced at each
introduction of acid must have been but a small portion of the amount
introduced in the bubble of air above mentioned, yet it gave a very
sensible increase in the brightness of the nitrocarbon bands.        The
difficulty of getting all the air expelled from the apparatus led
us next to adopt a modification of this experiment.         The carbonic
oxide was generated by heating in a tube of hard glass in an ordinary
combustion furnace a mixture of pure and dry potassium oxalate with
one quarter of its weight of quicklime, the mixture having been
previously heated for some time so as to expel traces of ammonia.
The rest of the apparatus was similar to that used in the previous
experiment, but in order to expedite the removal of the air the narrow
tube, b, was connected with a Sprengel pump, and the air exhausted
before heating the oxalate.       The distant end of the tube with the
oxalate was    then  heated, and the whole apparatus filled with carbonic
oxide ; it was then again exhausted with the pump, refilled by heating
more oxalate, and the gas allowed to stream out through the pump for
 some time.     The heat was then lowered, sparks were passed and the
 spectrum observed. No trace whatever of the nitrocarbon bands could
 be detected, however the spark might be varied.     The pump was now
 Bet going again, and the pressure of the gas reduced to 1 inch of
 mercury, while the spectrum was observed from time to time. Still no
 trace of the nitrocarbon bands could be detected.   More of the oxalate
 was next heated, and the observations repeated again and again,
 always with the same result.      We came, therefore, to the conclusion
 that carbonic oxide, if quite free from nitrogen, does not give, at the
 atmospheric or any less pressure, the nitrocarbon spectrum.
    From Dr. Watts' account of his experiments, it appeared that he
 had used carbonic oxide prepared by the action of sulphuric acid on
 ferrocyanide, and it was probable that it might have been contaminated
 with nitrogen, or with nitrogenous compounds, from the ferrocyanide.
 We accordingly repeated our experiments with carbonic oxide so
 prepared, and found that the nitrocarbon bands were then always
 distinctly seen.
    We have also repeated Angstrom and Thalen's experiments with the
 spark between carbon poles in nitrogen and carbonic acid gas.        For
 this we used a wide glass tube (fig. 7), to one end of which a quartz
 lens, a, was cemented, while the other was stopped with a cork, through
 which were passed two stout platinum wires with little cones of carbon
 (6), purified in Bunsen's manner, fastened, as shown in the figure, on

1880.]      On the Spectra   of the Compounds    of Carbon, $c.        505
to their ends. Two narrow glass tubes were also passed through the
cork, one reaching the whole length of the bigger tube for the intro
duction of gas, and the other a short one for exit. The tube was first
filled with nitrogen.   On passing the spark we observed, as Angstrom
and Thalen say, that about the poles the nitrocarbon bands were
plainly  seen ; and they were visible through a great range of variations
of the character of the spark ; even the use of a condenser of moderate
size (a litre flask full of sulphuric acid and coated to the neck with
tinfoil) did not diminish them. Photographs were then taken, with
and without the use of the condenser, and these showed the violet and
ultra-violet nitrocarbon bands including those near N and P. The
nitrogen was now swept out by a current of carbonic acid gas, and on
now passing the spark the nitrocarbon bands could no longer be detected,
and photographs taken as before showed no trace of any of them.
    In order further to test the sensibility of the spectroscopic test for
nitrocarbon compounds, and the permanence of such compounds under
variations in the electric discharge, we drew out, so as to form long
narrow necks, both ends of a glass tube of 110 cub. centims. capacity
which had wires sealed into it in the same way as before, and into one of
these necks we introduced a minute quantity, -002 grm., of mercury
cyanide ; a current of hydrogen was then passed through the tube at
atmospheric pressure, and when it was judged that the air must be
thoroughly expelled, the tube was closed by the blowpipe. On passing
the spark no trace of nitrocarbon bands could be seen.        The mercury
cyanide was then heated to decomposition by a spirit lamp.             The
nitrocarbon bands immediately made their appearance, and were well,
even brightly seen, and they did not disappear when a strong spark
from a very powerful induction coil was passed, or even with the use
of a condenser consisting of two such flasks as are above mentioned.
There was no sign of any permanent decomposition of the cyanide-^
the bands continued to show well after the passage of the spark had
been maintained for a long time.       The whole quantity of cyanogen
which the amount of cyanide introduced would give if it were wholly
decomposed, which is not the case at the temperature employed, is less
than -gfo of the volume of the whole tube, i.e., of the hydrogen with
which it was mixed.
    It appears from this experiment not only that the test is an extremely

506                    Profs. Liveing and Dewar.               [June  10.
sensitive one for nitrocarbon compounds, but that cyanogen is far more
permanent under the electric discharge when mixed with a large bulk of
hydrogen than when the discharge is passed through cyanogen alone.
    In all the foregoing experiments the bands which Angstrom and
Thalen ascribe to hydrocarbons were always more or less plainly seen :
and we have come to the conclusion that much more care than has
generally been thought necessary is needed if the last traces of
hydrogen and its compounds are to be removed from spectral tubes.
Indeed, we do not think that all water can be removed from apparatus
and reagents which do not admit of being heated to redness.            To
illustrate this, we may mention one or two experiments.
    Into the bulb of a sparking tube similar in form to that cf fig. 4.
but rather longer, some loose phosphoric anhydride was introduced and
then some well dried and redistilled carbon bisulphide.       The end of
the tube having   then  been drawn  out the carbon bisulphide was boiled
out in an oil-bath at a temperature of 200° O, and the tube sealed off.
On passing the spark without condenser the hydrocarbon bands were
discernible, and on putting on the condenser the hydrogen line C came
out plainly and was identified by comparison with an ordinary vacuum
tube containing hydrogen.      One would have supposed that the phos
phoric anhydride would have retained all the moisture, and that there
could be no other source of hydrogen in the tube.
    In another experiment a mixture of carbonate of sodium and boric
anhydride, previously to admixture heated red hot, was introduced into
one end of a piece of combustion tube, near the other end of which wires
 had been sealed, and the open end drawn out; the mixture was then
 heated, and when it was judged that all the air was expelled, the tube
 was sealed off at atmospheric pressure. On passing sparks through it
 carbonic oxide bands and oxygen lines could be seen, but no hydrogen,
 hydrocarbon, or nitrocarbon bands could be detected.         It appears,
 therefore, that the application of a red heat is likely to prove a more
 effectual means of getting rid of moisture than the use of any desic
 cating agent.
     The first point we have had before ns in these investigations is
 whether the groups of shaded bands seen in the more refrangible part
 of the spectrum of a cyanogen flame, of which the three which can be
 detected by the eye are defined by us in our previous paper on this
 subject by their wave-lengths (4600 to 4502, 4220 to 4158, and 3883 to
 3850), are due to the vapour of carbon nncombined, or, as we con
 clude, to a compound of carbon with nitrogen.
     Now, the evidence that carbon uncombined can take the state of
 vapour at the temperature of the electric arc is at present very imper
 fect.   Carbon shows at such temperatnres only incipient fusion, if so
 much as that, and that carbon uncombined should be vaporised at the
 far lower temperature of the flame of cyanogen is so incredible an

 1880.]       On  the Spectra    of the Compounds     of  Carbon,   Sfc.      507
hypothesis, that it ought not to be accepted if the phenomena admit
of any other probable explanation.            On the other hand, we have
shown that cyanogen or hydrocyanic acid is generated in large quan
 tity in the electric arc taken in nitrogen, and Berthelot has shown
that hydrocyanic acid is produced by the spark discharge in a mix
 ture of acetylene and nitrogen, so that in the cases in which these bands
 shine out with the greatest brilliance, namely, the arc in nitrogen and
the cyanogen flame, we know that nitrocarbon compounds are present.
 Further, we have shown that these bands fade and disappear in pro-
portion as nitrogen is removed from the arc. Angstrom and Thalen
had previously shown the same thing with regard to the discharge
between carbon electrodes ; and the conclusion to which they and we
have come would probably have commanded universal assent if it had
not been for the fact that these bands had been seen in circumstances
where nitrogen was supposed to be absent ; but where, in reality, the
difficulty of completely eliminating nitrogen, and the extreme sensi
bility of the spectroscopic test, had been inadequately apprehended.
    To clear up the question from this point of view, the experiments
now detailed have been made, and they appear to us quite conclusive.
Were the evidence less conclusive than it is, it would still be as rash
and as illogical to conclude from the appearance of the nitrocarbon
bands in a case where nitrogen was presumed, not proved, to be
absent, that they were not due to a nitrocarbon, as it would be
to deny that the well-known yellow lines were due to sodium,
because they had been seen in cases where sodium was supposed to
be absent.      Our argument is an induction from a very long series
of observations which lead up to one conclusion, and hardly admit of
any other explanation.           But Mr. Lockyer attempts to explain the
disappearance      of the   bands   when nitrogen is absent, by the state
ment,    "  that the tension of the current used now brings one set of
flutings   into prominence, and now another."          This is no new observa
tion. It is well known that variations in the discharge produce
variations in the relative intensities of different parts of a spectrum.
Certain lines of magnesium, cadmium, zinc, and other metals, very bril
liant in the spark, are not seen, or are barely seen, at all in the arc. His
remark might be applied to the spectra of compounds as well as to
those of elements.        Variation in the discharge accounts very well for
some of the variations of intensity in the bands if they be duo to a
nitrocarbon ; it will not, however, account for the fact observed by us,
that the bands, or those of them which have the greatest emissive
power, and are best developed by the particular current used, come
out on the addition of a minute quantity of nitrogen, when there is
every reason to think that no variation of the current occurs. *
   * It iB worthy of note, that if we number the sets of bands of the spectrum of
hydrocarbons, beginning with the orange set, and those of cyanogen, beginning with

 508                      Profs. Liveing and Dewar.                    [June      10,
   Much the same may be said with regard to the changes of the
spectrum produced by changes of temperature.              We cannot infer from
any of these changes        that  the  spectrum is not due to a compound.
The bands in question are singularly persistent through a great range
of temperatures, from the temperature of a cyanogen flame cooled by
admixture with carbonic acid gas, as related by Watts (" Phil. Mag.,"
1869, p. 258), to that of the spark of an induction coil with condenser.
   But again, Mr. Lockyer attempts to get over the difficulties of his
case by the supposition        that " the sets of carbon flutings represent
different molecular groupings of carbon, in addition to that or those
which give us the line spectrum."
   Now, until independent evidence that carbon can exist at all in the
state of vapour uncombined at the temperature ot a cyanogen flame
can be adduced, and further independent evidence of the existence of
different groupings in such vapour, the hypothesis here enunciated is
a gratuitous one, so long as any other hypothesis for which inde
pendent evidence can be adduced, as is true of the existence of nitro-
carbon compounds in the flame, arc, and spark, will sufficiently explain
the facts.
   Whether or no the nitrocarbon bands are visible in the solar spectrum
is not in dispute, for we have never hitherto expressed any opinion on
that point. The observation above recorded, that there is in the
spectrum of cyanogen a strong shaded band coincident with the very
characteristic dark shaded band P, strengthens materially the evidence
in favour of the existence of these bands in the solar spectrum ; the
more so, as the series of lines at P has far more of the distinctive
character of the cyanogen spectrum than any other series in the ultra
violet part of the solar spectrum.
   However that may be, we contend against the hypothesis that if
present they can be due to any vapour of carbon uncombined in the
upper cooler region of the chromosphere.           One object of our investi
gations has been to determine the permanence of compounds of non-
metallic elements, and the sensitiveness of the spectroscopic test in
regard to them.       It appeared probable that if such compounds existed
in the solar atmosphere their presence would be most distinctly re
vealed in the more refrangible part of the spectrum, and this is a
subject with which we purpose to deal in a further communication.
In the meantime it is sufficiently clear that the presence of nitrogen
in the solar atmosphere may be recognised through cvanogen when
free nitrogen might escape detection.
   In a footnote of his paper Mr. Lockyer assigns the wave-length 3881
the least refrangible of those shown in our diagram, 6g. 1, then the most persistent
in the hydrocarbon flame-spectrum are 2 and 5, while in the risible part of the-
spectrum of cyanogen they are 3 and 4, but there are conditions of the nitrocarbon
spectrum in which the three lines near G seem to be most persistent.

as  approximately that of the least refrangible edge of the ultra-violet
set  of bands next above K, whereas in our former paper we had given
it as 3883'5. Now, as we have before explained, we have never set
ourselves to the exact determination of wave-lengths, we have rather
used them as convenient handles by which to designate particular
lines ; but a repetition of the measures of our photographs does not
confirm Mr. Lockyer's number.           The photographs were those of the
arc from a De Meritens machine in one of our lime crucibles, and
gave the iron lines well developed ; and we used the iron lines, wave
lengths 3906, 3902, 3898 5, 3894-8, and the pair between 3877 and 3878
as lines of reference.     These measures give, as a minimum, the wave
length 3882-7. In Cornu's map a manganese line is given with the wave
length 3881. None of our photographs show this line, though man
ganese was purposely introduced into the crucible, and the other man
ganese lines came out well and strong.             We shonld not put a deter
mination made in this way against a direct determination of the wave
length by a diffraction grating ; but unless there be an error in the
identification of the iron lines, or Cornu's wave-lengths for those lines
be erroneous, neither of which suppositions is at all probable, we con
clude that the wave-longth is more nearly 3883 than 3881. If this be
correct, the band covers a markedly luminous portion of the solar
spectrum as shown in Cornu's map.
   Mr. Lockyer has forced us to go again over some of the ground
which we had previously traversed, by making such a statement as
the following : —
   " have therefore thought it desirable to go over the ground again,

of impurities. Indeed, I have started upon a somewhat lengthy re
search, and have taken a large number of photographs under various
conditions, so that to rednce them all will be a work of time.              I beg
permission, therefore, in the meantime, to submit to the notice of the
Society an experiment with a tube containing CC14, which, I think,
establishes the conclusions arrived at by prior investigators.            And I
may add that it is the more important to settle the question, as
Messrs. Liveing and Dewar have already based upon their conclusions
theoretical views of a kind which appear to me calculated to mislead,
and which I consider to have long been shown to be erroneous."
   As we have now demonstrated the utterly unsatisfactory character
of the crucial experiment on the strength of which Mr. Lockyer con
demns in so sweeping a manner our conclusions, it is unnecessary to
add any further comment.*
   * Mr. Lockyer  has  communicated to the Society a " Further Note on the Spec
trum of Carbon,"   since the above was written.     We see no reason to modify our
conclusions regarding the carbon spectrum on account of any new facts brought
forward.   The discussion of the paper we leave until a future occasion.

    The following is a preliminary notice of some of the results of ex
 periments which are still in progress.                  As   I hope to publish later a
•detailed    account of the whole investigation,                 it is unnecessary to
 describe here,     in more than brief outline, the apparatus which has
 been employed.
    The wires experimented          on were of soft Japanese iron, drawn in
Japan,     and annealed      shortly before being tested.               Each wire was
stressed separately by being hung vertically from a strong frame,
a tank capable of holding 100 kilos, of water being attached to
the lower end of the wire. The weight of the empty tank was
balanced, so that the stress on the wire was due only to the weight of
water in the tank. The tank was circular and of uniform diameter
from top to bottom, and the stress on the wire was therefore propor
tional to the height of water in the tank. This height was recorded
on a sheet of paper drawn along by a float, which rose as the water
was run in.       A pencil travelled transversely across the paper through
distances proportional to the elongation of the wire.                       In this way a
continuous diagram was automatically drawn, showing the relation of
the strain or elongation to the stress from zero stress up to the
•breaking point.

   Water was run into the hanging tank from a cistern at a consider
able height above it. This gave a convenient means of applying stress
slowly or quickly at will, and at a sensibly uniform rate. When not
otherwise specified, the rate of flow of water into the tank is to be
understood to have been about 1 kilo, in 15 seconds.
   The iron wires were      l'l millim. in diameter, and the length under
test was 250 millims.
   Fig. 1 shows one of the diagrams of a continuous test, in which the
flow of water was continued uniformly at the above rate until the wire
broke.   The horizontal ordinates give the stress in kilogrammes, the
vertical ordinates give the elongation in percentages of the original
length. The line is sensibly straight until the stress is about 21 kilos. ;
after that it curves rapidly but rather irregularly. The breaking stress
in this example was 37'5 kilos., and the final elongation 16 3 per cent.
   Fig. 2 shows the effect of maintaining a constant stress on the wire
for a considerable time. When the stress reached 35 kilos, the flow of

water was stopped, and this load was allowed to remain on the wire
for an interval of 45£ hours, after which the flow of water was resumed
at the same rate as before, and continued until the wire broke.                The
effect  was   most   remarkable.      Instead     of continuing  to   lengthen   at
once when the flow of water was resumed, the wire refused to stretch
further until the stress rose to about 40 kilos. There was, in fact, a
                              " at this
new " limit of elasticity                  point.    When the stress exceeded
40 kilos, the wire ran down rapidly, and finally broke with a load
of 41 kilos, and a total elongation of 13J per cent. The breaking
strength was therefore greater, and the elongation less, than when the
wire was tested continuously.
                                              "
   This effect, which I shall call the hardening effect," depends on
 the length of time during which the test is interrupted. Fig. 3 shows

 than, that shown in fig. 3.
     Experiments have also been made to determine the effect produced
 by completely relieving the wire of stress for a time, and then con
 tinuing the test. Fig. 4 is an example of the effect observed. In this
 example, when the stress reached 35 kilos., the flow of water into the
 tank was stopped, and the tank was- emptied by opening a stop-cock
 at the bottom.       This brought the line in the diagram back to the line
 of no stress. The wire was then left without stress for 19J hours,
 after which water was run into the tank again, at the usual rate, until
 the wire broke.        The result, as may be seen from the diagram, was
 that no considerable lengthening took place until a stress far exceeding
 35 kilos, was reached.           It was not until the stress reached nearly
 40   kilos,  that the wire began to stretch again, and then it stretched
 rapidly,    and  broke with the comparatively small final elongation of
 less than 13 per cent.
     Here the interval of no stress had an hardening effect exceedingly
 similar to the effect prodnced by an interval of constant stress.
     In the test shown in fig. 4 there was a gradually diminishing stress
 on the wire while the tank was being emptied, and a gradually in

 the hardening effect observed was not due to these stresses, made            I
the experiment whose diagram is given in fig. 5. Here the wire was

ran out of the tank at the same rate as in fig- 4, and immediately run
in again.        The circumstances of this experiment were, therefore,
identical with those of the preceding one, except that now there was
no sensible interval during which the stress was nil. There was in
this case a small hardening effect, such as might have been anticipated

from the results mentioned above, but nothing like so much as in
fig. 4. The difference can only be due to the long interval of no
stress.
  An investigation is now being made of the hardening effects of
equal intervals of constant stress and no stress at different points alone
the curve.   So far as the experiments have yet gone, it appears that
outside the so-called elastic limit, that is, for stresses greater than
about 22 kilos., the effect of 19 hours of constant stress is not greatly
different, whether the stress is great or small.   Inside the elastic limit
the effect  of constant  stress is to prolong that limit, that is, the wire
then requires a greater stress to make it begin to stretch considerably.
This effect is greater the nearer to the elastic limit the interval of
constant stress occurs.

during one test we get a stepped curve, having a number of " knees

effects.    It  produces    a  gradual   viscous  elongation,   at  first rapid, after
wards slow.        This shall call for brevity the viscous effect. It also
                              I
produces the hardening effect described in this paper. The hardening
effect, like the viscous effect, is greatest at first.         The viscous effect is
quite   visible   in  the  diagrams.       Thus,  in  figs.    and  2    especially in
                                                                          3,

stress has been constant          and in figs.

stretching during part         of the  time   that  the  water took to run out of
the tank.
   If the viscous effect existed alone, and there were no hardening
effect, a wire would show a higher breaking strength and less final
elongation the more quickly the increase of stress took place.   For,
with a quickly increased stress, the wire would not have time to take
the elongation, and consequently the diminished cross-section proper
to each value of the stress.
   If, on the other hand, the hardening effect existed alone, a wire
would show a higher breaking strength and less final elongation the
more slowly the increase of stress took place.

   We may, therefore, expect that whenever the viscous effect is great
relatively to the hardening effect, a wire will show to greater advan
tage as regards its breaking strength, and to less advantage as
regards its elongation, when tested quickly than when tested slowly.
This is probably the case with tin, copper, and other metals in which
the viscous effect is great,    [I have not tested tin wires, but copper
and also brass wires show a perceptible hardening effect under con
stant stress, much less, however, than that shown by soft iron.]
    When, on the contrary, the hardening effect is great relatively to
the viscous effect, a wire will show to greater advantage as regards
breaking strength, and to less advantage as regards elongation the
more slowly it is tested.      This is the case with soft iron, at least in
circnmstances like those of the above experiments.
    The experiments show that even snch variations in the rate of
applying stress, or such intermissions of stress as are liable to occur
in practical testing, are sufficient to affect most materially the results
of the test.
     A batch of specimens cut from the same coil, and similarly treated
in every way, give very closely accordant results when tested with the
same rate of increment of stress. The examples quoted above are all
taken from the same batch of specimens. One peculiarity is common
 to them and to all the other specimens in the same batch, namely, the
 double curvature, which appears in the diagrams soon after the limit
 of elasticity has been passed. On the other hand, other specimens cut
 from the same bundle of wire, but annealed at another time, do not
 show this peculiarity.

    The examples given may fairly be taken as representative of a large
 number of tests. I am now extending the experiments ; but it appeared
to me that the results already arrived at were of sufficient interest to
 excuse their presentation in this somewhat crude form.

    The object of this paper is to present in a shortened and simplified
form the processes and the results of Abel's famous memoir, " Sur
une propriute generale d'une classe tres-etendue de fonctions trans-
cendantes," composed and offered to the French Institute in 1820,
but first published in the " Memoires des Savans Etrangers " for
 1841.

   516        Mr. R. C. Rowe.          Memoir on Abels Theorem.         [June  10,
       The generality and the power of this memoir are well known, but
   its form is not attractive.          Boole, indeed, in a paper on a kindred
   snbject ( Phil.     Trans,  for 1857, pp. 745—803 ) says, " As presented
  in the writings of Abel . . . the doctrine of the comparison of
  transcendants is repulsive, from the complexity of the formulae in
  which its general conclusions are embodied."            Boole's theorems, how
  ever, escape this charge only with loss of the generality which makes
  Abel's valuable.
      But this complexity is rather apparent than fundamental. It is
  attempted, by rearrangement of parts, by separation of essential from
  non-essential steps, by changes of notation, in particular by the
  introduction of a symbol and a theorem discussed by Boole in the
  paper already referred to, and by the addition of examples of the pro
  cesses and results, to reduce this part of an important subject to a
  shape more simple, while no less general, than the original.
      Of the three sections which compose the paper the first contains the
  discussion     of the main question,
      Is it always possible   to establish  between the values for different vari
  ables of the integral of an algebraic function however complex, algebraic
 relations, the variables themselves being connected by any requisite alge
  braic lares  ?
     If, for  example,                fXdx=¥(x),
  where X is an algebraic function of x, rational or irrational, in
 tegral or fractional, is it necessarily possible by connecting r^, x^,
 . . . xn by any requisite        algebraic laws to obtain an algebraic (or
 logarithmic) expression for the sum F(x1) +F(:r2) + . . . +F(z») ?
     This question is suggested on the one hand by such well-known
 results as
          F(x1) + ~F(x2) = constant, where      X=-^==, if      x^ + x^t^l,
 and        F(j,)   + F(a;2) + F(ai3)=0 where     X=^=p===
 if       (1         (1
                        - V) (i -O = (2-xl*-xf—t*            + *V^V)S       ;
 and on the other hand by the possibility of finding algebraical ex
pressions for many symmetric functions of the roots of equations,
though these roots may not be separately determinable.
     This combination of the theory of integrals and the theory of equa
tions     furnishes in fact the key to the problem, as enabling us to
                  " requisite algebraic laws " very concisely by a single
express the
equation of which the variables are roots, and whose coefficients are
not independent but connected by a corresponding number of re
lations.

    The notation is this : —
    We first, to escape the inconvenience of irrational and fractional
 forms, introduce two functions, /, \i where X, the subject of integra
 tion =/(», y), y being determined as a function of x by the equation
                 x(*.2/)^2/"+J'i2/""1+      • •  +Pn-tf+p«=0,
 where   P\,Pt • • •  P* are rational integral functions of x, and x there

 necessarily integral.     This assumption will cover all       cases.

                                             y
    We next change f(x, y)       so that  its denominator shall be the pro
 duct of x(y), the differential coefficient of x with respect to y, and a
 function of x only, and write

    This is shown to be always possible.
    We then introduce the equation whose roots are the variables of the
 functions we add. This equation is obviously not arbitrary. It is
 necessary and sufficient to take the result of eliminating y between x
 and any other function of x, y which by the use of x can be made of
  (at most) the n— 1th degree in y.
    Let this function be
                       e(2/)=?»-i2/"_1+     • • •  +2iy + ?o.
 and let the result of elimination be called E.
    Here       qn-o, . . . qx, qg are rational integral functions of x, and E
is a function of x and of their coefficients.
    It may happen that, owing to relations between these coefficients,
 the equation E=0 is satisfied by values of x independent of them.
 Let F0(z) be the product of the corresponding factors, and write
    It only remains to define a symbol 9, used by Boole in his paper on
the comparison of transcendants.          The following is his definition : —
 " If <p(x)f(x) be any function of x composed of two factors 0(«),
f(x), whereof <p(x) is rational, let

     This formula is more general than either of Boole's, while                  it seems
more concise and intelligible than that of Abel to which                        it corre
sponds.
     The rest of this section is occupied with the application of the
theorem to several simple cases.                 Those have been chosen of which
the resulte were well known (e.g., the circular and elliptic functions),
with a view to the comparison of method.
     In  the second        section    it is shown to follow from the results of
             I
Section that the sum of any number of integrals of the form con
sidered may be expressed in terms of a number of such integrals equal
to the number of conditions necessarily connecting the variables in
the proposition already discussed ; and the question is investigated.
      What is the least value of which this number of conditions is susceptible ?
     It  is   proved     independent        of everything but the form of the
equation x(*> y)       —   0  by  which    y is determined as a function of x ; the
                                                                                        ™i
answer being that            if this equation has          roots of the form y = Cx^l,

     The expressions for the roots are according to descending powers of

 the series                etc., are   in descending order of magnitude      ;   and this
equality of powers in sets is shown to subsist.
     This section concludes with an example of its processes.
     The third section contains three distinct parts : first, a generalization
of the theorem of Section             I, showing that a similar expression to that
   * Cauchy had used in his " Calcul des Rfisidus " a
                                                          symbol which only differs from
this H in the absence of the subtractive term last mentioned.

I. " Notes of Observations on Musical Beats." By Alexander
       J. Ellis, B.A., F.R.S., F.S.A. Received May 28, 1880.
    During the last three years I have been greatly occupied with
observing and counting musical beats, for the purpose of discovering
the cause and amount of error in Appnnn's reed tonometer, and of
measuring the number of vibrations made in a second by tuning-forks
and organs, as materials for my " History of Musical Pitch." *                    The
following are brief notes of some of the observations then made : —
    When two musical notes nearly but not accurately form a con
sonance, or are in unison, they beat.              Under ordinary circumstances
the number of beats in a second of a disturbed unison is equal to the
difference of the number of double vibrations in a second made by
each note.     It is not so always, as will be shown later on. If x and               j
be the
          "         " or number of vibrations in a second, made
            pitch                                                             by two
musical tones, of which y is the sharper; then, if my — nx = 0, the
tones form what I have termed a considence, that is, the nth partial of
x falls on the same rank or seat as the in th partial of y.            Considences
are not always consonances, because other partials of the notes may
 beat roughly, as when m : n—8 : 9 or 9 : 10 or 15 : 16, which are well
 known dissonances, bnt give appreciable considences. But if the pitch
 of either x or y be slightly altered, so that my—nx=+b, the two
 considcnt partials become what I have termed dissident, or placed on
 different ranks or seats, and b beats in a second are heard, being called
 "sharp" when positive, that is when my>nx, and "flat" when
 negative, that is when my<nx.             This includes the unison for which

m=n.     Hence all beats heard are beats of simple partial tones, however
compound      may be the tones which contain them.             This agrees
thoroughly with my observations.
   Tuning-forks are comparatively simple but always possess an audible
second partial or octave, and sometimes higher partials still, capable
of being so reinforced by resonance jars properly tuned to them, that
beats can be separately obtained from them and counted.            This is a
matter of great importance in the construction           of a tuning-fork
tonometer.     When the tone is very compound, as in the case of bass
reeds (especially those of Appunn's tonometer, furnished with a
bellows giving, when properly managed, a perfectly steady blast for
an indefinite length of time), beats can be obtained and counted from
the 20th to the 30th and even the 40th partial, without any reinforce
ment by a resonance jar.
                                I
   Taking tuning-forks first, find it advantageous to hold the beating
forks over one or two resonance jars, tuned, by pouring in water, to
the pitch of the partial to be observed, whether it be the prime of
both or the prime of one and the second (or octave) of the other.
There may be small differences, but      I have not found any difference
appreciable by my methods of observation in the number of beats in
a second, whether the resonance jar is the same or different for the
two forks, and whether it is exactly or very indifferently tuned to each
fork, but a tolerably accurate tuning much improves the tone and
length of the beat. In that case the resonance jar practically quenches
all other partial tones, anil the beats are distinctly heard as loudnesses
separated by silences.     If no jar is used, the other partials are heard.
In the case of the octave, the low prime becomes a drone and fills up
the silences. In the case of beating primes, the octaves, which are
beating twice as fast, tend to confuse the ear. Sometimes the second
partial of a fork is so much stronger than the prime, that when the
fork is applied to a sounding-board, only the octave is heard, which is
inconvenient.     This ie entirely avoided by the resonance jar. Beats
being a case of interference, the amplitude of the beating partials
should be equalised as much as possible. With two forks of very
different size and power, it is easy to regulate the amplitude by hold
ing the louder fork further from the jar. Otherwise the beats become
blurred and indistinct. For powerful reeds or organ pipes, beating
with forks, it is best to go to a considerable distance from the reed or
pipe and hold the fork close to the ear or over a jar. I find 30 or
40 feet necessary for organs ; in Durham Cathedral, where the
pressure of wind was strong and my forks weak, I found 60 or 70 feet
distance much better.      As I was not able latterly to go to a distance
from Appunn's reed tonometer, having to pump it myself, I found it
impossible   to count the primes    of the upper reeds by the octaves of
my forks, which were completely drowned.

522                           Mr. A.  J.  Ellis.                 [June   17,
    I find beats of all kinds most easy to count (by the seconds hand
of a chronometer) when about 4 in a second. They can be counted
well from 2 to 5 in a second. Above 5 they are too rapid for accu
racy ; below 2 and certainly below 1, they are too slow, so that it is
extremely difficult to tell from what part of the swell of sound the
beat should be reckoned1.      Partly from this reason, perhaps, I have
found great variety in counting successive sets of such slow beats.        I
never use beats of less than one in a second, if    I can avoid it. When
the beats are slow it is difficult to discover by ear which of the two
beating tones is the sharper ; and even fine ears are often deceived.
It is easy to discover, however, by putting one of the forks under the
arm for a minute.      This heats and flattens it by 2 or 3 beats in 10
seconds. Hence if the beats with the heated fork are slower, it was
sharper, because it has been brought nearer the other ; if faster, it
was flatter and has been brought further away.         Count for 10, 20, or
40 seconds, according to the fork. Up to 20 or 30 beats in 10 seconds it
is easy to count in ones, but from 30 to 50 it is best to count in twos,
as one-ee,  two-ee, Ac, beginning with one, and hence throwing off one
at the end.    When counting for 20 seconds I always count in twos,
and for 40 seconds in fours, as one-ee-ah-tee, two-ee-ah-tee, <tc, be
cause I have to divide the result by 20 or 40 ; and this division is
avoided by the count itself.      Owing to difficulties in beginning and
ending the count, I find the possible error per second to be 2 divided
by the number of seconds through which the connt extends ; and that
it is best to take a mean of 5 to 10 counts for each set of beats.
    Temperature plays an important part. Forks should not be touched
with the unprotected hand ; they otherwise easily flatten by 2 beats
in 10 seconds. Interpose folds of paper. I use two folds of brown
paper stitched between two pieces of wash-leather.         Large forks are
generally on resonance boxes and need not be touched, otherwise the
same precautions should be used, as they are very sensitive, and retain
the heat longer than small forks. Scheibler's forks are fitted with
 wooden handles.     In tuning, the file heats and flattens ; the result,
 therefore, can seldom be known for a day or two, when the forks have
 cooled and " settled," as they will be sure to " jump up.''        I find it
 best to leave off filing when the forks are1 two or three tenths of a
 vibration too flat. In sharpening there is, therefore, great danger of
 doing too much, as the fork remains apparently at the same pitch, the
 flattening by heat balancing the sharpening by filing.          Hence all
copies should be compared some days after, by means of a third fork
about four vibrations flatter or sharper than each, to avoid the slow
beats of approximate unisons.       The filing also seems to interfere with
the molecular arrangement of the forks.
    The thermometer should be always consulted when beats are taken.
But if the beats are between two forks, of which the pitch of one at a

given temperature is known, and both forks may be assumed to be
altered in the same ratio by heat, then the temperature need not be
observed ; but the unknown fork may be presumed to be as many
vibrations sharper (or flatter) than the measured fork at the tempera
ture at which the latter was measured, as beats in a second were
observed to take place.       This is because the alteration is very small,
and would be quite inappreciable for the few vibrations between them.
But for tonometrical purposes an allowance must be made.
    The coefficient of temperature has not been satisfactorily determined.
It varies from '00004 to '00006 for each vibration and each degree
Fahrenheit. Possibly the mean '00005 is the best number to take,
but I have used 1-^21000 ='0000476.                The flattening seems to be
chiefly due to the effect of temperature on elasticity. A large fork
of about 435'44 vibrations at 59° F., grew sharper and beat more and
more brightly as the temperature descended to 10° or 15° F., being
easily counted for 20 seconds and more.              At 104° F. it could scarcely
 be counted for 20 seconds, at 112° F. -scarcely for 10 seconds, and at
 164° F. I could not count it at all, the sound not lasting more than
 2 or 3 seconds, and the beats varying during that time.                     The effect
 also seems to vary with the metal and make of the fork and its size,
 and the coefficient to be greater for high than for low temperatures.
 For a fork of about 256 vibrations at 59° F., the coefficient from 14°
 to 59° F. was about '0000305 or l-f-32,760, but from 59° F. to 175° F.
 about '0000548 or 1-i- 18,280.         These experiments, which I made by
 dipping the forks in freezing mixtures and hot water, and beating them
 with a fork at mean temperature, are unsatisfactory.                     In the same
 way M. Aristide Cavaille-Coll, the well-known organ-builder of Paris
 (private letter), experimenting on two forks of about 435 vibrations,
one of Scheibler's and one a large-sized diapason normal, found —

    These are practically the same, but it is the latter which he uses in
 his reductions. Professor McLeod by his machine ("Proceedings," 1871*,
 vol. xxviii, p. 291, and " Phil. Trans.," 1880, p. 1) at first obtained a
 result nearly identical with Koenig's, but afterwards, when experiment
 ing on one of my forks of about 440 vibrations, he found (private letter)
the coefficient to be -00004882= 1h- 20,490. While Professor Alfred
 Mayer (private letter) by repeated experiments on Koenig's and other
forks, exposed to the cold of American nights, and counted by beats
 with forks at mean temperature, obtained the coefficient -00004o45=
 l-r- 22,000, and I adopted 1-^-21,000 as a mean of those of Professor
McLeod and Professor Mayer.' The error must certainly be very
small for all Scheibler's forks.
    For organ pipes where great exactness does not seem to be possible,
I  find the coefficient -00104 for 1° F. and 1 vibration quite sufficiently
accurate and to give concordant results generally.              In some organs
where the air for blowing is     cooler  than the   air of the room,   this is too
large, according to the observations of Mr. A. J. Hipkins, at St. James'
Hall, the coefficient is nearer '0005 (private letter). In taking the
pitch of organ pipes by measured forks, I usually neglect the small
alterations of the pitch of the fork, and allow fully for the change of
pitch in the pipe. It is probable that this coefficient does not answer
for the stopped and fancy pipes.        I have applied it only to open, and
generally    metal cylindrical pipes.
    To construct the fork tonometer, invented by J. Heinrich Scheibler
(6. 1777, d. 1837), a silk manufacturer at Crefeld, obtain a set of about
70 good forks with parallel prongs, and of a tolerably large size ; tune
the lowest to about the C (or B for English high pitch) between the bass
and treble staves of any organ or piano, and tune the rest roughly each
about four beats in a second sharper than the preceding.           Then fit them
with wooden collars or handles, and allow them to rest for three months,
if possible in the same temperature at which they will be counted.
This was not the process adopted by Scheibler, but is much simpler.
Then count the beats between each set most carefully, at a temperature
which remains as uniform as possible.           It may be necessary to use a
high temperature; thus Scheibler's was from 15° R. to 18° R. = 65"75
to 72=-5 F., which I reckon at 69° F. as a mean ; and Koenig now works
at 20° C. = 68° F., but announces that his former 256 vibrations was
only correct at 20°-2 C.=79°-16 F. ("VVied. Ann.," 1880, p. 413.) Count
on one day the beats between forks 1 and 2, 3 and 4, Ac, and on

 another between forks 2 and 3, 4 and 5, &c, so that the same fork is
 not nsed for two counts on the same day. Excite by striking with a
 soft ball of fine flannel wound round the end of a piece of whalebone,
 as a bow is not convenient unless the forks are tightly fixed.            Each
 blow or bowing heats, and hence flattens, and this tells if the experi
 ments on any one fork are long continued.             Count each set of beats
 for 40 seconds if possible, and many times over, registering the tem
 perature and the beats, and take the mean.             Scheibler counted by a
 graduated    metronome,     set constantly  to  an  astronomical   clock, when
 the weight was at 60, to eliminate the effect of temperature, and he
 altered the position of the weight (finally by a micrometer screw) so
 that there were always four beats to each swing of the pendulum.            He
 seems to have attained extraordinary accuracy.            Having counted all,
 observe those forks which are near the octave of the lowest fork.
 Find two such, beating with the octave (that is, the second partial
 tone) of the lowest fork less than they beat with each other.         Then the
 sum of all the beats from the lowest fork to the lower of the two forks,
 added to the beats of the octave (that is, the second partial tone) with
 that fork, is the pitch of the lowest fork. Hence the pitch of all the
forks is known. The extra high forks are for verifying by the octaves
of several low forks, and for the purpose of subsequently measuring.
From such a tonometer any other can be made, and the value of each
fork at another temperature calculated.
    Scheibler made a 52-fork tonometer with infinite trouble, on another
plan, and counted it with marvellous accuracy.           This tonometer, which
I  have made many efforts to find, has absolutely disappeared and his
family knows nothing of it. But he left behind him a 56-fork tono
meter, believed to proceed from 220 to 440 vibrations, and through the
kindness of Herr Amels, an old friend of the Scheibler family, who
obtained it from Scheibler's grandson,         I  have had the use of it for a
year.    I had   to count  it as well as I could,  just as if it had been a set
of forks such as I have described, and        I  found it was not what was
thought, but that only 32 sets of beats were 4 in a second, and the
other 23 sets varied from 38 to 42 in 10 seconds. I found also that
the extremes were probably of the same pitch as in the original 52-fork
tonometer.       After then counting it as well as I could, and obtaining
219-27 vibrations in place of 219 67, at 69° F., I distributed the error
of 4 beats in 10 seconds, as 2 in 100 seconds, among 20 of the 23 sets
•which were not exactly 4 beats in 10 seconds, leaving the first 3 sets,
which I had repeatedly counted and felt sure of, unaltered.              Then I
reduced all the values from 69° to 59° F. Finally to verify my result
I  measured by beats with Scheibler's forks as thus determined ; first
5 large forks of various pitches, which I had had made for me in
Paris, and then 4 forks of Koenig's belonging to Professor McLeod.
Professor McLeod himself kindly measured all of them, also, by his

526                           Mr. A.  J. Ellis.                [June   17,
machine, and Professor Mayer, of the Stevens Institute, Hoboken, New
Jersey, U.S., kindly measured the first 5 forks by his electrogTaphic
method, both with the greatest care and precaution.        The three sets
of measurements agreed to less than 1 beat in 10 seconds, and more
often less than 1 beat in 20 seconds, when reduced to the same tempera-
ture.   Thus the value of the tonometrical measurement by beats only,
and the possibility of counting a tonometer sufficiently, was fully estab
lished.   Koenig's measurements of his own forks reduced to 59c F.,
and of the actual     Diapason Normal at the Conservatoire, Paris, in
tended 'to be used at the same temperature, also agree with mine
within less than the same limits. By these forks I have counted 75
standard forks of Messrs. Valantine and Carr, music smiths, 76, Milton
Street, Sheffield, who are thus in a position to make small copies,
probably not more than half a vibration wrong at most, at a cheap
rate.
   When forks are counted without a resonance jar, they should not
be applied to a sounding board, or held one to one ear and one to the
other, but should both be held about six inches from the same ear,
and their strengths should be equalised by holding the weaker fork
closer to the ear than the stronger.
   When the forks are screwed on and off a sounding board or resonance
box, there is great danger of wrenching the prongs, unless they are
held below the bend, but I have constantly seen this precaution
neglected.     A wrench immediately affects the pitch and duration of
sound of a    fork, and renders it comparatively worthless.    Such cases
have come within my observation.         The next enemy to be guarded
against is rust.     Forks should be kept dry, and occasionally oiled
with gun-lock oil. Rust towards the tip affects the fork much less
than rust at the bend. My observations and experiments show that
errors from rust can scarcely exceed a flattening of 1 vibration in 250,
and are generally very much less.        But as the amount is uncertain,
rust spoils a fork for accurate tonometrical purposes.
   My observations on reed tones are confined to those in Appunn's
tonometers at the South Kensington Museum, the Museum of King's
College, London, and Lord Rayleigh's, where there are copies, all of
which I have counted. They consist of oblong boxes containing the
reeds placed side by side. The wind pumped into a large reservoir, is
driven from it by a spring, and received into this box, the heavy lid of
which, separated from the body by the usual bellows-folds of leather,
presses on the wind and drives it on the reeds with a very constant
pressure.    Below each reed is a pallet which, when pulled out by a
valve to its full extent, allows the reed to sound at its highest pitch to
which it is tuned. If the pallet be slid in somewhat, the pitch can be
flattened by as much as two vibrations without much affecting the
quality of tone, and even as much as three vibrations with considerable

loss    in quality. This power of reducing the pitch slightly and
instantly restoring it, is of great service in experiments upon consi-
dence and dissidence, which the relations of the pitch of the reeds
allow of being tried in a very large number of cases.              It also enables
considences to be rendered perfect when the instrument, as is neces
sary generally the case, is slightly out of tune, as the intervals can be
made closer by flattening the upper, and wider by flattening the lower
reed.

     The correctness of these numbers had to be proved in the first place
by counting the beats. The sum of the various sets of beats in the
treble tonometer      should be 256, in the tenor tonometer            128, in the
bass tonometer, from 8 to 16, 8 beats        ;   from   16 to 32, 16 beats;   from
32 to 64, 32 beats     ; from 64 to   128, 64 beats.      I counted   the beats in
the treble tonometer at South Kensington several times.                   On 27th
October, 1876, each set of beats being counted for 20 seconds, obtained I
256 exactly.       From 5th to 24th September, 1877, I counted each set
of beats for a minute, and many times over, and, owing to alterations
in the pitch of the reeds, the beats varied from 3"85 to 4 27 in a second,
their sums being 256'27. On 25th and 28th September, 1877, 1 again
counted each set for one minute, and obtained 256-28 as the sum.                On
the 10th and 12th September, 1877, I counted the beats on Lord
Rayleigh's copy, and found the sum 256'38. My count of the King's
College copy, 13th November to 20th December, 1877, at two minutes
for each      set, gave 254-75, and was certainly erroneous.            The beats

 counted.    Of thirty determinations of I thus made for the South
  Kensington instrument, the highest was 256'65, the lowest, 253 05,
  and the mean, 255'85.     Hence the value of I could apparently be not
  far from 256, its nominal value.             But when compared with an
  Utj of  Koenig's,  the reed   beat  2'4 flat.   Supposing Koenig's fork to
  have been 256 truly, this made Appunn's Z=253'6, far less than any of
 my counts and most of my calculations. Lord Rayleigh and Mr. R. H.
 M. Bosanquet had already suggested to me that the confined air in the
 box of the tonometer, and the vibration of the whole instrument
 during the beats, " drew the notes. I believe they thought that it
                             "
 altered the pitch of the notes, and hence the number of the beats.            I
 began to entertain the same opinion, and devised the following ex
 periment, the Lords of the Committee of Council on Education allow
 ing me to remove the treble and tenor tonometers from South Kensing
 ton to the Museum of King's College, where Professor W. G. Adams,
 F.R.S., allowed me to compare these instruments with those in the
 Museum for many weeks.            Suppose L, M, N, are adjacent reeds on
 one instrument, and L', M', N' reeds of nominally the same pitch on
 the other.   Practically, they were not quite of the same pitch, a cir
 cumstance which showed inaccuracy of construction.             Then I took
 the beats between L and M, M and N, and thus by addition obtained
the internal beats between L and N, that is, those which occurred
within the box of the tonometer.          When I took the beats between L
 and M', M' and N, and thus obtained the external beats between L and
N, that  is,beats which were formed in the uncompressed atmosphere of
the museum external to the tonometers, the number of the internal
 beats always exceeded that   of    the external.   On taking a mean of my
observations, which extended to every set of beats,         I   found that  I
could  reduce  the  internal   to  the  external  by diminishing the number
of the internal beats by 76 in 10,000.       I    was not completely satisfied
with the accuracy of my observations, or with what        I   considered the
rather hazardous mean, but was unable to repeat the very long course of
observations.  In November, 1879, however,     was able to examine
                                                      I
every reed in all the tonometers by means of Scheibler's forks, and         I
found that the nominal values of the reeds in the treble tonometer
could be reduced to those of the forks by a mean subtraction of 76
in 10,000 in the tenor tonometer (which was altogether flatter), by a
            ;
mean subtraction of 83 in 10,000 in the bass tonometer, octave 64
                                        ;
to 128, by a mean subtraction of 76 in 10,000; octave 32 to 64, of 64

uncertain to deduce   a mean. These results singularly well confirm the
former.    The nominal values had been deduced from observed internal
beats of reed with reed the external beats agreed whether they were
                          ;
taken between reed and reed, or reed and fork.       It certain, there
                                                           is
fore, that the internal beats were accelerated, whether the pitch of the

  1880.1            Notes of Observations on Musical Beats.              529
 reedg     themselves  was raised or not;     I  think it was not. But the
 nominal value, depending        on the accelerated beats was, of course,
  increased, and the experiment of the forks shows that it was increased
 exactly in the ratio of the internal to the external beats. At any rate,
 therefore, if the pitch of the tones was increased, it was not caused by
 the confined air acting upon a single speaking reed, but was occasioned
 by the joint action of two speaking reeds.
     This joint action was very powerful. It shook the whole instrument
 violently. When reeds 256 and 260 (I cite them always by their
 nominal value) were sounded together, at first only a crash was
 audible, but after about a second the ear could distinguish the beating
 of the two primes, closely resembling the beating of two tuning-forks
 held over resonance jars, but accompanied throughout by a great crash,
 which made the simple beats difficult to keep well in the ear. This
 was totally different from the effect when a fork was substituted for
 one of the reeds. The simple beats remained, but the crash dis
 appeared.       Moving of the head caused considerable difference in the
 loudness of the simple beats, due perhaps, to placing the ear at or near
 a node of the sound wave, and removing it again.          It was useless to
 attempt to count the beats till these simple beats were well recognised.
 As   I  ascended the scale, the crash became less. It was much less for
 reeds 272 and 276, and the contrast of these beats with those of 256
 and 260 on the one hand, and 288 and 292 on the other, was very
 striking.      For reeds 320 and 324 the crash was comparatively faint.
 I  could not distinguish the beats of the second partials or octaves from
 the general crash arising from the beats of all the other partials. The
 beats of the primes were quite separate, slow (4 in a second) and
 distinct, and they seemed to give the time to the other beats. For
reeds 376 and 380, the beat of the primes overpowered the crash,
 which became comparatively light, and after this point, the beats of
the primes were always easy to find.            From reeds 412 and 416, the
beats of the primes were the principal phenomena, and after 492 and
496, the beats were practically simple.
    In the tenor and bass tonometers, the beats were still more dis
tressing to the ear, for even for single notes the upper partials beat
clearly and slowly enough, after reed 64, to be distinctly perceived as
beats    ; and the beats of two reeds sounded almost like a continually
reiterated feti de joie. Below reed 16, the primes could not be heard
at all, but down to 8 the beating upper partials could be heard.
    The effect of the external beats on the ear was distinctly different
from the effects of the internal beats.      The surge of the other partials
was not so strong, and the beats were much easier to count.          At one
time    I  placed the two tonometers fully 50 feet apart, and stood half
way    between    them to count the beats, which were remarkably clear,
the surge becoming       indistinct, very like that of the distant waves on

a sea-shore, and forming a running accompaniment, totally dissimilar
from the boll-like beat of the partials.
    The pitch of the reeds on the treble tonometer furnishes not only
numerous cases of considences, but numerous cases of disturbed consi-
dences, beating four times    in a second, when the reeds are    in order. Thus
3 X 256=2 x 384, and hence 256 and 384 are a perfect considence.            But
3 x 260-2 x 388= + 4, so that 260 and 388 form a disturbed Fifth, beat
ing 4 times in a second, the upper note being too flat; while 3 x 260 — 2 x
392= —4, another disturbed Fifth, also beating 4 times in a second, the
upper note being too sharp. The fact of the upper note being too flat or
too sharp is shown immediately by flattening it, as previously described ;
 the first beats are then made more rapid and the second more slow, but
it is impossible to destroy them entirely, as the upper note cannot be
 sufficiently flattened.   It is delightful, however, to take what should
 be a perfect considence, as all were when        I first examined the instru
 ment, and throw it out of tune by flattening either the upper or lower
 note, or both unequally, producing the dissident beats, and then to
 sharpen these notes gradually, and listen to the beats growing slower
 and slower till they finally entirely disappear, and then reappear as
 the sharpening is carried too far. The nature of considence and dissi-
 dence is thus distinctly felt, and the. delimitation of a considence is
  determined by the possibility of hearing these dissident beats when
 one of the extreme notes is flattened.         The beats are clear, distinct,
  and simple, and can be made very slow ; their pitch is also exactly
  what has to be expected by the number of the partials.               The other
  partials of the two notes    in the meantime beat roughly, strongly, and
  very much faster than the dissident beats. Thus for the Fourth 4 : 3,
  we may take reeds 264 and 352, then the partials         will be —
            (1)        (2)         (3)        (4)          (5)

     Even when the 1,056 is consident, the 88 beats of 704 and 792, and
  of 1,320 and 1,408 are easily heard, producing the well-known
  " roughness " of the Fourth, while the 264, 352, and 528 boom along
  loudly and independently.       But if the upper note is flattened, the rate
  of the two first beats is altered, one becoming faster and the other
  slower, while slow beats of an entirely different character are intro
  duced at the high pitch of about 1,056, by the tearing apart of these
  formerly coincident partials.      I have watched the phenomenon over
  and over again for different considences, and cannot imagine a better
   demonstration of Helmholtz's theories.
      The following, among numerous other considences, have all been
   clearly delimitated by me in the way mentioned, and most of the

difficult, on account of the great roughness of the intervening beats,
and succeeded best in the highest case, reeds 480 and 512. The Major
 Sevenths 16 : 9 and 15 : 8, however, baffled me, from the excessive
roughness of the other beats. I have frequently shown these effects to
others, and as the instruments are accessible at the South Kensington
Museum, they can easily be repeated.*
    In counting the beats of the reeds with forks, I was unable to use
the octaves of the forks, as they were entirely drowned by the primes
 of the reeds, and hence above reed 440 I was obliged to use other forks
 which had heen previously counted with the octaves of Scheibler's
 forks; but below reed 220               I always counted by the partials of the
 reeds.     By this means I was able to determine the pitch as far as 12
 vib. in a sec, with tolerable certainty. Occasionally determined the I
 pitch of a single reed by means ef several partials, beating, of course,
 with the primes of different forks. The following table gives the
 nominal numbers of some of these low reeds, with the partials used,

   After reed 12 the results were very uncertain. After reed 32 the
primes were scarcely audible, and after reed 15 they were utterly
inaudible.  All that could be distinguished was the thumping of the
beats of the upper partials, and these became gradually fainter and
fainter, but were always audible even for reed 8.
   The mode of finding the proper forks for any partials of reeds was
simple, since the approximate pitch of the reed and the actual pitch of
the fork were known. Thus for reed 12, the 20th partial would be
nearly 20 x 12=240, and hence would lie between the forks 239-66 and
235'C9.            I
          On trial found the beats to be respectively 2-00 and l-96
(the last a mean of several counts).   Then 239*66— 20 X reed 12=
200, and 20x reed 12-235-69=1-96.        These give 20 x reed 12=
237'66 and 237-65 respectively, and consequently reed 12=118*
vibrations. The ease and certainty with which the partials could thus
be picked out was delightful to observe.   As no resonance boxes or
jars were used for the reeds, the objection sometimes made, that
such partials are created by multiple resonances within the resonance
cavity itself, falls to the ground, and the practical objective existence
of the partials is established.    The practical coincidence of the values
of the prime from several distinct partials shows that there was no
error in assigning the pitch to the proper partial. In the case of the
four last reeds, 11, 10, 9, 8 only, where successive partials are so verv
close, did I feel any uncertainty, and hence           I
                                                     have not cited these
results.    It was  for  these cases extremely difficult to hear any beats
at all, as distinct from the beats of the partials of the single notes
themselves, as the partials that had to be used were very high and
very weak.      From and after reed 32 there were no musical sounds
at all ; indeed, even reed 64 scarcely deserved the name of a musical
sound, so strong were the beats of the upper partials.
   As the coefficient of temperature for reeds is unknown, a suspicion
of error to a small amount attaches to all these determinations
of pitch, which were made at artificial temperatures varying from
45° to 55° F.      This want of correction for temperature, and liability
to lose pitch from unknown circumstances, militate against the use of
the reed tonometer for scientific purposes, but on account of its
mumerous partials it is admirably adapted for many purposes which
the stabler tuning-fork, with its small number of available partials,
cannot subserve. How stable tuning-forks are, it is difficult to sav.
The lowest and highest forks of Scheibler's tonometer do not seem to
have varied, by so much as the twentieth of a vibration since 1837.

measurements of a fork in absolute union with the highest.         A good

 the rust fully accounts.      At the same time five other forks, of a large
size and very different make, after having journeyed to America and
 back to be measured by Professor Mayer, have, according to Professor
 McLeod's measures, lost "0015, -165, -0205, -0285, and "014 vibration
 respectively.    The second fork was not so good as the rest, and may
 possibly have been slightly wrenched, as it had to be screwed in and
out of a wooden holder. The other losses scarcely exceed errors of
 observation and differences of estimation of the effects of temperature.

    The points to which wish to draw attention are, the establishment
of the acceleration of beats which take place in confined spaces, and

    The Cailletet pump may be conveniently employed to observe the
 thermal effects of compression on solid and fluid substances. Before
 engaging in an investigation on this subject, it was necessary to test
 the apparatus, and especially the manometer.                For this purpose it
 seemed, on theoretical grounds, that observations on the lowering of
 the freezing-point of water by pressure would be a severe test of the
accuracy of the pressure gauge, and the constancy of the records of the
 thermo-junctions under pressure.         I am not aware of any quantitative
experiments on this subject having been made under high pressures.
 Sir William Thomson carried the proof of the accuracy of Professor
 James Thomson's great theoretical discovery to a pressure of 17 at
 mospheres.*      The experiments of Mousson (" Pogg. Annalen," 1858)
 were not of a quantitative character, being merely intended to show
that ice at a temperature of — 18° C. might still be liquefied by the
application of an enormous pressure.               The following experiments
appear to show that a convenient manometer for very high pressures,
based on the observation of the freezing-point,              may be easily con
structed.
    In all the following experiments the galvanometer, moving to the
negative side, represents a cooling effect on the junction inside the

lated by a covering of marine glne, the junctions themselves          being
covered with a thin layer of gutta-percha dissolved in benzol, were
employed in the experiments.
    One junction was placed in the iron bottle, to record the effect of
pressure under different circumstances, the other was kept in a beaker
outside at the constant temperature of melting ice.

    A junction,  fixed in a brass flange with marine glue, was frozen iu
a test-tube   containing boiled water, and placed in the iron bottle of
the Cailletet apparatus, surrounded with water at 0° C, the bottle
 itself being packed round with ice.
    The pressure was increased by 25 atmospheres at a time. The
galvanometer    showed a deflection immediately after the pressure was
applied,   rapidly coming to rest, and it remained perfectly steady at
the lower temperature as long as the pressure was maintained constant.
    The following table gives the results of one of many series of ex
periments, which agreed very nearly.         Pressures were recorded by a

    This represents a mean deflection of         19-7   on the scale, being 0-18
of a degree C. for 25 atmospheres, or a lowering of the freezing-point
by 2°"1 C. for the total range of pressure.           The mean reduction for
one atmosphere of pressure is 0o-0072.
    These experiments were afterwards repeated, with a stronger pump,
to 700 atmospheres.        Exactly the same mean deflection was observed,
and the galvanometer        moved with the same regularity.
                                    Series II.
    The junction in the flange was placed in a piece of quill tubing,
open at top and bottom, in order to insulate it from the sides of the
iron bottle, and surrounded with water at 0° C. instead of ice, the
iron bottle being afterwards packed, as before, in ice. On applying
 pressure a very slight decrease of temperature occurred, the whole
 deflection for 200 atmospheres being only about 4 divisions, or ^ of a
 degree C. This agrees with Joule's* experiments on the compression
 of water about the same temperature.
                                    Series III.
    A mixture of finely     powdered ice and water was placed round the
junction inside the bottle, which was, as usual, packed afterwards in
 ice.    It will be seen, from the following set of readings, that the
 deflection was about the same as when the junction was frozen into a
 block of ice, the only difference being that, whereas the galvanometer
 in the first series assumod its new position immediately after the pressure
 was applied, the instrument now required from two to three minutes
 before coming finally to rest, the action being far more sluggish.

   In this case a heating    effect was produced, which seemed, however,
to decrease as the pressure was increased. It represents an increase of
J,  of a degree Centigrade for the whole 200 atmospheres.
                                     Series V.
   The junction in the flange was frozen into a solid block of ice as iu
Series I, and placed in the bottle, surrounded with brine at — 20° ft,
the whole apparatus packed iu ice and salt.                A very slight heating
effect was produced,       which only amounted to about           1^   divisions for
200 atmospheres.
                                    Series   VI.
   These experiments were made with the junction frozen into a test-
 tube as in Series I, with mercury surrounding the test-tube instead of
water.    This gave exactly the same deflection of the galvanometer as
when water was employed, only the experiment could not be carried

the heating of the mercury by compression.
                                 Series VII.
   As in several cases the junction that was placed inside the bottle,
and which had been several times subjected to high pressures, appeared
to be affected by the compression and worked somewhat irregularly, it
was thought advisable to subject both the junctions to the same com
pression, so as to have them both under the same conditions.       For this
purpose   both  junctions were  passed  through   the brass flange (fig. 1),
being well insulated by marine glue, the one remaining outside of the
test-tube in which the other was frozen.

   The results with ice were exactly the same as when one junction
was  placed outside of the bottle.    Pressure still appeared to have an
effect upon the junctions, as after one or two series of compression
experiments they could be no longer relied upon, and worked very
irregularly.   The only way to obviate this difficulty was to prevent
the junctions being submitted to pressure at all, and this was effected
by soldering a stout iron tube (fig. 2), about  \  inch internal diameter,
into the brass flange, which reached to about the centre of the bottle.
The tube was closed at the bottom and contained a few cubic centi
metres of alcohol, into which the junction was lowered from the
outside.   The part of the tube which went into the bottle was then
frozen into a mass of ice, and the iron tube sustained all the interior
pressure. The alteration of temperature was conveyed slowly through
the iron to the junction.

    This method worked exceedingly well, giving exactly the same results
as before, the only drawback being that the action was very sluggish,
the galvanometer taking about two minutes to come to rest after each
addition of pressure.     The above results seem to prove that the calcu
lated value of the variation of the freezing-point of water, deduced
from the observed difference of volume of ice and water, and the
latent heat of fluidity at the melting-point under one atmosphere of
pressure, is identical with the mean experimental value obtained from
a series of observations extending to 700 atmospheres.                From Cla-

where T is absolute temperature, V the difference of volume of the

approximately constant, then T varies as L. Thus the latent heat of
ice diminishes as the freezing-point is lowered by pressure.           This is in
accordance with the deductions of Clausius* from other considerations.

       perimental Philosophy in the University of Cambridge.

    The   following   experiments     regarding the behaviour of carbonic
acid in    presence of different vapours above the temperature of the
 critical  point of the pure gas, were undertaken to ascertain if any
 optical   discontinuity could be observed in such mixtures.              As the
object    was  intentionally   a   qualitative   investigation,    many of the
 pressure observations have been taken with the metallic manometer.
        The Liquefaction  of Carbonic Acid in     ¦presence of other Bodies.
                 1. Carbonic  Acid and Bisulphide of Carbon.
    Carbonic acid liquefied in presence of a small quantity of bisulphide
 of carbon at a pressure of 49 atmospheres and a temperature of 193 C.
 It floated on the convex surface of the bisulphide, the line of separation
 being sharp and well defined.
    At 35° C. liquid condensed on the surface of the bisulphide in the
 same way at a pressure of 78 atmospheres, at 40° C. it still appeared
 at 85 atmospheres, at 55° C. there seemed to be a distinct appearance
 of two liquids, and at 58° C. there was still the same apparent separa
 tion under a pressure of 110 atmospheres.            Observed at 47s C. and a

1880.]          On the   Critical Point of Mixed Vapours.             539
pressure of 80 atmospheres, there was a distinct layer of a separate
fluid on the surface of the bisulphide, the bisulphide surface however
was not so well defined.
   By keeping the temperature at 47° C, on increasing the pressure
to 110 atmospheres, the upper surface of the liquid floating on the
bisulphide almost entirely disappeared. By reducing the pressure again
to 80 atmospheres, the surface of demarcation did not appear, but on
reducing the pressure another 5 atmospheres, the line of demarcation
again appeared very sharply and remained.         A quick withdrawal to
58 atmospheres, followed by a gradual increase of the pressure to 85
atmospheres, did not make the liquid remain, but on reducing it again
slowly to 80 atmospheres the definition became perfectly sharp.
                     2.  Carbonic Acid and Chloroform.
    Carbonic acid in presence of chloroform at 18° C. liquefied at 25
atmospheres, forming a distinct layer on the surface of the chloroform.
 On further compression, the manometer rose rapidly to 50 atmo
spheres, at which pressure the two liquids mixed completely, after
being left for a few minutes.          When the pressure was rapidly
 withdrawn, distinct layers of what appeared to be carbonic acid were
always formed, which however became rapidly dissolved in the chlo
 roform on standing a few seconds.
    At 33° C. liquid began to appear at a pressure of 35 atmospheres,
and on increasing the pressure to 55 atmospheres it behaved in exactly
 the same way as at the lower temperatures, except that the layer was,
if anything, more distinct and mixed more rapidly with the chloroform
on standing.
    At 55° C. a layer of liquid was still formed at a pressure of 50 at
 mospheres ; at 67° C. it behaved in the same way, except that there
was a smaller quantity of liquid formed, and the pressure rose to
85 atmospheres.
    In every case it rapidly mixed with the chloroform when left for      a
few seconds.
                        3. Carbonic Acid and Benzol.
   At 18° C. the carbonic acid commenced to liquefy at a pressure of
25 atmospheres, and at the moment of liquefaction the surface of the
benzol became violently agitated, the carbonic acid falling through the
benzol in an oily stream, and becoming completely mixed with it.
   When by further condensation more liquid        was formed, the agita
tion almost entirely ceased, the liquid carbonic   acid forming a distinct
 layer on the saturated benzol. On leaving this    for about five minutes,
 the line of demarcation disappeared, and the       two liquids formed a
 perfectly homogeneous fluid.

   On again increasing the pressure     so as to get a   layer of carbonic
acid, and then releasing the pressure gradually, the liquid carbonic
acid on the surface first fell in oily streams through the saturated
benzol ; but when all this had disappeared, the carbonic acid then
commenced to boil from the bottom of the benzol, and continued to do
so until it was again entirely vaporised.
   At 35° C. liquid commenced to appear at 35 atmospheres, forming
a distinct layer on the surface of the benzol, which was not in the
least agitated.    On further compression the liquid layer increased in
volume, but no oily streams were seen to fall through the benzol ; and
on leaving it for about ten minutes, the layer of liquid was almost
just as distinct, showing that it was not nearly so soluble in the benzol
at this temperature.
   On the pressure being now reduced, the liquid quietly evaporated
away from the surface ; but when all this had disappeared, carbonic
acid commenced to boil out of the benzol, showing that it bad dis
solved a considerable amount.
   At 52° C. the liquid appeared at 60 atmospheres, forming a layer
which mixed with the benzol on standing ; and at 70° C. and 85 at
mospheres a distinct layer was also formed,       which however     rapidly
mixed with the benzol.
                       4. Carbonic Acid and Ether.
   A  tube was filled with carbonic acid and a little    ether introduced.
At   20° C, and at a pressure of 20 atmospheres,        the carbonic acid
liquefied and fell through the ether, mixing with it    in all proportions.
   At 42p C. liquid was condensed on the surface       of the ether at a
pressure of 55 atmospheres, forming a distinct layer ; the upper sur
face of the ether was, however, kept in continual oscillation from the
apparent solution of the carbonic acid in it. No currents due to the
falling of the carbonic acid through the ether were visible. At 68° C,
and a pressure of 110 atmospheres, a perfectly separate layer of fluid
was formed on the surface of the ether, and no currents descended
through the ether.
                   5. Carbonic  Acid and Nitrous Oxide.
   When a tube was filled with equal volumes of carbonic acid and
nitrous oxide, and the gas liquefied, the fluids mixed together in all
proportions, no difference being perceptible ; but when the pressure
was suddenly withdrawn, the one gas boiled before the other, and for a
few seconds a distinct line of separation was seen.

 commenced to condense on the sides before the trichloride of phos
 phorus came in sight, and when the latter was visible, a slight in
 distinct layer of fluid was seen on the surface, distinguishable by
 the different refractive index of the two liquids, there being no sharp
 line of demarcation.       On standing a few minutes, the liquids became
 quite homogeneous.        On increasing the pressure, more carbonic acid
 was condensed, forming a more or less distinct layer on the surface of
 the trichloride of phosphorus.       This, however, rapidly disappeared on
 standing.     On releasing the pressure, the carbonic acid boiled first on
 the surface, but afterwards through the liquid, the trichloride of phos
 phorus at the same time falling in heavy stria? to the bottom.
    At 23° C. the carbonic acid appeared to liquefy at 46'91 atmo
 spheres, exactly the same appearances taking place as at 16° C.
    At 30° C. the carbonic acid liquefied at 49'94 atmospheres, forming
 a rather more distinct layer, and not mixing so readily.     On increasing
 the pressure to 90 atmospheres, the surface of the carbonic acid dis
 appeared, it being near its critical point, the top part of the tube
 being filled with a homogeneous mass.        The trichloride of phosphorus
 could also not be distinguished on the surface of the mercury, its
upper surface being entirely mixed up with the carbonic acid, the
 whole space above the mercury forming one homogeneous mass.
    On releasing the pressure, a cloud first appeared, and then the sur
face of the carbonic acid became visible ; it boiled away first from the
surface, and afterwards, through the trichloride of phosphorus.
     At 33°C, liquid     carbonic acid appeared at 50 "84 atmospheres.

except that as the temperature increased, the quantity of fluid liquefied
diminished, and it took a greater pressure to make the surface of the
trichloride of phosphorus disappear.
    The following are pressures taken with a smaller quantity of car
bonic acid and trichloride in the tube, and were read off when the sur
face of the trichloride was first agitated, thus showing that the

        Liquefaction of Carbonic Acid with Tetrachloride of Carbon.
   The quantity of tetrachloride of carbon was a little less than the
volume of the liquid carbonic acid.
   At 12°'8 C. the surface of the liquid appeared agitated as soon as it
appeared in sight, and on increasing the pressure, a distinct layer of
carbonic acid was formed on the surface of the tetrachloride ; on in
creasing the pressure, a still more distinct layer was formed jvhich,
however, on standing, rapidly commenced to dissolve in the tetra
chloride, and in about ten minutes it was perfectly homogeneous.
   At 21°'4 C. the surface of the tetrachloride appeared agitated when
it came in sight, a layer of liquid being formed on increasing the
pressure, as at 12° C.
   At 30° C. liquid was also formed, which, however, rapidly diffused
into the tetrachloride of carbon.
   At 40° C. the liquid also appeared agitated, and on increasing the
pressure rapidly, a small quantity of fluid was condensed, which, how
ever, rapidly disappeared in the tetrachloride.
   At 52° C. the liquid again became agitated, and on increasing the
pressure, a distinct layer of liquid was formed.
   The same took place at 58° C.
            Liquefaction, of Carbonic Acid and Chloride of Methyl.
   When chloride of methyl was compressed in a tube by itself, it
became liquid before the pressure could be registered, and must have
been below 10 atmospheres.
   When compressed with about twice its volume of carbonic acid at
13°-5 C, the chloride of methyl, of course, liquefied first, and at about
27"67    atmospheres, its surface became agitated, showing that the
carbonic acid had commenced to liquefy, but the exact point was
•difficult to ascertain, as it dissolved so very rapidly in the chloride of
methyl.
   At 20o,05 C. this point appeared to be at 28-57 atmospheres.
   At 30" C. some liquid was also condensed, but the pressure at com
mencement of liquefaction could not be taken, as it mixed so rapidly
with the chloride of methyl.
   That more liquid was in reality condensed, was seen by the
lengthening of the liquid column, and by its boiling out of the
chloride of methyl when the pressure was reduced.
   At 40° C. exactly the same took place.
                          Carbonic Acid and Acetylene.
   About equal volumes of these gases were compressed together ; they
liquefied and mixed completely at all the temperatures given below,
and no appearance of two different gases being liquefied could be
detected, except that the liquid was strongly agitated during eondensa

cases,  lower than either of the gases liquefied by themselves. Thus : —

   A mixture of equal volumes of these gases was filled into a tube,
the liquefied gases mixed completely together at all temperatures
below the critical point, which was 36° C, forming a perfectly homo
geneous fluid ; in fact, it was impossible to tell that two different gases
were present, as even at the point of liquefaction no difference was
discernible.
   The following are the pressures at which the mixture liquefied : —

   A   tube   filled   with a mixture of carbonic acid and bromine
vapour by passing dry carbonic acid through a tube containing dry
bromine before entering the liquefying tube.               A little strong sul
phuric acid was also introduced, to protect the mercury.               On com
pressing   this  mixture    at 11°'5 C. the   sulphuric  acid appeared in sight
with a layer of liquid at 50 atmospheres, the liquid having a decidedly
red colour.
   On increasing the pressure the liquid became more highly coloured,
while a little pure bromine liquid fell through the liquid carbonic acid,
remaining a short time on the surface of the sulphuric acid, through
which a globule also sank.
   As this tube was spoiled through the amount of bromine which fell
through the sulphuric acid, another was put up in the same way, and
 heated at once to about 40° O, before compressing the mixture.

   On the sulphuric coming in sight a small layer of bromine was seen
on the surface, which was surmounted by a layer of darkish red liquid,
about £ inch long.     The pressure was about 60 atmospheres.
   On increasing the pressure to 90 atmospheres, the upper liquid
increased a good deal in quantity and then disappeared entirely, but
immediately reappeared on reducing the pressure a few atmospheres,
and remained permanently.
                        Carbonic Acid and Camphor.
   Some small pieces of camphor were placed in the capillary part of
an ordinary Cailletet tube, near the end, and fused so as to adhere to
the sides. The tube was then filled with carbonic acid gas.
   On compressing this mixture in the pump at 12° C. the camphor
was seen to melt and run down the sides of the tube before the mer
cury appeared in sight (in this experiment it was not observed whether
liquid carbonic acid had commenced to form in the tube and thus dis
solve the camphor, or whether the latter was dissolved in the gas).   On
continuing the pressure so as to almost fill the tube with liquid, two
distinct layers of liquid were seen, the lower one being slightly
cloudy, containing the dissolved camphor, the upper liquid being per
fectly clear. On compressing at different temperatures up to 5b' C,
the lower cloudy liquid was always present, the upper layer diminish
ing gradually in quantity as the temperature rose, but at 40° C. there
was still a slight layer on increasing the pressure to about 125 atmo
spheres.
   On withdrawing the pressure very suddenly when the tube was full
of liquid at 50°, the sides of the tube became coated with crystallised
camphor, which rapidly dissolved again on increasing the pressure.
After doing this several times, a very small quantity of camphor was
seen to crystallise out, and in taking down the tube, the most of it was
found to have crystallised out in the top part of the reservoir near the
joining with the capillary part, thus allowing the mercury to get past
it on again increasing the pressure.
                Carbonic Acid and Camphor (second tube).
   Another tube was filled in the same way as the last (a rather larger
quantity of camphor being placed in the capillary part), with this
exception, that the carbonic acid, after being dried, was passed through
a tube, containing fragments of solid camphor, which were gently
heated, so as to fill the tube with carbonic acid gas, saturated with the
vapour of camphor.
   When this tube was compressed in the pump at a temperature of
15° C, and when the pressure reached 27'7 atmospheres, the camphor
was seen to gradually melt and run down the sides of the tubes before
the mercury appeared in sight.

1880.]           On the  Critical Point of Muted Vapours.              545
   On increasing the pressure to 37'0 atmospheres, the mercury appeared
in sight with about three-quarters of an inch of a turbid liquid on the
surface.   On still further increasing the pressure, two distinct layers
of fluid were formed, which, however, became qnite homogeneous
after a short time.     On mixing them up by a rapid decrease and in
crease of pressure, the two fluids soon mix.      At 28° C, two layers of
liquid were distinctly visible   at  G5 atmospheres, the lower layer being
visible as soon as the mercury appeared in sight.
   At 35° C. fluid was condensed on the surface of the lower liquid at
80 atmospheres, but when the pressure was increased to 100 atmo
spheres, the surface of the carbonic acid became undefined.
   At 45° C. fluid is seen to condense on the sides of the tube at a
pressure of 100 atmospheres, running down and forming a slight layer
on the surface of the camphor liquor, which, however, disappears on
still further increasing the pressure.
   When the temperature was 42°'5 and the pressure was suddenly re
duced, the inside of the tube became covered with crystals of camphor.
On now increasing the pressure very carefully, the camphor was seen
to melt or liquefy and run down the sides of the tube at a pressure of
37 6 atmospheres, and this pressnre scarcely increased at all until all
the camphor was thus liquefied.
   A diminution of the pressure by two or three atmospheres was suffi
cient to bring out the crystals of camphor.
   At 60° C. the lower layer of liquid still remained, and on increasing
 the pressure to 100 atmospheres there was an appearance of liquefaction
of carbonic acid on the surface.
               Carbonic Acid,  Air, and Camphor (third tube).
    A quantity of  camphor was placed in the capillary part of a tube as
before, which was afterwards filled with a mixture of four volnmes of
carbonic acid, saturated with camphor vapour, and one volume of air.
    The tube was surrounded with water at 25° C, so as to be far above
the critical point of the carbonic acid and air mixture, and on now
increasing the pressure the camphor liquefied and ran down the sides
of the tube    as before.   At 50° C. a quantity of liquid, about £ inch
long, appeared on the     surface   of the mercury when it came in sight,
the pressure being now 65 atmospheres.
    On leaving the pressure the same, the mercury being just in sight,
and increasing the temperature gradually to 60° C, the inside of the
tube above the liquid became covered with camphor crystals, which on
increasing the pressure another five atmospheres (viz., to 70 atmo
spheres) again dissolves.
   At 65° C, the pressnre standing at 70 atmospheres and the mercury
and liquid being in sight, on reducing the pressure to 65 atmospheres,
the camphor crystals separated out, being again suddenly dissolved on

 again   increasing the pressure to 73 atmospheres.    On now rapidly
 letting down the temperature to 15c C. a white mass of camphor sepa
 rated out from the liquid, which again dissolved on a slight increase of
 pressure, although it could not be again separated out by diminishing
 it. These actions may be due, in part, to supersaturation and the
 effect of pressure in aiding solubility when contraction takes place
 during solution.
    These experiments show that carbonic acid at high pressures in
 presence of various substances acts as if it produced a series of un
 stable chemical compounds, which are decomposed and recomposed
 according to the conditions     of temperature and pressure in the
 medium. Further observations are required to elucidate many obscure
 actions taking place under such conditions of experimenting as are
 detailed in the above communication.
 IV. " The Aluminium-Iodine        Reaction."    By J. H. Gladstone.
        Ph.D., F.R.S., and Alfred Tribe, F.C.S., Lecturer on
        Chemistry in Dulwich College. Received June 10, 1880.
    About four years ago we pointed out a reaction of iodide of alumi
 nium which, as far as wc are aware, has no precise analogue in the
 science of chemistry, and which has led to the discovery of several
 volatile aluminium alcohols.    It is well known that neither water,
 alcohol, nor ether is decomposed by metallic aluminium, and that each
of these bodies will dissolve iodine without entering further into com
bination with it ; but we found that by the joint action of these two
elements, it was possible to split up the above-mentioned        liquids.
Water, though forming a definite hydrate with the iodide of alumi
nium, is decomposed by it in the presence of an excess of the metal,
hydrogen being evolved and aluminic hydrate formed.          This takes
place at the ordinary temperature.
    Alcohol in a similar manner is decomposed by the joint action of
metallic alnminium and its iodide, with the ultimate production of
hydrogen gas, aluminic ethylate, and varying amounts of aluminic
iodoethylate proportional to the quantity of aluminic iodide employed.
A small quantity of the iodide suffices to bring about the formation of
a very large amount of the ethylate ; in fact, the process would be a
continuous one, were it not that the solid products gradually put a
stop to the reaction.
    Ether is not affected by aluminic iodide and aluminium, but when
exposed to iodine and aluminium simultaneously it suffers a violent
decomposition, iodide of ethyl and the aluminic iodoethylate being
the ultimate products.
    Amylic ether behaves in a similar manner, and the acetates of ethyl
and amyl give analogous results ; but the reaction is not an ordinary

double decomposition, for it does not take place when ready-formed
iodide of aluminium is employed.

   The several changes thus described are typical of our aluminium-
iodine reaction." The reaction is quite distinct from that which has
lately given beautiful results in the hands of Friedel ; and we have
investigated its applicability both for the production of new com
pounds, and for distinguishing between different classes of organic
bodies, as well as for throwing light on their comparative constitution.
   Neither zinc nor iron, nor, as far as we know, any other metal can
be substituted             for aluminium in this reaction     but the chloride or
                                                                  ;
bromide may be              used instead of the iodide, though with less advantage.

     For decomposing an alcohol a small quantity of iodine is dissolved
in   the necessary excess of aluminium
     it,                                  added, and the mixture

heated.  Evolution of hydrogen gas begins immediately, and proceeds
somewhat rapidly until the whole of the metal has passed into com
bination.            In this way        the aluminium derivatives         of the following
alcohols            have been prepared      :— Ethylic, normal propylic, iso-butylic,
amylic, benzylic, phenylic, cresylic, and thymolic. The first four of
these aluminium derivatives may be distilled in vacuo, and they have
thus been separated from the other solid products of the reaction, and
obtained in a pure condition.    The other aluminic alcohols cannot be
distilled, at any rate not without very considerable decomposition. The
following alcohols, however, behaved in a different way with the
reagent         —

allylic iodide are the sole products.
   Aldehyde. — Hydrogen is not set free from this compound.
   The general result, then, of these observations is that the reagent
substitutes aluminium for the basic hydrogen of water, and of all the
alcohols hitherto tried, whether of the methyl, allyl, benzyl, or phenyl
series, with the remarkable exception of isopropyl alcohol.        On the
other hand, it does not substitute aluminium for hydrogen in the
dihydric or trihydric alcohols, nor yet with aldehyde. The reaction
with the ethers and glycerine is of a different character, as, in addition
to an aluminium compound, the iodides of the positive radicals are
formed.
               General Properties of the Aluminium Alcohols.
   The aluminium alcohols are solid at the ordinary temperature, and
fuse generally into clear liquids. They possess, in a marked degree,
the property of remaining fluid far below their melting points.      Those
of the methyl series distil unchanged at reduced pressures,      affording
the first organic compounds which contain both oxygen and a mefal
and are capable of distillation.       They are soluble more or less in
ether, alcohol, and benzol, but are decomposed by water with the
formation of aluminium hydrate and the-alcohols.
   They were found to have the following specific gravities at 4° C. : —
        Ethylate           1147            Phenylate         125
        Propylate           1-026          Cresylate         1166

        Amylate             0980
   Action of heat. — All these alcohols are decomposed at a temperature
somewhere about their boiling points, and it became an interesting
subject of inquiry whether they were resolved into alumina, and the
alcohol   and its define,   or into alumina and the ether.     Both   these
actions seem to take place.       Thus aluminic ethylate appears to be
decomposed by heat in both ways, but mainly according to the following
scheme : —
                  (CsHsO),Alj= Al,Os + 3C3H4+ 3C2H60.
Aluminic phenylate on the other hand is capable of decomposition
mainly in the following way : —
                    (C8H50)6A13=A1.20 + 3(C6H6)20.
   It  must not however be supposed that these decompositions take
place without other reactions.      Some of the bodies thus produced are
new ones, and we are at present engaged in their investigation.
   The most interesting decomposition is that of the thymolate.      When

  1880.]               The Aluminium- Iodine Reaction.                    549
 heated    it splits up into alumina, propylene, and bodies of the cresylic
 group.     One of these is a solid     body, which when resublimed or
 crystallised from alcohol presents itself in most beautiful pearly plates.
 Its properties resemble rather those of an ether, and concordant analyses
 of different specimens and determinations of vaponr density give the
 anomalous molecular formula CuH130, but its real constitution is still
 the subject of inquiry.
                               Theory of Reaction.
    The reaction by which the compounds described above are formed
 is by no means clear at first sight.     It is difficult to imagine that the
presence of a haloid salt should determine the direct replacement of
hydrogen by aluminium in water or in alcohol.            We believe however
 that the presence of hydriodic acid in the reaction with the aromatic
 alcohols furnishes the true key to the chemical change.             The first
action is in all probability that of a reciprocal decomposition between
 two binary compounds — the alcohol and aluminium iodide — forming a
 certain proportion of aluminium alcohol and hydriodic acid.          Bnt the
metallic aluminium present at the same time decomposes the hydracid
with evolution of hydrogen and the production of more aluminium
iodide, which brings about a further redistribution of the elements
and the formation of more of the aluminium alcohol and the hydriodic
acid, and so on till the chemical change is complete.           The following
 equations express these changes, which take place alternately or rather
 continuously : —
            (1)    6(C„H2„_7O.H) + AlaI4=Ala(C.Hs..70)6+         CHI.
            (2)    6HI + A13=A12I6 + 6H.
    It is evident that as the iodine does not enter into the final products
a very small quantity of it is sufficient to carry on the continuous
chemical change.
    There can be little doubt that the same reactions occur in the case of
the alcohols of the CnlLm+jO.H series, but the amount of hydriodic acid
formed in the reciprocal decomposition is perhaps very small, and the
tenacity with which it is held by the alcohol has made it impossible
for us to prove its separate existence. The same remark applies also
to water, which we believe to act in the same way.           Indeed we know
from the experiments of Roscoe that there would be no chance of
separating minute quantities       of acid from an aqueous solution under
the circumstances.
    The part which the free elements take in the decomposition of the
ethers is doubtless analogous to that which the combined elements
play in the action with water and alcohol.         The reason why the free
elements do, and aluminic iodide does not attack the ethers, is probably
                                                               2q2

   In conclusion, we would commend this aluminium-iodine reaction
to the consideration of other chemists, who may be investigating
organic compounds containing oxygen.

       A.  Dixey,  B.A.    Received June 3, 1880.
    The diaphyses of the ungual phalanges of the digits offer an excep
tion to the usual mode of ossification of diaphysial bones (including
 the other phalanges) in the fact that the calcification of the cartilage
 and its attendant changes begins at the tip and not in the centre
 of the diaphysis.    The subperiosteal intramembranous ossification also
 commences at the same point— the tip, namely, of the cartilage— as a
 cap-like expansion over the end of the cartilage. The irruption of the
 osteoblastic subperiosteal tissue also first occurs here, so that this part
 seems to correspond    morphologically with the centre of the shaft of
 other long bones.     The expanded portion of the phalanx which bears
 the nail, claw, or hoof, is entirely formed by an outgrowth of the sub
 periosteal bone, and is not preceded by cartilage.
    A  detailed account of the mode of ossification     of these phalanges
 will be  shortly published.
 VI. " On      the Organisation of the Fossil Plants of the Coal-
       measures. Part XL" By W. C. Williamson, F.R.S., Pro
       fessor of Botany in the Owens College, Manchester.               Re
       ceived June 3, 1880.
                                  (Abstract.)
    M. Renault    has recently published a memoir, in which he repro
 duces the views of M. Brongniart respecting the relations which the
 Lepidodendra bear to the Sigillarite, still insisting that the former are
 cryptogamic Lycopods, whilst the latter are exogenous Gymnosperms.
 In endeavouring to establish this position, the French paheo-botanist
 concludes that if the exogenous Diploxyloid stems (i.e., Sigillarian
ones) are but matured states of some Lepidodendra, every Sigillarian
type of organisation ought to be found in a young or Lepidodendroid
form, because, he contends, the type of the central organisation, once
established, undergoes no further change with advancing ape.              In
support of his position, he affirms that there are three such Sigillarian

 1880.]    Organisation   of Fossil Plants of   the Coal-measures.     551
types, viz., Sigillaria vascularis ; 2. Diploxyloid stems ; 3. Favularia
and Leiodermaria. At present he contends that only the second of these
forms has been discovered in Lepidodendron Harcourtii.          He further
believes that there are three types of Lepidodendron known, repre
sented by — 1. L. Rhodumense, with a solid central vascular axis, in
which the vessels are not intermingled with medullary cells ; 2. by L.
Harcourtii, in which the vascular axis is a cylinder surrounding a
cellular medulla; and, 3. An undescribed plant, which he names
L. Jutieri, in which the vascular cylinder is broken up into detached
bundles of vessels.
   The author of the present paper considers that the above conclusions
are not in accordance with the facts, and he proceeds to give his
reasons for this conclusion by demonstrating that we certainly have
two of the three supposed Sigillarian types represented in a young or
Lepidodendroid state — the first by Lepidodendron vasculare of Binney,
and the second by L. Harcourtii, whilst, judging from M. Renault's
own description, the L. Jutieri represents the third type. On the
other hand, the author believes that of M. Renault's three Lepidoden
droid types the first is only a young state of the second, as illustrated
by the development of the Burntisland and Arran Lepidodendra
described in previous memoirs, whilst the able Frenchman appears not
to have been acquainted with the existence of the very characteristic
type of the L. vasculare of Binney.
   The author gives the series of facts upon which his opinions are
based by tracing the history of the development, first, of Lepidodendron
Selaginoides, the L. vasculare of Binney, and, second, of L. Harcourtii.
   Commencing with the declaration that the Lepidodendron vasculare
of Mr. Binney is but the young state of the Sigillaria vascularis of
the same author, he proceeds to show the successive stages by which
the vasculo-cellular    medullary axis of the former becomes not only
enclosed within the exogenous cylinder of the latter, but that this
cylinder ultimately develops into a very conspicuous example of the
Diploxyloid form of stem. The growth of the exogenous cylinder
begins at one point of the periphery of the vasculo-medullary         axis,
from  which  point  it extends  both laterally and radially. The exogenous
growth thus first appears in the transverse section of the Lepidoden
droid twig as a small crescent, thickest at its centre, but whose two
horns creep gradually round the medullary axis, its constituent vas
cular wedges also growing radially as the lateral growth advances,
until at length the exogenous zone forms a complete ring, enclosing
the vasculo-medullary     axis, in which state it becomes the Sigillaria
vascularis of Mr. Binney and H. Renault.         The various stages of this
growth are represented in the plates, in addition to which a section is
described and figured of a branch about to dichotomise, in which pro
cess the vasculo-medullary     axis has divided into two equal halves, one

 552                 Prof. W. C. Williamson.         On the        [June   17,
being destined for each branch.         One of these halves of the vascnlo-
medullary    axis displays, with  the utmost  distinctness, the characteristic
crescentic commencement of an exogenous zone, whilst the other half
retains its primary non-exogenous state. The latter condition thus
belongs to the Lepidodendron vasculare of Binney, whilst the former
as clearly represents the Sigillaria vascularis of the same author, and
the Sigillarian character of which is recognised by M. Renault.           We
thus have in one stem two branches, one of which, according to the
views of the French savant, is a Cryptogamic Lycopod, and the other a
Gymnospermous Sigillaria. The remarkable peculiarities characterising
the central axis of these specimens makes it absolutely certain that
they all belong to one species of plant.
   The typical Lepidodendron Harcourtii is then examined in a similar
manner.      In the details of its organisation it differs materially from
L. Selaginoides, nevertheless as its growth progresses it displays typi
cally similar changes. It attains to much larger dimensions than the
latter plant does before developing its exogenous zone, corresponding
in this respect with the Arran plant.       Its earlier changes are chiefly
seen in the rapid development of the bast or prosenchymatous layer of
the outer bark and in the increase in the size and number of the vessels
constituting its vasculo-medullary cylinder or medullary sheath — the
" itui medullaire" of Brongniart; but in more advanced specimens a
cylindrical zone of centrifugally developed vascular wedges begins to
make its appearance in a quasi-cambian zone of the cells of the inner
bark, these cells being arranged in more or less regular radiating lines.
In this state the rudimentary vascular zone corresponds very closely to
what is seen in young stems and roots of some Cycads.
   The author shows that, contrary to the views of M. Renault, very
marked changes take place in the development of the vascular bundles
destined for the secondary branches of the plant. In the first instance,
each of these is but a concavo-convex segment of the entire vasculo-
medullary cylinder, whose detachment leaves a large gap in the con
tinuity of that cylinder, which, however, soon becomes closed again by
the convergence of the disconnected ends of the broken vascular
circle.    The concavo-convex, detached segment undergoes a similar
change.     Its two extremities meet, and before it escapes from the
outermost bark, it has assumed the cylindrical form of its parent stem.
   The rootlets of Stigmaria ficoides, now well known to belong alike
to Lepidodendron and to Sigillaria, present some peculiarities              of
structure which are only found in the Lycopodiaceas and the Ophio-
glossffi, amongst living plants.
   The vascular bundle in the interior of each Stigmarian rootlet is
enclosed within a very regularly circular cylinder, composed of the
cells of the innermost bark ; but the position of the bundle in relation
to the cylinder is always, unless accidentally disturbed, an eccentric

 1880.]     Organisation of Fossil Plants     of the  Coal-measures.      553
 one. This position has not escaped notice, but it was regarded as
 accidental, but it now proves to be a normal one.        The bundle begins
 to appear in very young roots, as one or two very small vessels
developed in close union with the innermost cells of one side of the
 cylinder within which it is located ; newer and larger vessels are
 gradually added centripetally, until the bundle occupies a considerable
 portion of the area enclosed by the inner bark cylinder. The re
 maining space is usually empty, but occasionally specimens are found
in which it is filled with small delicate cells that have escaped destruc
tion. These represent what in the living Lycopods are liber-cells.
 The outer cortical layer of the root, composed of well preserved
and rathor thick walled cells, is usually separated from the inner
cylinder by a similar lacuna ; but in a few specimens the cells of this
usually destroyed middle bark are retained in good preservation.
 They consist of very delicate thin-walled parenchyma, separated by a
sharp line of demarcation equally from the innermost and outermost
 cortical cylinders.    The number of the vessels in each of the vascular
 bundles given   off from   any one section of a Stigmarian root is found to
 vary but little, but they steadily increase, both in number and size,
with the size and age of the root. Young specimens of Stigmarian
roots are described, the smallest of which is not more than one-fifth of
an inch in diameter, and the vascular bundles of its small rootlets
consists each of from three to five minute vessels.           In the largest
rootlets from old roots they number about forty, most of the additional
ones being of larger size; intermediate examples exhibit a regular
gradation on all these points.
   The only living plants which possess rootlets with this structure
being Lycopodiaceee and Ophiogloss®, and           it being sufficiently clear
that the Lepidodendra belong to the former and not to the latter
order of Cryptogams, the existence of this Lycopodiaceous feature in
the rootlets of Sigillaria is another indication of the Lycopodiaceous
aflinities of these plants.
   Many of the Diploxyloid forms of the Lycopodiaceous stems of the
Coal-measures have an abundant development of spiral or barred cells
in their numerous medullary rays.              Among living plants this
characteristic seems     to be almost, if not wholly, confined to the Gym-
nosperms.
   Two important additional observations have been made in reference
to the structure of the curious Strobilus, Calamostachys Binneyana.
The exact mode of the attachment of its sporangia to the Equiseti-
form sporangiophores has been ascertained ; but what is still more
important, it has also been discovered that it is provided with both
micro- and macro-spores — an additional indication of its probable
Lycopodiaceous affinities, already suggested by other features of the
fruit.

The author finds, in the specimens he has examined, including that
described   by Mr. Smith, no traces of septa in the hyphse or of
Zoospores in the Oogonia.         He concludes that its affinities are pro

       Superintendent of the Brown Institution.              Communicated
       by Professor Burdon-Sandeeson, F.R.S. Received June
       17, 1880.
    In the course of some experimental    investigations into the pathology
of anthrax at the Brown Institution, made during the past twelve
months, two series of phenomena have been the subject of study, and
                               I
in each some results which believe to be novel have been attained.
These results have not only a considerable practical importance, if
verified by other observers, but their interest in relation to the patho
logy of anthrax and other diseases appears to me sufficient to warrant
their communication to the Royal Society in the form of a preliminary
note, leaving the full detail of the experiments for a future occasion.
    The practical purpose of these investigations was to ascertain (1)
by what means the virus of splenic fever may be so modified as to be
capable of inoculation without fatal result, and (2) whether a modified

558                      Prof. W. S. Greenfield.               [June   17,
attack, produced by inoculation, exerts any protective influence against
a future inoculation with unmodified virus.
   The conclusions arrived at     by the    experiments  made   with this
object were as follows : —
   1. That anthrax may be artificially communicated to bovine animals
by  inoculation  with the blood or spleen of the guinea-pig -which has
died of the disease artificially induced, and that the same resnlt may
be attained by inoculation with the Bacillus anthracis cultivated from
the fluids of a rodent; the disease thus induced being severe, but
rarely fatal to previously healthy bovine animals.
   This result had already been attained by Dr. Burdon-Sanderson in
some previous experiments, with the details of which       I  was not ac
quainted when my own experiments were made.
   2. In all the cases thus inoculated, the animals appeared to have
acquired either a considerable degree of protection or entire immunity
from the results of subsequent inoculation, although much larger
doses of the virus were employed.
   Some    of  my experiments on these subjects have been already
published   in the Journal of the Royal Agricultural Society.
   In the course of these experiments, I employed on several occasions
the Bacillus anthracis artificially cultivated in successive generations
in aqueous humour, and finding that the results appeared to vary
considerably with the stage of the cultivation, those furthest removed
from the original parent source being more frequently inactive,     I was
led to make a series of observations, of which I now desire to commu
nicate the results.   They may be stated as follows : —
   That when the Bacillus anthracis is artificially grown in successive
generations in a nutrient fluid (aqueous humour) it maintains its
morbific properties through a certain number of generations, but each
successive generation becomes less virulent than its predecessor,
requiring both a longer time and a larger quantity to exert its morbific
action ; and after continuous diminution of virulence, at a certain
stage in the successive cultivations, the Bacillus, though maintaining
all its morphological characters and its power of growth, becomes
completely innocuous even to the most susceptible class of animals.
   It may be added that the modified virus produces forms of modified
disease which differ widely from ordinary splenic fever, both in the
distribution of the Bacilli and in the nature of the symptoms         and
pathological appearances.
   It does not appear necessary at the present moment to enter with
further detail into the evidence upon the subject of modified inocula
tion and protection from further attack, for this could only be done by
a detail of the experiments, which is beyond my present purpose. But
it is desirable that I should briefly stato the general method employed
in the determination of the gradual diminution of virulence by sue

cessive artificial cultivations, and the evidence upon which the con
clusion is based.
    The experiments were performed in a very simple manner.           The
cultivating fluid employed was aqueous humour, the animals inoculated
were     chiefly mice, though guinea-pigs, rabbits, cows, and on one
occasion a sheep were also used. But mice, being especially suscep
tible to the poison, were mainly relied on. The cultivations were
performed in closed tubes, half filled with the cultivating fluid. Every
precaution was taken both to prevent the entrance of other organisms
and to detect and eliminate from the series any cultivations which
proved to be contaminated.
    The cultivations were continued to the nineteenth generation, each
successive generation presenting identical morphological characters at
the various stages of its growth, and showing no diminution in the
capacity for growth, nor marked variation in the time and temperature
relations of its germination.     From each successive cultivation fresh
 cultivations were made, a microscopic examination was performed, some
 capillary-tubes were filled with the cultivation and preserved for future
 use, and, in most cases, a portion used for inoculation of a mouse.
    The first series of experimental inoculations were made, step by
 step, as the cultivations proceeded, and when the results showed that
 the Bacillus, though still actually growing, might be inoculated in
 large quantities with impunity, a second series of inoculations was
 made with the material which had been preserved in capillary tubes.
 To this second series the objection might be made that the material
 had deteriorated by keeping. The reply is to be found in the fact that
 the earlier the cultivation the longer had it been kept, so that the
 first cultivation might be two or three weeks older than the sixth, and
 would have had more chance of deterioration, whereas it was found to
 be equally virulent at the end of three months as when first used.
                     I
    In no case was able to produce any symptoms or a fatal result by
 inoculation with a later generation than the twelfth ; beyond that
 stage a large quantity of actively germinating rods and spores pro
 ducing no result whatever.       The diminution of virulence was very
 marked, even at the eighth generation, both as regards the proportion
 of animals affected and the rapidity of action with an equal dose.
    I  do not desire at present to dwell upon any conclusions to be
 drawn from these experiments.         I would merely observe that, while
they    suggest  a means  of protective  inoculation with a modified virus,
 the activity of which may be capable of exact determination, they
 also point to a modification of the views which have been entertained
 on the relations of the Bacillus anthracis to splenic fever.     Whether
 the facts are explicable on the hypothesis of alteration of the habitat
 of the Bacillus, acclimatization, and incapacity for transplantation to a
 different soil ; whether the same result would be attained by cultiva

 X. "On       the Miocene Plants discovered on the Mackenzie
       River." By Professor Oswald Heer, of Zurich. Commu
       nicated by Robert H. Scott, F.R.S. Received June 16,
       1880.
    On his return from his "searching expedition" to Arctic America
 of the year 1848, Sir John Richardson brought to London a box of
 fossil plant-remains, which he had collected on the Mackenzie River,
between Fort Norman and the Great Bear Lake Biver, in latitude
 65°  N.
    The deposits from whence the specimens were obtained had been
discovered by Sir Alexander Mackenzie, in 1785, and visited by Sir J.
Franklin and Sir John (then Dr.) Bichardson in 1825 ; but it was not
until his second visit that Bichardson was able to bring away speci
mens (Journal, vol. i, p. 186).
    This first collection contained seventeen specimens, of which onlv
fourteen allowed of exact determination, but it presented features of
great interest, as it gave us the first indications of the character of
the Miocene Flora of these inaccessible regions of North America.
    The importance of procuring more copious materials for the study
of these deposits hardly requires to be stated, and, accordingly, in the
year 1871, Mr. Bobert H. Scott, F.B.S., and Dr. John Eae, F.B.S.
(who had himself accompanied Sir John Bichardson on his expedition
in 1848, when the first specimens were collected), obtained from the
Government Grant Committee the sum of £50 to defray the cost of
procuring and forwarding to London a collection of these plant-
remains.     The actual expenses incurred have, however, fallen far
short of the amount received.
    The kind offices of Mr. W. Hardisty, Chief Factor of the Hudson's
Bay Company's Service, were enlisted for the task, which was not an
easy one to carry out.      The locality is distant from any inhabited
port, and is merely passed by the boats on their annual trading
journeys up and down the river, when the men are fully employed in
making the best use they can of the short period available for naviga
tion, and have but little time to look for fossils.
   More than one attempt was made to send boxes to London ; but as
this involved a long journey by boat before they reached the port of
shipment, it is not to be wondered at that two or three cases failed to
reach their destination.     At last, in the summer of 1879, Dr. Bae
learnt that a box of fossils, addressed to him, was lying at Manitoba

 which eventually was sent hy rail to New 5Tork, and thence by
 steamer to London, its contents            reaching me in the course of the
 present spring (1880).
     The specimens consisted of silicified wood with a number of leaves,
 partly in soft, but partly also in baked clay. The nature of the stone
 corresponds exactly with that in which Richardson's specimens are
 embedded ; and as, of the fourteen species represented in the new
 collection, seven are found in Richardson's, it is evident that all the
 specimens come from the same locality. The same is also true of
 a few plant fossils recently submitted to me, which have been re
 ceived by Mr. Scott from the Bishop of Athabasca, who, before
 leaving England, had readily consented to do what he could to for
 ward the study of the geology of this part of his immense diocese.
    If we summarise all the known facts of the Fossil Flora known to
 occur on the Mackenzie River, we find that there are twenty-three
species, of which six are widely disseminated in the Miocene deposits
 of Europe :— Taxodium disticlium nrioccnum, Glyptostrobus TJngeri,
 Sequoia Langsdorfii, Corylus M' Quarrii, Platanus aceroides, and Juglans
 acuminata.
    Not a single one of the species is found in the Eocene of Europe.
    The Mackenzie Flora contains six species present also in the Brown-
 coal Flora of Alaska, viz., Tax. distichum, Glypt. Ungeri, Seq. Langsd.,
 Coryl. iFQitar., Jugl. acuminata, and Viburnum NordenskiSldi.
    Eight appear also in the Flora of Saghalien : — Tax. dist., Glypt. Uvg.,
 Sequ. Langsd.,         Corylus M'Qmar.,      Jugl. acum., Hedera M'Clurii,
 Quercus    Olafseni,    and  Magnolia   NordenskiSldi.
    The Flora exhibits just as close a connexion with that of the Arctic
Miocene beds.         Thirteen species from Greenland, fourteen from Spitz-
bergen,    five  from     Grinnell Land, and four from Iceland make their
appearance.
    In Canada,       to the south of the Mackenzie River, in lat. 49° N.,
Tertiary plants have been found in some localities, e.g., at Porcupine
Creek, at Great Valley, and on the Milk River.               The last-mentioned
localities have yielded only a few species, and Professor Dawson has
determined       fifteen from     Porcupine Creek*        Of these six are still
existing, and one of these species (Onocha sensibilis, L.) has also been
found in the Miocene Tuffs of Mull, in Scotland, and at Fort Union.
To these should be added three species known as Miocene, Glypto
strobus Europa'us, Sequoia Langsdorfii, and Populus Richardsoni.
   Not one of the plants described by Dawson occurs in the Eocene of
Europe, and in the United States themselves four of the species have
been found in the Miocene, while only one (the Sequoia) is possibly
admissible as Eocene.

562      Miocene Plants discovered in the Mackenzie River.            [June    17,
    When we, moreover, consider that, according to Dawson's determi
nations, one-half the species agree with living forms, while not an
individual existing plant is known to occur in the Eocene of Europe,
we must certainly range these Porcupine Creek beds with the Miocene
and not with the Eocene, where Professor Dawson places them.
    Professor Dawson was led to this incorrect conclusion by some
remains of Vertebrata found at Milk River.               These, however, occur
on a lower     horizon  than  the  plant beds  on   the Porcupine River, as the
author himself points out (Zoc. cit, p. 152), and these Milk River beds
may be Eocene.
     Two species are common to the Mackenzie River and Porcupine
Creek, and when Professor Dawson, from this circumstance, concludes
that the plants from the former locality are Eocene, he has reasoned
on entirely mistaken grounds.           The same remark may be made when
he assigns the Tertiary Flora of the Arctic regions to the Lower
 Eocene.
     The plant-remains found at Porcupine Creek, on the Mackenzie
 River, and in Alaska belong to the northern Miocene Flora of North
 America, which has a considerable number of species in common with
 the Miocene Flora of the Frigid Zone, and belongs to a period at
 which in the Rocky Mountains, in Greenland, and Iceland, as well as
in Scotland, Ireland, and on the continent of Europe extensive volcanic
eruptions occurred, in which these plant-remains are occasionally found
 embedded.
     If we compare the        plants from the Mackenzie River with the
 Tertiary   Flora   of the  United   States, which has been very thoroughly
 worked up by Professor L. Lesquereux,* we find eight species in
 common, viz.,      Tax. dist., Sequ. Langsd., Qlypt. Ting., Cor. M'Quar.,
 Pop. Richards., Pojjulus Arctica, Betuia maerophylla, and Platanus
 aceroides   (?).
     All these species appear    in the Miocene beds of America, but one of
them (Pop.       Arctica)  reaches   down into the Oligocene and a second
 (the Sequoia) possibly even down to the Eocene.
     The comparison with the Tertiary Flora of the United States,
therefore, tends to place the white clay beds of the Mackenzie River
 among the Miocene, and accordingly corroborates the result based on
the proved agreement of the fossils therein contained with the Miocene
 Flora of Europe and of the Arctic regions.
     The specimens of silicified wood have been submitted for micro-
 scopic examination to M. C. Schroter, Assistant at the Botanical

 The   Electric Condition of  the Terminals    of a Vacuum-Tube after their
           connexion with the Source  of Electricity   has been broken.
    The question has been mooted whether there is         a polarisation of the
 terminals of a vacuum-tube      after the discharge through it has been
 interrupted by breaking connexion between it and the source of elec
 tricity. This question we understand in the sense — does there exist a
 chemical polarisation as is the case for instance with the terminals of
 a voltameter under similar circumstances ? It is evident that if a
 polarisation of this kind could be proved, the formula used for deter
 mining the tube potential (" Phil. Trans.," Part I, vol. clxxi, p. 65)
 wonld no longer hold good.

experiments    we are about to describe, and which we select from a
long series,  will show that there is really no such polarisation of the
terminals.
   We will first take the     case of the voltameter        ; the arrangement of
the apparatus employed in our experiments is shown in fig. 1, where
K K' represent a special key for breaking connexion between any piece
of apparatus and the battery, B, and connecting it afterwards instan
taneously with a galvanometer, G.          The terminals of the battery are
attached respectively to the screw-clamps, c and d, carried by an ebonite
bar, supported on two ebonite columns, touch-points in metallic contact
with   c and d, pass through this bar, so that when the brass springs,
ae and bf, are allowed to rise and press against, these touch-points,
the battery is in metallic connexion with the screw-clamps, a and b,
and any piece of apparatus attached to them, as, for example, the volta
meter, V-. The voltameter employed has a resistance of 20 ohms ; its
platinum electrodes are 2'5 inches long and 0'025 inch in diameter,
and are separated 0-25 inch ; it is charged with dilute pure sulphuric
acid in the proportion of 1 volume of acid, sp. gr. l-84, to 8 volumes
of water.    When the springs are suddenly pressed down by the fingers
placed    on the ebonite disks, e and/, the connexion is broken between
the voltameter and the battery, and it is connected instantaneously
 with the galvanometer, G. The galvanometer actually employed was
not that shown in the figure, but a Thomson galvanometer, whose
constant,    C,=
                    ^
                          — =1,874 scale divisions.             On connecting a
                 1  megohm
 battery of 10 chloride of silver cells with the voltameter for a minute
 or less, and then suddenly pressing down the springs e and /, there
 was a deflection to the left, say, of more than 1,000 scale divisions,
 although the         shunt was used to reduce the current through the
 galvanometer; therefore, the deflection without the shunt would have
 been more than 1,000,000 divisions.            By comparing this deflection
 with that produced by a half microfarad condenser, charged with
 240 cells, it was ascertained that the deviation produced by the volta
 meter was equivalent to that of 111 microfarads.
    The small condenser shown at C, fig. 1, was substituted for the
 voltameter ; it is made of a thin plate of glass 2 inches square and
 0 0115 inch thick ; the tinfoil coatings being 1*5 inch square, its
 capacity was found to be 0-00055 m.f.              When charged with 3,600
 cells, and afterwards      connected with the Thomson galvanometer
 through the | shunt, by pressing down e and /, the deflection was
 136'5 divisions to the left; this multiplied by 9 92, the value of the
 shunt was equivalent to 1,354 divisions.
    The apparatus, shown in fig. 2, which was constructed              for another
 object already described,* was connected with a and b                ; it consists

 discharge   took place,  and    it merely charged up as a condenser.         The
 deflection  produced, when the keys e and            /  were pressed down, was
 (without shunt)    150  divisions,   still to the left. It is evident, therefore,
 that the direction of the deviation throws no light on the question, for
 it is the same with the voltameter as with the condenser.

2,980 cells, and its resistance 449,500 ohms. On pressing down the

   So that in every case when the discharge did not take place, the
deflection, on connecting the terminals with the galvanometer, was the
greatest.
   If the fact which we have already pointed out be taken into ac
count, that with a constant battery-potential, the difference of poten
tial between the terminals of a vacuum-tube varies, in the same gas,
according    to the degree of exhaustion, it follows that as soon as a
discharge   takes  place, the potential of the terminals will be lowered.
We should therefore expect to find what the before-cited experi(
ments indicated, namely, that the static charge of the terminals would
be greater when no discharge takes place than after it has occurred,
notwithstanding that a larger number of cells may have been em
ployed in the latter case than in the former, for we have shown
(" Phil. Trans.," vol. clxxi, p. 67), that a tube-potential may be only
430 cells, although the battery connected with its terminals is 11,000
cells.
   We believe, therefore, that the experiments point conclusively to
the deduction that the current obtained from the terminals of a
vacuum tube, after having been disconnected from the battery, is
solely due to a static charge and not to a chemical polarisation.

   On substituting either the hell-jar, with disk terminals, or the tube
199 for the voltameter, the deflection of the return static charge was
in the same direction as the return current from the voltameter, so that,
as we before stated, no inference can be drawn from the direction of
the current as to its being produced by polarisation or a static charge.
We think, however, that we have shown conclusively that the effect
in the case of a vacuum-tube is due to a static charge, and not to a
polarisation of the terminals.   We rest our opinion mainly on the fact
that a greater deflection is produced, when the potential has not been
lessened by a discharge through the tube, than that which occurs after
the discharge has taken place, which, it had been surmised, might
possibly produce a chemical polarisation.

   T.  R. Robinson, D.D., F.R.S., &c. Received June 13, 1880.
                               (Abstract.)
   In  a previous paper the author detailed experiments made by
attaching anemometers to a whirling machine, and the conclusions to
which they led. He was however doubtful of the accuracy of the
method, and proposed one depending on tho action of natural wind

He has tried this, and he thinks successfully.                     Two instruments of the
Kew type, differing only in friction, were established                       22 feet asunder
on the roof of the house and 16 feet above it : the number of turns
made by each, and the time, were recorded by a chronograph, and from
these, v and v', the velocity in miles per hour of the centres of the cups
was known.
  The friction of one of these (K) was constant ; that of the other (E)
was varied by applying to a disk on its axle Prony's brake, which was
connected with a spring balance whose tension was recorded during
the time of experiment by a pencil moved by clockwork.         Thus the
mean friction was obtained.    It ranged from 353 grains to 4,982.
     The equation       of an anemometer's motion is                 V3+i>3—     2Vvz—   /=0
where   V is the unknown velocity of the wind, at and as two constants
which are to be determined.       Each observation gives two equations
in which there are four unknown quantities, for it is found that the
value of V changes from one instrument to another.          This is partly
owing to eddies caused by   the  buildings, but  also in great measure to
irregularity of the wind itself. It is, however, also found that these
wind-differences are as likely to have + as — signs, and therefore it may
be expected that their sum will vanish in a large number of observa
tions.   The ordinary methods of elimination fail here even to determine
with precision a single constant, and he has proceeded by approxi
mation.
   Assuming the value of a given by the actual measurements in his
paper =15'315 at 30" and 32° for 9-inch cups, and that there is no
resistance as v2 except that in the equation, and assuming an approxi
mate value for as, we can compute V and V*. The difference between
these must be due to an error in as and to w the wind error, and taking
the sum of      a series we have
          S(V'-V)       + Sw=    Ax x S(e -      e')
                                                   ;   e   being            —V
     If   the   observations
                           are sufficiently   numerous Sw=0, with the
assumed as+ Ax    thus  found,  recompute   the V till the sum of V— V                        is
insensible, and the final x will give V with    high degree of probability.

eddies caused by the cups being more powerful when the arms are
 short, bnt still more the presence of high powers of the arm and
-diameter occurring in the expressions of the mean pressures on the
concave and convex surfaces of the hemispheres.                In the present state
of hydrodynamics we cannot assign these expressions, bnt we know
enough to see that such powers may be present.
     As each type of anemometer has its own constants, the author would
suggest to meteorologists the propriety of confining themselves to
one or two forms.          For fixed instruments he considers the Kew one
as good as any, and would wish to see it generally adopted.                     For
portable ones he has no experience except with Casella's 3" cups 6"
arms, which he found very convenient ; he has not however deter
mined its constants.         Some selection of the sort seems necessary if it
is wished to have an uniform system of wind-measures.
XIII.     " Note on the Bearing on the Atomic Weight of Alumi
        nium of the Fact that this Metal occludes Hydrogen."
        By J. W. Mallet, F.R.S. Beceived June 14, 1880.
     In a recent communication to the Academic des Sciences,* it has
been pointed out by Dumas that metallic aluminium and magnesium,
as well as silver, may contain sensible quantities of occluded gas, that
obtained from aluminium being almost pure hydrogen.
    In a paper on the atomic weight of aluminium read before the Royal
Society on the 22nd of April last I gave, among other data, the results
of several experiments on the quantity of hydrogen liberated by a
known weight of aluminium from a strong solution of sodinm hydrate.

1880.]             On the Atomic    Weight  of Aluminium.                57£
In examining     beforehand the purity of the specially prepared metal
used, warned     by Dumas' previous results as to gaseous occlusion by
silver, of which due account was taken in the paper,      I did not neglect
to test in like manner the aluminium, but obtained an entirely negative
result. As, however,     I  heated the metal in a Sprengel vacuum only
to the highest temperature which a hard Bohemian glass tube would
bear, while M. Dnmas says that gas is only given off suddenly
                                                                       " vers
le rouge blanc,"  I have  since seeing his paper repeated the experiment
in a porcelain tube, and at this higher temperature, obtained by means
of an excellent gas furnace, with a small remnant of the same material
nsed in the atomic weight determinations.
    4-783 grms. of the metal thus treated gave a small bubble of gas,
which measured but -75 cub. centim. at 24° C. and 752 millims.
pressure.     Transferred to a miniature eudiometer it was exploded
 with oxygen, and seemed to be pure hydrogen.        This is but little more
 than one-third the quantity of gas obtained by Dumas, but his experi
 ments and my own with silver prove that the amount occluded varies
 with the conditions under which the metal has been fused, and two
 circumstances in the preparation of my alumininm probably tended to
 reduce the proportion of hydrogen taken up— namely, that, fearing
 possible contamination of the metal by its alloying itself with sodium
 at the moment of reduction from the bromide, I used a considerable
 excess of the latter, and that, not only were the ingots of sodium wiped
 free of naphtha with a cloth, but the outside surface was pared off
 with a knife, and only quite clear and solid pieces of the alkaline metal
 were used for the reduction.
    The above volume of hydrogen only represents a weight of 0'000061
 grm. ; the corresponding weight from the largest amount of aluminium
 used iu the atomic weight experiments of Series 3, A (in which
 the gaseous hydrogen evolved was measured), would be but O'OOOOIO
 grm., and the corresponding weight from the largest amount of alumi
 nium used in Series 3, B (in which the hydrogen evolved was burned
 and weighed as water), would be 0-000067 grm. — both quantities too
 small to be determined by the balance used.
    Even if it were possible to correct for this occluded hydrogen the
 weight of metallic aluminium taken, the greatest error in the volume of
 hydrogen obtained in Series 3, A, would only represent 0 12 cub.
 centim., which would be barely measurable in the flask used, and
 would affect the atomic weight deduced for aluminium to an extent
 less than one-tenth of the probable error of the mean result.       And, in
 Series 3, B, the greatest error in the weight of the water produced by
 combustion of the hydrogen would be 0'0006 grm., measurable by the
 balance, but affecting the result by less than three-fourths of the
 probable error of the mean.

error due to the cause pointed out by the great French chemist, its
influence is in the present case inappreciable by existing means of
measurement, and no correction of the numbers obtained for the atomic
weight in question can be applied which shall have any real meaning.
    The other series (1 and 2) of experiments made to determine this
atomic weight do not involve the question of gaseous occlusion, at any
rate in the same form, as in them the metal itself was not used, b ut
certain of its compounds only.
XIV. On the .Spectrum of the Flame of Hydrogen."                           By
       William Huggins, D.C.L., LL.D., F.R.S. Received June
       16, 1880.
    Messrs. Liveing and Dewar state, in a paper read before the Royal
Society on June 10 {ante p. 494), that they have obtained a photograph
of the ultra-violet part of the spectrum of coal gas burning in oxygen,
and in a note dated June 8 they add that they have reason to believe
that this remarkable spectrum is not due to any carbon compound
but to water.
    Under these circumstances I think that it is desirable that I should
give an account of some experiments which             I made on this subject
some months since without waiting until the investigation is more
complete.
    On December 27, 1879, 1 took a photograph of the flame of hydrogen
burning in air. As is well known, the flame of hydrogen possesses but
little luminosity, and shows no lines or bands in the visible part of the
spectrum, except that due to sodium as an impurity.
    Professor Stokes, in his paper
                                      " On the Change of Refrangibility of
Light,"* had stated that "the flame of hydrogen produces a very
strong effect. The invisible rays in which it so much abounds, taken
as a whole, appear to be even more       refrangible than those which    come
from the flame of a spirit lamp."          I was not, however, prepared for
the strong group of lines in the ultra-violet which, after an exposure
of one minute and a half, came out upon the plate.
    Two or three weeks later, about the middle of January, 1880, I
showed this spectrum to Professor Stokes, and we considered it
probable    that this remarkable      group was the spectrum of water.
Professor   Stokes  permits  me   to mention    that, in a letter addressed to
me on January 30, he speaks of
                                     "  this novel and interesting result,"

578                           Dr.  W. Huggins.                    [June  17,
    I have  since that date taken a large number of photographs of the
spectra   of  different flames, in the hope of being able to present the
resnlts to the Royal Society, when the research was more complete.          I
                                         I
think now that it is desirable that should describe the spectrum of
the flame of hydrogen, but       I shall reserve for the present the experi
ments which relate to the presence of carbon and its compounds.
    The spectrum of the flame of hydrogen burning in air is represented
in the diagram, Spectrum No. 1. It consists of a group of lines which
terminates at the more refrangible limit in a pair of strong lines,
X 3062 and X. 3068.      At a short distance, in the less refrangible direc
tion, what may perhaps be regarded as the group proper, commences
with a strong line, X 3090. Between the strong line X 3068 and the
line X 3090 there is a line less bright, X 3080. Less refrangible than
the line X 3090 are finer lines at about equal distances.      The lines are
then fine and near each other, and appear to be arranged in very close
pairs.    There is a pair of fine, but very distinct lines, X 3171 and
\  3167. In this photograph the group can be traced to about X 3*290.
This group constitutes the whole spectrum, which is due probably to
the vapour of water.
    I then introduced oxygen into the flame, leaving a small excess of
hydrogen.      A spectrum in all respects similar came out upon the
plate.    I  repeated the experiment, taking both spectra on the same
plate.    Through    one-half of the slit the spectrum of the oxyhydrogen
flame was taken.        This flame was about 7 inches long, and the
spectrum taken of a part of the flame 2 inches from the jet. The
oxygen was then turned off, and the quantity of hydrogen allowed to
remain unaltered.       A second spectrum with an exposure of the same
duration was then taken through the second half of the slit. On the
 plate the two spectra are in every respect similar, and have so exactly
the same intensity, that they appear as one broad spectrum.
    In all these experiments a platinum jet which had been carefully
cleaned was used.
    In these experiments     the two gases met within      the blowpipe and
 issued in a mixed state.
    The jet was removed, and a flame of hydrogen was surrounded
 with oxygen. The spectrum, No. 2 in the diagram, shows some addi
 tional lines. In this case the jet was brass, and in this or some other
                                                        I
 way impurities may have been introduced ; and should, at present,
 incline to the view that the additional lines about X 3429 and X 3473,
 and the groups more refrangible than X 3062, do not belong to the
 water spectrum, but to impurities.
    Coal-gas was substituted for hydrogen in the oxyhydrogen blow
 pipe, and oxygen admitted in as large a proportion as possible.        The
 inner blue flame rising about 2 inches above the jet showed in the
 visible part of the spectrum the usual " five-fingered spectrum."      The

  light from this part of the flame was projected upon the slit. The
  spectrum, No. 3 in the diagram, contains the water group already
 ¦described, and in addition a very strong line close to G, and two
  lines, X 3872 and   \ 3890 ; this latter line is seen to be the more refran
  gible limit of a group of fine lines shading off towards K.
      The ultra-violet group when carefully compared with the group in
  the spectrum of pure hydrogen, shows several small differences.             I
 am inclined to believe that there is the superposition of a second
 fainter group.     There is strong evidence of this in some spectra of
 hydrogen taken under other conditions. There is also a broad band
 less refrangible than the strong line at G, and the light extends from
 this line on its more refrangible side.
     A double Bunsen burner (Fletcher's form) with a strong blast of
air was then fitted up. The spectrum was taken of the intense blue
 flame.    It resembles the one last described. All the distinctive fea
 tures are intensified, and a continuous spectrum and groupings of
 very fine lines fill up all the intervals between the groups already
described, so that there is an unbroken strong spectrum throughout
the whole region which falls upon the plate.
     A spirit lamp was arranged before the slit. The spectrum is essen
tially the same as No. 3, but as it is less intense only the strongest
lines are seen.     The water group, the strong line at G, and the pair
of lines rather more refrangible than K, are seen.            Probably with a
longer exposure the finer lines would also show themselves.
     The distinctive features of spectrum No. 3 appear to be connected
with the presence of carbon.

   In our   last communication        to the Society, " On the Spectrum of the
Compounds of Carbon with Hydrogen and Nitrogen, No. II," we
noticed that a remarkable series of lines, extending over the region
between the lines S and R of the solar spectrum, were developed in
the flame of coal-gas burning in oxygen.               The arrangement of lines
and bands, of which this spectrum consists, is shown in the accompany
ing diagram,* fig. 1. It begins at the more refrangible end with two

about the wave-length 3210. It is well developed in the flame of hydro-
  • This diagram pives tolerably well tbc general character of the spectrum, but
the artist has not in all cases correctly rendered the relative strength of the lines.
Those of the le ss refrangible half are almost too strongly rendered.

gen as well as of hydrocarbons, burning in oxygen, and less strongly in
the flames of non-hydrogenous gases, such as carbonic oxide and cyano
gen, if burnt in moist oxygen.    Special pains were taken to purify
the gases from sulphur. The same spectrum is given by the electric
spark taken, without condenser, in moist hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen,
and carbonic acid gas, but it disappears if the gas and apparatus
be thoroughly dried.   We are led to the conclusion that the spec
trum is that of water. The accompanying diagram, fig. 2, shows
                                 Fi<i.
the apparatus used for comparing the spectra of the spark in the gases,
dry and moist. The tube in which the sparks were passed was closed
at the end 6 by a quartz lens cemented to the glass ; c c were platinum,
wires sealed into the glass. The gas was introduced through the
 narrow tube o, provided with a branch closed by a glass stopcock.
 The gas was passed from the gas-holder through two long drying-tubes,
of which the first was filled with calcium chloride, and the second
 with phosphoric anhydride.     The joints were all made with dry corks,
in order to avoid the hydrocarbons which contaminate gases passed
 throngh rubber tubes.     The exit-tube d was armed with a tube of
phosphoric anhydride, to prevent moisture entering that way. It was
necessary to pass a current of dry gas for fnlly an hour through the
warmed apparatus before the moisture was sufficiently expelled.
When this was done, photographs of the spark showed either no trace,
or only the faintest traces, of the spectrum above described. On now
introducing a drop of water through stopcock in the branch at a, and
letting it spread over a plug of asbestos placed in the tube at a, the
current of gas of course passed into the sparking tube moist instead of
dry   and on now passing the spark, the spectrum above described at
      ;
once imprinted itself on the photographic plate. The effect was the
same, whether the gas used were hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, or car
bonic acid. In the case of nitrogen, some of the channelled bands due
to that gas overlap the water spectrum, and partly obscure      it,
                                                               but not
so much but that it can be still very distinctly recognised.  When a
condenser is used, the water spectrum disappears.   The same spectrum

seems to appear in the De      Meritens arc, bnt is mach less fully deve
loped.     The  spectrum  we  have  figured does not by any means exhaust
the ultra-violet spectra of the flames we have observed, but it is as
much as we have been able at present to observe closely and to trace
to water as its cause.      In writing of this and other spectra which we
have traced to be due to compounds, we abstain from speculating upon
the particular molecular condition or stage of combination or decom
position, which may give rise to such spectra.         The interest of finding
an ultra-violet spectrum of water in a flame at all seemed to justify
our laying before the Society so much as we have already determined.
It opens up questions as to the emissive power for radiation of short
wave-length of gaseous substances at .the comparatively low tempera
tures of flames, with regard to which we are accumulating facts, which
we propose to discuss in a future communication.           It is obvious, how
ever, that this opens up a very large and extensive field of inquiry
which will necessitate great precautions in the conduct of the experi
ments ; for instance, we are not prepared to guarantee that oxides of
nitrogen from traces of air may not have something to do with some
parts of the spectrum here described.          Such facts as we have placed
before the Society will completely modify the inferences which have
been drawn as to the assumed continuity of name spectra even under
compression, and as to the character of the specific absorption of the
vapour of water.

                                   iii
  John Allan Broun was born on 21st September, 1817, at Dumfries,
where his father held a school intended   for young men about to enter
the Navy.
  On the death of his father, Mr. Broun, who was then about twenty
years of age, became a student at the University of Edinburgh, where
he speedily distinguished himself.     Here his attachment towards
physical science more especially developed itself and procured for him
the friendship of the late James D. Forbes, who was then Professor of
Natural Philosophy at Edinburgh.
   About this time (1842) the scientific world became awake to the
importance of cultivating terrestrial magnetism as a branch of cos-
mical inquiry, and Sir Thomas MacDougal Brisbane in a very generous
manner agreed to establish and maintain a highly equipped observa
tory at his house at Makerstonn, Dumfriesshire.
   Mr. Broun was appointed director of this observatory after a course
of preliminary training spent at the Royal Observatory, Greenwich,
from which he derived much information.
   He continued for eight years to be director of this establishment,
and in addition to his other duties he discussed his observations at
                                                                " Trans
great length in a series of volumes which were published in the
actions of the Royal Society of Edinburgh," of which body Sir Thomas
Brisbane was the President.
   The production of these volumes must have cost Mr. Broun           a
great amount of time and thought, inasmuch as while published at an
early stage of an important inquiry, they were conspicuous for the skill
employed in the development of new methods.
    John Allan Broun had now in virtue of what he had done acquired
a high reputation as one of the leaders in the science of terrestrial
magnetism, and was regarded as one peculiarly well adapted to fill a
prominent scientific position whether at home or abroad. About this
time two Professorships in Scotland became vacant, for either of which
he would have been a very desirable candidate   ;  but he had conscien
tious scruples which prevented him from subscribing to certain
formulae which were then insisted on from the holders of all Scotch
Chairs.
   In 1850 Broun left Makerstoun and went to Paris, where he formed
the acquaintance of the leading men of science of that capital.
   There also he met with the lady who became his wife, Isaline
Vallouy, the daughter of a clergyman in the Canton dn Vaud, and
belonging to an old Protestant family of Dauphine (du Val Louise),
who had fled from France at the Revolution. This lady and a family
of three sons and two daughters are now left to mourn his loss.
   In 1851, through the influence of Colonel Sykes, Broun was ap
pointed Director of the Trevandrum Observatory, an institution
supported by His Highness the Rajah of Travancore, and ho went to

                                      iv
India in tho same year. His work in India was attended with many
difficulties, bat it was of very great scientific value.
   Among other things hp wished to obtain observations at different
heights, and the following short statement will exhibit in his own
words tho nature of the difficulties he met with in carrying out this
project, all of which were successfully overcome.
   " It had appeared to me necessary," he says, in the preface to his
observations, " for a complete examination of the questions to be solved,
that observations should not be limited to a single station, but that
the standard observatory should serve not merely for the determination
of the laws and physical constants at one point, but also for the com
parison and co-ordination of the laws depending on differences of
height, of latitude, and of longitude.
   " With reference to questions connected with difference of height,
the Agustia Malley, about twenty-two miles E.N.E. of Trevandrum,
the highest mountain in the narrow chain of the Ghats, rising rapidly
from the plains of Coromandel and Malabar, possessed the great
advantage of being free from the effects of neighbouring high table
lands.     The chief objection to this locality lay in its position, without
roads, a day's journey from the nearest cultivated grounds, surrounded
by forests inhabited by elephants and tigers.       The construction of an
observatory on this nearly inaccessible rocky peak presented con
siderable difficulties.   It was doubted, also, whether native observers,
accustomed only to the climate of the plains, could live, or could be
induced to try to do so, on a mountain top, which for months of each
year remains buried in cloud.
   " These and many other difficulties were, however, vanquished, and
the observatory, built of wood in the forests about 2,300 feet below
the summit, was taken to pieces, carried to the top, and rebuilt there
in the first month of 1855."
   Broun was not likely to spare himself, even under such a climate as
that of India, and a deafness, which never left him, was caught in one
of his excursions on the hills for the purpose of observing.        He came
back to Europe in 1866, in the hope that medical treatment might
remove his deafness.     In this he was disappointed ; he then returned
to India for three years more.
   On his final return from India he resided, for a time, at Lausanne,
and afterwards at Stuttgart, where his whole time was devoted to the
preparation of the first volume of the results of the Trevandrum
observations.     Of this volume, it is sufficient to say that it is no less
admirable than those in which the Makerstoun observations were
discussed.
   Tho last six years of Broun's life were spent for the most part in
 London, where he gave his whole time and energy to tho prosecution
of scientific research.    Upwards of two years ago his health began to

give way, and during a stay at Lynton (Devonshire) he had, in 1878,
a kind of nervous attack, which was the beginning of his last illness.
He died suddenly on the 22nd November, 1879.
   If  Broun occupied the position of a leading pioneer in observa
 tional inquiry, he also shared the discomforts of such a post.             He
 considered no trouble too great in order to procure trustworthy
 observations, and he would spend an immense amount of labour upon
 them, when once obtained.           On one occasion, with the purpose of
 making observations, he lived for about six weeks in a hut on the
 Cheviot Hills, performing his toilet in the open air, sometimes with
 miste aronnd him and water nearly freezing.
    It has been said of Faraday that his failures must have cost him
even more thought than his successes, and the same remark will apply,
with even greater force, to an original thinker in observational science
like Broun. Here tho testing of every idea entails a laborious in
 vestigation, and Broun, whose mind was at once very fertile and very
 scrupulous, must often have overworked himself before dismissing
a subject from his thoughts.         It seems likely that this combination of
 qualities eventually contributed to undermine his health.
    During the latter part of his life he received from the Government
 Fund of the Royal Society a sum of money to enable him to improve
and complete the reduction of the colonial magnetic observations.
 But this immediate and apparent responsibility was peculiarly trying
to a man like Broun. The work seemed to go on growing the more he
 examined  it,  and he was never satisfied without going still more deeply
 into the subject than he had already gone. At length his health began
to give way, and the thought that he had not been able to finish these
investigations unfortunately hastened the progress of his malady.
    It must not be supposed that Broun, while combining scrupulosity
and intense devotion to science, was by nature a recluse.            He was, on
the contrary,    a  man of delicate social instincts and well calculated to
take an active part in scientific administration.        His deafness, however,
prevented     this,  and during    the   latter  years of  his life he was best
known to small, but attached, circle of friends.
           a
    Broun was both a magnetician and a meteorologist. His Makerstoun
observations have been already mentioned as being peculiarly valuable
for the light they threw, at      a      comparatively    early period, on the
changes    of  the magnetism    of  the   earth.
    In 1861 he contributed two very valuable memoirs to the " Transac
tions of the Royal Society of Edinburgh." In one of these he discussed
the errors and corrections of the bifilar magnetometer, including the
determination of its temperature coefficient, which he showed might
be found by a more correct method than that hitherto adopted. His
second memoir was on the horizontal force of the earth's magnetism,
for which he established the annual laws from a discussion of obesrva

                                      vi
ticns taken at various places. He likewise showed that the variations
of this element from day to day are nearly the same over all the
world.
   For these discoveries the Keith Medal of the Royal Society of
Edinburgh was awarded to him.
   In his first volume of the " Results of the Trevandrum Observa
      "
tions    Broun has given an original and exhaustive investigation of
the influence of the sun and moon upon the direction of the magnetic
needle ; but his researches regarding the lunar-diurnal variation of
this element form perhaps the most original part of the volume.
Besides having claims to be considered an independent discoverer of
this variation, he has certainly increased our knowledge of its laws more
than any other magnetician.        He showed that near the equator its
law in December was the opposite of that in June.        His observation
that the lunar action was reversed at sunrise, and that it was much
greater during the day than during the night, whether the moon was
above or below the horizon, may be noted as peculiarly likely to throw
mnch light on the theory of the subject.
   Broun's discovery of the simultaneity all the world over of the
changes from day to day of the earth's horizontal force has already
been mentioned.      Certain of these changes he found to be due to the
moon, while others had a period of nearly twenty-six days. These last
Broun attributed to solar action, and in discussing the subject, in
a memoir published in the " Philosophical Transactions
                                                              " for 1877,
he found that the greater magnetic disturbances were apparently due
to actions proceeding from particular meridians of the son.          This
is a subject of very great importance, and its exact meaning has yet
to be discovered.
   In meteorology Bronn has done some very important work. He has
shown the apparent simultaneity of the changes of mean barometric
pressure over a great part of the globe, and here too he has discovered
a period of   nearly twenty-six days.
   He was the first to commence those systematic observations of
clouds at various altitudes that arc now so common, and he has like
wise pointed ont certain relations between atmospheric motions and
the directions of the lines of equal barometric pressure.
    For his various researches one of the Royal Medals of this Society
 was conferred on him in 1878.
   It is gratifying to be able to state that Her Majesty has been
graciously pleased to mark her sense of the labours of this distin
guished physicist by bestowing upon his widow a pension of £75 per
annum.
