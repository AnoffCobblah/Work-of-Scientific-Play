                                       (Abstract.)
     When preparing a report on the great Indian earthquake of 12th
 June, 1897, the author noticed that the European records of this
 earthquake      showed a phase of increased disturbance in what are
 commonly called the preliminary tremors, making, with the great un
 dulations, three phases of motion.             He suggested that these three
 phases    represented    the   arrival  of (1) the condensational, (2) the dis-
 tortional waves travelling through the earth, and (3) surface undula
 tions travelling round the earth. The present paper is an attempt to
 verify these suggestions by a comparison with other earthquakes.
      For this purpose a selection has been made from the published
  records of those earthquakes which fulfil the conditions (1) that the
  place of origin shall be known within 1° of arc, (2) that the time of
  origin shall be known within a limit of error of one minute, (3) that
  there shall be a sufficient number of records, distant more than 20° of
  arc from the origin, to serve as a check on each other.          Eleven distinct
  shocks, representing        seven   great earthquakes,   are found to satisfy
  these conditions, and in every case the same three-phase character
  as was recognised in the earthquake of 12th June, 1897, is found.             A
  comparison of time intervals        and apparent rates of propagation     shows

                                                                                        '¦'>

that the coincidence   is   not accidental, but represents the separation of
three   distinct types of wave motion having different rates of propa
gation.
  On plotting the records     itfound that the time curves of the first
                                   is
two phases   form   curved lines,  indicating an increase of apparent
velocity with distance from the origin, such that, applying Rudzki's
investigation, the wave motion represented by these two phases must
have travelled through the earth, along curved wave paths, convex
towards the centre of the earth, and with  rate of propagation which
                                                   a
increases with the distance from the surface.   On continuing these
curves, by extrapolation, to the origin they give rates of propagation
in very fair concordance with the rates of propagation of condensa
tional and distortional plane waves which may be expected to obtain
in continuous rock at some distance from the surface of the earth.
  The waves of the third phase show no such increase of rate of
progagation with distance from the origin. The rate of propagation                      is
uniform at all distances; from which       concluded that the great
                                              it   is
undulations of the third phase are surface waves, travelling with a
uniform rate of propagation round the surface of the earth.   It also              is
found that the waves of this phase set up by great earthquakes travel
faster than those set up by lesser ones, and from this      concluded
                                                                 it   is
that the rate of propagation of these waves     in some way a function
                                                        is
of their size, thus affording a confirmation of Lord Kelvin's suggestion
that their propagation   is in part gravitational.
  The general conclusion        that in the complete record of a distant
                               is
earthquake, three distinct types of wave motion can be recognised (1)
condensational, and (2) distortional plane waves, travelling by brachi
stochronic paths through the earth, and (3) elastic, or gravitational
elastic, surface waves, travelling round the surface of the earth.  The
records are, however, often incomplete by the omission of the first or
the first and second of these phases, and the widely divergent estimates
of    the apparent rate of propagation          of      the preliminary        tremors
are   largely due to this.

     Sincethe discovery of male medusas in specimens of Millepora
collected by Professor Haddon in Torres Straits eight years ago (2),                    I
have examined several large collections of specimens, both dried and
preserved in spirit, from different parts of the world with the object of
comparing the medusas and the ampullae they form in the varying
forms which the genus exhibits. The examination of the dried coralla
in museums has convinced me that the presence or absence of ampullae
                                                                           b   2

cannot be used as the diagnostic character of any one species, since
these structures occasionally occur in nearly all the principal forms of
the genus which have been described.        It was not until I examined one
of the many specimens of the genus collected by Mr. Stanley Gardiner
in Funafuti, however, that I had the opportunity of seeing again a
male medusa, all the other specimens I had received having proved to
be barren.    The male    medusae of Mr. Gardiner's specimen turned out
to be identical   in size and form with those given to me by Professor
Haddon, and I came to the conclusion that no specific distinction could
be drawn between the two forms based on characters of the medusa
before it is set free (3).
   In May,    1898,  Mr. Duerden, of the Jamaica Institute, sent me a
small piece   of Millepora preserved in spirit, which upon examination
was found to bear female medusae.        Each of these medusas carried on
the manubrium from thirty to fifty ova of approximately equal size,
0-015 mm., and the general appearance of the medusae suggested that
they were nearly ready to escape.        This appearance, however, proved
to be deceptive, for in December I received another consignment of the
material from Jamaica, in which the medusae showed very different
characters, three or four, or, in a few cases, five, of the ova in each
medusa being greatly enlarged and the others degenerate.             In the
meantime, Mr. Duerden wrote to me saying that he had actually seen
these  medusae escape, and had been able to liberate many others       from
the corallum     by  means   of a needle.    Thus was it definitely  proved
that this Millepore in the West Indies produces free swimming medusa?
which bear ova.
   Several important questions arose when this matter was settled.        It
was clearly important to find the male medusa of Millepore in Jamaica
to compare it with the female medusa and also with the Pacific male
medusas.    It was  also important, if possible, to trace the development
of the medusa,     and  to find, if possible, the place of origin of the
sexual cells. In the hope of being able to get fresh material which
 would   enable me to answer these and other important questions,          I
have delayed the publication of the results I have obtained for nearly
twelve months, but as      it  seems  probable that I may have to wait a
very long time more before the material is forthcoming, I have decided
 now to publish the results of my investigation of Mr. Duerden's
material.
   1. The immature    female medusce received in May, 1898.         A small
branch of    a  Millepore   well  preserved  in spirit after treatment with
formalin was all that was sent to me.         No very definite signs of the
presence   of the medusa?     could be noticed before the specimen was
decalcified, but as soon as the soft tissues peeled off the lower parts of
the corallum under the action of nitric acid a considerable number of
medusiform     bodies could be seen with a lens.      They varied consider

                       The Jlcduscr of Millepora,                          5
ably in size, but the majority were about O-i ram. in diameter, and the
remainder rather smaller.     The structure of these bodies was examined
by means of sections taken horizontally and vertically to the surface of
the eorallum.   Each medusa (fig. 1) lies in an ampulla (amp.) or cavity
in the eorallum, and is attached by a narrow stalk to the centre of the
innermost   wall of the ampulla.     The umbrella   (fig. 1, umb.) is a thin
                                  Fig.  1.
                                    IT      mm
 membrane, slightly swollen at the margin (m.u.).       With a high power
of the microscope it can be clearly seen that this membrane consists of
a median lamella of endoderm, covered on each side by an ectodermal
epithelium.    No canals or cavities of any kind occur in the umbrella.
 There is no velum, and there are no tentacles. The cavity of the
umbrella   is almost completely filled with a swollen manubrium, which
tears on its outer or upper side a mouth (M), around which lies a
broad band of ova.      There can be no doubt that in some cases there is
communication     between the endodermal cavity of the medusa and the
sub-umbrella   cavity by way of this mouth, but it is impossible to say in
the present state of the inquiry whether the mouth of the medusa opens
normally at this stage.     It appears to be closed usually at the time
when the medusa is ready to escape, as will be mentioned later on.
The great size, however, of the manubrium of the female medusa is
principally due to the thick vacuolated endoderm (end.). The gastral
cavity of the medusa is not so simple as it is in the male medusa (of
the Pacific Millepores), but it is subject to many very striking varia
tions.   In some of the medusas there arc four radial couca proceeding a
Bhort distance into the endoderm of the manubrium from the main
tubular gastral cavity that occupies the axis of the manubrium.         This
cavity communicates,    on the one hand,   with the exterior by the mouth,

(i                          Mr. S.  J. Hickson.
and, on the other, with the canals of the ccenenchym.           In some cases
there are only three of these cceca, in others they are very irregular,
and again in others there are none.      It is quite impossible to determine
with certainty what is the " typical " or " average " arrangement of the
cavities of these medusae with the limited amount of material at my
disposal, but I think it is probable that the quadriradiate form will be
found to be the most frequent of the many variations.
    2. Tlie mature female medusa) received in December, 1898.             The
material sent to me being abundant, I have been able to examine a
large series of medusae at this stage before their escape from the
ampullae.    I have also examined a few medusae which Mr. Duerden
collected in his aquaria after their escape from the ampullae.       They are
decidedly larger than the immature medusae of the last collection ;
the diameter of the umbrella being about 0-6 mm. instead of about
0-4 mm.      The variability is even more pronounced at this stage than

 in the last, and it is almost impossible to find two medusae exactly
 alike.   In most of the medusae (figs. 2 and 3) three or four large ova
 are found, and the manubrium is usually triradiate or quadriradiate
 accordingly, but occasionally medusae with five, two, or only one
 mature ova occur, and the manubria of these are more irregular.
    I mounted a piece of a decalcified specimen about 48 sq. mm. in area,
 and found that it bore forty-one medusae ; of these, nineteen had four
 ova, eighteen had three ova, two had two ova, one five, and one one.
 In another piece I counted three with four ova, six with three ova, and
 one with two.    In another piece 15 mm. by 10 mm. in area I counted
 forty with three ova, fifteen with four     ova, five with two, and five with

                            The Meduscc     of MMepora.                         7

.  the  fours were about six times     as numerous    as the threes, while in the
   remaining two-thirds the threes were about nine times as numerous
   as  the fours.
      No very definite conclusions can be formed upon these figures, but it
   3eems to me probable that so little is the form of the medusa of Mille-
   pora stereotyped,     that a slight variation in the distribution of nourish
   ment   in the canals may be the determining       cause of the medusa being
   triradiate or quadriradiate.

      The germinal vesicle of each large ovum is regularly spherical in
  shape, with a very sharp outline.             The nucleoplasm is apparently
  homogeneous, and resists the action of iron-haematoxylin and carmine,
  exhibiting no nucleolus nor chromatin granules.
      In addition to the large ova, there are always present in the medusa
  several oocytes. These cells stain much more deeply than the ova, and
  many of them exhibit a well-defined nucleus with a deeply staining
  nucleolus.      In some cases the cytoplasm of one of these cells may be
  seen to be continuous with the cytoplasm of an ovum, and I have little
  doubt that most of them, and perhaps all of them, arc ultimately

8                          Mr.   S.   J.    Hickson.
absorbed into the substance of the large ova.    The nucleus of the
oocyte seems to  be disintegrated before complete fusion takes place,           ,
since no degenerate nuclei can be found in the cytoplasm of the
large ova.
   The remarkably thick endoderm of the female medusa is a very
characteristic feature. It may be regarded as a special adaptation of
endodermal tissue for the purpose of affording nourishment to the
rapidly maturing ova, and similar in function to the trophodisc of the
Stylasteridae.
  At this stage several zooxanthcllae (fig. 3, z) occur in the manubrium,
but none were observed in the cytoplasm of the ova.
  I have not been able to find evidence of the existence of an open
mouth in the medusae at this stago, but, bearing in mind the great
variability they exhibit, I cannot assert that a mouth never occurs.
  The margin of the umbrella exhibits three or four or five thickenings,
due to clusters of nematocysts (figs. 4 — 9), but no definite tentacles nor
sense organs were to be found after a most searching examination.

    ;{.                       I have carefully examined the medusae
and free ova that Mr. Duerden collected in the water of his aquarium.
The medusae are so shrivelled and degenerate that nothing of their
anatomy could be satisfactorily    determined.     The ova, however,
appear to be in a satisfactory state of preservation, and exhibit one
or two features of interest.   Each ovum of this series is approxi
mately 0-25 mm. in diameter, that is to say, 0'05 mm.             larger   in
diameter than the ovum in the last stage.
  The cytoplasm is very granular and contains numerous vacuoles
and a few zooxanthellae (fig. 10, The germinal vesicle
                                      z).              very large

and contains no nucleolus and very few or no chromatin granules.           Its
outline is very ill-defined.   The presence of zooxanthellse in the ovum
at this stage is of interest, and it is a matter for regret that I have
been unable     to determine the manner in which they pass into the
cytoplasm from the endoderm of the medusa.

   In general characters the free ovum of Millepora has a remarkable
resemblance to the ova of Alcyonium and other Alcyonarians, and I
believe that this points to the conclusion that its specific gravity is
very slightly higher than that of sea water, and sinks extremely
slowly when set free.
   We are indebted to Mr. Duerden (1) for a brief account of these
medusae as observed in an aquarium (see figs. 4 — 9).            " When first
liberated their walls appeared quite wrinkled, and the interior was
occupied with three or four opaque bodies (the ova).               No stalked
tentacles were developed, their place being taken by four or sometimes
five  swollen   areas,   where a few    large stinging cells were located.
The   medusae    were   very sluggish   in   their movements, feebly pulsa
ting only now and again.        While under observation a curious action
began   to take   place ;  the opaque bodies in the interior were seen to
                                                        "
be extended through the mouth of the medusa;              {i.e., the mouth of
the umbrella cavity), "sometimes           singly, sometimes two or more
partly connected. These became spherical, and appeared to have a
slight movement of their own. Having discharged themselves in this
way, the medusa; shrunk up and their mission was apparently ended.
 The whole process, liberation of the medusa; and extrusion of the
spheroidal bodies, was completed in five or six hours."
   There are almost insuperable difficulties in the way of maintaining a
sea-water aquarium in the tropics in a thoroughly healthy condition.
I am satisfied that Mr. Duerden took every possible precaution, but
nevertheless it is probable that in some respects the conditions cannot
be relied upon as being strictly normal.          The observations, however,
are of importance, the structure of medusa as it is seen in the ampulla

suggesting that it is not capable of living a long time free from                   the
colony, and the character of the cytoplasm indicating that when                     the
ovum is set free it is very buoyant, and is probably fertilised                    and
passes through the early stages of its development suspended in                     the
water.
   It is almost certain that the medusa does not digest food and
nourish the ova after its escape from the ampulla, and I am inclined
to believe that after a few pulsations which are sufficient to carry it
away from the region of the colony, the ova are set free and the
medusa dies.

rise to the large kind of nematocyst.

vapour-density of bromine is normal up to a temperature of 279° C, a
result in entire opposition to the numbers obtained by J. J. Thomson, t
   We have now determined the densities at temperatures ranging
from about 600° C. to 1050° C. by a modification of the former method,
the chief difference being that the globe was not filled with the vapour
by boiling out the excess of liquid, as in the usual method, but by
admitting the bromine, already in the form of vapour, to the globe
which remained in the furnace throughout the experiment.

and Co., and have proved extremely satisfactory.            The lubricant used
on a,     b,  and   c, which  came   into contact with liquid bromine,     was
phosphorus pentoxide which had become viscous by exposure to the
air. Further action of the air was prevented by a covering of burnt
rubber and vaseline.
                                Mdlwd of   Procedure.
   Filling    the Globe. — The  small globe C containing bromine was heated
by means        of the water-bath    to about 60° C., i.e., about the boiling
point of bromine under atmospheric pressure. The globe A was
exhausted by means of a water air pump, through the connections
shown, to about one-sixth          of an atmosphere, sometimes      less.  The
stopcock d was then closed, and b and c opened to admit bromine into
the globe A, the connecting tubes being warmed by means of a Bunsen
burner to prevent the condensation of bromine in them. After a short
interval (15 to 30 sees.) b was closed and d opened ; the globe was
exhausted to about the same extent as before, and all the bromine
carried off was absorbed by strong caustic soda solution placed in the
absorption tube and flasks D and E. (The arrangement of the flasks
shown in the figure was found to be a very convenient one ; it consists
of two small wash-bottles with the long tubes connected, or in one
piece   ; by this arrangement the liquid was never carried over in either
direction.)
   The large globe        F  was usually kept exhausted and the pump at
work.       If necessary   the globe A could be connected directly with the
pump by turning off stopcock h.
   The globe was again put into connection with C, again exhausted,
and so on, the filling process being repeated seven times. Some bro

 mine was then allowed to condense above the stopcock a, and the
 stopcock b was opened to the air ; a was then turned on, when usually
a little bromine entered, and finally began to blow out on reaching the
hot neck of the globe ; a was then turned off, and the tubes between
a, b, and d cleared of bromine by a current of air ; a was again turned
 on for a few seconds, and the tubes cleared again ; this was repeated
 nntil no more bromine was seen to come out on opening the stopcock.
 During this process the neck of the globe and the stopcock were
 kept warm by heating with a Bunsen burner ; considerable difficulty
 was sometimes experienced in getting the stopcock free from bromine.
    The globe   was thus filled with bromine vapour at the atmospheric
 pressure   and  the temperature of the furnace ; the latter was read
 on the galvanometer scale at the moment of opening the stopcock a
 for the last time. The stopcock c was then closed, and the bromine
 removed from the tube be by repeated exhaustion.         The bromine in
 the globe   C was thus cut off from the rest of the apparatus by the
 exhausted space be.
    Absorption and Estimation of the Bromine. — A strong solution of
 potassium iodide was placed in the tube and flasks D and E, and the
globe A was exhausted to about one-sixth atmosphere as in the filling,
the bromine drawn off being caught by the potassium iodide.       Air was
then admitted    to the globe through  b, and the exhaustion repeated.
   After the seventh exhaustion the tube     was washed out through the
stopcocks e and /,    and the solution added to that from the flasks E,
and titrated with a standard      sodium thiosulphate  solution  of about
N/5 strength.     The solution was standardised by    means of pure   bro
mine weighed in small bulbs and dissolved in potassium iodide solu
tion.    When a series of determinations was made at different pres
sures, the globe was filled in the usual way, and then slowly exhausted
to the required amount, the bromine drawn off being absorbed by
potassium iodide solution as usual, except that the absorption flasks
were replaced by a straight tube with two small bulbs blown in it con
taining some of the solution ; this arrangement was to obviate the back
pressure caused by the solution in the flasks.
   The residual amount of bromine was drawn off     as before described.
   Determination of Temperature.  — The thermo-electric couple  was stan
dardised    by means of boiling selenium and solidifying potassium
sulphate.    The latter was melted in a small porcelain crucible by
means of the oxygen-gas flame ; the porcelain was not appreciably
attacked if the operation was conducted quickly. The galvanometer,
a dead-beat d'Arsonval, was obtained from Messrs. Nalder Bros., and
had a resistance of about 200 ohms ; the focal length of the mirror
was 40 inches.     In order to bring the zero point and the reading for
the highest temperature employed upon the scale, it was necessary to
introduce a resistance of 11,000 ohms, which remained in the circuit

 14               Dr. E. P. Perinan and G. A. S. Atkinson.
during     the whole of the experiments.             With this arrangement one
scale   division was equivalent to about 2° C. The porcelain tube con
taining the couple was supported by asbestos some distance above the
 floor of the muffle.      The variation of temperature between the floor
 and the top    of  the  muffle    was found to be 6° C. at a temperature of
about 600° C, and 8° C. at 900° C. ; no correction was made for this
difference as the couple was near the level of the centre of the globe.
    Between the two fixed points obtained the scale reading was taken
to be proportional to the difference of temperature, according               to the
method used by Koberts-Austen.
    Determination   of Pressure. — The pressure was read off on a standard
barometer, or on the pressure gauge G in the case of pressures less
than atmospheric.
    Capacity of the Globe. — The porcelain globe was weighed full of air,
;ind again weighed, filled with water, and the capacity calculated.            The
filling with   water  was    effected   by  repeated   exhaustion and   letting in
water.
    Preparation of Pure Bromine. — Commercial bromine was purified by
one of the processes       previously employed, viz., by boiling with potas
sium bromide, distilling over red-hot manganese dioxide, shaking with
strong sulphuric acid, and re-distilling. The greater portion came over
at a perfectly constant temperature, 58-9° C. at a pressure of 761 mm.

                                   Chief Possible Sources of Error.
   (1) Error in filling and emptying Globe.— To avoid error in filling, the
globe was exhausted and filled with bromine seven times, as men
tioned above.    Each exhaustion being to at least one-sixth atmosphere,
the volume of the residual air would                              be theoretically            (^j

                                                                                                    i.e.,   less
than 1/250,000 of the volume of the globe. Similar remarks apply to
the emptying.
   As  practical test, a glass globe was filled in the manner described,
          a
and on opening      under water, only
                              it           negligible amount of air was

this was made  in the following manner —                      :
     Let   v       = volume of globe.
           8       = vapour-density of bromine in globe.
        T          = absolute temperature of globe.

           D if,   = apparent vapour-density.
     Then                            8     =   D    -    £-1*™     -    d\

     The maximum correction thus calculated                             is   only 0-4.
   (3) Loss    Bromine
                     of    Incomplete Absorption. — The potassium iodide
                                      by
solution in the small bulbs of the absorption apparatus         remained                      E
uncoloured, showing that the absorption was practically complete.
                                —
   (4) Leakage at the Stopcocks. In the earlier experiments ordinary
stopcocks were used, and were found to leak to such an extent as to be
uselessfor the purpose.  Well-made diagonal                                       stopcocks    were then
employed and were found quite trustworthy.
                                            —
   (5) Error in Temperature Determinations.         very difficult to say
                                                                        It   is
what the maximum error          we think      to be not more than 10°,

the galvanometer              ;    this was reduced to             a    minimum          by switching         in

    The above values of T and D were read from the curve.
     Series III, V, and VII show the effect of varying the pressure.          The
 results of series  VII  form a smooth curve, vapour-density being plotted
 against pressure (Curve      II), but the dissociation-constant calculated
 from them is irregular.

   The     recent blue coral Heliopora presents striking resemblances in
structure to the palaeozoic Heliolites. All the earlier writers on corals
accordingly regarded the two genera as intimately allied.                     But some
later authorities      consider the resemblances as accidental, and that the
corals     have    no special affinities.         Thus, according to F. Bernard,
 Heliopora and     Heliolites   belong    to distinct subphyla.     Lindstrom admits
only one species of Heliopora, and regards the genus as quite isolated,
as essentially       distinct in structure from Heliolites, and as further
                                       " the total absence of all connecting links
separated from the latter by
from the end of the middle Devonian to the recent times."                   The author,
however, considers that the original view of the close affinity of
Heliopora and Heliolites is correct, that the two genera are essentially
similar in structure, and that they are linked by a series of eocene
and cretaceous corals.           Amongst these fossils is the genus Polytremacis,
which is redescribed,        and   a new;species of Heliopora from the Cretaceous
of Somaliland.         It is suggested that Heliopora has descended from the
palaeozoic Heliolitidae by degeneration             in size and increase in number
of the camcnchymal          caeca.

    The first part of this paper gives the equilibrium curve for the
liquid alloys and the various solid bodies that can form in them. The
curve is based on the determination of the freezing points of mixtures
 varying in composition from pure gold to pure aluminium.
    The freezing points were determined by means of platinum resist
 ance pyrometers    of the Callendar-Grriffiths   type, and the composition
 of each alloy was found by extracting     a sample from the crucible and
 analysing it.
    The ordinate in the curve is the freezing point on the air-centigrade
 scale, and the abscissa is the composition of the alloy expressed in-
 atomic percentages of aluminium.
    The curve was found to consist of seven branches, each branch cor
 responding to a state in which a particular solid crystallises first.    In
 harmony with this, seven substances can be detected in the solid alloys.
 The bodies are  : —
    Gold  ; AuiAl ; A115AI2 or perhaps AiigAls ; AU2AI ; a body which is
       probably AuAl ; AuAlg, Roberts- Austen's purple alloy ; aluminium.
    The bodies Au>Al and AnAL* are indicated by well-marked summits
 in the curve, at 33-4 and at 66'6 atomic per cents, of aluminium re
 spectively.
    The melting or freezing point of AuoAl is at 625° C., that of AuAU
 is at 1062° C., apparently identical with the melting point of gold
 itself.   The body whose formula we give as either Au5Al-» or AusAU
 has its melting   point at 575° C.     The body AuiAl has its melting
 point near 550° C. That of the hypothetical AuAl is not given by the-
  curve.
     The curve has three well-marked eutectic angles. One of these is at
  527" C. and 3-6 per cent, by weight of aluminium, the alloy here being
  a mixture of  Au4Al and AujAlo.      The next is at 569° C. and 8-36 per
  cent, by weight of aluminium ; this alloy has a composition corre
  sponding to the formula Au3Al2, but it is a mixture of Au>Al and
  AuAl. The third eutectic is at 648° C., and the alloy contains 1*87
  per cent, by weight of gold ; it is a mixture of AuAlj and aluminium.
  We see from the above that the mixture with the lowest melting point
  of all is that containing 3-6 per cent, by weight of aluminium, this
  small percentage depressing the melting point of gold from 1062° C. to
  527', that is more than 500°.      A liquid of this composition, though
                             • Spc footnoto, p. 21.

almost     wholly composed of gold, will not begin to solidify until this
 comparatively low. temperature of 527° C. is reached.*
    Eaeh of these eutectic points gives rise to a horizontal row of second
freezing points in the curve, and the alloys containing more than 44
and less than 60 atomic per cents, of aluminium have three distinct
freezing points corresponding to the       successive  formation of three solid
bodies.
    The four compounds, Au,Al, AusAL, AuoAl, and the hypothetical
AuAl, are pure white       substances.     AuAL,    as is well known from the
work of Sir W. Roberts-Austen, is a magnificent purple body.
    The latter part of the paper gives the result of a microscopic exami
nation     of polished and etched sections of alloys taken from various
parts of the curve.         All the bodies referred to above could be dis
 tinguished under the microscope.          The photomicrographs accompany
ing the paper show that the structure of the solid alloy is everywhere
in strict harmony with the indications of the freezing point curve.
Speaking generally, we may say that the patterns observed in the
photographs      repeat themselves at corresponding points of each branch
of the curve.        For example, near the summit of the branch corre
sponding to the pure alloy, Au2Al, the photograph shows us more or
less hexagonal polygons of this substance           almost entirely filling the
field, and only separated from each other by very fine lines of im
purity. If we take a section of an alloy a little way below the summit,
we see the polygons      of   AujAl surrounded by      a ribbon-like  network of
mother      substance.    Still further down, the crystals         of AiijAl   are
scanty, and arranged in such regular patterns, generally in lines at
right angles to each other, as to render it certain that they crystallised
freely while surrounded by liquid.            Finally, at the bottom of the
branch, that is at the eutectic point, the large crystals of Au^Al are
absent, and the whole field is full of the mother substance, which is some
times but, as we explain in the paper, not always a eutectic mixture.
    If, leaving the eutectic point, we ascend the next branch, these phe
nomena repeat themselves, but the primary crystallisation (that is the
matter which solidified first) is now of a different substance.
    Some     of the photographs of alloys very rich in aluminium were
taken by the Rontgen rays, and an enlargement made from the nega
tive.     The contrast between the Rontgen ray photograph and the
surface photograph of the same alloy shows what a much better picture
of the structure of the alloy is given by the Rontgen rays.
   • The rapid depression    in the freezing point of gold, due to the presence of
small quantities of aluminium, and tho great rise in the freezing point as the
composition corresponding to the compound AuAl2 is approached,          have been
already discoTered by Sir William Roberts-Austen.

     The paper deals with the theory of association of attributes, ».«.,
                                                                       "

 Two attributes A and B are independent or unassociated if
                                   (AB)    =  (A)(B)/N,
 (A) being the frequency of the attribute A, (B) that of B, and (AB) the
 frequency of the pair AB ; N being the total number of observations.
 If  this relation do not hold, they are " associated."
     Section (I) of the paper is introductory, describing the subject-matter
 and notation, which is essentially that of Jevons.*                  Calling a group
 defined by n attributes ABCD                   Nan «th-order group, Section (II)
 deals with the fundamental problem of the number of independent Nth
 order frequencies that can be formed from m attributes ; i.e., the number
 of such frequencies that must be given before the remaining frequencies
 of the same order can be calculated.                    Certain extremely curious
 relations are shown to hold in the special case of " equality of con
 traries," where all pairs of contrary frequencies (A) (a), (AB) (a/3),
(ABC)       («/3y) are equal, a being the contrary        of A — i.e. not   A — and  so
 on.

attributes are independent, + 1 when all A's are B or all B's are A,
and     -  1 when all A's are (i or all f3's are A, and thus measures               the

partly  to selection, partly to change in  the individual,  and the
material available does not enable us to separate the partial effects.
These two laws of association appear to correspond to similar ones
for correlation women being more highly correlated than men, and
                      ;

                    (A). — On   a Monthly Period in the Birth-rate.
    2. While it     is well known that there is an annual period in the         birth
rate, no attempt, as far as I am aware, has been made to ascertain
whether a lunar period exists.              Accordingly, I applied to Dr. E. C.
Perry, superintendent          of  Guy's Hospital, who most kindly placed at
my disposal the maternity records of that charity.                   As preparatory
work Mr. Yule and I extracted upwards of 6,000 births with their
dates.      These, with the assistance of Mr. L. Bramley-Moore,                    we
arranged in four groups, male and female, and in twenty-nine and
thirty day lunar months as given by the almanack of the year. In
each lunar month the number of births on each successive day following
the new moon was tabulated, and each month was then reduced to the
same total, so that no month might be weighted by its relation to the
annual variation in birth-rate.           Thus four curves were obtained, each
embracing the material for twenty-four months, and giving the daily
fluctuation     in male and female birth-rate for twenty-nine and thirty
day lunar months.           In none of these curves was there any significant
deviation from the diurnal average on any day. The curves were then
harmonically analysed by Mr. Yule ; the result gave no approach to
agreement between the amplitudes or phases in the four cases. Had
there been any approach we should have gone on to 20,000 births as we
originally proposed, but it seemed merely a waste of labour. I con
clude, therefore, that if there be any monthly period in the birth-rate,
it is of very small importance.               There    is little or no correlation
between lunar phase and birth frequency.                The object of this inquiry
was the following : The average regular recurrence of the monthly
period in woman has been taken to suggest a tidal influence on the
primitive ancestry of mankind ;* there is an indisputable correlation
between birth and the date at which a monthly period would have
taken place had pregnancy not intervened.                  Hence a positive result
might have confirmed            this   suggestion   of  tidal  influence, as well as
explained a certain amount of folklore connecting birth and lunar
influence.
    Our negative result merely shows that if lunar or tidal influence
ever fixed the period of the menses, sensible correlation between the
two has now disappeared.

         Table     I   confirms the view already expressed by me, that the male
      infant is    at birth more variable than the female : that female infants
      from six to ten years of age are more variable than male in both
      weight and height, appears to be not a result of selection but of
      growth.*          Both sexes lose not only variability but correlation as they
      grow older, and this is a fundamental                     point to be borne in mind, when
      attempts       are   made     to  trace    the  influence of natural selection in the
      change of variation or correlation                      in a group of growing animals.
      Even the co-efficient of variation, which is far more stable than the
      standard deviation (or absolute variability) is seen to alter considerably
      with growth. So far as weight and height are concerned female and
      male both lose variation as they grow older, but women less rapidly
      than men.          So far as correlation between weight and height is con-

 corned, men start with a scarcely sensible advantage over women as
 infants, and conclude as adults with an immensely less correlation than
 women, among whom it appears to have slightly increased, or at any
 rate not to have decreased.                Until we have accurate numerical de
 terminations of the change in the correlation' between organs with
growth, it is impossible to attempt to measure quantitatively the in
 fluence of a selective death-rate on growing living forms.                       We can
only    deal  with   the   influence of    sudden     selection    on  growing organisms,
 or of long continued selection on adult life.

     4. The measurements upon which these                       results are based were
taken from cards in the possession of the Cambridge Anthropometrical
Committee, who kindly allowed me to have copies taken for 1000 cases
of male students, and for the whole series of female students, which
unfortunately were only about 160 in number.*                           The whole of the
lengthy arithmetic involved in the calculation of the constants was
undertaken by Miss C. D. Fawcett, B.Sc.                        The bulk of the students
were between nineteen and twenty-five years of age, although some few
were older ; they may be taken to represent adults, who in the great
majority of      cases were in good physical             health and training, and were
not troubled with the superfluous weight                  of a later period of life.
     I will first put in a separate table the             results for weight and height,
in order that the constants for adults                    can be easily compared with
those for new-born infants.

    This table shows us the decrease             of variability with age in both
 weight and height.          But the female is now more variable than the
 male.      Were    this change to be attributed to natural selection, with a
 stronger incidence on the male than the female, then we have the
 anomaly that the correlation has been reduced in the male, but increased
 in the female, while theoretical considerations would lead us to the
 conclusion that      it ought to be reduced in both. We are compelled to
 consider the changes       in variation and correlation as due to growth or
  nurture ;    or, if there be selection, it is to a large extent screened by
  these causes.

     I  expect the greater correlation      of the male in these two cases is due
 to the    fact that a better physical training has taught him how to
 make    use of his height and weight, especially the latter, in exerting his
strength.

              Strength of pull and head index            0-041 ± 0 021
    Thus it is only in the first case that the correlation with head index
can be considered as significant, and in this case it is negative.             There
is no reason, then, for supposing braeby cephalic persons stronger                or
heavier      than    dolichocephalic,     but they do appear to be slightly
shorter.      We conclude, therefore, that dolichocephalic persons (? nicest

 dealt with the correlation between shape of head and physique, the
 correlation between absolute size of head and physique will be given
 later.    It would be of the greatest value to obtain the intensity of
 correlation between shape of head and intellectual capacity.                   We hope
 to return to this on another occasion.*

     6.  In the reduction of my family measurements, I have                   been   much
 struck by the very high values obtained for the correlation in cha
 racters between husband and wife. For 1000 cases in which the stature
 of husband and wife were determined, the correlation was nearly 0-3 !
 This   is almost as close a resemblance as we have found for some cha
  racters between father and daughter.              Now there is little doubt that
  there is a certain amount of conscious assortative mating in this
  respect ; a short man does not, as a rule, like a very tall wife.                  There
  is further an unconscious mating arising from neighbours marrying ;
  neighbours in England often mean persons of the same local race, and
  such local races differ considerably in their mean statures.t                    But my
  data were very largely drawn from the professional classes, and in
  large towns like London to marry
                                               " in the set " hardly means to marry
  into the same local race.            The parents, however, may in some cases
  have come to London from the same locality.                    The question whether
  husband and wife spring from the same rural district is one of con
  siderable interest, and deserves special investigation.               I hardly believe,
  however, that it will be found a source contributing much to the
  intensity of assortative mating in my own data. A large proportion
  of the data cards were filled in by members of the London professional
     * Measurements are now being made on brothers and siBters in schools, the
  apparatus being provided by aid from the Government Grant.              It will, however,
  be some years before sufficient data have been collected.
     t Mr. Francis Galton has pointed out this source of indirect assortative mating
  to me as worthy of consideration.

                 Data   for    the Problem   of Evolution in Man.                L>9
classes, and marrying within the district or set cannot, I think, intro
duce much local race influence.
     I accordingly turned the problem round, and asked if there appeared
any reason why, in collecting my material, I should have selected uncon
sciously homogamous marriages. Now, clearly, I was much more likely
to get a return from a large than a small family ; one member of a
family of eight was more likely to take interest in the matter than one
member of a family of two or three.           It seemed to me that out of 10,000
families I was clearly more likely to get returns from the larger families
 than the smaller ones, remembering that 26 per cent, of the families
 correspond to 50 per cent, of the offspring.               Hence arose the im
 portant problem is fertility associated with homogamy ? When like
 mates    with like, is the number of progeny greater than when like and
 unlike mate J Put in this way the problem appears to be of first cliiss
 importance for the theory of evolution.              If homogamy rather than
 heterogamy results in fertility, then we get a first gleam of light on
 what may be ultimately of vital significance for the differentiation
 of species.     When any form of life breaks up into two groups under the
 influence of natural      selection, what is to prevent them intercrossing,
 and so destroying the differentiation at each fresh reproductive stage f
 Various hypotheses — isolation, recognition marks, physiological selec
 tion — have been propounded.            But if like mating with like connotes
 greater fertility, the answer to the problem         of differentiation would be
  simply summed up in differential fertility.         We should have merely a
  case of genetic selection arising from the         correlation   of fertility and
  homogamy.
      We must be careful, however, not to rush to any conclusions without
  ample data. In particular we must not confuse homogamy with endo
 gamy.      Nor must we argue that relatives being closely alike, kin-mar
  riages would mean increased fertility.          Darwin has shown statistically
  that, as a rule, self-fertilised flowers are more sterile than cross-fertilised ;
 kinship, sameness of stock, means likeness of characters, but likeness of
  characters does not necessarily indicate sameness of stock.            It is quite
  possible for like individuals of different stocks to be fertile inter se,
  and like individuals of the same stock to be in part or wholly sterile inter
  •v.   In fact, that homogamy        means fertility may in all or certain forms
  of life  be dominated        by a more potent rule, namely, that endogamy
  means sterility.       The two statements are not contradictory if we
  interpret homogamy to mean the mating of two like individuals, not
  in the first place like because they come of the same stock. In fact, if
  a man seeks a wife of stature corresponding to his own, he will as a
  ride have a larger field of suitable mates in the general population than
  within his own limited kin. Bearing this point in mind, I now turn to
  the somewhat       narrow      data available  at present for the influence      of
  homogamy in the matter of stature on fertility in man.

   7. Taking 205 marriages in which I had details of the stature of

     Now       these results seem at first sight significant.            We have practically

but woidd increase with the amount of homogamy. The process of

that of my own family data cards, the influence of size of family on
chance of procuring data being      consider nothing like as marked.*

This       think, the source of the difference in correlation of stature
         is,
          I
between husband and wife being so reduced.
   8. In order to further investigate the matter directly,    correlation          a
table was prepared for me by Mr. L. Bramley-Moore, in which the
variables were     difference in stature of husbands and wives, and (ii)
                       (i)
size of family.  In this case the statures of the wives were reduced to
male equivalents before the difference was taken,     Thus the difference
                                                                     t
iszero, when the wife has the female stature which corresponds to her
husband's.  The calculations on this table were made by Miss Alice
Lee, D.Sc.  The correlation was found to be neg<dive, and its value
                                      -0-1201 ±0-0464
   Thus       would seem that large difference in stature means small
               it
fertility.         But there
                          danger of
                               is     fallacy here, which requires careful
                                               a
investigation.    The  regression equation for size of family (/) in terms

   Thus, since the range of difference is from about         -  10 to +10 inches,
¦we have a fertility varying from 57 to about 3-7, or about 42 to 43
per cent, variation in fertility as we pass from wives relatively 10 inches
taller than their husbands to wives relatively 10 inches shorter ! In
other words, our homogamous influence is really cloaked by the fact
that big husbands and small wives have for extreme cases some 42 per
cent, less offspring than small husbands and big wives, a residt of con
siderable interest from the standpoint of genetic selection, and possibly
capable of easy physiological explanation, if pelvic measurements are
closely correlated with stature.
   In order to disentangle the two factors, I divided up my 205 pairs
into the quartile groups, and found the following results :—
                                         IX.

   Quartilea.       Range of difference.       Total offspring.
                                                                       family.

                  + 0-417" to + 2-583"            229-083           4 -47 ±0-26

   The total number of offspring was 963, or the number to be expected
in each quartile 240 75, while the average size of the family is 4 6976,
with a standard deviation of 2-7826.         These results show us that very
nearly half the marriages occur with the wife relatively taller than the
husband, and that such marriages give 54 per cent, of the total offspring
as  against 46 per cent, produced wnen the husband is relatively taller
than the wife.      The mean family with mother relatively taller than
father is 5-06 ± 0-18, and that with father relatively taller than mother,
4-33 ±0-18, a difference which may be taken as significant.
   Grouping the 1st and 4th and the 2nd and 3rd quartiles together,
we have for the mean family when husband and wife differ consider
ably 4-62 ±0-18, and for the mean family when they differ but little
4-77 ±0-18.     This difference in itself, however, unlike that recorded
by the previous process of investigation by weighting with fertility,
would hardly be sufficient to demonstrate a correlation between
fertility and homogamy.
   I accordingly made out a fourth correlation table, in which the vari
ables tabulated were difference of relative statures of husband and wife,
without regard to its sign and size of family.               The mean relative

•")
              Mr. W. Steadnian Aldis.     On   ilu Numerical
difference in stature was found to be 2-751     inches, ahd the standard
deviation   of its distribution 2-070 inches.    The correlation   between
difference in stature and size of family was      - 0-0236, or greater fer
tility appears associated with small differences.       The observations,
however, are so few (205) that the probable error of the correlation is
0"0471, and thus no stress can be laid on this residt.       If the reader
asks why is not the result in § 7 conclusive, the answer must be, it
woidd be conclusive,   if the means of the husbands and wives weighted
with their fertility were the same as when they were unweighted ;
increased correlation would then necessarily connote that fertility was
associated with homogamy.       Actually the fact that absolutely taller
mothers are the more fertile alters the centre of the correlation table,
and somewhat obscures the issue as to whether the whole increase of
correlation is really due to homogamy being correlated with fertility. .
    That in man, whether from conscious or unconscious sexual selection,
there is far more homogamy than has hitherto been supposed, my family
data cards amply demonstrate.      If in man, then with great probability
we can consider it to exist in other forms of life.   But the existence of
such homogamy is of immense importance for the problem of differen
tiation.   The present statistics do not enable us to say whether
homogamy in man is definitely correlated with fertility ; they do show
that fertility is not a random character, but depends upon the relative
size of husband and wife, and thus bring evidence in favour of genetic-
selection.    I can conceive no more valuable investigation   than a series
of experiments or measurements directed to ascertaining whether
homogamy is or is not correlated with fertility, but such investigation,
bearing in mind Darwin's conclusions, should carefully          distinguish
between exogamous and endogamous homogamy.

   The values of Po and Q0 are tabulated in the Report of the British

    In finding Jq(x), 2ft,„ and 2ftm+2 are separately computed by
addition of alternate terms from Io(^), and the smaller sum written
down below the larger.     In all cases in Table the sum of these has                   I
first been taken, and the agreement or disagreement of this sum with
the known correct value of I0(') has shown either that there was no
mistake, or has revealed where such mistake was committed, and
secured its correction.

them.
      Sir Norman Lockyer frequently records them as unknown lines.  In
his    recent paper " On the appearance of the Cleveite and other New
Gas Lines in the Hottest Stars" (June, 1897),+ he records all three
linesas unknown.      The first occurs in a map of the spectrum of
Bellatrix as a line in a probable new series found by Dr. W. J. S.
Lockyer.   The second and third lines, given as 4566-8 and 4574-8,
occur        inTable of Lines which Sir Norman regards as belonging,
                  a
with     high probability, to gaseous substances which have yet to he
iliscovered.
     It will be noticed that the connection existing between                                       the   three
lines   is not there recognised.
     In none of the Tables    of Wave-Lengths available for reference at
the    Cape could any satisfactory clue be obtained as to the origin of the
lines.
     During          experiments made with a view to securing the best

elementary     line spectrum of oxygen as a comparison spectrum for stars
of the fi Crucis type, I found that a tube of carbon dioxide gave the
!>est results, being freer from impurities, and giving stronger  oxygen
lines    than any of the oxygen tubes at my disposal.    By the use of a
 jar   and  air gap in the secondary circuit of the coil the gas was dis
sociated, and gave the spectra of carbon and oxygen.                                    During       use, the
carbon        dioxide tubes              became      more vacuous, and,                with    a    view    to
obtaining a brighter                    discharge and      shorter     exposure,        I      passed      the
induced       current from            an 18-inch Apps' coil, using four large                  jars and    an

     Whilst usingthese electrical conditions,    happened to expose an

4G          Mr.  J. Lunt.    On the Origin   of certain Unknown
and a subsequent photograph of the spectrum of < Canis Majoris, in
which the argon tube was used, as stated, as a comparison spectrum,
established their absolute identity both as regards position and relative
intensity.
    It was, therefore, evident that a terrestrial source of the three
unknown lines had been discovered, and with the behaviour of the
carbon dioxide tube fresh in mind, and the replacement of the argon
spectrum by unknown lines and those of oxygen by use of a highly
disruptive spark, it is not surprising that an obvious startling explana
tion as to the nature of the element thus found terrestrially should have
suggested itself.
    It was at first assumed, erroneously as it afterwards proved, that the
 origin of the unknown lines lay in the gaseous contents of the argon
 tube. Four argon tubes in succession gave precisely the same results,
 viz., the argon spectrum with an ordinary discharge and the unknown
 lines and oxygen, together with the disappearance of the argon
spectrum, as a result of using the jars and air gap. On communi
 cating these results to Dr. Gill, he at once interested himself in the
matter, and gave every facility for a further prosecution of the inquiry.
 He rememlxired that Professor Ramsay had furnished him with a
specimen tube of pure argon, and this tube had not been examined.
 On trying this tube under the same conditions as the others, it was
found to give the argon spectrum under all conditions.           Neither the
 unknown lines nor oxygen made their appearance, even when the most
 intense disruptive spark available was employed.
    The first four tubes had aluminium electrodes, whilst Professor
 Ramsay's tube had platinum electrodes, and was more vacuous and
 much shorter.
    A pair of aluminium electrodes was then taken from a vacuum tul>e,
and a spark between the metal terminals in air was next examined,
 with   the result   that  the unknown     lines were not found.      A line
appeared very approximately in the same position as the strongest of
 the three lines, but this was only one of the numerous air lines, and
 was due to nitrogen (4552 -6 Neovius).      Therefore, the electrodes of the
 argon tubes did not account for the unknown lines.
    On a further examination of the negatives, the H and K lines of
 calcium were recognised in the spectra of the argon tubes subjected to
 the highly disruptive spark, pointing to the fact that the lime of the
 glass was being volatilised.
    This fact alone might account for the presence of the oxygen lines in
 the spectra, and the materials of the glass were then suspected as being
 the origin of the lines under consideration.
     A tube of pure helium, kindly furnished to Dr. Gill by Professor
 Ramsay, was next examined, and, with much surprise, this was found
 also to behave exactly as the first argon tubes had done.

            Lints in    the  Spain', of Stars of   the /8 Cruris Type.          47
    With   an ordinary     discharge it gave the pure helium spectrum, but
 with the highly disruptive discharge the helium spectrum vanished
entirely, and was replaced by the unknown lines and the spectrum of
oxygen.      The helium spectrum could be obtained at will by reverting
to the ordinary discharge.
    This helium tube had platinum electrodes, and these last observations
finally hanished any idea that the gaseous contents of the tubes or the
metallic electrodes could be the origin of the substance searched for,
and the conclusion that the glass of the tubes contained the substance
 sought was now irresistible.          Yet in some of the spectra from the
 helium tube, the H and K lines of calcium were absent when those of
oxygen were present, showing that the lime of the glass did not neces
sarily account for the presence of oxygen.
    After various fruitless experiments, sparks were taken between the
platinum terminals of a broken up vacuum tube on which still adhered
some of the blue fusible glass, commonly used in sealing in platinum
 wire in glass.     The spectrum of this spark in air showed the unknown
 lines.
    Beads   of glass made from ordinary soda glass tubing, were then
fused on platinum wires, and the spark from these was examined.
The unknown lines again appeared. The substance sought was now
strongly suspected to be the element silicon.            The siliceous diatomace-
ous earth
             " kieselguhr " was next used as the most convenient source of
fllica, and beads of sodium silicate were made by fusing this material
with sodium carbonate on platinum wire. The result of the examina
tion of the spark was that the unknown lines were again found.
The next step was to replace the kieselguhr by pure rock crystal
obtained from the South African Museum by Dr. Gill.                        Sodium
silicate made from the pure rock crystal, also furnished the unknown
lines, whilst the sodium carbonate alone failed to give them.
    These experiments left little room for doubt that the element sought
was silicon.      Nevertheless, it was very desirable to confirm the result
in another way, by examining the spectrum of a gaseous siliceous com
pound.
    Platinum wires were sealed into the ends of a piece of wide glass
tubing, £ inch internal diameter, the ends of the wires leaving a gap
of only s incn f°r tne passage of the spark.              The tube was also fur
 nished with an inlet and outlet tube for the gas.             No capillary tube
 was   used in  order   to   avoid   the hot spark    coming  into  direct contact
with glass. The tube was then filled with silicon tetrafluoride, and
after the gas had been passing for some time, it was sealed oft' at
 atmospheric     pressure.
    An ordinary      discharge     pissed through    the gas without jars or air
 gap gave a banded spectrum of the compound itself.
     The disruptive discharge obtained by using four jars and           an air gap,

48            Mr. J.  Luut.      (hi the  Origin of certain Unknown
 at once     gave the unknown         lines, which were thus proved to Ik-           un
 doubtedly due to silicon.
    This silicon spectrum was not accompanied by that of oxygen, thiu
 proving that it could not be due to any dissociation of the silica of
 the glass, and that in this case, the gaseous contents of the tube                 awl
 not the tube itself, furnished the lines under consideration.
    Sir Norman Lockyer's papers were then consulted for any reference
to the presence of silicon in stars, and it is necessary to refer in some
detail to his observations.           It is evident that he has used similar
powerful disruptive discharges with vacuum tulxss, and obtained partial
                                                      " The use of the
decomposition of the glass, for he says :*                                  spark with
 large   jars  in vacuum     tubes   results  in  the   partial     fusion of the glass,
and the appearance of lines which have been traced to silicinm."
    Unfortunately he does not give the wave-lengths of the lines thus
 traced to silicon, and from his statement alone, one would surmise
that the origin of the three lines was recognised by Lockyer.
    There is evidence, however, in the mme paper that he cannot have
 traced the lines in question to silicon notwithstanding the above state
 ment, because, as previously pointed out, Sir Norman regards two of
 the lines as belonging to gases yet undiscovered, and includes them in
 a Table of Wave-Lengths of lines due to unknown gtwu.
    The other line he also includes        as an unknown        line in Bellatrix, and
Dr. W. J. S. Lockyer places this           as a member of a probable          rhythmic
series due to an unknown          substance.
    It is a curious fact that     Hartley and Adeney, and Kder and Valenta,
who alone give       us   any extended list of lines due to silicon, appear
not to have examined the spectrum of this clement in the region of
the three lines here considered.            Their published wave-lengths show
only lines in the extreme ultra-violet,           and the majority of them are
quite outside the region         which can be examined by the McClean Star
Spectroscope.
    Watts's ' Index of Spectra' (Appendix E, p. 21) records a line at 456G
(Salet), but no lines appear corresponding to 4552*79 and 4574-68.
    Sir Norman      Lockycrt      regards two lines at 4128*6 and 4131*4 as
the most conspicuous enhanced lines of silicon, indeed these two lines
are the only silicon lines he labels Si in his published photographs.
Eder and Valenta give          4131*5    and 4126*5 as the least refrangible on
their list, and although there is a rather excessive discrepancy in the
wave-lengths of one of the lines, they are probably the same pair of
lines. They are shown in Lockyer's photographs of the spectra of
a Cygni and SiriusJ and also of a Cygni and KigcI.S

    It is a remarkable fact that these three stars, which may be con
sidered as amongst the best examples of silicon stars in the light of
the spectrum of silicon hitherto known, do not show the three silicon
lines which are so prominent in ji Cruris, c Canis Majoris, &o.             Schemer
has measured the spectra of all three stars* in this region, but does
not record the lines in his Table of Wave-Lengths.
    Their absence from the spectra of         these stars (as well as the presence
uf Lockyer's enhanced silicon lines)           is fully confirmed by photographs
taken here with the special object of searching for the new silicon
lines in the best known silicon stars.
    This can be readily understood in the light of the experiments
 with the tube of silicon tetrafluoride.
    With the highest disruptive spark, Lockyer's silicon lines 4128*0
and 4131*4      are much enhanced as compared with the lines 4552*79,
 4567*09, 4574*68, and it was found possible by suitable exposure to
obtain the two enhanced lines without the presence of the other three
 lines becoming evident.
    The latter lines would         Iks much more rapidly obliterated           in the
 absorption spectra      of   stars,   than   in  the   bright  line spectrum from
 the tube, and therefore their absence from certain stars in which the
 enhanced lines are strong need not occasion much surprise.
     In other stars, however, all five lines are present. Lockyer has
 recorded them in Bellatrix and their presence has been confirmed by
 photographs of the spectrum of this star taken here.                   Mr. McClean
 has measured all five lines in /? Cruris where Lockyer's                  enhanced
 silicon lines are certainly not so conspicuous as the lines 4552*79 and
  +56709.
     The   same   may be said of        e Canis    Majoris in which star the new
 ¦silicon  lines are very prominent,         whilst the enhanced lines are very
 faint.
     In the silicon spectrum from the argon and helium vacuum tubes,
  the enhanced lines noted by Lockyer are by no means so prominent
  as they are in the silicon spectrum, obtained from silicon tetrafluoride
  with the intense disruptive       spark.      It is evident, therefore, that great
  variations in the relative intensities of the silicon lines occur in stellar
  spectra, and that such variations can be produced to a certain extent
  in the laboratory, and these require further investigation.
     The behaviour of the silicon lines will give           us valuable data  for the
  elucidation of the problem of relative stellar temperatures.
     It is clear that if we regard, with Lockyer, the lines 4128*6 and
  4131*4 to be the enhanced lines of silicon and their presence, enhanced,
  to be a criterion of a higher temperature than occurs in stars where
  these lines are not enhanced, it must follow that such stars as a Cygni,
   Rigel, and Sirius      are   hotter than Bellatrix,       ji Cruris,  and  «  Canis

   Of the other lines recorded by Eder and Valentat as due to silicon,
3905-4, 3862-5 and 3855-7 are present both in the spectra of the
dissociated glass and in the high temperature spectrum of silicon
obtained from the silicon tetrafluoride tube.
  They are enhanced lines in the latter case, occurring together with
Lockyers enhanced lines in the absence of the three new silicon lines,
but they lie outside the region measured by Scheiner                          in   a   Cygni,
Sirius, and Rigel.
   In the Harvard " Spectra of Bright Stars "J the two latter lines
are however, specially noted in Rigel as 3863*2 and 3856-2 as
                                                                " con

(3905-6, 3863 2, 3856 2) in stars of Groops VI to VIII (Harvard),
comprising a Cygni, Sirius, and Rigel. They would thus appear in
these stars to accompany the enhanced silicon lines, specially noted
by Lockyer, viz. 4128 6 and 4131 -4.
   The lines 3834-4 and 3836-7 recorded by Eder and Valenta are not
present in any of the photographs of silicon spectra, and may possibly
be due to impurities.
   The lines 3795-9 and 3791-1 recorded by Eder and Valenta are
present in all the silicon photographs, but do not become enhanced at
high temperatures.       There          is,

 as  required in a state of such chemical purity, and brought so easily
 into similar physical conditions as to annealing and density, that
determinations       made by different observers of their resistivity or
specific electrical resistance are nearly identical.
    Matthiessen's long-accepted value* for the mass resistivity of copper,
 in the form of hard-drawn wire, viz., 0" 14493 standard ohm per
 metre-gramme, was substantially confirmed by the more recent work
 of Mr. T. C. Fitzpatrick.t            Even the purest electrolytic copper now
 obtainable in an annealed condition does not show an electric con
ductivity more than 3 per cent, greater than that of a similar charac ter
prepared thirty-five years ago by Matthiessen.
    In a research carried out in the years 1892 and 1893 by the author
in conjunction with Professor Dewar, careful redeterminations                          were
made of the volume-resistivity at 0° C. of all ordinary metals, taken
for the most part in an annealed condition                    and in a state of great
chemical purity.
    The values    so obtained   for the electrical volume-resistivity            of silver,
copper, gold, aluminium, zinc, platinum, tin, lead, magnesium, and
iron agreed fairly well with the values given by Matthiessen, and
quoted in most of the treatises on electricity.                 The resistivity of cad
mium, as given by us was, however, considerably larger than that
usually stated, although our sample of cadmium                      was    very carefully
prepared.
    In the case of nickel, the purest nickel we were able to obtain was
that prepared from nickel-carbonyl.                Dr. Ludwig Mond, F.E.S., was
so kind as to furnish us with two tubes of this nickel.                     It was found,
however, to be too brittle to draw into wire, and the operation of
melting it would have most certainly introduced impurities.                        Accord
ingly,   the   nickel  tube   was    cut up     in  the lathe into       a  spiral, and a
resistance coil formed with it which could be used for taking the
resistivity ratios at different temperatures, but which was not suffi
ciently uniform in dimensions to permit its volume-resistivity to be
calculated.      Hence, in our published results, we took the volume-re
sistivity of this nickel at 0° C. to be 12,320 C.G.S. units, which is the
value given by Everett, said to be derived from Matthiessen's experi
ments, and simply calculated the resistivity at other temperatures
from the experiments given by our own observations with the Mond
nickel.     About a year ago, however, Mr. J. W. Swan, F.R.S., sent me
a sample of nickel wire which he had prepared electrolytically from a
hot solution of very carefully purified nickelous chloride.                   The electro
lytic metal was annealed by heating in an atmosphere of hydrogen,
after having been drawn into wire through a die.
    The nickel wire    so prepared       and annealed is as soft as a silver wire.

previous researches.
  The conversion of the platinum temperatures into centigrade tem
peratures was effected by means of a table drawn up Mr. J. Hamilton
Dickson* for this thermometer.
   The measurements of the resistance at low temperatures     78-2'                      (-
and       - 182-5°)
                was obtained by measuring the coil in liquid air and
melting COj at the Royal Institution Laboratories, by kind permission
of Professor Dewar.
   The total resistance of the nickel calculated from the above observa
tions is set out in the form of a curve (fig.                         1 ),   having resistance as
ordinate* and temperature as abscissae.
  The curves are given both for temperature in centigrade degrees and#
temperature in platinum degrees.     The curve shows that the resist-
ance is falling steadily downwards to a zero value as the absolute zero
of temperature is approached.
   In fig. 2 the portion of the curve between 0' C. and 100' C. is shown
in an enlarged scale. In fig. 3 the volume-resistivity is set out in terms
of temperature.
  The results show that the volume-resistivity or resistance per centi
metre-cube of this electrolytic nickel at 0* C. is 6935 C.G.S. units.
The average temperature coefficient between 0a C. and 100° C. is
000618.
  The above observations indicate that this electrolytic nickel, as pre
pared by Mr. Swan, has an exceedingly different and much lower
resistivity     than   that       employed         for   test    by     Matthiessen    thirty-five
years ago.
   The value of the mean temperature-coefficient of the nickel used in
the experiments of Fleming and Dewar in 1893, and prepared by
Dr. Ludwig Mond,              was    0 00622t        between 0° C. and 100° C.                It   is
clear therefore  that some extraordinary    electrical difference exists
between nickel as it can now be produced electrolytically and nickel
as it was produced by Matthiessen for his experiments.
     It
      would be interesting to ascertain if any specimen of nickel known
to have been used by Matthiessen for his experiments still exists, and
if so, to discover the nature of the impurity     impurity was present),
                                                                  (if
or at least the physical difference, which caused his nickel to have
nearly double the electrical resistivity of that which can now be pro
duced.

    Sote added Dece ntJier 6, 1899. — Since writing the above short paper,
  I have discovered in a paper by Messrs. A. Matthiessen and C. Vogt,*
 a reference to the sample of nickel with which the present accepted
 figure for its resistivity was evidently obtained.
    This paper is entitled " On the influence of Temperature on the
  Electric Conducting Power of Iron and Thallium," and its title would
 not lead a reader to look in it for a reference to the resistivity of
 nickel.
     Messrs.    Matthiessen      and Vogt therein state that samples of sup
 posed chemically pure         nickel and cobalt wires prepared by M. Deville
  were given to them by M. Wohler.                They measured the resistivity
 of these samples, but they state that their electrical behaviour gave
  them reason to believe that this nickel and cobalt were not pure.
  They give the electrical conductivity of             the   nickel as 13-11 at 0a C.
 taking hard drawn silver at 0° C. as 100.
     Hence if hard drawn silver has a volume resistivity of 1620 C.G.S.
  units at 0' C, it follows that Matthiessen and Vogt's value for the
  resistivity of their sample of nickel would be 12,357 C.O.S. units at

 electrical specific resistance.*
     Matthiessen and Vogt state in this paper, that they hope to be able
 to prepare pure nickel electrolytically, and obtain a value for its
 electrical resistivity.         I have been unable to discover, however, that
 they ever carried out their intention.             At any rate, the number which
 they give       for   the   electrical  volume   resistivity of this nickel of the
 purity of which they evidently had suspicions,               has   been accepted     for
 the last thirty-six years as the true value.

    This research        was    undertaken    in order to confirm if possible the
 observations of Sanfelice, Roncali, and others, on the presence of
 organisms of the order Blastomycetes in carcinomata, and to study the
 morphology of the same.                 The observations have been arranged
 under four headings : —
                  1.  Isolation by culture.
                  2. Staining reactions.
                  3.  Histology.
                  4.  Tissue reactions following inoculation.
    1.   Isolation   by Culture.  — The tumours examined were carcinomata of
the breast and uterus ; incisions were made with a sterilised knife and
scrapings from the edges of these inseminated on to media. Many
kinds of media were tried, but a result was obtained only on glucose
agar. Wort agar and wort bouillon were subsequently used for sub
cultures; on both            the   organism grows readily      aerobically    at 37°  C.
Sub-cultures        on neutral     gelatine  appear as pale     yellow slow-growing
colonies without          liquefaction of the medium.          On neutral agar the
colonies have a more marked yellow tinge ; they do not appear until
   *  Tlic numerical values of t he specific resistance of nickel given in various tables
 by different authors arc not quite identical, and yet all so far found arc stated to
be derived from Matthiesseu's experiments.           Thus, Everett (' C.G.S. System of
 Units,' 1891 ed.) gives 12,320 C.G.S. units at 0° C. as the value. Landolt and
Bernstein give one value equivalent to 12,757 at 0° C. from the ratio of conduc
tivity of nickel to that of mercury, and auother equivalent to 12,014 at 0° C,
ilerherl from the ratio of the conductivities of hard drawn silver to that of nickel.

          Morphology    of the Blastomycetes found in Carcinoinata.      59
after four to five days' incubation at 37° C.   There is no growth on
acidified gelatine, agar, or bouillon. Neutral bouillon yields a scanty
growth after four days' incubation at 37° C. ; no scum is formed. On
wort bouillon and wort agar the growth is plentiful after twenty-four
hours' incubation      at 37° C.
   On potato at the same temperature there is a characteristic dark
brown growth after forty-eight hours.       The organism grows more
readily anaerobically  than aerobically ; the growth on potato under
the former conditions is white, but turns brown when air is admitted,
whereas the growth on agar is brownish-yellow, contrasting with the
pure yellow colour of the aerobic growth. These appearances on culture
media agree in the main with those described by Sanfelice and
Plimmer in the case of the organisms which they have severally
isolated.
      The darning readionx of the organism in the tissues were specially
     2.
studied in order to establish if possible the real characters of
the " cancer-bodies
                     "
                        described by many observers.     After trial of
several methods, the following was decided upon as giving character
istic and distinguishing results.   Carmine is first used as a nuclear
stain, either in the form of lithium carmine, alcoholic borax carmine
(when the pieces of tissue are stained in the mass), or acetic car
mine.    The last is the only preparation which gives good results
with tissue fixed in Flemming.'s solution.     The sections thus stained
are placed   in a 1 per cent, watery   solution  of methyl-violet for two
minutes, then in a 0-25 per cent, solution of picric acid, washed, dried
with filter-paper, and decolorised in clove oil. The methyl-violet is
extracted from the plasma and nuclei, but remains in the organisms.
The method was proved to give distinctive results in sections of the
growths produced by experimental inoculation of the organism
isolated.
  3. The morpliologkal cJuiraders of the organism are as follows : —
Fresh specimens from cultures are spherical, from 4 to 10 microns in
diameter, and in most cases take an aniline chromatin stain diffusely.
There     is,
          however, a great variety in the distribution of the chromatin,
it is sometimes aggregated to one pole, sometimes divided up at
different parts of the cell, and in other cases  it   is
                                                       only represented by
a  few isolated granules.      The capsule  is delicate.   Multiplication in
cultures takes place by budding.
   In the primary growths produced by intraperitoneal inoculation of
the organism, the latter         also in most cases spherical, possesses
                                   is                                     a
delicate capsule, and multiplies by budding.         Two peculiarities are,
however, to be seen     firstly,
                         :        in many cases, delicate processes connect
adjacent specimens of the organisms; and, secondly, the capsule           is
                           kind of " halo round the central deeply
                                         "

60       Morphology      of the Bl ostomy eetes found in  Carcinoma ta.
    In the nodules in lungs, liver, spleen, and kidneys,             which are
secondary    to  the  growths   on  the peritoneum,   in addition  to the forms
already described, spore-bearing forms are found.          In these the capsule
is much thickened, the chromatin of the cell breaks up irregularly,
and portions are allowed to escape through dehiscences in the capsule.
 There is no regularity in the process, no simultaneous division of the
cell-contents     into a definite number of spores, and no simultaneous
shedding of the same.           The spores are without capsule when they
escape,    and     are  irregular in contour.        They stain deeply with
chromatin stains, and are finely granular.             This method of spore-
formation is specially to be noted, as it is entirely unlike the methods
described in the case of members of the Saccharomyces class.
    4. Tissue Reactions.  — The animals     used  for inoculation were guinea-
pigs, and the inoculations were made not so much for the purpose of
estimating the capacity of the organism for producing cancer as for
that of studying the morphological characters of the latter when in the
tissues.
   The results following intraperitoneal injection of 1 c.c. of a culture
forty-eight     hours' old are as follows : — The animals showed no
symptoms of illness ; they were killed at periods from two to six
weeks after the injection.          On opening the abdomen, the omentum
and general peritoneal surface were found to be studded with nodules
from the size of a pea to that of a pin's head ; of the other organs,
nodules are visible to the naked eye in the lungs, liver, spleen, and
kidneys.     The primary growths on the peritoneum are composed of
proliferated endothelial cells ; the organisms are present in consider
able numbers, some within the cells, but most outside them. In many
of the nodules there is some attempt at the formation of a connective
tissue capsule, and in others the central parts are broken down.
    In the lungs, the nodules are made        up of endothelial cells ; in each
nodide there are organisms present and usually centrally situated.
    In the liver and spleen, the nodules are very similar in appearance
to the primary omental growths ; the origin of the cells composing
them is doubtful.
    In the kidney, where again the nodules are of endothelial origin, the
cells are derived from those lining the Malpighian corpuscles and
tubules.
    In no   case was    there any alveolar arrangement of the cells or any
appearance resembling the endotheliomata of man.

in   the formative        processes.  present communication seeks to

establish an additional method of enamel formation, essentially differing
from any which has hitherto been described, and whilst the investiga
tion was undertaken in the hope of bridging over the gaps which exist
between the methods previously known, it has only partly succeeded in
doing so, as the process to be described stands somewhat alone.
   The principal point which is set forth in the paper that the forma   is,
tive cells of enamel, known as ameloblasts, in all the Gadidse and in
Sargus and Labrus, undergo a preliminary  transformation  into h
reticulated stroma, which of the full dimensions of the ultimate
                                   is
enamel.    During the calcification of enamel, the ameloblasts no longer
exist as such, nor do any other cells take their place, but the stroma
itself seems able to segregate and properly apply the lime salts re
quired, which make their appearance at that side of the thick stroma
which      is   most distant from the blood vessels.
   There have thus been demonstrated four varieties of the process by
which enamel    formed, which, although there are gaps not at present
                     is
bridged over, may perhaps be taken as representing certain stages in
the evolution of enamel.          These are —
     1.   Enamels     not wholly epiblastic in origin, in which                    the stroma
which      is   the seat of enamel calcification  furnished by
                                                        is                     a   transforma
tion of the exterior of the mesoblastic dentine papilla, the ameloblasts
apparently segregating the lime salts required for its hardening.   This
isfound in the Elasmobranch fishes.
     Enamels wholly epiblastic in origin, in which the ameloblasts
     2.
undergo a prior transformation into a stroma of the dimensions of the
finished enamel, and themselves disappear.   This     the subject of the
                                                                   is
present  communication, and    met  withisin the Gadidae, in Sargus and
in Labrus, and probably in many other fish.
     3. Enamels  wholly epiblastic in origin, in which the ameloblasts
retain their integrity throughout the whole process.       Their extremi
ties are, however, produced into long fibrillar processes, which are
traceable far through the calcifying enamel, and these processes are
prolongations of the plasm of the cells. This method         found in the     is
enamel of Marsupials,     and   probably in  all similar tubular enamels,
such as are found in Hyrax and sporadically among other mammals.
   4. Enamels wholly epiblastic in origin, in which the ameloblasts
persist throughout the process of calcification.      Their free ends are
produced   into short processes (Tomes's processes), which penetrate but
a short distance into the calcifying enamel.        This     the ordinary is
method found in placental mammals.
   It will be seen that the last two methods differ in degree rather than
in kind, but that the first two stand markedly apart.
   Apparently in the Bays there      some sign of the approaching aban
                                              is
donment of the share taken              by
                                  the dentine papilla, as there   a less             is

degree of specialisation of its outer portion, but no sign of any trans
formation of the ameloblasts themselves into any intermediate form of
tissue has been observed.
    The sudden and entire transfonnation of the ameloblasts in the
Uadida- may perhaps be correlated with the very early and rapid for
mation of the enamel, which is formed while there is yet- but little
dentine calcified.
    In mammals enamel           formation is a very much slower and more
gradual process, and the dentine is always much further advanced
towards completion than is the enamel.
    A comparison of the various processes now known as occurring in
fish, in implacental mammals, and in placental mammals may, in the
author's opinion, be taken as finally disproving the idea, which is still
entertained by some, that enamel is to be regarded as a sort of secre
tion shed out from the ends of the ameloblasts ; for, imperfect though
our knowledge remains in some respects, yet some form of conversion,
direct or indirect, of a pre-existent organic matrix is common to all,
though as in placental mammals it may be exceedingly small in amount,
and the erroneous idea alluded to has proceeded from the study
of the process exclusively in placental mammals, in whom its true
natjire is most difficult to decipher.

and without an additional supply of nitrates.
   A further study of the morphology of nodules from various genera
of the Leguminosea?, leads to the conclusion that no definite line of -dis
tinction can be drawn between genera in which filaments occur in the
nodules and those in which they have not yet been observed. Several
examples were found of fragmentary portions of filaments in the cells
of very young nodules, whilst in older specimens these filaments were
quite absent (e.g., Pluuteolus, Desmodium, Acacia,, and others), suggesting
an intermediate stage  in the adaptation of the parasite to the special
conditions existing in any given host.
  During the course of this study, some peculiar anatomical characters
have been observed in certain nodules, >'.g., the presence of  definite                 a
crystal layer in some genera, of apple-green nucleus-like                                bodies in
 Desmodium and Robinm, and of organisms of an unusually                                  large size
in Desmodium, CoromUa, Psoraka, and others.
     Aprolonged study              was        made      of the organisms       from Desmodium
gyrans in particular.  Pure cultures were obtained, and from these
observations in hanging drops upon bacteroid formation showed that
the        X   and   Y   forms arise    by   distinct lateral branching   of   the straight-   rods.
   After twelve to fourteen days' culture, the individual long rods tend
to break up into small rodlets, and the branched forms become dis
jointed in     similar manner.

and parallel cultures of   " nitragin," compared with pure cultures of
organisms obtained direct from Pimm tubercles, shows that they all
alike grow readily on gelatine or agar media containing an extract of
pea stems, asparagine, and sugar, but very slowly on broth gelatine.

like film forms in twelve to fourteen days. The presence or absence of
spores     in these films is now under investigation.         The organisms are
aerobic, and may pass through a short motile stage, but the presence
of cilia has not been demonstrated.              On a medium consisting of
silica   jelly and a mixture of salts, including ammonium sulphate, abun
dant growths of the organisms from Pimm and De.vmodium have been
obtained ; also in hanging drops of silica jelly, colonies of the latter

type have grown to 30//. diameter in seven days at 1 7 C. Further experi
ments are now in progress in order to test whether these organisms
are per se capable of (a) fixing free nitrogen,       or (A) converting nitrogen
in the form of ammonium salts into nitrites           or nitrates ; also to deter
mine whether        or not the presence    of nitrates in the culture medium
is  directly injurious to the organisms. At a temperature ranging from
 24 — 35" C. (average 30°) a considerable increase in the percentage of
direct infections of pea roots was obtained, but at temperatures above
 35', the host plants themselves succumbed after fourteen days.                 In
 water cultures only very early stages of infection were observed.
     Experiments to determine the action of the organisms proper to one
genus upon plants of another tribe or genus suggest that there is
 probably only one organism capable of producing nodules on legu
 minous plants, but that in each particular host special physiological
 conditions exist, to which the organisms become so specially adapted
 as    to make it difficult for successful reciprocal action to take place
 between plants not nearly allied, though exceptions do occur.
     In connection with infection experiments conducted under, as far as
 possible, sterile conditions, it was determined that fifteen minutes' treat
 ment of seeds with aO'l per cent, solution of mercuric chloride lief ore
 sowing, is without injurious        effect upon the seeds, but that a longer
 action of the solution poisons      the embryo.      Crop cultures in uterilisni
 media give best results when        nitrates without organisms are supplied
                                     of " nitragin
                                                    "
 to the plants.       The addition                     under these conditions is
 of very little benefit, and if     a sufficient supply of nitrogenous food be
 available, a reduction in the resulting crops ensues when this "fertiliser"
 is employed.
      In tinderUised media a small increase in crop may result from the use
 of " nitragin." The conclusion derived from the various experiments,
 however, is that the presence or absence of "nitragin" is but one
  factor in a complex problem, and that at the same time must be taken
  into account the complicated physical and biological conditions of the
 soil and atmospheric environments, as well as the symbiotic action of
  the host plants, in the removal of the products of metabolism from the
  field of action of the nodule organisms.

    On the Innervation of Antagonistic Muscles. Sixth Note." By
       C. S. Sherrington, M.A., M.D., F.R.S.   Received December

   Machine-like regularity and fatality of reaction, although charac
teristic of spinal reflexes, is yet not exemplified by them to such
extent that similar stimuli will always elicit from the spinal animal
similar responses.      This want of certainty as to response is an
interesting difficulty attending the study of spinal reactions.    The
variation in the responses of the skeletal musculature manifests itself
not only in regard to the extent of the movement but also in regard
to the direction of the movement.
   Some of the factors determining the character of the reactions are
factors contained within the stimulus.  Important among these is the
" locus of the stimulus." Thus it has long been known that the direc
tion and other characters of the reflex movement are influenced by the
mere location of the stimulus.    Nevertheless stimuli identical in all
respects,  including locality, may evoke reflex movements of widely
different, even of absolutely opposite, character.  Such differences of
response must be referred to differences obtaining at the time in the
spinal organ itself.  One cause for such differences seems indicated by
the following observations : —
   The most usual, indeed the almost invariable, primary reflex move
ment of the hind limb of the spinal dog (and cat), when spinal transec
tion has been performed in the cervical or upper thoracic region, is
flexion at hip, knee, and ankle ; the limb is " drawn up." This move
ment can    well obtained by, among other stimuli, the pressing of the
            be
pads of the digits upward so as to extend the toe-joints, a stimulus
that in some measure imitates the effect upon those joints of the
bearing of the foot upon the ground under the animal's weight.
Extension as a reflex result from this stimulus     in my experience,     is,
never met with in the homonymous limb in the early time after transec
tion.  When     certain period has elapsed, three weeks or more after
                  a
transection, and shock has largely subsided,    becomes possible to, at
                                                                     it
times, obtain extension at hip     as the primary movement in the
homonymous limb.     The pressing of the toe-pads upwards, spreading
and extending the digits, elicits a sharp movement of extension at the
hip,   at the time the initial posture of hip and knee be flexion.
      if                                                                        If
the initial posture of hip and knee be extension, the primary reflex
movement excited                 is,
                         in my experience, invariably flexion.     The
reflex movement           true, not unfrequently flexion, even when the
                           is,   it   is
initial posture    one of flexion
                      is            but                        is,
                                               on the other hand, very
                                                 ;        it
frequently,      and especially preponderantly in certain individual animals,
extension.       The passive assumption of       flexed posture at hip and
                                                           a

                On the Innervation      of Antagonistic Muscles.          67
knee seems   to favour the reflex movement at those joints taking the
form of extension.   The influence of the posture of the ankle-joint upon
the reflex movement at the hip seems negligible, for           I
                                                         have often
remarked the reaction at the hip to be unaltered, whether the ankle
were flexed or extended, at the time of excitation.
    In some dogs, when the spinal transection  has been made at the
hinder end of the thoracic region, stimulation of the skin of the limb
evokes the usual primary flexion at hip and knee wherever the locus of
the stimulus, except it be in the upper three-fourths of the front of the
thigh.  Applied in this latter region the stimulus, if the limb be mid
way  between extension and flexion, not unfrequently evokes reflex
extension  at hip and knee ; it does not evoke extension if the initial
posture of the limb be extension ; but if the limb be, at the time of
application of the stimulus, well flexed at hip and knee, reflex exten
sion, instead of reflex flexion, becomes the rule.
   In the spinal frog, as in the spinal dog, flexion at hip and knee is
the  regidar reflex response of the musculature of the homonymous
hind limb to skin stimuli applied at any part of the surface of that
limb.   This being true when the initial posture of the limb        is,
                                                                as when
pendent, one of extension at hip, knee, and ankle,   difference becomes
                                                        a
evident when the initial posture   one of flexion at those joints. In the
                                   is
latter case excitation of the skin within a small gluteal and pubic area,
lateral and somewhat ventral to the cloacal orifice, causes extremely
frequently not flexion at hip, but extension at that joint. Stimuli
(mechanical and chemical) to that area which evoke flexion at the hip-
joint when the initial posture of the limb involves extension at that
joint, evoke, when the initial posture  flexion, reflex extension at the
                                             is
joint.
   These     instances seem to indicate distinctly that the direction which
a   spinal   reflex movement elicited by stimuli similar in all respects,
including " locality," may take,    in part determined by the posture
                                        is
already obtaining  in  the limb at the  time of the application of the
stimulus.
   The reaction described above for the spinal frog holds good after
previous removal of all the skin from both hind limbs, with the
exception of the small gluteal piece necessary for application of the
skin stimulus.  It would appear, therefore, that the influence of the
posture of the limb upon the spinal condition and reaction   not trace
                                                                   is
able to the nerves of the cutaneous sense-organs of the limbs.   There
still remain the afferent nerves subserving muscular sense, and connected
with the sense-organs in muscles, tendons, and joints.       These, as    is
well known, are largely affected by the various postures of the limb,
even by such postures as are passively induced.

"
  On the Viscosity of Argon         as affected by Temperature."             By
       Lord Eaylkigh, F.R.S.       Received January 12, — Read             Jan
       uary  18, 1900.
   According to the kinetic theory,        as developed by Maxwell, the
viscosity  of a gas is independent   of  its  density, whatever may be the
character of the encounters taking place between the molecules.               In
the typical case of a gas subject to a uniform shearing motion, we may
suppose that of the three component velocities r and w vanish, while u
is a linear function of y, independent of x and z.     If fi be the viscosity,
the force transmitted tangentially across unit of area perpendicular to
y is measured by ftdujdy.       This represents the relative momentum,
parallel to r, which in unit of time crosses the area in one direction,
the area being supposed to move with the velocity of the fluid at the
place in question.     We may suppose, for the sake of simplicity, and
without real loss of generality, that « is zero at the plane. The
momentum, which may now be reckoned absolutely, does not vanish,
as in the case of a gas at rest throughout, because the molecules come
from a greater or less distance, where ('V7.) the value of u is positive.
The distance from which (upon the average) the molecules may be
supposed to have come depends upon circumstances.             If, for example,
the molecides, retaining their number and velocity, interfere less with
each other's motion, the distance in question will be increased.            The
same effect   will be produced, without    a change of  quality, by    a simple
reduction in the number of molecules, i.e., in the density of the gas,
and it is not difficnlt to recognise that the distance from which the
molecules may be supposed to have come is inversely as the density.          On
this account the passage of tangential momentum per nwlerule is in
versely as the density, and since the number of molecules crossing is
directly as the density, the two effects compensate, and upon the
whole the tangential force and therefore the viscosity remain un
altered by a change of density.
   On the other hand, the manner in which this viscosity varies with
temperature depends upon the nature of the encounters.                   If the
molecules behave like     Boscovich   points, which exercise no force upon
one   another until the distance falls to a certain value, and which then
repel one another infinitely (erroneously called the theory of elastic
spheres),  then, as Maxwell proved, the viscosity would be proportional
to the    square root of the absolute temperature.          Or again, if the
law of repulsion were as the inverse fifth power of the distance,
viscosity would be as the absolute temperature.
   In the more general case where the repulsive force varies as r~n, the
dependence of p upon temperature may also bo givon.                If v be the
velocity  of  mean   square, proportional    to the square root of the tern

during our enc6unter are of a symmetrical character.                        It seemed,

the pressures being determined before the first and after the second
passage, as well as between the two.               But to a gas like argon, avail
able in small quantities only, the application of this method is difficult.
And it seemed unnecessary to insist upon the use of constant pressures,
seeing that     it was not proposed to investigate experimentally the
dependence    of   transpiration upon pressure.
   The theoretical formula for the volume of gas transpired, analogous
to that first given by Stokes for an incompressible fluid, was developed
by 0. E. Meyer, t Although not quite rigorous, it probably suffices
for the purpose in hand.           If pi, V] denote the pressure and volume of
the gas as    it enters     the   capillary,   p>, Y> as    it leaves the capillary,  we
have
                          ftVi    =  ^V,     =
                                                ^(ftt-j,,*)                          (4).
   In this equation      t  denotes the time of transpiration, R the radius
of the tube,     /  its length, and /x the viscosity measured in the usual
way.
   In order to understand the application of the formula for our pre
sent purpose, it will be simplest to consider first the passage of equal
 volumes of different gases through the capillary, the initial pressures,
and the constant temperature being the same.                     In an apparatus, such
as that about to be described, the pressures change as the gas flow's,
but  if the pressures      are definite functions of the amount of gas            which
at any moment has passed the capillary, this variation does not inter
fere with the proportionality between t and ft. For example, if the
viscosity be doubled, the flow takes place precisely as before, except
that   the scale of time is doubled.                 It will take twice as long as
before to pass the same quantity of gas.
   Although different gases have been employed in the present experi
ments, there has been no attempt to compare their viscosities, and
indeed such a comparison would be difficult to carry out by this
method.     The question        has been,     how is the viscosity of a given gas
affected  by  a  change of temperature 1 In one sot of experiments the

connection passage K.       When the mercury reaches L, the time
measurement is closed.
   One of the points to l>e kept in view in designing the apparatus is
to secure long enough time of transpiration without unduly lowering
the driving pressure.   At the beginning of the measured transpiration
the pressure in A  was about 30 cm. of mercury above atmosphere, and
                                   Fm. 1.
that in  B about  2 cm.  below atmosphere. At the end the pressure in
A  was 20 cm., and in   B  3 cm., both above atmosphere.    Accordingly
the driving pressure fell from 32 to 17 cm.
   Three, or, in the case of hydrogen, five, observations of the time
were usually taken, and the agreement was such as to indicate that the
mean would be correct to perhaps one-tenth of a second.    The time for
air at the temperature of the   room  was about ninety seconds, and for
hydrogen forty -four seconds, but these numbers are not strictly com
parable,

            On the Viscosity  of Argon as     affected by Temperature.         73
     When the low temperature observations were finished, the gas was
lighted under a small boiler placed upon a shelf above the apparatus,
and     steam was passed through the jacket.            It was necessary to see
that there was enough heat to maintain a steady issue of steam, yet
not so much as to risk a sensible back pressure in the jacket.               The
time of transpiration for air was now about 139 seconds.               Care was
always taken to maintain the temperature of the bulbs at the               same
 point as in the first observations.
     There are one or two matters as to which an apparatus on              these
 lines    is necessarily somewhat imperfect.          In the high temperature
 measurements the whole of the gas in the capillary is assumed to be at
 the temperature of boiling water, and all that is not in the capil
 lary to be at the temperature of the room, assumptions not strictly
 compatible.      The compromise adopted was to enclose in the jacket the
 whole of the capillary and about 2 inches at each end of the approaches,
 and seems sufficient to exclude sensible error when we remember the
 rapidity with which heat is conducted in small spaces. A second
 weak point is the assumption that the instantaneous pressures are
 represented by the heights of the moving mercury columns.                If the
 connecting U-tubes are too narrow, the resistance to the flow of mer
 cury enters into the question in much the same way as the flow of gas
 in the capillary.     In order to obtain a check upon this source of error
 the apparatus has been varied.          In an earlier form the connecting
  U-tubes were comparatively narrow ; but the result for the ratio of
 viscosities of hot and cold air was substantially the same as that sub
 sequently obtained with the improved apparatus, in which these tubes
  were much widened.        Even if there be a sensible residual error arising
  from this cause, it can hardly affect the comparison of temperature-
  coefficients of gases whose viscosity is nearly the same.
     I will now give an example in detail from the observations of
  Decemljer 21 with purified argon.        The times of transpiration at the
  temperature of the room (15° C.) were in seconds
                     1043,    104A,   104-J.     Mean, 104-67.
      When the capillaries were bathed in       steam,  the corresponding  times
   were
                      167A,   167J,    1G7J.     Mean, 167-58.
     The barometer reading (corrected) being 7G7--4 mm., we deduce as
                                            '

scarcely any further contraction could be effected on sparking with

   It will be seen that the temperature change of viscosity in argon
does not differ very greatly from the corresponding change in air and
oxygen. At any rate the simpler conditions under which we may sup
pose the collisions to occur, do not lead to values of n such as 0'5, or

                                                      Annalen,'   an experiment   is
 described by Giesel showing that the Becquerel rays are deflected in a
 magnetic field.       This result is of great interest, on account of the light
 which it throws on the nature of the rays.              Up to the present, the
 evidence has tended to show that the Becquerel rays were of the same
 nature as the Bontgen rays, both being capable of penetrating thin
 metal sheets, of affecting a photographic plate, and of producing ionisa-
 tion in the surrounding air.        Neither could be refracted or reflected ;
 and so   far  as has yet appeared, neither could be polarised.
    These    facts seemed to form a fairly strong body of evidence that
 the two kinds of radiation were essentially similar.            But the announce
 ment of the magnetic deflectibility of the Becquerel rays seems to
 throw    doubt on this conclusion.          The Bontgen rays, so far as is
 known, are quite unaffected by magnetic force.               Under these circum
 stances it seemed worth while to make a new attempt to discover such
an effect on the Bontgen rays.          This attempt I have carried out. It
 will  be best to say at once that the result is negative.
    A   focus tube was employed as the source of radiation.                 It was
 placed   at a  distance   of about  35  cm.  from    a powerful electro-magnet,
and in such a position that the cathode rays in the tube were parallel
to the magnetic force due to the magnet.              The line joining the oblique
anti-cathode to the centre of the magnetic field lay in the plane of the
anti-cathode.
    A short distance in front of the magnet a wire was placed at right
angles to the direction of the rays, and in the plane of the anti-cathode.
It was thus at an angle of about 50° to the magnetic force — the same
angle as that between the axis of the cathode stream and the anti-
eathode. This wire was used to cast a shadow on a photographic plate
placed at a distance of 65 cm. on the other side of the magnet.
    An exposure was first made with the magnetic force in one direction.
The exposure was then stopped, the field reversed, and another ex
posure given of course without shifting the plate.               If then the rays
had been appreciably deflected, the photograph should have shown two
shadows, either overlapping, or altogether separated.
    The rays casting the shadow were those emitted at a grazing
angle from the anti-cathode.              The reason for using these very
oblique rays was that owing to the foreshortening of the anti-cathode,
the source was      virtually narrower than it would         have  been, had rays

sharper     shadows    were   obtained,    and   a smaller  magnetic    deflection
could have been detected.
   The tube     was arranged   with its cathode stream parallel to the magnetic
field, so as to avoid any shifting of the source of radiation when the
magnet was reversed, owing to an effect of the magnet on the original
cathode beam.        Such a shifting would have given rise to a spurious
effect.     The only objection to this was that the shadow-casting wire
had to    be  obliquely placed so as to be in the plane of the anti-cathode.
Thus some sensitiveness was lost.
   I   shall now give an estimate of the smallest deflectibility which
could have been detected. The rays traversed a distance of 65 cm.
after leaving the magnetic field.
    It was estimated that a lateral displacement of the shadow of the
wire by 0'02 cm. could have been detected. But the wire was in
clined 50° to the resultant magnetic force. Thus the smallest real
                                                                        ^

   The length through which the rays were exposed to the magnetic
force was 8 cm.        If in this distance they were bent through the above
angle, the radius of curvature would be

    The strength of the magnetic field was determined in the usual
manner, by observing the throw of a galvanometer when a small coil
of known dimensions connected up with it was suddenly withdrawn
from the region between the pole pieces.               To reduce the results to
absolute measure, the throw due to reversal of an earth-inductor in
the same circuit was observed.
    In this way    the strength of the field was found to be
                                     3270 C.G.S.
    It  is convenient to exhibit the result by       giving the maximum       field
which the experiments indicate           as unable to produce a curvature        of
 radius   1  cm.
    Since a field of 3270 does not produce a curvature of radius less
 than 19,800 em., we see that the field required to produce a curvature
 of radius    1 cm. cannot be less than
                                       6-5 x 10T.

   Owing to the fact that the magnetic field was reversed instead of
being merely shut off, the experiment is really of double the sensitive
ness indicated above.    But, in order to be well on the safe side, it has
been thought best to leave this out of account.
   For the sake of comparison I have attempted           a rough estimate of
the amount of the magnetic deflection of the Becquerel rays.                 The
method employed was as      follows : —
                                     Fig. 1.
   A  photographic  plate, shown in section at ai, was laid on the top of
the square pole pieces of a magnet, the magnetic force being perpendi
cular to the plane of the diagram.        The plate was covered with thin
aluminium foil ; e is a metal capsule filled with the substance d, which
emitted the rays.*
   When no magnetic force was acting, the rays were emitted from
the capsule as indicated in fig. 1, some      of them striking obliquely on
the plate.    On development after one hour's exposure, a shadow was
 obtained beginning at the edge of the capsule c, and extending a short
distance.    The effect gradually tailed off, and at a few cm. distance
 away from c it was inappreciable.        When the magnetic force was in
 such a direction  as to bend the rays down        into the plate (fig.   2), the
                                    Fig.  2.

 reversed so as to bend the rays away from the plate (fig. 3), the

amount    less than a ten-thousandth part of that observed in the case of
the Becquerel rays.
   The magnetic deflectibility of the Becquerel rays cannot but be con
sidered to be a most characteristic propeity. And the above result
appears to make it tolerably certain that the Rontgen rays do not
possess   this property.     It is to be concluded, therefore, that the
Becquerel rays are, after all, essentially different in character from the
Rontgen rays.

 Part I. — On    the Law of Flow of  Saturated Steam through Small Orifices.
   In making experiments on the thermal properties of superheated
steam obtained by wiredrawing saturated steam, it is essential that
certain laws assumed in theory to govern       the flow through the orifice
should obtain in practice.
   Among      these  laws the only one on which a difference would be
expected to exist between experiment and theory, is the law of
adiabatic expansion assumed to hold during the flow.
   Since such adiabatical flow is not only assumed, but is indispensable
in obtaining temperature results in the wiredrawn steam which will
enable deductions to be made by theory of the initial dryness of the
steam or its thermal condition after wiredrawing,         it was found im

80      Mr. J. H. Grindley.       An Experimental Investigation of
portant to know the circumstances under which adiabatic          flow could
be experimentally obtained.
   Many experimental       results have already been given by various
experimenters which indicate the laws governing the flow through
various types of orifices, and to some extent bear out the theoretical
conclusions on the subject, but so far as the author is aware, no
experiments have yet been made with saturated steam, showing results
which entirely agree with those deduced from theory by assuming
adiabatic flow, and hence arose the necessity of making experiments
with this object in view.
   It appears from the theory, that when the ratio (the lower to the
higher) of the two pressures causing the flow through the orifice is
diminished below a certain value, the upper pressure being kept
constant, the rate of discharge of the steam should be constant.        This
value of the pressure ratio depends entirely on the law of expansion
assumed to hold during the flow.         By assuming this law to be repre
sented by an equation of the form
                               pvn = constant,
p being the pressure,   v the specific volume of the gas, and n a constant
for any particular gas, we can deduce this value of the pressure ratio
giving maximum flow in the form
   Putting n = 10/9 we get for saturated        steam   expanding   adiabati-
cally during its flow through the orifice.
                                &   = 0-5824.
                                Pi
   If  now the flow of steam     be truly adiabatic in an experiment, this
particular value  of  the pressure ratio giving the maximum flow should
be actually found by the experiment, and if some other value than
this be obtained the law of flow will not then be the true adiabatic
one for saturated steam.
   Ilcnce the attainment of this particular value of the pressure ratio
giving the maximum discharge was made the object of the experi
mental inquiry here described, since it would follow that the law of
expansion through the orifice was then truly the adiabatic law for
saturated steam.
   To begin with,   an orifice was   drilled in a piece  of thin sheet bra>s
the nature of which     should create, if possible, a large deviation from
the adiabatic  in the actual law of flow through the orifice.        Experi
ments were then made with this orifice placed between a steam chest
and a condenser, the weight of steam passing per minute being taken

         the TJuriiio-dyTuiiiiical       Properties of Superheated         Steam,.      HI
at various pressures over a wide range of pressure ratio, the upper
pressure being kept constant. It was found that the maximum rate
of discharge did not occur until the ratio of pressures had fallen to
0-33, a value far below that given by the theory, and indicating a far
different law of flow through the orifice than the adiabatic.
  As     a          to this, since the main element in the question
               contrast
appeared  to be the  conductivity of the substance in which the orifice
is made, the later experiments were made with an orifice drilled in a
glass plate, the orifice being neither sharp lipped nor smoothly
rounded, the lip in the best circumstances presenting a rough chipped
edge.  Now with such material for an orifice plate, it is evident that
any passage of heat between the glass and the steam will be very
small, and also that if adiabatic flow is not now obtained, then either
there must be a passage of heat between various portions of the glass
and the steam in contact with them, or heat must be conducted along
the stream of vapour itself, the latter being considered negligible from
considerations of gaseous conductivity.
   The experiments made with this orifice show                  a complete agreement
between the results of experiment and theory, and that the law of
flow through an orifice drilled in a plate of glass, no conditions being
attached as to the roundness or otherwise of the lip of the orifice, is
precisely the adiabatic law assumed in the theory.
        Part II. — On      the Cooling   of   Saturated Steam   b//   Free Expansion.
   In    Regnault's       experiments     on    the total   heats of saturated steam
 under various pressures, the            steam     was withdrawn
                                                       upwards from                      a
 toiler, .allowing any entrained moisture in the steam to be separated
 by gravity. Saturated steam obtained in any other manner would not
 necessarilyhave the same total heat as that obtained by Regnault at
 the same pressure, and      therefore of great importance to note that
                               it   is
 the dryness of the steam in Kegnault's experiments was obtained by
 the simple method of draining suspended moisture from it.
    Hence, since the foundation of most of the researches                  on het thermal
 properties of steam rests upon Regnault's results,    would be well to
                                                                  it

  from a knowledge      of those of saturated steam   already obtained by
  Regnault.
     The temperature and pressure of saturated steam in a steam chest
  in which a constant supply of steam is kept is taken, the steam is then
  drawn upwards to an orifice, and, after wiredrawing, its pressure and
  temperature are again taken, using for the determination of the latter
  a thermo-electric junction immersed in the steam.
     Special precautions were found necessary, and special apparatus
 designed to prevent losses of heat by radiation from the channel con
 taining the wiredrawn steam, a steam jacket of peculiar construction
 enveloping this channel completely, and by adjusting the temperature
 of the jacket to equality with that in the wiredrawn steam, all radia
 tion was effectively prevented from this portion of the apparatus.
     Again, communication of heat from one side to the other of tho
 orifice through the substance in which the orifice is made was pre
 vented, and true adiabatic flow obtained through the orifice by drilling
 it in a piece of plate glass, such as that descril)ed in the research on
 the law of flow through orifices.
     During an experiment, the pressure in the steam      chest being kept
 constant, a series    of temperature readings at various values of the
 lower pressure were observed in the wiredrawn steam.        By this means
 a curve showing the cooling of the steam for any degree of wiredrawing
 from an initial constant pressure could be drawn on a pressure-tempera
 ture diagram.
     Provided now that the total heat of steam before passing the orifice
 was known, it would be possible to deduce from these temperature and
 pressure results the values of the mean specific heat at constant pressure
 of superheated steam between the saturated condition and the tempera
 ture of the wiredrawn steam at any given pressure, and further, the
 total heat of steam    at any pressure and temperature obtained by such
 wiredrawing,    would be known.
     Whether the steam was in the same condition       before wiredrawing
 as that obtained    in Regnault's experiments was certainly not an cash
 point to decide. In both cases, however, the steam was obtained In-
 draining any suspended moisture from steam initially wet, but whether
 this process of drainage always brought the steam into the same con
 dition as to dryness, whatever the degree of wetness originally in the
steam,    was as yet an open question, which could only be decided by
experiment.      Accordingly experiments were conducted with saturated
steam at a known pressure and temperature in the steam chest, but at
different degrees of wetness in different experiments.         The results
obtained are very important, as the maximum difference of temperature
at any particular pressure in the wiredrawn steam which could l)e
found to exist between experiments with different degrees of wetness
in the steam     in the steam chest was 0'35 F., and generally the differ

          the Ther mo-dynamical Properties of Superheated Steam.             83
enee    could not be distinguished, it being remarked that if the dryness of
the steam       before passing the orifice had been altered by so little as
0-06    per cent.,   a difference of 1°F. should have been observed in the
temperature of the wiredrawn steam.
    It would, therefore, appear that saturated steam at any particular
pressure obtained by relieving it of suspended moisture by gravitation
has only one condition as to its dryness, and also that steam in this
particular condition was obtained both in these experiments and in
those of Regnault, and it is therefore taken that the steam before wire
drawing has       a total heat given by Regnault's tables of the total heats of
saturated     steam.
    Further     experiments were also made to observe the effect of altering
the position of the thermo-electric junction in the wiredrawn steam, of
 the effect of the steam       jacket on the temperature of the wiredrawn
 steam, and of the effect of the velocity of the steam through the apparatus
 on  these temperature readings.       The amount of the corrections required
 for  the conduction of heat between various portions of the apparatus
and    the steam was also calculated, but on account of the precautions
 taken these were generally found to be negligible.      The method of fixing
 the absolute temperature of the wiredrawn steam should be hero men
 tioned, as it is a point of great importance, on account of the diffi
 culties attending the accurate measurement of the temperature.              In
 the experiments the thermometer was used merely as a scale to compare
 the temperature of the wiredrawn steam with that of saturated steam
 under a known pressure flowing through the same portions of the appa
 ratus with about the same velocity, the fixing of the temperature being
 again dependent on Regnault's tables of the pressure-temperature rela
 tion of saturated steam.
     The final results obtained show clearly that within the limits of tem
  perature obtained by wiredrawing saturated steam at temperatures
  varying from 240° to 380° F., the condition of the steam known as a
  perfect   gas  was   not obtained,   even when the wiredrawing was con
  tinued to 3 lbs. or 4 lbs. per square inch absolute pressure ; and further,
  that between the same temperatures and between pressures of 2-5 lbs.
  and 195 lbs. per square inch, there was not found any indication of a
  constant value of the specific heat at constant pressure in the super
  heated steam.       The specific  heat at constant pressure was found to
  increase   with temperature,      the mean specific heat at atmospheric
  pressure between the temperatures 230-7° and 246-5° being 0-4317,

     As regards the variation in the value of the       specific heat at con
  stant pressure of superheated steam with the pressure, it appears
  from an examination of the results obtained at about the same tem
  perature but under different pressures, that if any such variation in the

84       Mr.    J. H. Grindley.       An Experimental In vestigation of
specific    heat exists  it will   be very small compared        with the variation
with temperature, such examination              indicating    that the value of the
specific heat is sensibly independent of the pressure.
     The law of cooling followed by the wiredrawn steam is slightly
different from that obtaining in many other gases, viz., that the fall of
temperature varies directly as the difference of pressure. The rate of
fooling was found to diminish with increase of initial temperature.
     The curves showing the pressure-temperature relations of the super
heated steam wiredrawn from definite initial pressures, seem to follow
for   a short distance the law of       boiling points, and the experiments show
that this coincidence always exists in saturated steam, and may well
be mistaken for evidence of wetness in the steam.
     Tables showing the fall of temperature with pressure in the wire
drawn steam, of the total heat of the steam under certain pressures
and temperatures, and of the mean value of the specific heat at con
stant pressure of superheated steam at definite pressures and between
definite temperatures, accompany the paper.

     In this portion      of the paper the two properties of steam deduced
directly from the experimental figures, viz., the specific heat Kp and
 the cooling effect Hdj&p or c, are more directly considered.             In the first
 place, the cooling      effect c is found to be inversely proportional        to t3-s,
 where    t  is the absolute temperature.
     It is then shown that the       following formula
 is capable     of strict proof from thermodynamical principles, the inter
 pretation of the formula, being that the variation of Kp with the
 pressure at constant temperature is equal to the variation of the pro
 duct cKp with the absolute temperature               at constant pressure, but of
 opposite sign.
     Applying this to steam           when superheated,       it has been   shown in
  I'art  II  of the paper that the variation
                                                   ^-(Kp)
                                                              is zero to the degree
 of accuracy       to which   the   experiments    have been taken.        It follows,
                                                                     g
  therefore, from the above formula, that the variation                (cKp) should

  equal zero ; hence, the values of the product cK,, have been tabulated
  for different pressures and temperatures, and so far as the results go,
  it is clearly shown that the product <-Kp is an absolute constant, which
                                   3                 8
 means that the variations             (<"K») and   ^   (^Kj,) are both zero,

conditions of pressure and temperature, the value of A being deduced
from known data in the saturated condition of the steam.

on the experimental      results obtained in the research, are compared
with   those   obtained experimentally by Hirn, the results in general
agreeing very well.

vary with the pressure, the product cKp must also be independent of

   The experimental portion of this work consists of the careful com
parison of six thermometers, with the object of studying the effects of
capillarity, and in the second place of obtaining a comparison l>etween
thermometers made of English flint glass with those of French " verre
     "
dur or Jena normal glass, and therefore indirectly with the hydrogen
scale.
   The instruments employed consisted of a Tonnelot " verre dur
                                                                               "
thermometer, to be referred to as No. 4976, an English flint glass
(No. 711,179) by J. J. Hicks, two normal thermometers (Nos. 2218 and
2219) of Jena 16'" by Gerhardt of Bonn, and two calorimetric thermo
meters Nos. 2220 and 2221 of Jena 16'" by Gerhardt, with a range
from     -  2° to 25° C.
   The Tonnelot instrument is divided on the transparent stem into
tenth degrees, and is cylindrical in the bore.       The other thermometers
have enamelled backs, and are divided on the stem into half milli
metres.       At  the time the latter instruments    were obtained elliptical
bores were the only ones procurable, but care was taken           that the bore
was    not unduly flattened, and was      smooth in contour.        The author
considers the readings taken with these thermometers to be quite trust
worthy.       The ratio of the major to the minor axis of the bore was
about 2 for the Jena glass thermometers and 3 for 711,179. In each
case the bulb     (without enamel) was fused to the    stem.    Ampoules were
avoided in all the instruments.
   The calibration corrections were obtained in the usual way, a micro
meter l>eing used to measure the ends of the thread.             The reduction
was made by the Neumann-Thiessen          method.
   All    readings other    than  those for  calibration   were   made   with a
telescope     magnifying   eighteen to twenty-four times, the eye-piece of
which was provided with a micrometer scale by Zeiss. With the aid
of this eye-piece, which serves to further subdivide the thermometer
divisions, the readings agreed to 0-005 mm.            Several readings were
always taken, generally three for zero readings, six for the indications
in steam, twenty-one for coefficients of external pressure, fifty-four for
coefficients of internal pressure ; twenty -seven of zero and fifty-four in
steam for the fundamental internal correction, and ninety of comparison
and eighteen of zero on each instrument during the comparisons.             The

   The Constant of Capillary Depression K and the Coefficient of External
Pressure. — It is usual to determine the pressure coefficient by suspending
the thermometer in a tube, the pressure within which can be rapidly
changed from atmospheric pressure to one of a few centimetres of
mercury.     A sudden diminution of pressure p causes a fall in the
indications of the thermometer, and in the absence of capillary effects
S p would measure the so-called coefficient of external pressure.       But
the fall of thermometer    being accompanied by a change in the shape of
the meniscus, the readings before and after the change of pressure are
not directly comparable. If the meniscus is normal at high pressure
(which can be realised in the experiment, by arranging for a slowly
rising temperature), we must add to the reading at the low pressure a
1-ertain constant K, which represents the difference in the readings of a
thermometer between a rising and falling thread. Hence (8 + K)/p will
be the corrected coefficient of external pressure          If ten sets of   (/i    ).

    Mr. Sworn concluded from his results that K is a constant not
affected by a change in the rate of rise in temperature, and not appreci
ably different in different parts of the tube, if the average value of K
over a space of several millimetres is always taken.
    The Fundamental Interval and the Coefficient of Internal Pressure.        — The
zeros were determined by plunging the thermometer into a mixture of
finely pounded ice and distilled water. Samples of ice were frequently
prepared from distilled water, which had for some time been kept in a
partial vacuum of 50 — 100 mm. Norwegian ice was also used, and
within the limits of experimental error was always found to give the
same results as the specially prepared ice.         The purity of the ice was
invariably    controlled  by testing  for  chlorides,   by the Nessler test, and
by evaporation to dryness in a platinum basin.               In order to l>e sure

that the two varieties of ice would give the same results, control
determinations were made with Nos. 2220 and 2221, the indications of
which coidd be relied upon to show differences               exceeding 0-001° C.
The apparatus for taking the zeros did not differ            materially from that
generally used and described by Guillaume.
     The    thermometer was plunged into the ice within one or two minutes
 after removing it from the hypsometer, whilst the bulb was still at
 +0  —  50°. The thermometer was held vertically in the hand until the
 mercury had fallen sufficiently for the bulb to              be   immersed with
 safety into the ice. 5 — 10 mm. of the stem above            0° C. were exposed
 to   the  ice, adjustment to the vertical made, the thermometer raised so
 that the image of the meniscus was just clear of the ice, and the
 readings taken. The stem was always well tapped.
      The   indications   of thermometers at the temperature         of saturated
 steam were investigated in a form of rotary hypsometer which pre
 sents some slight difference from that used at the Bureau Inter
  national.      The difference consists in an improvement of the position
  and construction of the manometer which measures the pressure excess
  of the steam.        In the Breteuil instrument the manometer keeps its
  vertical position while that part of the hypsometer which holds the
  thermometer may         be placed in either a vertical or horizontal   position.
  This    construction renders it necessary   for the manometer opening to be
  placed at      some distance from the thermometer         bulb, the two being
  separated     by a narrow    passage through   which   the   steam has to pass.
  The manometer will, therefore, register too high a pressure. To correct
  for this the steam in passing into the condensers when it is at .atmo
   spheric pressure, is forced through an exactly similar passage, so that
   the hypsometer pressure may be assumed to be half way between the
   pressure    indicated   by the manometer and the atmospheric pressure.
   Mr. Sworn gave up the convenience of having the manometer in                  a
   fixed position and secured thereby greater certainty in measuring the
   actual steam pressure at the thermometer bull).            Arrangements had
    to be made, of course, for the manometer to turn so as to keep the
    water column vertical when the tube is placed in the horizontal posi
   tion.     Two manometers were used, one connected with the inner
    chamber holding the thermometer, and the other with the outer steam
    jacket, but no difference in pressure could ever be detected.         In order
    to prevent the formation of troublesome water drops in the ma
    nometers, short and wide glass chambers were interposed between
    them and the steam.       It was thus ascertained that the pressure excess
    of the steam could be kept within 0'02 mm. of mercury.
       A distillation of mercury was avoided by leaving the ast two
    degrees of the thread unexposed until it was thought that the depressed
   zero had attained a constant position.        Tapping was always resorted
   to, but the author has been unable to satisfy himself that it makes any

   The observed values of     were obtained by dividing the differences
                                            ft;
in the observed reading (horizontal — vertical position) by the height of
the mercury column above the centre of the btdb.       No correction was
made for the fact that when the column of mercury was raised from
the horizontal to the vertical position, the thread descended, and the
reading therefore corresponded to one taken with falling temperature,                a
while in the horizontal position the reading corresponded to one taken
with rising temperature.    Mr. Sworn concluded from the good agree
ment between the observed and calculated values of       that the effect                       fti
of capillarity   somehow eliminated in these observations.

observed at an angle    to the horizontal, the readings should differ by

position   from the  horizontal, or  from  the  vertical.    The observed
differences are, however, for the most part nil, and in any case a mere
fraction of K. If, further, the thermometer        gradually raised from the
                                                                           is

the manometers.             I am personally inclined to think that we are
dealing in the hypsometer with steam under what I might term
oscillatory conditions of temperature and pressure, the effect of which
is to reduce       all the steam indications of the thermometer to what they
would be with a receding menisous. Within narrow limits the mercury
may advance along the tube, but of necessity there will subsequently
be a capillary force erected which will, within the same narrow limits
(viz.,    K),   prevent its return.
     Comparison      of  Thermometers.  — The apparatus in which the compari
sons     were conducted consisted of a cylindrical tank surrounded, except
;it the     top, by a jacket kept at constant temperature, by a circulation
 of   water heated in a thermo-regulator.           The capacity of the tank was
 5   litres, and it could be heated or cooled independently,                and its
 temperature set a few degrees above or below that of the jacket.              The
 contained water would then heat or cool at a definite and constant
 rate.      The upper part of the tank has two plate glass sides let in
 parallel to one another and at right angles to the reading telescope.
 Two series of comparisons were made.                In the first the normal thei-
 mometers       were compared at 20°, 40°, and 60° C. At each tempera
 ture    the instruments were compared, two at a time in six pairs, the
 zeros being taken immediately after the second set of readings for
 each      pair.     In the second       series the   calorimetric   thermometers,
 2220     and 2221 w;ere also utilised, the former in closed series       with  the
 normals.        These comparisons were made at intervals of 5° from zero
 to 55°     and at 80°.      It is not necessary to refer further to the results
 obtained with the calorimetric thermometers, as it was found that
  the   water in the comparison tank was slightly different at different
 levels according as the tank was at a temperature                 higher or lower
  than that of the atmosphere.             The bulbs of the calorimetric thermo
 meters      being placed at different and varying levels as compared
  with the bulbs of the standard          thermometer, the results were vitiated,
  but    this   source of      error  did   not affect the comparison of the
  standards.       In the reduction of observations Mr. Sworn reduced all
  readings     to  a falling meniscus. Assuming that the actual observations
  at the freezing and boiling points of water are those corresponding to
  a falling thread, he adds to such reading          in the comparison the con
   stant    K   previously     determined    by him.     From the result of his
   investigations, Mr. Sworn drew the conclusion that there is no syste
   matic difference between the indications of the verre dur and the Jena
   16'" thermometers, and that the flint glass thermometers give indica
   tions   which are practically     identical with those   of the hydrogen   ther
    mometer.

       Note on the above Paper.         By Arthur Schuster, F.R.S.
                         Received January 4, 1900.
   .Mr.  Sworn's   investigations raise some questions of importance in
the behaviour    of mercury thermometers.        The irregularities which are
observed in the behaviour of the mercury thread of a thermometer
while descending have led observers to take accurate measurements
only in a slowly rising temperature.           To avoid inconsistencies, the
standard temperatures ought also to be measured under conditions
which secure the normal formation        of the mercury meniscus, which is
that of a rising thread.        At the temperature of boiling water it is
supposed that this can be done by stopping momentarily the flow of
steam,   so as to lower the temperature before bringing the mercury
thread to its final position.       At the freezing point a difficulty has
always been felt about the influence of effects of capillarity, and there
is no doubt that this     is the weakest point at present    in the accurate
measurement of temperatures with mercury thermometers.
   Mr. Sworn's investigations led him to conclude that if the fall of a
thermometer is slow      {i.e., when the meniscus travels its own diameter
in about one minute), the fall is regular, and not a series of disjointed
steps.    The difference in the readings of a falling and rising ther
mometer being, according to him, a constant (K), which can be deter
mined by the method described in his paper, it should be possible to
reduce readings taken with a rising meniscus to readings with a falling
thermometer by simply adding K to the reading.
   .Mr. Sworn's contention was that this should always be done, because
the freezing point is approached from above, and the boiling point
also, according to him, corresponds to a measurement taken with a
falling thread.     His observations on the behaviour of thermometers in
the hypsometer are of considerable importance, but some confirmation
is required, because Guillaume          describes an experiment which is
not in agreement with Mr. Sworn's conclusion, that the difference in
the readings between a rising and falling thermometer disappears
when     the instrument      is  suspended in steam.       On the contrary,
Guillaume     determines the amount of the difference by observations
in the hypsometer, and states it to lie between 0-002 and 0'003° with
the standard Tonnelot thermometers.           I am inclined to think that the
truth lies between the two extremes, and that the effects of capillarity
are still appreciable in the steam, but decidedly smaller than at lower
 temperatures.     1 am led to this conclusion through my observations
at the freezing point with Tonnelot thermometers, which have always
made me think that Guillaume must have underrated the effects of
capillarity.   But even granting for a moment that there is no effect
of capillarity in the hypsometer, I should not be inclined to accept
 Mr. Sworn's explanation of the fact, which is that the temperature of

              Researches    in  Absolute Mercurial         Thermometry.                93
the steam is    slightly fluctuating, and that when it            is accidentally high
the temperature      rises,   but  when    it is low, stiction prevents the thread
from falling, so that the ultimate effect is to make the thermometer
indicate too high by an amount equal to K.                 There is no evidence in
support of such a fluctuation.            It is at least equally probable that
stiction is actually of smaller importance at the higher temperature,
where the distillation of mercury, which is known to take place from
the free surface, must assist the formation of the normal meniscus.
Mr. Sworn's method of reducing thermometric observations depending
on the complete disappearance of             K at the boiling point, cannot there
fore be accepted       without further evidence, but the matter               is one well
worthy     of careful investigation.          Mr. Sworn was perfectly right in
saving    that  the three     readings,  viz.,   freezing point, temperature, and
boiling point, ought to be taken under like conditions of the meniscus,
but the proper way of accomplishing this is to alter the usual practice
of   fixing the zero by substituting          a method     similar    to that of deter
 mining the freezing points of solutions.              If the water is first slightly
 undercooled, and then brought to the proper temperature by the intro
 duction of a few ice crystals, a great improvement in zero point deter
 minations would be effected.
    Mr. Sworn's comparisons between thermometers of different com
 position were carried out with great care, and may be considered
 reliable, as far as the instruments            used are concerned, but          it is not
 quite certain in how far different thermometers purporting to be made
 of the same glass may differ.           Thus the majority of the Jena glass
 thermometers carefully studied at Berlin showed a difference of over
 0-01° at 50° when compared with the French hard glass,* but one
 instrument agreed throughout its range with the latter, while another
 differed in the other direction.              Marek, at Vienna, did not find
any systematic       difference     between     the French and Jena glass, and
 Mr. Sworn's thermometers also show a practical coincidence.                           Mr.
 Sworn's    evidence     that    his  instruments       were     really made of the
 16'" Jena glass rests on the assurance of the maker (Gerhardt, of
 Bonn), but the anomalous behaviour of two of the Berlin ther
 mometers leaves a doubt as to how far blowers are carefiU to guard
 against accidental mixing up of different sorts of glass. It is not
 possible, moreover, to compare directly the result of Mr. Sworn's com
 parison with that of other observers, on account of the difference in the
 method of reduction,         but, as far as I can see, the discrepancy would
 have been greater if Mr. Sworn had reduced his observations in the
 way adopted at Sevres and Charlottenburg.                  The same remark applies
 with greater force to Mr. Sworn's reduction of the flint glass indica
 tions to those of the hydrogen thermometer.                      He uses Chappuis's
  numbers    for the relation      between the French           hard glass and hydro-

gen scales.     But Chappuis's numbers only apply when the glass ther
mometers are treated and read in the way in which he treated them
in his comparisons. That is the great advantage in using the Tonnelot
thermometer.       It is not an absolute but an intermediate standard. It
is  immaterial    whether Chappuis's method of treating a glass ther
mometer can be improved upon by adopting a different way of obtain
ing the zero, or by making corrections for effects of capillarity. It is
sufficient to know that consistent results can be obtained if the ther
mometers are always treated in the same way, and whether that way
is good or bad,    it is the only one which can be used, if we wish to refer
the temperature measurement to Chappuis's hydrogen thermometer.
For this reason, and also because we have not at present any guarantee
that flint glass thermometers agree sufficiently in composition to give
identical results, Mr. Sworn's conclusions cannot at present be accepted
as final.   Mr. Chree's experience* tends in the direction of indicating
differences in the behaviour of different thermometers nominally made
of the same glass.

             Researches      in Afcplitte Jfarcttfytf, Thermometry.                93
the steam is slightly fluctuating, and that when it is accidentally high
the temperature rises, but when it is low, stiction prevents the thread
from falling,  so that the ultimate        effect   is to make the thermometer
indicate too high by an amount equal to K. There is no evidence in
support of such a fluctuation.           It is at least equally probable that
stiction is actually of smaller importance at the higher temperature,
where the distillation of mercury, which is known to take place from
the free surface, must assist the formation of the normal meniscus.
Mr. Sworn's method of reducing thermometric observations depending
on the complete disappearance of K at the boiling point, cannot there
fore be accepted without further evidence, but the matter is one well
worthy of careful investigation.            Mr. Sworn was perfectly right in
saying that the three readings, viz., freezing point, temperature, and
boiling point, ought to be taken under like conditions of the meniscus,
but the proper way of accomplishing this is to alter the usual practice
of fixing the zero by substituting a method similar to that of deter
mining the freezing points of solutions.              If the water is first slightly
undercooled, and then brought to the proper temperature by the intro
duction of a few ice crystals, a great improvement in zero point deter
minations would be effected.
    Mr. Sworn's comparisons between thermometers of different                    com
position were carried out with great care, and may be considered
reliable, as far as the instruments used are concerned, but it is not
quite certain in how far different thermometers purporting to be made
of the same glass may differ. Thus the majority of the Jena glass
 thermometers carefully studied at Berlin showed a difference of over
 O'OV at 50° when compared with the French hard glass,* but one
 instrument agreed throughout its range with the latter, while another
 differed in the other direction.            Marek, at Vienna, did not find
any systematic      difference     between    the French and Jena glass, and
Mr. Sworn's thermometers also show a practical coincidence. Mr.
Sworn's evidence that his instruments were really made of the
 16"' Jena glass rests on the assurance of the maker (Gerhardt, of
Bonn), but the anomalous behaviour of two of the Berlin thermo
meters    leaves a doubt as to how far blowers are careful to guard
against accidental mixing up of different sorts of glass.                   It is not
possible,   moreover,   to   compare directly      the  result   of Mr.  Sworn's com
parison with that of other observers, on account of the difference in the
method of reduction, but, as far as           I   can see, the discrepancy would
have been greater if Mr. Sworn had reduced his observations in the
way adopted at Sevres and Charlottenburg.                  The same remark applies
with greater force to Mr. Sworn's reduction of the flint glass indica
tions to those of the hydrogen thermometer.                      He uses Chappuis's
numbers for the relation between            the   French     hard   glass and hydro-

gen scales.      But Chappuis's numbers only apply when the glass ther
mometers are treated and read in the way in which he treated them
in his comparisons. That is the great advantage in using the Tonnelot
thermometer.        It is not an absolute but an intermediate          standard.   It
is immaterial whether Chappuis's method of treating a glass thermo
meter can be improved upon by adopting a different way of obtaining
the zero, or by making corrections for effects of capillarity. It is
sufficient to know that consistent results can be obtained if the thermo
meters are always treated in the same way, and whether that way is
good or bad, it is the only one which can be used, if we wish to refer
the temperature measurement to Chappuis's hydrogen thermometer.
For this reason, and also because we have not at present any guarantee
 that flint glass thermometers agree sufficiently in composition to give
identical results, Mr. Sworn's conclusions cannot at present be accepted
 as final.    Mr. Chree's experience* tends in the direction of indicating
 differences in the behaviour of different thermometers nominally made
of the same glass.

     Speaking generally, colloidal matter occurs in three conditions : —
     (1)   As fluid mixture, colloidal solutions, or                      sols, as Graham             called
             them ;
     (2) Solid mixtures of fluid and solid, the gels                      ;    and
     (3) Solids, such as dry silica or dry glass.
       property of forming gels is not possessed by all those mix
     The
tures which have been classed as colloids. Some only form slimes,
which even to the point of actual drying retain the fluid property of
flowing. Serum albumen and water is an instance.
   Those which form gels fall into two well-defined classes, according
to whether the change from the sol to the gel      or   not, reversible       is,    is
      reversal of the conditions which produce it. Silica and water
 by
 a
may be taken as the type of the latter, gelatine and water of the
former. When        hydrosol of silica forms
                            a                   hydrogel, the latter
                                                                   a                                      is
" insoluble." To this class belong hydrosols of metallic hydrosulphides
and oxides.            A hydrosol of gelatine sets to hydrogel by lowering the
                                                                 a
temperature        ;   the process    however reversed when the temperature
                                         is                                                               is
again raised.        As the inner mechanism of the gelation of the hydrosols
must       differ in the two cases, since in the one irreversible, in the other
reversible molecular aggregates are formed,      propose to distinguish
                                                                  I

I will call " coagulation," of    soluble gel " setting."

96               Mr. W. B. Hardy.      On the Mechanism       of
at considerable length     ; and initial experiments     were made with the
ternary systems, gelatine-water-alcohol, gelatine-water-mercuric chlor
ide, and agar- water-alcohol.     These mixtures are homogeneous when
heated, but, on cooling, there occurs a division into two fluid phases.
In the binary systems and in the ternary system agar-water-alcohol,
the conjugate phases have approximately the same refractive index.
In the ternary system, gelatine-water-alcohol, the refractive index of
the one phase differs so much from that of the other as to permit of
 direct microscopical investigation of the form of the surface which
 separates  the phases.   For this reason   I  propose to treat this ternary
 system first.
                   The Ternary System — Gelatine-water-alcohol.
     "When 13-5 grammes of dry gelatine are dissolved in 100 c.c. of a
 mixture of equal volumes of absolute alcohol and water, a system is
 produced which is clear and homogeneous at temperatures above 20°.
 As the temperature falls below this limit a clouding occurs, which findI
 to be due to the appearance of fluid droplets which gradually increase
 in size until they measure 3/x. On cooling further these fluid droplets
 become 3olid, and they begin to adhere to one another.              In this
 way a framework is built up, composed of spherical masses hanging
 together in linear rows which anastomose with one another.               The
 framework, therefore, is an open structure, which holds the fluid phase
 in its interstices. The macroscopical result of the change is the con
 version, with falling temperature, of the fluid into a loose gel. The
 droplets can be readily separated from the interstitial fluid by the help
 of a centrifugal machine.
     The phenomena above        described undoubtedly depend upon the
 separation   of a  homogeneous mixture into two phases owing to a fall of
  temperature.     Each phase contains water, alcohol, and gelatine, and
  the system may be described as a conjugate composed of a fluid solu
  tion of gelatine in a mixture of water and alcohol, and a solid solution
  of water with a trace of alcohol in gelatine.        Both phases, however,
  are fluid within a small range of temperature.       The surface of separa
  tion of the two phases is curved, and at first discontinuous, and owing
  to the small size of the droplets it is very large.
      When the gel is heated the two phases again mix to form a clear
  fluid.   Owing however to the fact that the droplets adhere to one
  another, they tend to fuse as temperature rises, so as to form irregular
   masses of viscous fluid, which are separated from the other phase by a
  surface of no particular shape.     The irregular form of this surface, and
   the ease with which it is modified by any chance slight currents, show
  that at this stage the surface tension between the two phases must be
  exceedingly slight. In order to simplify the description I shall call that
                                                 "
  phase which separates as small spheres the internal pkise."

     The concentration of the gelatine in the mixture exerts a very
remarkable   influence upon the configuration of the hydrogel.      When
it is present in large quantity the internal phase is less viscous and of
smaller gelatine content than the external phase, and on cooling it is
the external            phase      which    becomes       a solid solution.                 The       effect   of
increasing      the        proportion         of     gelatine   above a certain                 amount         is
therefore      very striking —          it,   so to speak, turns    the system inside out,
sothat the gel   composed of
                         is                      a   continuous framework of solid solution,
out of which are hollowed spherical spaces filled with fluid.      The
general mechanical properties of the gel, built on this plan, naturally
differ               those of
           very much from       gel with    small proportion of gelatine,

which consists of an  open  framework    of  solid holding fluid in its
interstices.
  A   mixture of gelatine, water, and alcohol          ternary mixture          is   a
which resembles               a   mixture     of benzene,           acetic acid, and water.                    In
eachthere are two immiscible substances and   common solvent.   The       a
immiscible substances are gelatine and alcohol in the one case, and
benzene and water                 in the other, while the common solvent                          is   water in
the former and acetic acid in the latter case. In both systems the
solubility of the immiscible substances in the common solvent varies
widely.    Thus acetic acid and water, and water and alcohol, mix
readily with rise of temperature   while acetic acid and benzene and
                                                      ;
water and gelatine mix freely only when the temperature     above 15°                         is
in  the former case, and above 40° in the latter case.      Duclaux's
researches* show that in ternary mixtures having this last charac
teristic the distribution of the constituentsin the two phases varies
widely with variations in the composition of the whole mass.
  These different characters are illustrated by the following figures,
which give the amount of gelatine present in grammes per 100 c.c.
They are, however, only approximate for the solid phase, owing to
the      difficulty in separating           it   completely from the fluid phase.

  98              Mr. W. B. Hardy.          On the Mechanism,      of
  not to be constant for a given mixture.             The internal phase formed
  droplets, which   were   large  or  small  according to whether the mixture
  was cooled slowly or rapidly.             Thus with a mixture containing
  13*5 grammes gelatine per 100 c.c. the droplets
                                                          (of solid solution) were
 very regularly    3/x in diameter when about 20 c.c. was allowed to cool
 slowly in air.      Cooled rapidly, however, in an ether spray, the drop
 lets were so minute as barely to be visible with a magnification of
 400 diameters.       The effect of the rate of cooling is the same when
 mixtures with a large gelatine content are used, and when, therefore,
 the internal phase is a fluid solution at ordinary temperatures.             When
 cooling is very rapid the droplets are excessively minute ; when it is
 slow they may be as large as 10/i in diameter (gelatine 36'5 per oent.
 of the mixture).       One can therefore make the general statement that
 the more slowly the   division into two phases occurs  the smaller  and less curved
is the surface of separation.
    The effect upon the structure       of the rate at which a fresh condition
is imposed upon the system is manifested in a very striking way when
an already formed gel is cooled.            The experiments upon the effect of
temperature on the composition of the two phases in the case of the
hydrogel of agar show that when heat is added to or taken away
from the system the balance of the phases is altered, water, and
perhaps agar, passing from the one to the other.                  It might be ex
pected that this would take place solely by the passage of material
across the surface which separates the two phases.             The study of the
ternary     mixtures,   however,     makes   it clear that a new approximate
equilibrium     may be reached in two       distinct ways.
    When a portion of the hydrogel of gelatine-water-alcohol is cooled
slowly from 16° to, say, 3° or 4°, one can see with the micro
scope no change beyond an alteration in the size of the droplets
already present, that is to say, the fresh (approximate) equilibrium
is attained by exchange across the surface which separates the phases.
But if the cooling is rapid, say a fall of 10° in a few minutes, a second
ary system of small droplets appears.
    In all the mixtures       which   I  examined    these   were formed in the
external    phase.     Thus, when the concentration           of gelatine in the
whole mass was low,        it was the fluid phase which underwent a division
into secondary phases ;       when it was high, it was the solid phase.          To
put this fact in a general way,           one can say that when the hydrogel is
exposed  to a  rapid fall of   temperature the phase which lies on the convex side
of the surface of separation undergoes division into two secondary phases.*
When the temperature is again allowed to rise these secondary phases
fuse before there is any obvious change in the relation of the primary
phases.
   * The formation of the second ary phases therefore occurs in that one of the
primary phases which is under the lower hydrostatic pressure.

   When once formed   the phases have considerable stability.   If the
droplets are composed of a solid solution one may, by the addition of
water, cause them to increase to relatively  vast dimensions without
their being  destroyed, as they increase in size their refractive index
approximates    more and more to that of the external phase until
finally they are lost sight of. The addition of alcohol, however, once
more brings them into view and causes them to shrink.          Owing to
this    stability once a configuration is established one has to far overstep
the     conditions of its formation in order to destroy it.       This would
account       for the remarkable           hysteresis observed in reversible gels.
Thus a 10 per cent, solution              of gelatine in water sets at 21° and melts
again    at 29-6°, and solutions of agar in water set at temperatures about
   '
•35    and melt at temperatures about 90°.      Similarly with the ternary
mixtures.           In     about 35 per cent, gelatine, the internal
                         one   holding
andexternal phases separate at 20°, but they mix again only at 65°.
When water is added to a ternary mixture so as considerably to swell
the droplets the system is unstable, and the two phases mix at once
when it is mechanically agitated.
  The properties of the ternary system : alcohol, gelatine, and water
are the       following : —
       L Below a certain temperature     it exists in two phases separated by
              a well-defined surface. The temperature at which the separa
              tion occurs depends upon the relative proportion of the com
              ponents in the mixture.  Increasing the proportion of gelatine
              raises it ; as does also an increase in the proportion of alcohol.
              An increase in the proportion of the common solvent, water,
              however, lowers the temperature at which the biphasic cha
              racter develops.
       ii.   Both phases are at first fluid        ;   with further fall in temperature
               one becomes solid.
      iii. The surface of separation   curved and discontinuous.
                                              is                   In some
             cases, strictly as secondary change, the discontinuous masses
                                    a
             of the internal phase become continuous with one another.
      iv. The more slowly the two phases are established the less       the          is
             surface which separates them both in extent and in curva
               ture.

                                              is
               sometimes on the convex side of the surface of separation.
               The former happens when the proportion of gelatine    small,     is
               the latter when     large.

 hanging one to the other, form                a   framework     in the   spaces of which

100                   Mr. W. B. Hardy.                     On the Mechanism          of
fluid is held.      These two types present important mechanical pecu
liarities.    The former is firm and elastic, and it maintains its structural
integrity even under high pressure.                            The latter is much more brittle,
and manifests a tendency to spontaneous shrinking, which is due to a
continuous increase in the surface of contact or possibly union between
droplet and droplet.    These gels with an open solid framework there
fore specially manifest that property of spontaneous shrinkage to which
Graham applied the term " synseresis."
    In the building of a hydrogel of the         type two distinct events
                                                               second
occur. The first is the separation of droplets, which rapidly become
solid ; the second is the linking of these droplets together to a pattern
so that they build a framework throughout the fluid phase.      The first
is the separation of a homogeneous mass into two phases                                    ;   the second is
a phenomenon akin to the grouping of particles which are suspended                                        in
a fluid.     It   is probable that these two events are not directly connected
with   one another.
                                Binary Mixtures (Agar-toater).
    I know  of no binary reversible system in which the optical characters
of the two phases differ sufficiently to permit of direct microscopical
investigation of the surface of separation. It                          is,
                                                   however, easy to prove
that in such system as agar and water the property of gel building
                   a                                                                                      is
dependent upon the appearance of two phases.
   The agar which was used was prepared from commercial agar as
follows. The strips were suspended in a large volume of distilled water
for twenty-four hours  the water was then drained off, and
                                 ;                            large part                       a
of the water absorbed by the strips was squeezed out by         powerful                       a
press.  The strips were  again suspended  in distilled water, and  again
drained and squeezed after forty-eight hours.        This washing with
distilled water      continued for some weeks. The strips were then
                        was
melted and the hydrosol filtered, and the filtrate allowed to set. The
clear hydrogel so obtained was sliced and suspended for further period               a
of weeks in many changes of distilled water.  In this way colourless                           a
gel was obtained free from all foreign diffusible bodies. It was not
found necessary to take precautions against micro-organisms.   With
the removal of the salts the agar ceased                              to afford them            a   suitable
nidus.

from soluble substances by treatment for months with hot and cold
distilled water. The packet was then pressed in a screw press, and the
large yield of fluid collected.       When the fluid ceased to flow, the
solid which remained in the canvas was removed to a stoppered
vessel.
   The fluid was found to     be a solution  of agar. This was proved by
evaporating some after it had been thrice filtered to a small bulk, when
it was found to set to a typical clear gel. The results of the study of
the ternary systems give sufficient grounds for defining the expressed
fluid as a solution of agar in water, and the solid which remains in the
canvas a solution of water in agar. The effect of the composition of
the gel and of temperature upon the distribution of the water and the
agar in these two phases was determined.         The percentage composition
was arrived at by drying a known weight of each, and assuming that
the residue was entirely composed of agar.            The results which were
obtained lie far outside of any error which could have been introduced
by this assumption when one considers the pains which were taken to
free the gels from foreign bodies. Further, in every case an examina
tion of the dry residue was made in order to prove that it was composed
of matter capable of forming with water a typical agar gel.
                           Experimental Difficulties.
   The method used to separate the two phases, though at first sight
 crude, was found to be the most effective. The great error to be avoided
is the blocking of the canvas pores by a mass of the solid phase, so
 that, instead of the true fluid phase, one really expresses fluid which has
been forced through a membrane (pressure filtered). Owing to this error,
a press, which   I had specially made, and in which the piston drove the
gel directly down on to a disc of canvas, proved quite useless.           Very
great force was necessary to express a fluid which was found to be
almost pure water.
   To   succeed,  it is necessary to avoid direct or great pressure.       The
 masses of gel are loosely placed    in a long canvas    packet, which is then
 deformed by pressing the ends together.           The pressure necessary to
 yield abundant fluid is now quite small, for the solid framework of the
gel is destroyed by being rubbed against the canvas, and is reduced to
fine particles, while the fluid easily makes its way through the coarse
pores of the canvas. Eaising the pressure always expresses a fluid
poor in agar, while with slight to moderate pressure the concentration
of the expressed fluid, as tested by determining the solids in the yield
at different stages, remained fairly constant, but always with a slight
decrease as time went on.
   The expressed fluid was filtered before the solids were estimated           ;
this was found to lower the amount of solid to a very slight extent.

  Two portions of              a   fairly concentrated gel             were taken.          To   one     part
water was added to dilute                     it,

equal portions of each were poured into two glass stoppered cylindrical
vessels of identical shape, make, and size. The two vessels were then
set aside to cool.
  After forty-eight hours samples were cut from different levels in                                      each

duces an increase in the concentration of the agar in both phases. An

           Effect of Temperature upon  the Composition      of the Phases.
    This was determined by running        a large mass of the hydrosol           into
a  number of glass vessels of the same shape and size.                 Each vessel
held 600 c.c. of the hydrosol.      They were close stoppered and allowed
to cool to the room temperature.           After forty-eight hours they were
placed in chambers of known temperature, where they were kept for
five to seven days before the contents were subjected to pressure.                 In
these experiments, as is obvious, the internal changes are those which
follow on raising or lowering the temperature of the hydrogel from
the air temperature.       In other experiments the hydrosol was cooled
down to, but not below, the temperature of observation.                    This dis
tinction is important, because it was found that the composition of the
phases varied for a given temperature according to whether that tem
perature was the lowest of a descending series or the highest of an
ascending series.      This is shown clearly in the two curves AB AB',

    Putting on one side for a moment the different          effect of an ascending
 or   a descending temperature change,          these   experiments show that
(1) a hydrogel of agar is a structure form of a more solid part and a
 fluid, and (2) each of these two phases is a mixture of agar and water,

 (3) the composition of the phases is dependent to a lesser degree
 upon the ratio of agar to water in the entire mass, to a greater
 degree upon the temperature.
    While recognising      as  fully as possible that only an approximation         to
 the actual composition of the two phases at different temperatures is
obtained     by these experiments, it is obvious that they afford reliable
information on two points.           These are, firstly, the marked " lagging "
action or passive resistance to change offered by the system agar-water.
 The difference in composition of the phases according to whether any
given temperature lies in an ascending or a descending series shows
 how slow the system is in reaching final equilibrium.* Secondly, the
experimental results seem to me to indicate pretty clearly the general
form of a part of the concentration temperature curve.                    I give the
 curve as   it appears from the figures in Experiment II. AB and CD
are   the curves for the system — solution of agar in water, solution of
water in agar, and vapour. If they correctly represent the general form
of the curve, then, by the theorem of Le Chatelier, it follows that the
change from the system solution of water in agar and vapour to the system
solution of water in agar, solution of agar in water, and vapour will be
accompanied by a liberation of heat when the change takes place along
the isotherms from 5° to ± 20°, and by an absorption of heat when the
change is along the isotherms ± 20° to 35°, while the change from the
system solution of agar in water and vapour to the system of two
solutions and vapour will always be accompanied by absorption of
heat.
    I  have not established this deduction         experimentally, but it finds a
 considerable amount of support in the following facts. When water is
allowed to dissolve in pure dry agar at 14°, a considerable amount of
heat is given off.       1 c.c. of dry agar in coarse powder added to 10 c.c.
 of water gives a rise of more than 6°,t while control experiments with
 carefully dried finest graphite or Band gave a rise of temperature of
 0-15° and 017° respectively.          Wiedemann and LudekingJ also found

over a wide range of temperatures, and even in presence of the stable hydrates it
is often hours or days before equilibrium is reached (Bancroft, loc. cit., p. 54, or
Roozebrom, ' Zeits. f. Phys. Chem ,' vol. 5, 1890, p. 198).      The lagging action in
colloids which is eo markedly shown by van Bemmelen's researches into the
effect of time on the hydrogel of silicic acid, ceases to be extraordinary when one
remembers that one of the phases is a solid. Gels reach equilibrium much more
rapidly than does, for instance, a bar of metal in which the reaction Telocity is so
slow that final equilibrium may never bo reached.

   light is passed through      a gradually cooling hydrosol.    The observa

 beyond which the equilibrium is no longer between a fluid solution and

    The first worker to regard gelation         as being due to the formation    of
 two phases, one fluid and the other             solid, was van Bemmelen.*      He
 has given a suggestive discussion of            the formation and structure of
 gels, based chiefly upon the manner            in which amorphous material is
 precipitated     from a solution,      and he     is  led to the conclusion that
" coagulation or the precipitation of         a gel from a solution seems to be a
similar phenomenon ;       a  desolution (Entmischung) which forms, not two
layers completely separated from one another, but
    "  1.  A framework    of a material which is in a more or less transitional
            state between fluid and solid, and which presents those special
            properties to which the term colloid is applied.
    "  2. A fluid which is enclosed within this framework/'
    Van Bemmelen, however,          does   not consider that these two parts can
be considered as two phases          in the  sense of the phase rule, since there
is no sharp line between them,t and he therefore concludes that the
phase rule cannot be employed to elucidate the phenomena.                     This
opinion is based upon a study of the equilibrium between the water
content of various gels and the vapour pressure, so patent and
thorough       as to give   it very great weight.        The curves of the equi
librium points are gradually bending lines if the dehydration of the
gels is sufficiently slow, but if dehydration is relatively rapid there is a
sudden change of direction (fig. 2) when the water content is very
much diminished (1 to 2H20 to ISiOj).
    It is possible that the form of these curves does not necessarily
depend upon the absence of a clear separation between the fluid and
the solid portions of the gel.           When one considers how small is the
mutual solubility of silica and water and how slight therefore the in
fluence which a given mass of silica is likely to exert upon the vapour
pressure of even a relatively small mass of water, it is probable that
the form of the curve is determined more by the operation of secondary
influences, such as capillary tension, which depend on the structure of
the gel, than upon the direct interaction of silica and water.           Capillary
tension would tend to lower the vapour pressure ^ with which the gel
is in equilibrium to a greater and greater extent as the spaces in the
solid framework of the gel became smaller and smaller with the
decrease     in the water content.       The tendency to reduce the surface

 when dehydration has been relatively rapid and is nearly complete, is
 what must occur when the capillary spaces in the framework become
 commensurate with the masses (small spheres for instance) of solid
 out of which the framework is built, and         when, therefore, any further
 diminution in the capillary spaces involves      deformation of those masses,
 unless the removal of water is so slow           that the very slow rate of
 readjustment in the solid phase is not          exceeded.     Lastly, the very
 limited    powers of reabsorption of fluid by completely dried irrever
 sible gels would, on this view, again not necessarily represent a
 reformation of the phases, that is to say, a real interaction between
 silica and water, but the refilling of capillary spaces by water due to
 the excessive     capillary tension of these very minute capillaries. The
 capacity for reabsorption would therefore be diminished by any agent
  which facilitates the annealing of the dried gel and so destroys the
  capillary interspaces.     Such an agent is heat, and van Bemmelen found

     There            is   one         system in which gelation is an irreversible
                                  binary
process           (i.e.,   coagulation) which can be readily studied under the
microscope.                The hydrosol is a ternary system composed of water, a
minute trace of free acid or alkali, and the modification                   of egg albumen
which is produced by heating                    it   to 100°.  Coagulation occurs when the
free acid or alkali is removed.                      As the coagulation point is neared the
proteid particles in the hydrosol increase in size, so that spheres 0-75
to     in diameter are formed. These become arranged in rows which
anastomose so that an open net with regular polygonal meshes is
formed. t  In this case the process of gel building is the same as
that which can be followed so easily in ternary mixtures, and in both
cases a definite surface separates the phases. It is probable that the
hydrogel of silica is formed in the same way, since Picton and Linder
have shown by optical tests that, as the point of coagulation is
approached, larger and larger particles of silica form in the hydro
sol. I These particles may be solid solutions of water in silica, or
they may-be large molecular aggregates of silica free from water.                                    I
incline to think that the latter is the more probable assumption, since,
if they were solutions, it is difficult to see why the process should be
irreversible.
     In the                       systems agar-water, or gelatine-water-
                      case of the reversible
alcohol, the particles seem to be of the nature of solid solutions.
   The system agar and water consists of two components, and,
therefore, a nonvariant   system should be defined by four coexistent
phases.   Since the gel stage consists of three phases, namely two
solutions and a vapour phase, it should be a monovariant§ system. That
is to say, the composition of the phases should be fixed by fixing
either the temperature or the pressure of the vapour phase.       The
experiments show that this is not the case.    The composition of the
fluid and solid phases is not constant for a given temperature.  This
result might be regarded as being due to the passive resistance to
change in the system which is introduced by the formation of a solid
phase.  On this view if the velocity of the reaction were known, the
phases would be fixed if the element of time were introduced and
accorded a definite finite value. This is the method which Bancroft sug
gests for dealing                with such   cases   ;j|   it   is,   however, possible that there are

 really more than n + 2 independent variables, so that the hydrogel is
 not a monovariant system. In an ordinary system the independent
 variables are the components (n), temperature and pressure. Agar-
 water, however, is a system with two components, temperature and
 two pressures.            This follows from the fact that the surface which
 separates     the   fluid   and solid phases is curved.        In point of fact the
 system is most closely represented by a system of two solutions
 separated by a membrane which is permeable by only one of the com
 ponents, for while water will readily pass the surface of separation,
 agar, having the heavy immobile molecule characteristic of such
 organic bodies, will be almost unable to do so. Hence, if time be con
 sidered finite and small, the surface may practically be considered to
 be  permeable by only one component.                As Bancroft* points out, in a
 system of two solutions separated by semipermeable membrane, there
 are two pressures and there will be n + 3 phases in a nonvariant
system when n — the number of components.                         The hydrogel is a
system of three phases and, therefore, on this view, to fix the com
position, it would be necessary to fix the temperature and one pres
sure.     This relation would probably be true if the curvature of the
surface of separation could be fixed.               This, however, is not the case,
and in order to fix the composition of the phases it would be necessary
either to fix the temperature and both pressures, that of the internal
as well as of the external phase ; or to fix the temperature, one pressure,
and the form of the surface. Practically we can only fix the tempera
ture and the pressure of the external phase.                   I have succeeded in
obtaining       two    phases separated by a plane surface by cooling a hydro-
sol slowly in an electric field.            This method may prove suitable if the
system     is  able    to  recover    from  the forces operating during its forma
                        !
tion.     The me . od of taking known weights of dry agar and water
and keeping them at constant pressure and temperature until equili
brium is obtained is simple, but unfortunately there is the fallacy that
the dry agar is a preformed system.                 The structure of the hydrogel
from which        it is reproduced is not destroyed by drying, and the system
tends to reform itself on the old lines by the filling of the original
capillary     spaces.
    To sum up        these remarks, we may describe the hydrogel of agar as a
system     of  three    phases, a solid, a fluid, and a vapour phase.       The equi
librium is determined by the chemical potential of the components in
the   various       phases,    by two pressures, and by temperature.            Other
operating variables are capillary tension and the energy of the surface
between the fluid and solid phases.              I have made no measurements to
determine how soon the system reaches equilibrium, but the analogous
system, gelatine and water, attains to a constant melting point twenty-
four hours after the formation of the hydrogel. t

     It   has long been held that a large number of colloidal     solutions     are
related to or identical with suspensions of solid matter in a fluid in
which the particles of solid are so small as to settle at an infinitely
slow rate. Such solutions are the colloidal solutions of metals and of
sulphides such as those of antimony, arsenic, and cadmium.         Such
solutions belong to the class of irreversible colloidal mixtures. A rise
of temperature assists the process of coagulation or precipitation;*
but neither  a further rise nor a fall of temperature will cause the
reformation  of the hydrosol.    On this ground they may provisionally
be classed with such colloidal solutions as those of silica, ferric hydrate,
alumina, &c, and with the modification of the albumen of white of
egg which is produced by heating an aqueous solution to the boiling
point.  I also add to the class, for reasons to be developed in the
following pages, the suspension of mastic in water which is produced
by adding a dilute alcoholic solution of the gum to water.
   Looked at from the point of view of the phase rule, the equilibrium
in these hydrosols, if they really consist of minute solid particles dis
persed in a fluid, is not necessarily between the solid particle and water,
but between the solid particle and a solution of the particular solid in
water.   The hydrosol of gum mastic gives off a vapour of the gum of
a density  sufficient to affect the olfactory organs, and, therefore, the
water must contain a definite quantity in solution.     Similarly, as it is
probable that  no  substance  is completely insoluble, we may assume that
in all the examples a portion of the solid is in true solution in the fluid.
As the solid which is not in true solution is dispersed in particles
whose diameter       asis,rule, very much smaller than the mean wave
                             a

although only an immeasurably minute quantity of the solid may be
in true solution at any one time, this quantity, minute though      be,    it
is probably an important factor in determining the equilibrium between

     It   is necessary to keep such considerations as these in mind in view
 of the readiness         with which these mixtures have been regarded as
 simple suspensions* in which the only relation between solid and fluid
 is a mechanical one. These hydrosols are, as a matter of fact, singularly
 stable when pure.           They can, for instance, be concentrated by boiling
 to a remarkable extent, and their stability depends upon complex
 relations between fluid and solid, which gives the former, so to speak,
 a definite hold over the latter.
     Mode of Preparation of the Different Solutions. — The hydrosol of gold
 was prepared by adding a couple of drops of a solution of phosphorus
 in ether to about a           litre of   a very dilute      solution    of gold chloride.
 The fine ruby-coloured fluid which was formed was dialysed against
 distilled      watert for fourteen days, and then concentrated by boiling.
 The hydrosol of silicic acid was prepared by acting on soluble glass
 with excess of hydrochloric acid, and dialysing the product.                             A
 hydrosol of ferric hydrate was prepared by prolonged                       dialysis of the
 solution in ferric chloride.
     The hydrosol of gum mastic was prepared by adding a very dilute
 solution of the gum in alcohol to distilled water.                    It was dialysed. for
 fourteen days against            distilled  water.     The   hydrosol of heat-modified
 egg-white was prepared by dissolving white of egg in nine times its
 volume of distilled water, filtering and boiling.                 The result should be a
  brilliant fluid which scatters blue light.                   Surface action, however,
 plays an extraordinary part.                If the solution is boiled in a test-tube
  a milky fluid is formed and a film of proteid is left on the glass ; a
  second quantity boiled in the same test-tube comes out less milky,
  until, when the proteid film is sufficiently thick to eliminate all action
^ by   the glass, the solution after boiling contains the proteid dispersed
  as particles so small that they scatter pure blue light.                       After pre
  paration      the   hydrosol     was   dialysed   against     distilled  water   for some
  days.
     Behaviour of the Hydrosols in an Electric Field.— It has long been known
  that the particles in these colloidal solutions move in an electric field.
  Zgismondy^ found that the gold in colloidal solutions moves against
  the current.         Picton and Linder§ established the important                fact that
  the     direction    of movement         of the particles, as compared with the
  direction of the current, depends upon their chemical nature.                       I have
  shown that the heat-modified proteid is remarkable in that its direction
  of movement is determined by the reaction acid, or alkaline of the fluid

1   12          Mr. W. B. Hardy.        On the Conditions whicJi
in which it is suspended.* An immeasurably minute amount of free
alkali causes the proteid particles to move against the stream, while in
presence of an equally minute amount of free acid the particles move
with the stream. In the one case, therefore, the particles are electro
negative, in the other they are electro-positive.
  Since one can take a hydrosol in which the particles are electro
negative and, by the addition of free acid, decrease their negativity, and
ultimately make them electro-positive, it is clear that there exists some
point at which the particles and the fluid in which they are immersed
are iso-electric.
   This iso-electric point is found to be one of great importance. As it
is neared, the stability of the hydrosol diminishes until, at the iso
electric point, it vanishes, and coagulation or precipitation occurs, the
one or the other according to whether the concentration   of the proteid
is high or low, and whether the iso-electric point is reached slowly or
quickly, and without or with mechanical agitation.
   This conclusion can be verified experimentally in many ways. If a
coagulum or precipitate of the proteid particles made either by the
addition of a neutral salt, or by the addition of acid or alkalis, be
thoroughly washed, made into a fine mud in an agate mortar, and
suspended in water in a U-tube, it rapidly subsides. The establishment
of an electric field having a potential gradient of 100 volts in 10 cm.
has  no influence on the level of water or precipitate in forty-eight
hours.  If, now, the smallest possible amount of caustic soda or acetic
acid be added, the proteid will commence to move, so that in twenty
hours the precipitate will rise in one or other limb until it nearly
touches the platinum electrode.
  Speaking generally, the hydrosol of ferric hydrate is stable only in
the absence of free acids or alkalis or neutral salts. The hydrosol of
heat^modified    proteid is stable only in presence of free acid or alkali.
The hydrosol     of gum mastic is readily precipitated by acids, but is
stable in presence of any concentration of monovalent alkalis.        The
general conditions of stability of these various hydrosols, therefore, are
very different, yet they agree in manifesting the same important rela
tion between the isoelectric point and the point of precipitation as is
shown by the hydrosol of proteid.
  In the hydrosol of ferric hydrate the particles are markedly electro
positive.  A dilute hydrosol is coagulated by citric acid when the
concentration of the latter reaches 1 gramme-molecule in 4,000,000 c.c.
No matter how small the concentration of the ferric hydrate, the
hydrosol becomes cloudy and settles. The rate of settling         however,is,
slow, being about   1cm. an hour.   In an electric field, having the form
of  aU-tube, the particles always settle slightly faster from the negative

electrode— the acceleration due to the electric field being about 5 mm.
an hour.  The suspended particles of ferric hydrate show, therefore, an
exceedingly slight movement in a direction opposite to that which they
manifest when in colloidal                 solution.        In the latter condition they are
markedly electro-positive             ; in the former they are exceedingly faintly
electro-negative.                An exceedingly faint electro negative character is
also conferred upon the ferric hydrate when the hydrosol is coagulated
by ammonia, 1 gramme-molecule        of the latter being present in
100,000 c.c.
     If
      a fresh gel of silica is broken up in distilled water and carefully
washed to free it from still uncoagulated silica, and from impurities, it
is completely iso-electric with the water.  It becomes markedly electro
negative, however,                on the    addition of the minutest trace of free
alkali.
  Gum mastic precipitated from a dilute hydrosol by adding barium
chloride until the concentration is 1 gramme-molecule in 600,000 cm. is
found to be iso-clectric with the fluid.  It is markedly electro-negative
when      in colloidal solution.
  Picton and Linder have shown that the particles in these hydrosols
gradually grow in size its the coagulation or precipitation    point
is neared.*          It
                 might, therefore, be urged that, as the movement
of the particles in the electric field                  is,

endosmose, due to surface action, the fact that they do not move when
in    simple suspension as opposed to colloidal solution may be due to
the    diminution of the impelling force acting on given volume,  Thisa                        t
is,    however, negatived by the character of the experiments.     The
addition      of   a   minute amount of free alkuli to                 a      mass   of particles of

the size of these relatively                 very large         masses        to any appreciable
extent.       And since in the          case of ferric hydrate and proteid, the sign
of the charge which the particles                carry in the electric field              is   different
on each   side of the actual point of precipitation, that point must of
necessity be an iso-electric point.
   If the stability of the hydrosol     dependent upon is    difference in           a
electrical potential between the solid particles and the fluid, then one
would expect that for, at any rate a short distance from the iso-electric
point, the stability would vary simultaneously with the variation in
the difference of potential.   The experimental investigation of this
question      is   beset by many difficulties.                At   present    I   know of no way
of approaching the iso-electric point other than by the addition of salts,

acids, or alkalis.    One may, therefore, approach the point by the addi
tion  of, say, acid   or alkali, and use a salt to measure the stability of
the system, as in the experiment described later.             In such experiments,
however, the colloid particles are immersed in a complicated system of
three components, the conditions of equilibrium of which cannot be
arrived at from existing data.          The conditions could be simplified by
using, say, KHO or H2SO4 to approach the iso-electric point, and
KjS04 as a measure of the change of stability. A series of determi
nations with different systems of this kind may afford the requisite
measurements.
   A direct and conclusive proof that stability does decrease as the
iso-electric point is approached was however obtained in two ways. The
iso-electric point can be approached in the case of the hydrosol of proteid
by the withdrawal of either the free acid or the free alkali, as the case
may be. As it is neared, the proteid particles increase in size, so that
instead of scattering blue light, they scatter white light ; thus the sur
face of contact of fluid and solid gradually diminishes as the point is
neared. The second experiment, though not a quantitative one, is very
convincing.     A hydrosol of gum mastic dialysed as pure as possible is
not destroyed by mechanical agitation even when long continued.                 If,
however, a salt is added in an amount so small that it just fails to
coagulate the hydrosol, the latter is rendered so unstable that it is
destroyed by shaking.
   Experiments were made to determine whether the particles actually
carry a charge.        An electric field which was practically uniform was
made   by using flat electrodes of the same size, which were placed
parallel to one another at the ends of a straight tube. The particles
were found to move in all parts of the field ; they therefore carry a
definite charge which, according to Quincke's theory of the movement
of particles in an electric field, would be a surface charge, each particle
being surrounded by a doublo layer of electricity.
   Action of Salts. — The power possessed by salts of destroying colloidal
solutions was noticed by Graham.               The subject was, however, first
accurately investigated by H. Schulze.*              He showed that the power
which various salts possess of precipitating a hydrosol of sulphide of
arsenic is related to the valency of the metal, while the valency of the
acid has little influence.      The increase in the precipitating or coagu
lating power produced          by increase in valency' is very great.            If
coagulative power      be  defined   as  the   inverse of the concentration in
gramme-molecules per litre necessary to convert a given hydrosol into a
hydrogel, then from Schulze's measurements the coagulative power of
metals of different valency is : —
                         R'  : R" : R'"   =   1 : 30  : 1650.

   Schulze'8    conclusions     were verified by Prost,* who used sulphide
of cadmium,       and     Picton and       Linder, who used the sulphide of
antimony, t The last-named workers added the important fact that
a small portion of the coagulating salt is decomposed, the metal being
entangled in the coagulum.
   The measurements which            I  have made with various colloidal solu
tions  both confirm        Schulze's   results, and bring out a new relation,
which may be stated as follows          : —
   The coagulative power      of a salt is    determined    by the valency    of  one  of  its
ions.  This prepotent ion is either       the negative or     the positive  ion, according
to whether the colloidal particles move         down    or up the     potential gradient.
The coagulating ion is always of the opposite electrical sign to the particle.
   The salts employed to determine this point were the sulphates of
aluminium, copper, magnesium, potassium, and sodium; the chlorides
of copper, barium, calcium and sodium, and the nitrate of cadmium.
Solutions containing        1 gramme-molecule in 2000 c.c. were prepared.

salt on the hydrosol is as a rule small compared with the effect of the
metal ion.     Thus the stability of a hydrosol of electro-positive proteid
is increased by free acid, yet the acid salts find their proper place in
the scale of valency.     Again, ferric hydrate is coagulated by nitric acid

   The extraordinary rise in coagulative            power with an increase in
valency,    which   was observed      by    Schulze, Prost, and Picton and
Linder, holds in all    cases.   In order to measure it for ferric hydrate,
I  used Schulze's method, in which a drop of the hydrosol is allowed
to fall into   a large volume of the solution of the salt.              A number of
experiments were made until the concentration of the salt was found
which just sufficed to coagulate the drop.               In the   case of gold and
mastic    the process was reversed, the salt solution            being added drop
by drop to a measured quantity of the hydrosol.                       I  append the
results : —

   The figures for ferric hydrate have already been given. It has been
pointed out that if specific molecular coagulative power be defined as
the inverse of the volume occupied by one gramme-molecule of a sub
stance when it just suffices to bring about coagulation, then this value
(K) varies with the valency of the active ion approximately according
to the square and cube : —
                        R'  : R" : R'"   =   K  : K2   :  K8.

118               Mr. W. B. Hardy.           On the Conditions which
The relation         really is not as simple as this ; it is complicated by the
change which the specific molecular conductivity of a salt undergoes
with change in concentration.                 The theoretical considerations have
been     dealt with       elsewhere.*      For convenience of description, how
ever,    I  will call this relation the relation of the square and cube.
    Action of Acids and Alkalis. — The values for K furnished by these
substances show relations to valency even more interesting than that
found with salts. As in the case of salts, their action is entirely
dependent upon the electric properties of the colloid particles.
    When the colloid particles are electro-negative, alkalis either do
not cause precipitation            at any concentration, or if they do cause pre
cipitation the value of         K   does not vary in any simple way with varia
tions in valency.
    When the particles           are   electro-positive, K increases with valency,
but the relation of the square and cube does not hold.                   Instead, one
finds that      K varies directly with the chemical activity of the solution.
    Acids have the reverse relations. When the particles are electro
negative, the value of K varies directly with the chemical activity of
the solution       ;  while  if these    particles are electro-positive, acids either
 have no precipitating power, or if K has any value, then (in the par
ticular case measured) the value varies with valency according to the
 square and cube.
     The various measurements             are brought    together in the following
 table.      The specific conductivities         were calculated from the British
 Association tables. t

   The figures in the fourth column are very remarkable.                 When the
particles are electro-negative, equicoagulative solutions of acids agree
in their electric conductivity within the limits of experimental error.
The same relation is clearly shown if one takes the measurements
which Picton and Linder made of the power possessed by acids of
coagulating   the hydrosol of arsenious sulphide.

where a is the fraction of the total number of molecules (n) which are
dissociated at any one moment, and u + v is the sum of the velocities of
the two ions. The factor u + v plays an important part, as will be
seen by comparing the values for na, in equicoagulative solutions of
acids with slowly moving ions with those with rapidly moving ions : —

    This, however, is probably partly due to the fact that owing to the
 manner in which the coagulative power was measured, time has
 practically a constant small value. The values for n might, perhaps,

122               Mr. W. B. Hardy.                On the Conditions which
   The important       point, however, which calls for notice is that the
function a(u + v) is a numerical measure of the chemical activity of the
substance at a given concentration, so that we reach the important
conclusion that the concentration of acids necessary to coagulate electro
negative colloid particles, and of alkalis necessary to coagulate electro-positive
particles, is determined by the laws which govern ordinary chemical equilibrium..
   In the case of the action of salts on these hydrosols, the relation is
not so simple. K does not vary directly with a(u +     but contains
                                                                                 a v),
                                                                                                  a
factor which   approximately squared or cubed by
                  is                                  change from                                  a
mono-valent to di- or tri-valent ions. The relation can therefore be
best expressed as
                                      K   =
                                              na(u     +     v)A*

particles.
I     should interpret these relations by the suggestion that in the
former the acid or alkali alters the difference of potential at the surface
of the particles by altering the character of the fluid, and in that way
modifies the stability of the hydrosol     in the latter the active ions of
                                                        ;
the salt act directly upon the solid particles, or, perhaps, on the charge
which these carry, and thus play       part which a     perhaps, generally is,
similar to the action of ions when they furnish nuclei for the condensa
tion of vapour.    Picton and Linder have shown that the active ions
are actually entangled in, and form part of, the coagulum.*
   The former relation may profitably                        be placed beside            Bruhl's con
clusions that the action exerted by    fluid upon the substance dis
                                                       a
solved in    itdetermined by the chemical characters of the former, as
                  is
well as of the latter.           He   has shown that the molecular refraction,                   the
dielectric  coefficient, and the power possessed by the fluid of disso
ciating  or chemically changing the molecules of the substance dissolved
in it are measured by the unsatisfied valency, or, to use another phrase,
the residual energy of its molecules.
  The action of acids or alkalis on     hydrosol, the particles of which
                                                      a
are of the opposite electrical sign, seems to be compounded of these
two actions. The acid or alkali may act as         salt, and exhibit the
                                                                     a
characteristic relation between               K
                                    and the valency of the ion of the
opposite electrical sign.             An instance
                                            furnished by the action of

various acids on ferric hydrate, or the acid or alkali by increasing the
difference of potential between the fluid and the solid particles may
increase the stability of the hydrosol.  This     markedly manifested is
by the increased stability given to the hydrosol of gum mastic by the
addition of univalent alkalis.    In the action of barium hydrate on
this hydrosol, the segregating                action of the metal ion overcomes the

action exerted by the reagent in virtue of its alkalinity, the result is
that the coagulative concentration of the alkali Ba(OH)2 gives a value
for K which is less than that given by salts of bivalent metals, and the
specific conductivity of the solution is of the same order as that of the
coagulating concentration of salts of univalent metals. Against these
suggestions, however, must be set the anomalous                          relations  of  the
 various alkalis to the hydrosol of gold.

     These   results   are shown in the curve.                Ammonia alone will not
  aggregate    the  particles     of   gold.    Up   to   a  certain    point, however, it
  decreases the stability of the system.
     The conclusions       can    be summarised         as follows    : — The irreversible
  hydrosols    which have been investigated are systems composed of solid
  particles dispersed through a solution of the substance of the solids
  in the water.
      The stability of the system            is related     to the contact difference of
  potential   which exists between the solid and the fluid phases, and
  which forms round        each solid     particle a double electrical layer.          Such
  double electric layers round particles of any kind immersed in a fluid
     * Except for p faint acid reaction of the gold solution, due probably to a trace of
   phosphoric acid.

 124           Mr. W. B. Hardy.             On the Conditions which
would resist any movement of the particles through the fluid, because,
as Dorn's experiments show, electric work is done in displacing the
particles.*    The effect would be the same as if the viscosity of the fluid
was    increased, t
   The stability of the system may            be destroyed by   altering the differ
ence     of potential.     Free    acid, added to a hydrosol in which the
particles are   negative to pure water, will diminish the relative differ-

a hydrosol in which the particles are electro-positive.
   The stability of the system may also be destroyed by induction, the
active agents being free ions carrying a static charge4                 In this case

 the action may be said to be on the particles, or rather on the electric
 layers immediately around them, and the active ions are those whose
electric sign is the opposite of that of the charge on the surface of the
particles.      In this case coagulative power does not vary directly with
 variations in chemical activity.              It rises exceedingly rapidly with a
 rise in the valency of the active ion. so that the relation
                               I' :  I" : T"   = n   : n1 : na
 is approximately      satisfied.
    Picton and Linder have shown that when the concentration of the
 salt is insufficient to completely destroy the system, it is not wholly
without action.        A fresh point of equilibrium between solid and fluid
is reached by an increase in the size of the particles and therefore a
diminution in the extent and curvature of the surface of contact. The
fact is of importance, because it introduces us to the possibility that
 the reagent may affect the size of the particles by altering the equi
librium between the part of the solid in solution and the part in
suspension.       Double electric layers round each particle are, according
 to Thomson, separated by a region of " uncompleted chemical combina
       "
tion between the components.*                  The density of the field round the
particles in hydrosols will therefore be a measure of the velocity of the
solution and condensation between the particle and the liquid, and
therefore the factor which determines whether the particles will on the
whole grow, diminish, or remain stationary in size.
    "When acids or alkalis are added to hydrosols holding particles of
the opposite electric sign to themselves, the simplest relation seems to
be that univalent acids or alkalis increase the stability ; bivalent acids
or alkalis decrease it.
    The view advanced in this paper implies that each particle in a
hydrosol is surrounded by a zone in which the components are in a
condition of chemical instability. According to R*iyleigh,t such a zone
is of finite thickness, and deep enough to contain several molecules.
We therefore have in these hydrosols two phases, separated by a layer
of extraordinarily large extent, which possesses considerable chemical
energy.       This, it seems to me, suggests an explanation of the catalytic
powers so markedly manifested by hydrosols.

"The Piscian Stars."           By Sir Norman Lockyer, K.C.B., F.R.S.
          Keceived November 20, — Bead December 14, 1899.
                                    Introductory.
   In  the Bakerian     Lecture for 1888*      I  briefly considered the relation
of the stars having spectra with predominant                 carbon absorption (for
which    I  have recently suggested the name Pisciani) to the various
other types of celestial bodies. Shortly afterwards                 I  began the dis
cussion of the observations which had been made by Duner in the case
of these stars.    Those relating to Group             II  (now named Antarian),
another group studied by Duner, were fully dealt with in the Bakerian
Lecture, but after all the available information as to the former had
been   brought together,      I  found that notwithstanding            the admirable
data which Duner had put on record, there were some points on which
further information was desirable.
   In the Antarian stars we had evidence               as to the lines present     in
company with the various flutings, but in the Piscian                  stars even the
presence or absence of lines was somewhat uncertain.
   The publication of this investigation was therefore postponed to see
what light could be thrown upon the subject by further observations.
At various times, as the work permitted, such observations have been
attempted, and the results, so far as they went, did not disturb the
classification at which     I   had already arrived.          Still, the information
thus gained was less complete than desired.
   The photographic work which has quite recently been done on these
stars by Dr. McClean and Professor Hale has now furnished the
additional information required, and it is therefore unnecessary to
delay the publication of the memoir, some ten years old, which in the
main points stands as it was written.
                                Historical Statement.
   Secchi was the     first to recognise stars with spectra of the type
under discussion during his spectroscopic survey made in 1866 and
 1867.    They constituted his fourth type. All the stars of the group
are of small magnitude, and of a deep red colour.                He was inclined to
believe that a radiation spectrum was in question, but pointed out that
there was a relation between the flutings of carbon and the dark bands
seen in the spectra of the stars.         He says :— " Quelques-unes des raies
noires, et les plus importantes, coincident a tres-peu pres avec celles du
troisieme type ; cependant le spectre, dans son ensemble, se present*

comme un spectre direct appartenant à un corps gazeux, plutôt que
comme un spectre d'absorption.                  Si on le considère comme un spectre
d'absorption on trouve qu'il présente le caractère des composés du
carbone, tels qu'on les obtient en produisant une série d'étincelles
électriques        dans un mélange de vapeur de benzine et d'air atmo
sphérique       et   dans l'arc voltaique entres les charbons."*
   Secchi also statest that bright lines are occasionally seen in the
spectra of stars of this type, and in a diagram of the spectrum of
152 Schjellerup he indicates no less than six bright lines.
    Dunér in        1884 catalogued       fifty -five stars of this group, and recorded
the details of their spectra, so far as he was able to observe them. J
    Referring to Secchi's work, Dunér says : — " Secchi s'est beaucoup
occupé de ces spectres, mais il y a de très graves erreurs dans ce qu'il
dit sur l'apparence qu'ils offrent et sur leur nature. D'abord il prononce
                                                                  '

                   que le rouge leur manque presque absolument.                   Pour ma
part, je     l'ai  trouvé très vif dans tous, seulement un peu pâle en com
paraison avec la sous-zone jaune excessivement brillante.                     Puis Secchi
parle   des      raies   vives  qui termineraient, du côté du violet, les zones
brillantes.         Mais ni dans la zone verte ni dans la bleu je n'ai vu la
moindre chose qui pût expliquer un tel énoncé, et je sais que M. Vogel
n'a pas été plus heureux.              Quant aux deux raies brillantes que Secchi
«lit avoir vu dans le jaune, elles se rapportent selon toute probabilité à
la sous-zone jaune, laquelle, comme je viens de le dire, est divisée en
deux par une bande étroite.                 Secchi s'est plus tard persuadé, par des
mesures, que les deux raies jaunes n'ont pas la même position que celles
du sodium ; mais il est néanmoins difficile de comprendre comment il a
pu croire que cette zone, quarante fois plus large que la distance entre
D, et D2, fût les raies du sodium. Au reste il paraît disposé à admettre
que tout le spectre est un spectre direct émis par un gaz incandescent.
Pour moi, il est tout à fait incontestable que c'est un spectre d'absorp
tion, tout aussi bien que celui des étoiles de la Classe Illa, et M. Vogel
a déjà,    il y   a quelques années, émis une pareille opinion, et           il l'a répétée
tout récemment. "§
    In 1865 Zôllner pointed out that spectra might enable                      us to deter
mine the relative ages of celestial bodies, and suggested that the yellow
and red light of certain stars were indications of a reduction of tem-
perature.||         There is now no doubt that stars with fluted spectra,
whether of Group             II (Antarian) or Group VI (Piscian), are cooler than
stars like the sun and a. Lyrae, which have line spectra. But there is an

important difference between the two groups, as I pointed out in the
Bakerian Lecture.            In the Antarian stars we have to deal with con
densing swarms of meteorites in which the temperature is increasing,
whereas in the Piscian stars we have an advanced stage in the cooling
 of masses of meteoritic vapours.             In the case of Antarian stars we have
 mixed radiation and absorption flutings, and I suggested a way in
 which the stars of the group might be divided into fifteen distinct
 species, representing successive stages in condensation.             We have now
to consider a similar classification of the Piscian stars, of which          I stated
 in the Bakerian Lecture (p. 26) :— " The species of which                    it will
 ultimately       be composed are already apparently         shadowed forth in the
 map which          accompanies DuneVs volume, and they will evidently be
 subsequently differentiated by the gradual addition of other absorptions
 to that of carbon, while at the same time the absorption of carbon
 gets less and less distinct."
       In considering the stars of this group, it is most important to bear in
 mind that there are indications of carbon absorption in the spectrum
 of the sun. I first obtained evidence of the existence of carbon vapour
 in the solar atmosphere in 1874, and in 1878 I communicated a paper
 to the Royal Society on that subject.*               Angstrom had already shown
 that the true carbon lines were not reversed in the solar spectrum, but
  I   demonstrated      by photographic comparisons that there was a perfect
 correspondence between the individual members of the brightest part
  of the fluting in the ultra violet (commencing at A 3883-55), and a
 series of fine      dark lines in the solar spectrum.       I pointed out that this
 carbon vapour existed in a more complicated molecular condition (as
  is evidenced by the flutings) than the metallic vapours in the sun's
  atmosphere, t
       There can therefore be no doubt that in the sun carbon absorption
  is just commencing, and that, as I stated in a former paper, J "the
  indications of carbon will go on increasing in intensity slowly, until a
  stage is reached when,          owing to reduction of temperature of the most
  effective absorbing layer, the chief absorption will be that of carbon —
  a stage in which we now find the stars of Class III6 of Vogel's
   classification."

       t Note (added 1899). — Professor Rowland has since identified a considerable
   number of faint lines in the solar spectrum, on the more refrangible side of 4, with
   the constituents of the green carbon fluting ('Prelim. Table of Solar Spectrum
   Wave-lengths,' p. 90), and we thus have direct evidence of the presence in the
   solar spectrum of the band which is perhaps the most characteristic feature of the
   I'iscian stars.

                       General Characteristics     of  the Spectra.
    The main features of the spectra are three broad dark flutings,
which fade off to the violet end of the spectrum.                   These, as is now
well known, coincide with the three principal bands in the spectrum
of high temperature*         carbon.
    The wave-lengths          of   the bands,     and     DuneVs    numbers,     are as
follows : —
                                                                      Hot carbon

            9                 516-3                 616-9                 516-4
           10                 472  7                472-9                473 -6
     The greatest discrepancy is in the case of band 10, and this is easily
explained when we consider the variation of the position of the maxi
mum intensity of the band to which I have previously drawn attention. \
At     different   temperatures      the position     of the brightest   part     of the
band changes, and in Angstrom's measure of the carbon fluting this
 was not taken into account.
     In addition to these principal bands, Duner mapped seven secondary
 bands.      In the Bakerian Lecture, I stated that " there is evidence that
 some of the absorption is produced            by substances which remain in the
 atmosphere during          the   next  stage, that of Group VII (dark bodies).
 This probability is based upon the fact that some of the bands are
 apparently coincident         with bands in the telluric spectrum         as mapped
 by Brewster, Angstrom,           Smyth, and others."§
    • Ab in former papers, the term "high temperature," a9 used here, is only
 relative, and refers to the spectrum of carbon which is seen in the electric are,
 Bnnsen burner, or vacuum tube under certain conditions. The spectrum of carbon
 at a still higher temperature consists of lines.

       Note                — Although my subdivision of the group into species, made
    §        {added 1899;.
 ten years ago, is based in part upon the secondary bands, it is not materially affected
 by the new information as to the nature of these bands, since, as cooling goes on,
 low temperature metallic lines would become more prominent relatively, just as we
 might have expected the secondary bands to become stronger on the supposition
 that they had the same origin as the telluric bands.

                          Specific differences  in  the Spectra.
    In considering the question of variations of spectra with temperature
in   these stars, the importance of taking differences of magnitude into
account must not be lost sight of.
   A general examination of DuneYs observations indicates that there
are two marked        differences in the spectra of the different stars. (1)
Some of      them  give secondary bands, whilst in others they are absent.
(2) Some of them have longer continuous spectra than others, .is
                                             "
indicated by the number of " zones visible.
   If the continuous spectrum extends far enough                  towards      the violet,
the three dark flutings of carbon will divide the                spectrum into four
bright zones.       If it does not extend beyond the             most refrangible of
the flutings (A.473) only three zones will be visible,            and the continuous
spectrum will appear to end sharply at wave-length 473.                       In one case
it does not extend beyond the fluting at A.517, and then only two
zones are visible.
   These differences might evidently depend upon differences of mag
nitude of the stare concerned, but a detailed examination of the
observations shows that some of the differences do not depend upon
brightness.       If we consider the visibility of the secondary bands
according to DuneV, we have the following result : —

    This table shows that the visibility of the secondary bands is not
altogether dependent upon the magnitudes of the stars observed.
Thus the bands 2 and 3 are seen in some of the stars of the group as
low as magnitude 8*1, whilst they are absent from some of the stars of
the sixth magnitude.
    If we consider the question of the length of the continuous spectrum,
 we have the following result, the maximum number of zones referring
 to the longest continuous spectrum          : —

                                2                    8 0—9-0
    Here, again, the visibility of the zones does not depend altogether
upon the magnitude.            There are stars as bright as the sixth magni
tude which only give three zones, whilst some as low as 8-2 give four.
Dunér refers to this difference as follows :—
    " Puis   l'intensité    de la lumière      des   zones    brillantes  peut varier
considérablement chez les étoiles de la même grandeur.                      Dans les
étoiles d'un rouge foncé, la zone ultra-bleue est extrêmement faible en
comparaison avec la même zone dans les étoiles rouge jaune ; et chez
les étoiles faibles, cette zone est tout-à-fait invisible, et même la zone
bleue est très difficile à voir si elles sont très rouge."*
    Another important difference is the variation in the intensity of the
citron band of carbon (band 6) as compared with the other bands.
Dunér also refers to this point              (p.  10) as follows :
                                                                     — " Mais aussi la
bande principale       à la longueur d'onde 563 est d'une opacité très variée.
Chez certaines étoiles, elle est presque aussi foncée que les deux
autres bandes principales ; mais dans certains spectres elle est assez
faible, et semble,      probablement        à cause de    cela, être beaucoup moins
large   que les bandes aux longueurs             d'onde 516 et 473.       Celles-ci, et
surtout la première d'entre            elles, sont toujours très fortes et très
larges, et forment le caractère le plus prononcé de ces spectres." A
discussion of the observations shows that this variation is independent
of the magnitudes of the stars.
    Thus we find that the band is dark in some stars with magnitudes
varying from 5-4 to 8'0. It is interesting to note that this band, as I
have shown, is also the one most subject to variations in the spectra
of comets,   t
    It thus appears that there are distinct differences in the spectra,
quite independent of the difficulties in recording the details.
    It will be clear that the stars with the longest spectra, characterised
by four
           " zones," must be placed above those with shorter spectra on
the temperature curve. As none of the stars, however, show more
than four zones and only one less than three, this alone does not dis
 criminate sufficiently between the different species, and we have there
 fore to look to the variations in the carbon flutings and secondary
 bands for finer sub-division.

   In the last stages of all, before final extinction, the stars will be so
feeble that the details of their spectra cannot be recorded ; so that the
expected phenomena, on following out continuity of changes, cannot
be checked by direct observation.           The sequence of changes which we
should expect to occur would be          : —
   (1) The gradual darkening of the carbon (lutings and subsequent
            paling as the continuous spectrum becomes weaker.
   (2) The gradual fading out of those solar lines which do not persist
            as low as flame temperature.
   (3) The gradual increase in the intensity of absorption lines or
            bands representative of low temperature.

                               employs  two  methods   of indicating the
colours of the stars, which he has specially observed — first, by means of
initial letters, and second, by means of numbers, such that 10 = blood
red.      Thus   :

   Of the fifty-five      stars in DuneVs        list, ten exhibit fluctuations    in
brilliancy.
   On the whole the light changes are not so great as in the stars of
Group II, and the periods tend to greater length.
   As to the cause of variability, the increase of light at maximum
may be due, as I suggested in 1890,* to the light added by bodies
of a cometary character when they reach periastron, the increase of
luminosity being produced by tidal action, as in the case of comets in
our    own solar system. If there be any truth in this idea, it seems
probable that the added light of the comet at maximum, which woidd
give a spectrum consisting of bright carbon flutings, would produce a
paling of the carbon absorption flutings.
    As in the variables of the Antarian group, which are uncondensed
swarms, and where, on the meteoritic hypothesis, the increased light
 at maximum is produced by the collision of a revolving swarm at
 periastron, irregularity is a natural consequence of the revolution of
 more than one secondary body.

                                 Recent Observations.
    The Kensington observations were made chiefly during 1894 and
 1895,   with special reference to the lines involved.             The stars selected
 for observation were 132 Schjellerup, 152 Schjellerup, 115 Schjellerup,
 and 19 Piscium.       The 3-foot reflector was used.             In addition to the
 carbon bands, numerous lines were seen without much difficulty, but
 only the more prominent ones could be satisfactorily measured.
 Among the lines recorded in 132 Schj. were KB, the E line of iron at
 5269, and a group of lines near A. 5380. In 115 Schjellerup addi
 tional lines were measured near 5005, 5762, and 5429, and the presence
 of Hj8 was again determined by comparison with a hydrogen vacuum
 tube.    In 19 Piscium     numerous lines were observed, among them being
 D and F.       No suspicion of bright lines was entertained during these
 observations.     Attempts to photograph the spectra were not sufficiently
 successful  to  help matters.
   'In 1898, Dr. McClean published photographs of the spectra of
 19 Piscium and 152 Schjellerup,t showing that these stars have a line
 spectrum     similar   to a Tauri, in addition          to the well-marked     bands

of   carbon.      This was the information wanted, but more recently
Professor Hale has published photographs of the spectra of 280 Schj.,
273 Schj. (19 Piscium), 132 Schj. (U Hydne), and 152 Schj., taken
with the aid of the Yerke's telescope at Chicago, and showing a wealth
of fine detail.*        The dark line spectrum is very marked, and the
details of the carbon bands themselves are clearly revealed. Besides
these, there are certain bright places in the spectrum which Professor
Hale has been led to believe are true bright lines, and he mentions that
Professor Keeler has arrived at the same conclusion                 as a result of his
observations with the       Lick refractor.
   Duner      appears to have continued his observations of this group of
stars after his removal from Lund to Upsala, and he states that with
the Upsala refractor        he was able      to see more detail, and could detect
without difficulty bright lines in the spectra of various stars of the
group,   t
                            The Question    of Bright Lints.
   As I have already pointed out, Professors Hale, Keeler, and Duner
consider that there are bright lines in some of these spectra, but I
must confess that the published photographs do not convince me upon
this point.      In the plate which accompanies Professor Hale's paper of
 April, 1899,f the spectra of four stars are shown, namely, 280 Schj.,
273 Schj., 132 Schj., and 152 Schj.               A study of these photographs
shows that the supposed bright lines are involved in the carbon ab
sorption bands in the yellow green, and occur where there is reduced
absorption, on the less refrangible sides of the dark flutings.
   This at once led me to suppose that they could not be real bright
lines, but simply places in the continuous spectrum where there is least
absorption. These supposed bright lines are most marked in 152 Schj.,
and there is no suggestion of them in 280 Schj., while I think few
 would be disposed to suggest their presence in 273 Schj. and 132 Schj.
without having 152 Schj. as a guide. Nevertheless, in these inter
mediate stars there are certainly bright places corresponding in posi
tion with the "bright lines" in 152 Schj., the principal one being at
 X 5592.      So far as appearances go, the greater apparent intensity of
the bright line in 152 Schj. appears to be due to the introduction of a
strong absorption line on the less refrangible side.
    In another paper§ Professor Hale reproduces photographs of 152
 Schj. in which the contrast has been increased by photographic means,
 so that the whole spectrum appears to consist of bright lines, rather
 than dark ones.

  In favour of the real existence of bright lines, Professor Hale points
out that the contrast between the line and the continuous spectrum
increased rather than diminished                        when dispersion was increased, and
that there was no decrease                   in contrast    as the slit was widened.   The
question, however, is so complicated by the presence of the carbon
fluting and other absorptions, that I shall not follow Professor Hale in
his definite conclusions as to bright lines upon these grounds.
   Before we can admit the certain presence of bright lines in 152
Schj., we must consider whether similar appearances occur in other
stars  where bright lines have not been previously suspected. As a
matter of fact, in the photographic spectra of a Tauri, /? Andromeda,
and aOrionis, which I published in 1893,* the spectra might, so far as
mere appearance goes, be regarded as containing both bright and dark
lines, some of the bright spaces between obvious dark lines being very
conspicuous ; the same remark applies in a less degree to the spectrum
of Arcturus which I published at the same time. But we find a com
plete explanation of these spectra if we regard them as consisting of
dark lines, whereas if we take the bright spaces we cannot match them
at all. We do not hesitate in these cases to treat the spectra as
consisting of dark lines only, the apparent bright lines being simply
spaces between dark ones.      I find that practically in all dark line
spectra where the lines are from some cause or other thick, the inter
vals between them are apt to appear as bright lines, and this bright
ness can readily be intensified by purely photographic processes.
     I
     have accordingly thought it unnecessary to modify the division
into species on account of the supposed presence in some of them of
bright lines. If the presence of bright lines be eventually established,
may they not indicate that we are observing the effects of volcanic

  The photographs taken by McClean and Hale have now sufficiently
shown that there is much in common between the line spectra of the
Antarian and Piscian stars. This indicates that there is a practical
equality of mean temperature in the reversing layers of the two groups,
but we find a very great difference in the conditions as to carbon ;
while carbon is undoubtedly absorbing in the Piscian stars, it is cer
tainly not absorbing in the Antarian, and there is in fact strong
evidence that it is radiating.!
   We cannot imagine different kinds of stars of the same temperature
as representing the same stage in any evolutionary scheme, so that the

separation of the two groups which            I   suggested in 1887 is fully
justified by the recent work to which           I  have referred.   By putting
the two groups on the same level of temperature, but on opposite sides
of the temperature curve, as in the evolutionary order forming              part
of the meteoritic hypothesis, the differences are fully explained.
   It will   be seen  that this work carries us a step beyond that with
which    I  have recently been engaged in connection with the hotter
stars.
                               General Conclusions.
   (1) The undoubted presence of dark carbon flutings in the solar
spectrum, including that near b, and of solar lines in the Piscian stars,
indicates that the Piscian stars are next in order of development to the
Arcturian stars.
   (2) The stars observed by Dune> may be divided into seven species,
beginning with the hottest and ending with the coolest stars.
   (3) The reported presence of bright lines in the Piscian stars must
be received with caution, as similar evidence of bright lines might be
adduced in the case of other classes of stars in which the spectrum is
fully explained by dark lines alone.
   (4) The redness of the stars increases as we pass from the earlier to
the later species of the group.
   (5) The variability in this group is less marked than in the Anta-
rian stars, and may perhaps be accounted for by the revolution of
secondary bodies of the nature of comets round the stars themselves.
   (6) The place on the temperature curve assigned to these stars on
the meteoritic hypothesis is fully confirmed by the more detailed
inquiry, and the hypothesis is thereby strengthened.
   I am indebted     to Mr. Fowler for assistance      in the determination   of
the   species  and the construction of the map ten years ago, and for
additional    assistance  in discussing the recent work.        I have also to
express my thanks to Mr. Shackleton for a detailed examination of the
recent photographs.

guishing between three diverse types of heredity, namely (i), Blended
Inheritance, (ii) Exclusive Inheritance, and (iii) Particulate Inherit
ance.
   In   a memoir  printed in vol. 62, pp. 386 — 412 of the ' Proceedings,'
I have dealt at length with the theory of blended inheritance, general
ising for this purpose Mr. Galton's Law of Ancestral Heredity.
   Allowing for a certain degree of variation in the constant y, or
" coefficient of            there discussed, I consider that this
                heredity,"                                         theory
gives a fairly good first approximation to the facts hitherto observed in
this field. But blended inheritance certainly does not cover the whole
field of heredity.   When a character blends, then this law of ancestral
heredity tells us the most probable blend for the offspring of given
ancestry.    It shows us the offspring of exceptional parents regressing
towards mediocrity, owing to the fact that without stringent selec
tion the great bulk of their ancestry must be mediocre and not
exceptional.*  Thus the main feature of the law of ancestral heredity
is regression.   Such regression is not what most biologists would un
derstand by reversion.     In fact, when the inheritance from a variety of
ancestry is blended, the idea of reversion becomes very obscure ; I venture
to think meaningless.
  Let      us supposestature a blended character, then the array of off
spring of a definite short statured ancestry will have a mean regressing
(here progressing) towards the population mean and a definite vari
ability.  Hence the theory of chance enables us at once to determine
the frequency of a very tall man born of such short ancestry.      The
frequency may  be small, but sooner or later the  tall man will appear.
Now let us suppose one distant ancestor in the otherwise short ancestry
to have been tall.       Clearly his existence will hardly affect at all the
mean of the array of offspring.
  He will not materially influence                 of a very tall man
                                             the chance
appearing among the offspring ; yet a superficial observer might easily
describe the appearance of the very tall man as a case of reversion to
the distant tall ancestor.  The absurdity of this attribution is mani
fest when we remember that persons like him would have had sensibly
equal frequency with or without the distant tall ancestor.      In fact,
it seems to me that in the case of characters which continuously
vary, and which blend their inheritance, it is hopeless to look for any
evidence whatever of reversion.         The term     is,   then, meaningless.
  To find reversion     we must investigate cases     in which characters do not
blend, i.e., the individual takes exclusively after some one member of the
ancestry.     In this case the appreciation of reversion becomes possible

common. Thus, Mr. Gal ton writes in his Natural Inheritance '(p. 139) :
" Parents of different statures usually transmit a blended heritage to
their children, but parents of different eye-colours usually transmit an
alternative horitage                              .if
                                           one parent has a light eye-
colour and the other a dark eye-colour, some of the children will, as a
rule, be light and the rest dark ; they will seldom be medium eye-
coloured like the children of medium eye-coloured parents."
                          "
  Again, in his paper on Basset Hounds,"* Mr. Galton classifies these
hounds as tricolour (T) and non-tricolour (N), remarking, " I am assured
that transitional    cases between     T    and   N are very rare, and that experts
would       hardly ever disagree about the          class   to which    any particular
hound should be assigned."  In other words, Mr. Galton appears to
assume exclusive inheritance.t  Roughly, in such exclusive inherit
ance, the offspring takes after      one or other parent, or reverts to move
distant ancestry.   It       becomes  accordingly somewhat difficult to see
how the law of ancestral heredity, which applies to blended inherit
ance, can be transferred to this different field. Yet Mr. Galton in his
'Natural Inheritance' (p. 153) writes:                  "The broad conclusion to
which   the present results irresistibly lead, is that the same peculiar
hereditary relation that was shown to subsist between a man and each
of his ancestors in respect to the quality of stature, also subsists in
respect to that of eye-colour."      Further, in the paper on Basset
Hounds, he actually endeavours to demonstrate the truth of the law
on the exclusive colour of these hounds. Now                  I
                                                think we must keep
these two matters quite apart.      The average stature of an individual
is a blend of all his progenitors' characters ; even in a single individual
we find contributions     from many ancestors ; this is not the case
with an exclusive inheritance, and it does not accordingly seem to me
              " the same
possible that             peculiar hereditary relation that was shown
                                                        "
to subsist between a man and each of his ancestors        for a blended
character can also hold for an exclusive character.
   It is no longer of the proportions of a character in one individual
that we speak, but of the frequency of various types of individuals
among the total offspring of a given ancestry. The one statement is a
law of blending characters, and the other is a law of distributing the
exclusive characters among a group of individuals.   In the first case
we deal with regression, in the second with reversion.      What Mr.
Galton really      asserts that the proportions of reversion in an array
                             is,
of offspring are identical with the proportions of blend in the average

   Now want to draw attention to one or two points here. 1/4

not be all the children like, say, their father for out of the 1/4 N      ;
who are like members of his ancestry, those who are like ancestors
like him — and these ancestors will occur in certain proportions — will
thus also be like him. This holds for each individual ancestor the                                     ;
number like any ancestor will be considerably greater than the number
              "

                                                If
of character as we find in the general population, then undoubtedly
some woidd have the same quantity or quality of the character as he
has — some, for instance, would be blue-eyed    he were blue-eyed — but
                                                                     if
this   israndom likeness and not like in the special sense in which we

 coefficients to be expected between offspring and parent, grandparent,
       nth great parent, &c. Here we have assumed equal potency for
 both sexes and all lines of descent, otherwise these coefficients must be
 looked upon as mean values of the correlations      for different genera
 tions of ancestry.
       Lastly, it       seems to me that reversion may not be the proper word to
 apply to those who directly follow their parents, and that these may
 be fairly considered direct inheritors and distinguished from reverters.
 I shall accordingly assume no it priori relation between these two
        certainly not that direct inheritors and reverters are equally
 classes,
 numerous, i.e., $ and    as in Mr. Galton's Law.     As for reversion
 itself      I   will only suppose it to diminish in geometrical progression                                         as
 we  step backward to more and more distant ancestry.          I shall
 accordingly take /3N offspring to follow either parent and yaN, ya2N,
 yasN, '&c, to follow grandparent, great grandparent, great great
 grandparent, &c. With these preliminaries arranged we can now pro
 ceed       with the analysis.

Now consider how the number of offspring " like or absolutely corre

also there will be yaN like each of the parent's parents, and the parent
will be like one or other of the parent's parents in p\ proportion of cases                                          ;

   (4) Comparison with Law of Ancestral Heredity.
                                                             — Now let us compare
these results with those I have obtained from the law of ancestral
heredity.* On p. 390 of the memoir on that subject we have for the
nth midparental     correlation with the offspring pn = 2*nr„, where rn is
the correlation of the offspring with the individual ?ith great grand
parent.     By p. 394 pn = ca". Hence
                                        =
                                   r„       c(z/J2)»
or the correlations of the offspring with the ancestry follow                a simple
geometrical progression.
   Comparing this with the result (xii) of this paper, or
                              r.  =
                                      0-c)(i)n       + <« +   /?-i)n              (xii)
where c is now a different constant, we see that the two cannot possibly
be in agreement, unless one of the terms of the latter result vanishes.
Thus there is in general a fundamental difference between the law of
ancestral heredity and the law of reversion ; they give expressions
differing in character for the correlations between the offspring and
individual ancestors. Let us see when the two laws will agree. There
is unfortunately a bad slip in my memoir of 1898.                   The series at the
top of p. 403 leads to
      y07(l-/J')    =   1   and not as there given             y^l-y/?)      = 1.
 Thus we have        P{l+y)      -   1     or        =
                                                         1/(1 + 7).

    This shows     us that   the correlation with the individual ancestor is
halved at each backward               in the pedigree. We see at once that
                                    step
(xii) can   only be in          agreement with (xxiv) — the letter c being
different in the two, and merely standing for a constant — provided
a + {} =    or by (i), provided y —       Thus the condition that blended

lations with the ancestry      that reversion should form series starting

with the actual parent.           this condition should hold, then, for
                                     If
example, the grandparental correlation must always be one-half the
parental either for blended or for exclusive inheritance.

        (6) Difficulties arising when                  we
    — Now the above table shows    us that by varying y sufficiently we can
    obtain a considerable range of values for the correlation of characters
    in kindred. But these values are limited by two serious considerations,
     namely          :   —
          (i)The ancestral correlation   halved at each stage.
                                                            is
        (ii) The  fraternal  correlation appears to become perfect as                                                    we
               approach the upper limit of parental correlation, i.e., 0-5.
      Now actual determinations of grandparental correlation in the cases
    of eye-colour in man, of coat-colour in horses, and of coat-colour in
    hounds,            have recently made, do not as
                         which    I                      rule seem to                           a
    justify the statement that the grandparental half the parental cor          is
    relation.   Further, in two of these cases, the average parental
    correlation              is   quite 0*5, but the fraternal correlation                       is,   while larger
    than 0-4, still               a  good deal short of perfect.    Hence                      I     am bound    to
    conclude that              :  —
           (i)These characters do not obey the laws of blended inheritance as
                deduced from the law of ancestral heredity    or,                           ;
         (ii) The  laws   of blended  inheritance, as deduced from   the law of
                ancestral heredity, would be largely modified     we considered                 if

        (iii) The fundamental assumption that                             if    all the midparents right
                         away back had the same amount of the character, the average
                         offspring would have also the same amount,    not justified.           is

     It
     is quite possible that eye-colour in man and coat-colour in hounds
are exclusive and not blended inheritances, so that        would cover         (i)

natural      selection,    or    to       improved physical or organic environ

we cannot get     parental correlation as high as the value 0-5, which

Mr. Galton's view, i.e., that the likeness to the parent    the beginning,                                 is

   1   - 2(a +      /3)   =    0,        or   S     =       0.     Thus by (xviii)
                                                                 Pi =       2p2,

Thus  as soon as we know p\, we can find all the ancestral correlations
and the wholo series of reversions.     For example       p\ = 0*4 we                                     :   if
should have p2   = 0-2,   =    and a2- 3-5 a + 0-5

and    =
       y   351 =0       Thus in this case 35 per cent, of the offspring
                               /3.
take after each parent, and 30 per cent, revert to higher ancestry.
Of this 30 per cent. 100 x 0"35 0-H9, or     23 per cent., revert to
                                                                   x                         5
each of the four grandparents, leaving  per cent., about, to revert to           9
great grandparents and higher ancestry still.
   (ii) Next suppose Mr. Galton's full view to be correct, and that 1/4
of the offspring follow each parent, 1/16 each grandparent, 1/64 each
great grandparent, and so on.   Then we have —

 y negative. . Accordingly we conclude that a =                       \   and fi =       while
 y  =    0.   Thus   reversion     is totally  excluded   and   one-half   the  offspring  take
 after each parent.           In this case the grandparental correlation, pi, is
 0'25, the great grandparental (H25, and so on.                      The ancestry beyond
 the parents have no direct influence on the offspring, beyond the fact
 that they have determined the parents.                     We are dealing indeed with
 a case like that investigated in my memoir on
                                                                  "
                                                                    Eegression, Heredity,
 and Panmixia."t              So far our theory of exclusive inheritance with
 parental      correlation     = 0-5 agrees with that of blended inheritance
 with the      same value of the parental correlation.                   But we have seen
 that the latter leads to an impossible value for fraternal correlation,
 i.e., one which does not fit the facts.                Does perfect fraternal correla
 tion     necessarily flow from exclusive inheritance without reversion 1
¦Certainly not, for this would connote that all the offspring of a given
 set of parents would be alike, or one parent in each family be abso
 lutely prepotent.          This is of course not the fact.
     Supposing       all families      to consist     of   n members,        and that     both
 parents were equipotent in the family, there would be                       2.

    * See   '
              Natural Inheritance,' chapter viii, p 149, ic. Mr. Galton there uses the
 correlation coefficients     corresponding to blended inheritance for eve-colour, an
 exclusive inheritance.       But, directly investigated, such values are far from holding
 for eye-colour.

  family is about 4-5 ; but if we confine ourselves to one sex, we must
  exclude all sterile marriages and all not leading to two brothers, or
  two sisters.     We might then very well take n = 6, which gives 0-4 for
  the fraternal correlation.        Thus we might expect in the case of exclu
  sive inheritance     that the fraternal correlation would lie between 0*4
  and   1,  according as to the degree of prepotency of one or other parent
  in the individual marriage.*
      Thus our theory of exclusive inheritance is not, like that of blended
  inheritance, incompatible with observed facts, i.e., high values of
  parental correlation and values substantially less than unity of the
  fraternal correlation.       But for such cases we must deny the existence
  of any regular and continuous law of reversion.                  We should have to
  look upon reversion, if it occurred at all,            as merely   an irregular and
  infrequent phenomenon.
     On the other hand, if we differentiate the taking after parents from
  the reversion to ancestry as phenomena of a quite distinct nature, our
  theory will enable us to surmount, for some cases at least, thoie
  difficulties in ancestral correlation, which arise when we take Mr.
  Galton'8 Law in its original form to cover both blended and exclusive
 inheritance.       I illustrate this from data for the coat-colour of Basset
  Hounds in the following section.
     (8) Application       to  Basset   Hounds. — Understanding          that  I   was
 desirous of testing        my theory on a character which was definitely
 exclusive, Mr. Galton, with his invariable kindness, at once placed at
 my disposal his material on Basset Hounds.                The reader will remember
 from the statements in Mr. Galton's own memoir (' Roy. Soc. Proc.,'
 vol. 61, p. 403) that these dwarf bloodhounds are either lemon and
 white, or black, lemon, and white          ;   and here, as in Mr. Galton's work,
 they will be classified as non-tricolour and tricolour, or by the symbols
 N and T. In dealing with the offspring               I   was in many cases unable
to determine the sex of the dog, as that information is not in the stud
book,t and all individuals         are not again recorded as sires or dams,
nor do they possess obviously male or female names.                      Thus in my
principal tables all the offspring of both sexes are clubbed together.
To measure the legitimacy of this,              I have formed separate tables of
the two sexes in the case of sires and dams.                Further, in dealing with
great grandparents         there  were  so    few  of  each  of the eight individual
types alone, that       I have formed merely one table, that of great grand
parent     and  offspring, disregarding the line of descent.
    * The mother and father    may be equipotent on the average, but in the individual
family one or other be markedly prepotent.             It is to this prepotency of the
individual, rejjardless of sex, that the increase of fraternal correlation beyond 0'4
 is very probably due.

    The extraction of eleven tables from Mr. Galton's data papers I owe
to Miss Alice Lee, D.Sc.         A twelfth is due to Mr. K. Tressler. For
the other three I am responsible.           Of the determinations of the corre
lation coefficients, I owe five to Miss Alice Lee, no less than six to
Mr. L. N. G. Filon, M.A., and the remaining four only are my own
work.      The method by which the correlation coefficients have                  been
calculated will be explained and justified in another memoir ; it                  is a
novel process, which we believe to be of considerable importance, and
which we have already applied to a variety of attributes not capable
of    exact quantitative measurement.              The probable error of this
method of determining the correlation has also been ascertained, and
may be taken in the present cases to range from 0*01 to 0*04, so that
differences which are significant can be appreciated.

     Now several noteworthy                     conclusions      follow at      once   from        these
numbers          :   —
                                       (1) Direct Inheritance.
  (a) The            clam has a great prepotency               in the matter of coat-colour.
Mr. Galton           has already remarked on              this.* We here see that, quantita
tively, the dam             is,
                   on the average of both sexes, thrice as highly corre
lated with the offspring as the sire. While she has reached the high
value 0-5, he has fallen below      and the theoretical value 0-3 of the
                                                0

unmodified               law of ancestral       heredity    is   neither     satisfactory        for the
individual           cases nor for    their average.
  (b) Offspring take more after the dam than the sire, but  offspring                  $
more than      after the sire, and
                     ?               offspring more than
                                                     ?     after the                   <$
dam. In other words, the parent hands down its characteristics more
strongly to its own than to the opposite sex.
      Curiously enough, the sire's parents seem to have more influence
      (c)
than the dam's.   In particular the dam's sire has, within the probable
error of our determinations, no influence at all. In the unchanging line
of descent, the dam's dam has more influence than the sire's sire, which
is what we should expect from (<t) but (a) also makes the male element
                                                     ;
of much less importance than the female, and so the dam's sire insig
nificant as compared with the sire's dam. The final result     thus to                      is
give   a    slight preponderance to the sire's over the dam's parents.
                                      (2) Collateral Inheritance.
  (a) The degree of resemblance between puppies of the same parents
isnot greater when they are of the same than when they are of differ
ent litters.
     Itis   clear, however, that we have only been able to find comparatively
few pairs of whole siblings        from different litters, and the difference
between 0*5084 and    5257        0        is   of the order of the probable error of the
differences.             With greater numbers, possibly          more sensible difference
                                                                  a
might be found for the correlation of siblings from the same and
different litters. At present there seems nothing to warrant the idea
that puppies from the same litter have the high degree of resemblance
which we find between twins in the case of mankind.
     (b) comparison of the correlations for half siblings ou the dam's

side and on the sire's side again emphasises, the breeding be straight

forward, the great prepotency of the dam in the matter of coat-colour.
The fact that we have upwards of five times                 pairs of halfas many
siblings on the sire's side as on the dam's side shows how large fashion                     a

possibly overworked sires lose some of their hereditary influence,
while not losing their power of fertilising the dam.*
      The great reduction in the degeee of fraternal correlation when
    (c)
we turn from whole to half siblings       very remarkable, and at any is                                    is,
rate for half siblings on the dam's side, not very explicable.
   Had we assumed the parental correlation to be 0*3507, and found
y from (xxvii), i.e. = 1*4722, we should have deduced from (xxviii)
for the fraternal correlation the value 5236, which  in fair accord     0                      is
ance      with the observed result for whole siblings.                             But, as we have seen,
(xxvii) and (xxviii) belong to                               a     theory which gives very poor values
for the grandparental and great-grandparental                                          correlations, i.e., 0*1753
and     0   0877, instead of 0*1326                              and 0*0402.           Further, we should on
that theory have expected the average correlation for half siblings
to be half the value above, since one-half of the common ancestry                                                            is
cut off, i.e., 0*2618, and not 0*1646,                                as   it    actually     is.       Thus the fra
ternal correlation does not appear to be in accord with the theory of
blended inheritance.    Its determination in the general case of exclu
sive inheritance with reversion seems    problem of considerable diffi a
culty, which in this case      rendered much greater by the immense
                                                    is
prepotency of the dam, so that    would seem very desirable to differ

                    two dozen mesalliances     can be palmed off as telegony, how
many alliances within the blood may be conveniently overlooked                                      ?

      Hence                   y = 0-019594,                               ft     =      0341279.
     This effectually shows                     us that   for this             case y cannot be taken equal
to    ft,   or the reversion series started from the parents.

     Such value again demonstrates that in this case the ancestral correla
             a
tion differs totally in form from what might be deduced from the
theory of blended inheritance, i.e., shows us how we must distinguish

 not be denied that the difference is of extreme biological interest.                In
 the foi-mer case we have a comparatively small total reversion widely
 spread ;    in  the latter      a   much   larger   total   reversion concentrated
 on   the  first   stages    of ancestry.     Which system       is  more accordant
 with facts    1  It  needs far wider observation        and experiment than are
 yet  available   to  settle  this.   So  far  we  can only say that the former
 case covers Mr. Galton's as a special sub-case, and that the data for
 Basset Hounds appear capable of treatment under the wider rule, but
 can only be fitted with some straining to the special case.                 Are there
 or are there not physiological reasons for supposing that resemblance
 to a parent arises from a different source from reversion to an ancestor 1
 Here    reversion to an ancestor must not be measured                   by cases of
resemblance to an ancestor, for a portion of this resemblance is due to
common likeness to the parent ; we must approach the matter from
the standpoint of cases in which the offspring inherits a character like
that of the grandparent or higher ancestor, and unlike that of the
parent.*       Current use of the term " reversion" at least justifies us for
the time being in not speaking of all inheritance, including likeness to
parents as reversion, and in our theory we may be permitted to dif
ferentiate parental and reversional inheritance of exclusive characters,
if  we find it needed by our numerical data.                Here, as elsewhere, we
sadly need a widely extended range of observation and experiment.
    (10) On the Variability of Basset Hounds liaeing regard to Sex and
Pedigree. — We have already indicated that our justification in applying
the methods of normal correlation to coat-colour is considered in
another memoir.          We merely suppose at present that there               is some
variable, following approximately the law of normal variation, on which
the coat-colour can be thrown back. This being so, let h in terms of
this variable be the distance of its mean value from the division line
between tricolour and non-tricolour,            and let   o- be the standard devia
tion of this variable for the          same group.     Then if    \  = hj<r, we easily
deduce by aid of tables of the probability integral                from the correla
tion tables in § 8 the following results : —
   * Of C and D brown-eycd parents, A and B, the offspring, have respectively
brown and blue eyes. Is the process by which B gets the blue eyes of his grand
father or great grandfather qualitatively different from that by which A gets the
brown eyes of his parents ?         The problem can hardly be answered at present,
but I see no a priori reason for a negative.

   Now, if there were no secular change due to artificial or other selec
tion, h would remain the same in each generation, and therefore
<t = hjx would  give a proper measure of the variability due to sex
or to relative  position in ancestry.      The table at once suggests a
number of interesting points, which I proceed to note.
  («¦) Turning first to the offspring, as given in the second column, we
observe that the dogs with the longest pedigree have the largest x-
We have, in fact, the values of 1/x for pedigrees stretching to great
grandparents, grandparents, parents, and merely to brethren, respec
tively,    as
                                1-517     :   2-064   :   2-550     :   3-221,
or, roughly, we have a geometrical series with the ratio of about l-3.
   Now this result may be reached in more than one way, either                                    (i)
decreasing    or (ii) increasing cr. Increase of
                    h,                            would signify that, for   h
the longer pedigree, the mean of the quantity on which the coat-colour
depends    being thrust further into the tricolour section decrease of <r
               is                                                                    ;
would signify greater concentration in the tricolour section within
which the mean lies. Whether the longer pedigree signifies the more
modern hounds, or the more careful preservation of ancestors' names in
the more fashionable hounds, we reach practically the same conclusion                              :

the female offspring.   As very often only one or two puppies out of                              a

tion, which is more stringent for the males than the females, appears
to be, theoretically at least, a mistake when we remember that the
potency of the female is thrice that of the male in coat-colour.
  Within the groups of grandoffspring and siblings the differences are
hardly significant enough for special conclusions to be drawn.
  (i) Turning next to the parental groups, we see that      the sires and     (i)
dams,   neither of which        can   be   considered         to form     a more modern
group than the other, have yet remarkably different values of x, that
for the sire being about seven times as great as that for the dam. The
sires are thus far more stringently selected than the dams, and    great            a
deal of this difference must undoubtedly be due to the lesser variability
of the sires.   Here again the breeders,   they are selecting at all for
                                                if
coat-colour, would appear, at least theoretically,    to be in error,
(ii) Grandsires, and
                   <J     appear to be less variable than the sires,
                            ? ,
and granddams,     and
                   £         less variable than the dams.
                                ? ,                         This may
be due to the original paucity of the breed, or be an instance of the
general rule to which   have elsewhere referred, i.e., that parents are
                        I                                                                     a
selection out of the general population, and so less variable than their
offspring.
   (c) But this rule meets with    remarkable exception in the case of
                                       a

spring, and very significantly so. An examination of dam and female
offspring shows that the   offspring have
                              ?             value of a    double as great x
as that of their dams.  With few original dams,        difficult to under
                                                                it   is
stand how they could be more variable than their offspring.      Consider
ing the great prepotency of the dam,         difficult to attribute this
                                                it   is
increase of   xentirely to the action of the less variable sire   one               ;         is
more or less forced to believe that there          process of stringent
                                                          is   a
selection of the offspring which are entered on the record going on,
and that thus a group of dams possibly fairly variable, and with                              a
not very marked     tendency to melanism,     represented in the next

stringent selection of sires may have contributed, but can hardly be
the sole source of this change.
  A   further conclusion      worth noting
                                is            Parents, whether male or

they have female offspring.
    (10) General Results.
    (a) The laws hitherto  propounded for blended inheritance do not
appear  to  cover the cases of exclusive inheritance, e.g., such cases as
eye-colour in man, coat-colour in horses or hounds, &c.
  (b) The law of ancestral heredity
                                      must be distinguished from      law               a
of reversion.     Neither    seem to   fit the facts     if   we adopt the amounts of
heritage,    {,         &c, from parent, grandparent, great grandparent,
&c, originally taken    as   a   first approximation          by Mr. Galton.

one-half that of an (n             -

follow if reversion were started from the parent.)
   (d) Testing theory by the case of Basset Hounds, we find much
difficulty, owing partly to the great prepotency of the dam, and partly
to the large amount of artificial selection which is evidenced at every
turn, and obscures what may be termed the natural laws of inheritance.

A. — Thermo-electric        difference   between   free wires and wires previously
           subjected    to  longitudinal    extension    and lateral compression, by
           drawing them through       the holes of a  draw-plate (§§  1 — 7).
    §1. In Part       I  of this paper, read to the Society on 2nd February,
1899, the object of the experiments was stated to be the determina
tion of the magnitude of the thermo-electric effects, obtained from
any one metal strained and unstrained.                  The results then given were
obtained from two wires of the same material, one wire being pre
viously drawn through a draw-plate, so as to reduce it in size from

166                  Dr. M. Maclean.         On the Effects     of
ments to measure the thermo-electric effect is shown diagrammatically
in fig. 1. One junction of the wires was kept in a glycerine bath
which could be heated by a Bunsen burner.                This junction was tied
by a fine copper wire        to  the   bulb  of  a  thermometer T. The other
ends of the wires were joined          to short copper wires, which served as
terminals   of  the  low  resistance   galvanometer used in the experiments.
These junctions were wrapped in paraffin paper or cotton wool, which
contained the bulb of a thermometer T' reading half degrees from
0° C. to 25° C.      A paper screen S was hanging vertically between the
Bunsen burner and the thermometer             T   and the galvanometer, to pre
vent any heat from the flame reaching the rest of the circuit by
radiation.     These precautions were taken to make certain that all
junctions,   except the hot junction, would be at the same temperature.
The sensitiveness of the galvanometer was 0-09 mikroampere per
division, and as its resistance was 15 ohms, the electromotive force at
its terminals was 0-135 mikrovolt per scale division.
    § 2. The metals for which results were given in Part              I  were copper
(six  specimens),   lead  (two  specimens),   platinoid, gennan     silver, reostene,
and manganin.*
    The present paper gives the results of similar experiments made on
specimens of commercialt and pure lead, obtained from Messrs.
Johnson and Matthey ; and specimens of annealed steel, of aluminium
and of nickel.
    § 3. The method of experimenting was to take a piece of the wire and
draw it through a few holes of a draw-plate, so as to reduce its cross
sectional area to about a quarter.          Then two pieces of the wire, one
drawn and one undrawn, each 60 cm. long, were joined as in fig. 1.
The glycerine bath was very slowly heated by the Bunsen burner.
When there was a rise of temperature of 5° C. the Bunsen burner was
drawn slightly aside, so as to give as much heat to the glycerine bath
as it lost by radiation.      When both the thermometer reading and the
spot of light on the scale were seen to be steady, the readings were
noted.     The circuit was then broken and readings taken of the gal
vanometer zero and the thermometer T. The circuit was again com-

 B. — Thermo-electric   difference     between     free wires and wires previously
           permanently   elongated by     longitudinal stresses (§§ 8 — 10).
    § 8. Attempts were now made to determine the thermo-electric
 difference between free wires and wires previously permanently elon
gated by a longitudinal stress.            It was found difficult to elongate the
hard wires permanently to any appreciable extent before they broke.
Several methods for stretching the wires were tried, and the method
finally adopted, was to take two pieces of stout copper rod, bent into
the shapes      shown at   A   and    B in     fig. 2, and   to wind the wire to be
                                          Fig.  2.
stretched several times round         A   and B.      The end   A  was clamped in a
fixed vice and the end        B fixed in the clamp of          a screw arrangement.
By turning the 6crew the wire was stretched tight. Two ink marks
were then put on the wire at C and D 60 cm. apart. The screw was very
slowly turned, and the distance between C and D measured until the
necessary elongation was produced or until the wire broke.                 The wire
generally broke where       it lay tangentially to either rod A or B.
   § 9.   The greatest percentage permanent elongation that cotdd by
this method       be got in hard drawn copper, manganin, nickel, and
German silver, was 0 7, 0 5, 0 7, and 0-5 respectively.                The thermo
electric difference between the stretched and the unstretched wires was
then determined, as described in § 3, and the results are given in
Table    IV.

from stretched to unstretched through the hot junction for other three
specimens.        The probable explanation of           these results is suggested        in

ticity.  AB  is a brass tube through which steam from a kettle is allowed
to pass. The wire under test is wound round this brass tube three times,
and then round a small brass tube in the triangular frame below, and
then to one of the terminals of the galvanometer.         The wire is thus
quite continuous, from one terminal of the galvanometer to the other
terminal.   Some cotton wool is loosely packed at the hot junction of
the wire to ensure that the temperature of the wire is at steam tem
perature.   The weight of the triangular frame (two sides wood and
                                   Fis. 3.
one side brass    tube) with its hook for hanging weights on was 220
grammes.      This is the smallest weight used for each wiro, every
one of which was about No. 30 S.W.G. (diameter, 0*0315 cm.). The
object of the small brass tube in the triangular frame was to keep
the temperature of the cold junction at any determined temperature by
allowing water or other fluid to flow through it. In all the experi
ments hitherto made, the temperature of the cold junction was taken as
the temperature of the air at the time of each observation.
                                                          —
   § 12. The experiments were performed as follows : The wire was
put into the circuit, as shown in fig. 3. After steam was allowed to
pass through the tube for some time, the galvanometer reading and the
air temperature were taken.       The circuit was then broken, and the
metallic zero of the galvanometer was noted. The circuit was made,
and a weight was added on to the hook of the triangular frame. Three
readings of the galvanometer were now taken : (1) with the weight on,
(2) with the weight off, and (3) with the circuit broken.        A heavier
weight was hung on, and other three readings taken, and so on to tho
heaviest weight used in the experiments.
   § 13. The readings of the galvanometer were in the same direction

  172                  Dr. M. Maclean.     On the Effects  of
 for all  the wires tried with weights on and off, except for soft copper
 and iron.       The greatest permanent elongation produced in any of the
 hard copper wires experimented on was CH7 per cent., and for this
 permanent elongation the reading on the galvanometer was in the same
 direction for weights off and on, though always greater for the latter.
     § 14. For the soft copper wire (Table IX below) the readings were in
 the same direction for weights on and off, up to a permanent elongation
 of 1 per cent.        After a permanent elongation of 4-72 per cent., the
 current with weight on was 0-00103 mikroampere per degree from
 stretched to unstretched through the hot junction, while with the weight
 off,  the current was 0-00075     mikroampere per degree from unstretched
 to stretched through the hot junction.
     For iron wire the current was in the same direction for weights on
 and off, up to a permanent elongation of 0*35 per cent. ; but after a
 permanent elongation of 3-41 per cent, the current with weight on was
0-00461     mikroampere per degree from unstretched to stretched through
the hot junction, and with weight off, 0 0069 mikroampere per degree
 from stretched to unstretched through the hot junction.

    § 15. In Mathematical and Physical Papers,' vol. 2, p. 270, § 109,
 Kelvin says :— "     I have thus arrived at the remarkable conclusion tha
 when a permanent elongation is left after the withdrawal of a longi
tudinal force which has been applied to an iron or copper wire, the
residual thermo-electric effect is the reverse of the thermo-electric effect
which is induced by the force, and which subsists as long as the force
acts."
     It seems (1) that for small longitudinal strain in copper or in iron
 the direction of the current through the hot   junction  is the same, whether
 the force which      produced the permanent strain is on or off, (2) that
as the permanent         elongation is increased by increased longitudinal
forces, a stage is reached which gives zero current when the forces are
removed, and (3) that for greater longitudinal forces and permanent
elongations the direction of the current is opposite, with the pulling
forces off and on. It seems, in fact, that the permanent elongation must
exceed a definite limit, to produce reverse thermo-electric effects with
the longitudinal force on and removed.        I hope to further investigate
this point and to report the results to the Society.
    § 16. The galvanometer used for the investigation of these temporary
and permanent strains was one of the Kelvin recorder pattern, namely,
a movable       coil between the poles of a strong permanent magnet of
circular form.       The coil had 81 turns and a resistance 14 94 ohms at
17°-5 C.     Its constant was determined in the usual way, and found to
be 0 029 mikroampere per division of the scale.
    § 17. To find the stress-strain diagram, experiments were performed
on a specimen of each wire, in the following manner.            Two pieces of
the wire were passed through two small holes in a metal plate, and

             Strain on  the Tliermo-electric   Qualities  of Metals.        173
soldered at the back of the plate.       This plate was fixed to a horizontal
support   at  a convenient height.   One   of the wires had a half millimetre
 i         1         1       1         1        I          I         1       I*
scale near    its lower end, and a weight hanging       on   it to keep the wire
straight.    The other wire had a scale pan and a pointer in the manner
generally    used in laboratories   for finding the Young's modulus of

174                  Dr. M. Maclean.       On the Effects   of
materials.     By putting weights into the scale pan, and taking them
out, and noting the readings of the pointer on the scale, the temporary
and permanent elongation in the wire for different weights were found.
The numbers are given in the second and third columns of Tables V
to   XIV. The currents in the fourth columns are calculated from the
deflections of the galvanometer when the stated weights are on the
wire, and the thermo-electric differences in the fifth column are found
by multiplying the currents in the fourth column by the total resistance
in the circuit in each case.
    § 18.   The numbers in the tables are plotted in curves with percentage
permanent      elongation as abscissae, and thermo-electric differences as
ordinates.     The thermo-electric difference between free platinoid and
strained platinoid, rises rapidly with the permanent elongation of the
strained wire.      For manganin and lead, both commercial and pure, it is
very nearly constant up to a permanent elongation of           \ per cent.

   Cases    of monochromatic        vision   are    rare, and    I  have thought it
right to put on record one which was kindly brought me some time
ago by Mr. Parker. The patient, whom we will call K. B., was aged
twenty-five at the time when          I   examined him for colour vision.          The
notes of his case are as follows        : — Vision always defective      ; has  always
been    colour blind.       Has quick horizontal nystagmus ; probably an
absolute central scotoma. He is always " day blind." His vision for
right and left eyes is 6/60. He is not night blind.                     His fields are
nearly, but not quite, fidl for white.           He shows no definite changes in
his eyes.
    I took his luminosity curve, and all colours he matched with white
 with the same facility as if they were white. The following table

 of reference a previous case, which has already appeared in the ' Pro

 these curves are shown, together with the curve of luminosity for the
 normal eye. As regards the first two, it will be seen that the maximum
 of each curve is about scale number 40, or close to E. On the right-
 hand side of the maximum the curves do not absolutely agree.                     K.B.'s
 observations were first made in the red and green, and his readings
 at first were not very close, and a mean had to be taken.                       As the
 colours he had measured went towards the blue his measures were
 much more accordant,         as he had become accustomed to the methods

 from that of P is probably due to his colouring matter in the yellow
 spot. Attention must be again called to the fact that these curves arc
 practically identical    with   those   obtained by the normal eye when it
 measures    a spectrum      of very feeble luminosity, and also agree with
the results obtained by measuring          the diminution of each ray when it
first becomes    invisible,   and making a curve of the reciprocals of the
numbers, taking the highest point of it as 100.               This is clearly shown
in Part   III, " Colour

 liquid air (-  183° C. to      -  192° C).      The results were equally nega
 tive in the recent experiments of Sir W. Thiselton-Dyer,* in which
seeds survived exposure for upwards of six hours to the temperature
of liquid hydrogen (       - 250° C. to     -  252° C).
    The following investigation on          the   influence of the temperature of
 liquid air on bacteria, was carried out at the suggestion of Sir James
 Crichton Browne and Professor Dewar.                 The necessary facilities were
 most kindly given at the Royal Institution.                 The experiments were
 conducted under the personal supervision of Professor Dewar, and he
 has asked me to put the results on record, although it must be
 acknowledged that the essential features of the investigation aro due
 to him.
    The bacteria employed were selected from the stock of the Jenner
Institute of Preventive Medicine, where the results were also con
trolled. Pure cultures of the several micro-organisms were employed,
and the series included typical representatives of saprophytic and
 parasitic bacteria.      The organisms chosen possessed varying degrees of
 resistance to external agents — the extremes in this respect being repre
sented by the very sensitive spirillum of Cholera Asiatica and the
 highly resistant spores of B. anthracis.
    Ten organisms were used for the experiments, viz. : — B. typhosus,
B. coli communis, B. diphtheria:, Spirillum cholera Asiatica, B. proteus
vulgaris, B. acidi lactici, B. anthracis (sporing culture), Staphylococcus
pyogenes aureus, B. phosphorescent and Photohacterium balticum.
    The cultures of the organisms were young and vigorous, and were
 tested both on solid and in fluid media, viz. : — Nutrient gelatin, agar-
agar, potato and peptone broth.
    The cultures on these media were simultaneously exposed to the
temperature of liquid air for twenty hours               (-  182° C. to -   190° C).
They were then carefully           thawed and examined.            The results may
be briefly stated.     In no instance, whether on solid or in liquid media,
could any impairment of the vitality of the micro-organisms be
detected.    The fresh growths obtained from the exposed tubes were
normal in every respect, and the functional activities of the bacteria
were equally unaffected.           The colon bacillus produced its typical
effects — such as the curdling of milk, the fermentation of sugar and
the production of indol ; the Staphylococcus pyogenes aureus retained its
pigment producing properties and the anthrax spores their pathogenic
action on animals.         The photogenic bacteria preserved their normal
luminous properties.          These photogenic properties are intimately
connected with the functional          activities    of the cells.   The cells emit
light which is apparently produced by a chemical process of intra
cellular oxidation and the phenomenon ceases with the cessation of
their activity.    These organisms therefore furnished a very happy

test of the influence of low temperatures on vital phenomena.            Their
cultures, when cooled down        in the liquid air for twenty hours, became
non-luminous, but on re-thawing the luminosity returned with unim
paired vigour as the cells renewed their activity.       Watery emulsions of
the photogenic bacteria, on immersion in liquid air for a few minutes,
ceased to emit light, but on withdrawal the luminosity reappeared in
a very short time.        Strips of filter paper soaked in the watery emul
sions and brightly luminous were immersed directly in the liquid air with
similar results. The sudden cessation and rapid renewal of the photo
 genic properties of the cells, despite the extreme changes of tempera
 ture, was remarkable and striking.
     The following experiment was made : — Fifty litres of the laboratory
 air about six feet from the ground were liquefied at atmospheric pressure
 in a glass bulb by means of boiling liquid air in vacuo.        The tempera
 ture reached was about         -  210° C.   The bulb was then sealed off, the
 contents being still at a temperature below zero, and was subsequently
 opened and washed out with sterile broth.           A series of plate cultures
 were made from the broth on nutrient gelatin, agar-agar and 'sugar agar,
 and were incubated under aerobic and anaerobic conditions at 22° and
  37° C.  for a period of ten days. The anaerobic plate cultures remained
 sterile.     The aerobic plates yielded forty-four organisms which had
 survived an exposure to        -  210° C.   The organisms were representative
 types of those to be usually met with in the air, viz., moidds, bacilli,
  cocci, torulse and sarcina;.
     It  may also be       mentioned that a sample of yeast cell plasma
  (Buchner's     zymase)    subjected to   -  182° C. to -  190° C. for twenty
 hours,   retained   its  peculiar properties unchanged, viz., as regards the
  production of CO> and alcohol.
     The    above experiments show that bacteria may be cooled down
  to  -  190° C. for a period of twenty hours without losing any of their
  vital properties.
     Further experiments are in progress with the above-mentioned and
 with other micro-organisms, exposed to the temperature of liquid air
 for still longer periods of time, as well as to that of liquid hydrogen.
  These experiments will form the subject of a future communication.

    The experiments described below form part of a research which I
began in the summer of 1897 in the Cavendish Laboratory, Cam
bridge,   but was unable     to complete before leaving Cambridge that
same year.      The object of this part of the research, which was sug
gested by Professor J. J. Thomson, was to determine whether evapora
tion of an unelectrified liquid produces any electrification or not.
    The liquid used was fused sodium and the arrangement of apparatus
is shown in the accompanying drawing.
    The sodium to be fused was held in a vertical iron cylinder, A,
                                                                  Q 2

closed at the bottom and having a tightly fitting asbestos plug at th»
mouth.     Through a small hole in the asbestos plug there passed a
tightly fitting glass tube, G, only     a little longer than the thickness of
the plug.    A   stout bare copper wire, C, passed through this tube G
without touching the sides, and had a copper disc at the end inside
                                                           Bunsen Burners.
the iron cylinder.     Outside the cylinder, this wire passed direct to the
insulated quadrants of an electrometer              E, and was surrounded
throughout    this portion of   its length by   a metal guard-tube D, which
screened it from outside electrostatic influences.       Besides the fastening
to the electrometer, the sole supports of the wire C were two paraffin
plugs fixed into the ends of this tube D. The iron cylinder A, the
tube D, and the uninsulated quadrants of the electrometer E, were
connected by a wire with one another and with the sheath of the
electrometer, denoted by S in the diagram.
   The heat to fuse the sodium was supplied by two Bunsen burners
placed below the cylinder A ; and in order to protect the insulated
wire from the hot    gases  rising from the burners,    a metal screen    M was
fixed on the cylinder and bent up on the side remote from the electro
meter to serve as a funnel.

          due to Evaporation of Sodium           in Air and other    Gases.     185
    With     these    arrangements it was found that very soon after heat
 was applied       to the sodium, a negative electrification of 2 to 3 volts
was indicated by the electrometer.              This electrification persisted for
a considerable time, but eventually the insulation broke down, owing
 to the sodium vapour condensing in the glass tube G at the mouth of
the cylinder, sufficiently to cause a solid connection between the tube
and wire.
    When the        same   experiment was repeated mthout the sodium, no
electrification     was indicated by the electrometer.
    These results were confirmed by repeated experiments, and the
question then arose whether this negative electrification is due to the
evaporation of the sodium, or to oxidation of the sodium going on in
the iron cylinder.
    The latter seemed probable, as the electrometer showed electrifica
tion almost from the moment when heat was applied to the sodium,
whereas sodium does not fuse            till at temperature of     96° C. and boils
at about 400° C.
    To determine this point, the same experiment was repeated with
this difference, that the air in the cylinder was replaced by an atmo
sphere in which the sodium could not oxidise.                  Carbonic acid gas
was first tried, being kept flowing into the cylinder after passing
through a drying apparatus ; but in this gas the sodium became
•coated with a white encrustation, and showed no signs of evaporation
or of boiling even at a red heat.
   Coal gas was next tried, and no difficulty was found in boiling the
sodium in this gas.         To prevent accident by explosion, the apparatus
was set up in the fire-place, so that the escaping coal gas might pass
up the chimney, and not mix with the air of the room.                   Great care
was taken to ensure            the   complete removal of air from the iron
cylinder before heat was applied. With this atmosphere of coal gas no
electrification was obtained while heat was applied to the tube for over
an hour.        The insulation was tested from time to time during this
period by giving a charge to the wire from an electrified vulcanite rod,
watching the rate of leak indicated on the electrometer scale, and
then discharging.         It was found to be excellent ; but eventually, as
before, it broke down when some of the sodium vapour condensed in
the mouth of the cylinder between the wire and the glass tube.
Repetition of this experiment confirmed this result.
    This problem of the possible generation of electricity by evapora
tion of a liquid, has been recently investigated for the case of water by
Pellat,* who found no trace of electrification.             A similar result was
found in the earlier experiments of Blake, t who used water and solutions

The present experiments lead to the conclusion that evaporation of

by the method used, unless oxidation is going on.

   («) Origin.
               — Seeing that spindle fibre nodes (apparently intact) can
be recognised in     mature wall of considerable thickness, there would
                              a
seem little doubt that the existing views with regard to the genesis of
the cell plate and first formed cell wall cannot be entirely correct.
 I   am inclined to believe that the cell plate arises not directly from
the spindle fibres, in the manner described by Strasburger and others,
but rather indirectly; that     to say, that although
                                         is                 possibly pro it   is
vided by or even proceeds from the fibres in question, yet     exhibits            it           a
certain structural distinction, in that        pierced by the persistent
                                                    it   is
nodes of the spindle fibres, and not merged into their substance.

  The cell plate would appear to consist of cytoplasm, and cytoplasm,
moreover, practically identical with the ordinary cytoplasm of the cell,
and from      secreted the first formed cell wall as an equatorial mem
               it   is
brane traversed by the nodes of the achromatin spindle fibres.
   (A) Development.
                    — There are grounds for regarding the primary cell
wall   as different           in genesis and character from the secondary formations
which succeed     and arise from the general cytoplasm.
                         it                                In any case,
the wall rapidly grows in thickness as layer after layer of cellulose                          is
deposited.  In the course of my work certain observations were made,
which appeared to throw some light on the structure and genesis of
the wall thus produced.     It was found that many walls, and especially
mucilaginous walls, when strongly swollen and stained, after passing
through the stage of stratification, became resolved into numberless and
often well-defined spherical droplets or spherules which not unfrequently
exhibit markedly high refraction, and are embedded in hyaline and
           a                                                                    a
possibly mucilaginous ground-substance or matrix.
 I   am of opinion that these spheroidal droplets represent swollen
gramdes or spherules, which are practically homologous with the
droplets or the drops (and    am disposed to think with the droplets)

   In the above paper we compared the droplets of            Blechnum   occidentals
with the granules or spherules described by Langley               as occurring   in
certain gland cells, e.g., the mucous cells of the sub-maxillary gland of
the dog; and I am still of opinion that such a comparison was a
pertinent one, and not entirely without significance in the case of the
plant cell wall   also.
   I  am disposed to regard the cell wall as fundamentally of the nature
of a mucous or, rather, mucilage secretion ; the droplet or spherules
                                        " tnchosomes"
(shall I call them provisionally                       f) being composed of a
substance which, when more hydrated, passes as " a mucilage," and when
less hydrated functions as
                                " a cellulose." The spherules are embedded
in the "ground substance," and possibly the remains of even a proto
plasmic framework        (which   may undergo mucilaginous        change) is also
present.
   I  regard stratification as the necessary accompaniment of the rhythmic
periods of activity and rest of the secreting protoplasm ; and as to the
method of secretion, it is external and not internal, as in the mucilage
cells described by Gardiner and Ito.
   The changes incident upon lignification and the like I have always
regarded as induced by secondary secretion or post-formation chemical
change.
   I  may add that I see little in the above view of the structure of the
cell  wall  which militates against the facts which we have at our disposal,
either with regard to the properties of the cell wall or to the phenomena
associated with growth in thickness or in surface.
   I  am aware that much remains to be done before the above views are
placed on a proper basis, but I have great hopes that this is only a
matter of time and of further detailed research.

    One of the chief results which, in my opinion, would be secured by
the use of the prismatic camera in eclipse work was the differentiation
between chromospheric and coronal phenomena.                     The photographs
taken during the eclipses of 1893, 1896, and 1898 all enabled this
distinction to be made very clearly, and various radiations formerly
attributed to the corona have been shown to belong to the chromo
sphere alone. The photographs taken in Africa in 1893 showed eight
rings in the spectrum of the corona ; in Novaya Zemlaya, in 1896, with
a less powerful instrument, a smaller number was secured ; but those
taken with increased dispersion in India, in 1898, show a much greater
number.
    I have already given the results of an inquiry into the wave-lengths
of two of the chief coronal rings (5303-7 and 4231 3) as determined
from photographs taken in 1898 with the 6-inch prismatic camera ;*
and as the results of the continued investigations             may be of service to
intending observers of the eclipse of next May,             I give a short abstract
of them in the present note.
    Eight photographs were obtained during the time the spectrum of
the corona was least admixed with that of chromosphere ; of these, throe
taken with instantaneous exposures show only two or three of the
brighter rings, so that five, showing many coronal rings, are suitable
for measurement. The exposures of the photographs used for measure
ment were as follows, the ratio of focal length to aperture being 15 : —

    During the earlier part of the exposure of plate 2a, the upper
regions of the chromosphere were visible in the north-east, and some
of the stronger chromospheric arcs appear, together with the coronal
rings, in the corresponding parts of the images. In plates 3c and 3<l
chromospheric arcs appear in the south-west quadrant, together with

coronal rings ; but, as I pointed out in the preliminary report on the
observations at Viziadmg, the arcs and rings are readily distin
guished.*
    The coronal rings which have been noted on the photographs may
lie divided into three groups, defined by the position-angles in which
they have their greatest brightness.              The typical rings are (1) the
green ring at A. 5303-7 ; (2) a violet ring at A. 3987, near He ; and (3)
a blue     ring at    A. 4359'5, near Hy.       The structure and brightness of
these are shown in the accompanying diagram, but it may be remarked
that the fainter members of the three groups do not exhibit the differ
ences of structure so clearly.

   I  have already suggested that the different forms of the coronal
rings indicate that they are not all due to the same substance, and
the foregoing      tables suggest that at least three substances are in
question.    The attempts which have so far been made to trace the
origins of the rings, however, have led to no very definite results, and
the coincidences with lines in the spectra of stars and nebulae which
were formerly suspected have not yet been completely established.
   Special interest is attached to the question of the presence or
absence   of carbon flutings.       There is    a possible trace of the        fluting,

commencing at X 4736'18, which so far has not been observed in the
chromosphere.   The other flutings of carbon which are present in the
chromosphere  do not appear in the coronal spectrum.
   The reductions indicate that there may be feeble indications of the
presence of  some  of the  chromospheric  gases in the inner corona.
Thus in photograph 3d, on the north-eastern edge, fragments of rings
corresponding to lines of helium at XX 4472, 4714, and 4922 have
been recorded ; these occur also on the south-western limb, where the
chromosphere itself is coming into view, but as the chromosphere was
completely eclipsed in the north-east at this stage, the radiations
mentioned as occurring there perhaps belong to the inner corona.
   A very interesting result of this detailed examination of the photo
graphs is that the chief coronal ring in the green is very closely
associated with the form of the inner, and appears to have no distinct
connection with the outer, corona. This suggests that the green line
of the coronal spectrum is not produced in the outer corona, and that
the indications of its presence there on previous occasions, as obtained
by slit spectroscopes, were simply due to glare, as in the case of hydro
gen and calcium. So far as the photographs taken with the prismatic
cameras are concerned, the spectrum of the outer corona gives no indi
cations of bright rings.
   The measurements of the coronal rings and the diagram which
accompanies this paper have been made by Mr. Fowler.
   Dr. Lockyer has investigated the coronal spectrum in relation to
carbon, and Mr. Baxandall has made comparisons with the spectra of
stars and nebulae.
" The Ionisation of Dilute Solutions at   the Freezing Point."  By
       W. C. D. Whetham,     M.A., Fellow of Trinity College, Cam

the number of ions which   these substances must be supposed to yield
in order to explain their electrical conductivities.         Again,   as the con

        The Ionisation of Dilute Solutions at the Freezing Point.      193
both the extent and the accuracy of our experimental knowledge of
these relations.    Freezing-point determinations for very dilute solu
tions are extremely difficult, owing to the minute differences of tem
perature to be measured, and the results given by various observers
showed great discrepancies.       On the other hand, the most satisfactory
experiments on the electrical ionisation of corresponding solutions had
been made at higher temperatures, instead of at the freezing point, at
which they should be obtained for purposes of comparison.         The fact
that the temperature coefficient of conductivity differs for solutions of
different concentration, showed that the values of the ionisation would
vary if the temperature was changed.
   Mr. E. H. Griffiths therefore undertook the examination of the
freezing points by the method of platinum thermometry, and the
present paper contains an account of corresponding measurements of
the electrical conductivities at 0° C.
   In order to avoid any possible action of glass on the solvent used, it
was determined that the water should be obtained from a platinum
still and collected in platinum bottles, and that both the freezing
point and the electrical measurements should be made in platinum
vessels. The structure of the resistance cell is represented in fig. 1.
The walls of the vessel itself are used as one electrode, and an insu
lated platinum cage, suspended inside, forms the other. Within the
cage is a platinum screw, mounted on a shaft, which can be turned by
means of a hand wheel and cord.          This screw is used to insure tem
perature equality throughout the liquid, and to mix the solutions
when made.      The shaft of the screw is » hollow tube, closed at the
bottom, which contains a thermometer.
   Instead of beginning with a strong solution and gradually diluting,
it  was  thought better to begin with a definite quantity of the pure
solvent, and, when its resistance had been observed, to add weighed
amounts of stock solution of known strength by means of the platinum
vessel shown in fig. 2. This vessel will obviously empty itself if a flow
of liquid is started by slightly increasing the air pressure at the neck.
   In order to obtain   a definite quantity of solvent, slightly more than
the volume needed was placed in the cell, and the level of the liquid
 was then adjusted by sucking water through a capillary platinum tube
into the glass vessel shown in fig. 3.       The bottom of the capillary
always comes to the same position relatively to the cell, and, if the
sucking pressure is kept constant and equal to that of a water column
of about a foot in height, it is found that the amount of water left in
the cell is constant to within about one-tenth of a gramme.          Thus
three independent withdrawals left 2 19-60, 219-63, and 219-59 grammes.
 Whenever the cell was dismounted and set up again, this measurement
 was repeated.
    The platinum   vessel was   surrounded by a brass case, coils of metal

tubing being placed in the narrow air space between them. Evapo
rated ether vapour could be drawn through these coils by an air-pump,
and thus the whole vessel cooled.    The apparatus was fixed in a large
copper tank, which was filled with melting ice.

   The electrical resistance measurements were        made  by the method
of alternating currents, but the usual telephone indicator was replaced
by a D'Arsonval galvanometer.      This was done by using a revolving
commutator, which, turned by a hand-wheel and cord, alternated the
connections of the bridge with the battery and with the galvanometer
simultaneously.    The usual Wheatstone-bridge method could then be
used, and measurements obtained in the same cell of resistances
varying from     10 to 50,000 ohms, the accuracy throughout        being at

least 1 in 1000.   The method eliminates several troublesome periodic
disturbances, and, in this form, seems entirely satisfactory.           The
surface of the electrodes was platinised in the usual manner, but was
afterwards heated to redness.     This process gives a roughened plati
num surface of large area, which is less liable to absorb matter from
the solution than is the unheated platinum black.
   The water used was thrice distilled, twice with alkaline perman
ganate and once in a platinum still with a trace of acid potassium
sulphate.   It had an average conductivity at  18°  of about 0-9 x 10"15in
C.G.S. units.

 196                     Mr. W. C. D. Whetham.
   Some of the stock solutions for the early part of the work were
prepared by Miss D. Marshall, and most of those used in the later
measurements were made up at the Cambridge University Chemical
 Laboratory by Mr. G. Hall, under the advice of Mr. H. J. H. Fenton.
Others were prepared by the writer from recrystallised        salts obtained
from Kahlbaum, of Berlin.
   From a knowledge of the weight of solvent used and the weight of
stock solution added it was easy to calculate the concentration (m) of
the resulting solution in terms of gramme-equivalents of solute per
thousand grammes of solution.       All the experiments were made on solu
tions so dilute that this way of defining in leads to practically the same
results as though the gramme-equivalents of solute were referred to 1000
grammes of solvent, or to one litre of solution.       The differences only
become    visible on the curves in the cases of two or three of the
strongest solutions of some of the substances used.
   The observed resistance is corrected for any slight difference in
temperature from zero, and for the increased volume of liquid in the
cell due to the volume of stock solution added.
   The reciprocal of this corrected resistance is the conductivity in
arbitrary cell units, and from this the corresponding arbitrary con
ductivity of the solvent is subtracted.      The resultant conductivity, k;
duo to the added solute alone,   is  divided by in, and kjm, the equivalent
conductivity, plotted on a diagram as ordinate, the value of ml, a
number proportional to the average nearness of the molecules, being
used as abscissa.    From these curves the maximum value of kjm is
estimated, and taken to represent complete ionisation, the ionisation
for the solutions measured being calculated as the ratio between the
actual value of kjm and its maximum.
   The values obtained for these ionisations were arranged as shown
in the following table, which is given as an example, and are plotted
as curves on the diagrams appended.
   Sulphuric Acid. — Prepared at the Chemical Laboratory by adding the
calculated amount of S03 to distilled acid. Successive crystallisation
brought the melting point of the resultant H0SO4 to + 105° Cent.
The crystals were dissolved in water and the concentration of the
solution estimated by the barium sulphate method.
   Similar measurements were made on Potassium Chloride, Barium
Chloride, Copper Sulphate, Potassium Permanganate, Potassium Ferri-
cyanide, and Potassium Bichromate.
   In discussing the results, we may first notice that, in cases where
it has been possible to obtain values for the ionisation at 18° from
Kohlrausch's work, the ionisation curve at 0° is appreciably different
from that at 18°, the ionisation falling off more rapidly with increasing
concentration at the higher temperature.        In the diagrams the values
for 0° are given by   dots inside   circles, and  those for 18° by crosses.

         The Ionisation         of Dilute Solutions at               the    Freezing Point.             197
In the     case of copper sulphate, measurements                       by the present method
were made at        18°   as   well    as at 0°, and are indicated            by crosses inside
circles ; giving a curve which agrees with Kohlrausch's observations at
moderate concentrations, but differs from them at extreme dilution.
   The normal type of curve is given by potassium chloride, barium
chloride, &c.   The curve for sulphuric acid departs from this form, as
other observers, using glass vessels and working at higher tempera
tures, have previously found.      The drop in this curve at extreme
dilution is seen also in solutions of other acids and alkalies, and it has
been usual to explain it by supposing that the effective amount of acid
is reduced at extreme dilution by interaction with the residual im
purities of the solvent. The phenomenon seems too constant for this

explanation to be satisfactory, and the cause of it may perhaps be con
nected in some way with the fact that it occurs only in solutions the
solute of which gives ions either of hydrogen or hydroxyl, which are
ions (1) present in the solvent, (2) possessing                         greater velocities than
any other ions.
  The drop in the curve for potassium permanganate      on the other                   is,
hand, probably due to interaction between the salt and the solvent
impurities. The effect  completed by the first addition of salt, for
                                is                                                                          if

 stock solution was added to the solvent, as though the action took
 time for its completion.       While, however, in the case of permanganate
 this phenomenon was only observed on adding the first lot of stock
solution, in the case of acid it appeared in the second solution also.
 This confirms the idea that the action is not completed by the first
addition of acid, though the quantity of acid present must be large
compared    with the amount of residual impurity in the solvent.
    The permanganate measurements also show that the slant of the .
curve is that of a salt like potassium chloride, with a monovalent acid
 radicle, rather than that of a salt such as copper sulphate, with a
divalent acid.       The chemical structure of permanganate in water
solution is therefore probably represented by the formula KMnO*.
    The curve for potassium bichromate appears to consist of two parts,
an indication, perhaps, that the ions are different at different concen
trations.
    In order to collect the results, smoothed values have been obtained
from the curves and are appended in Tables IX, X, XI, and XII.               The
first three tables contain ionisation coefficients at 0°, the concentration
being    tabulated    in different  ways.    Table XII shows approximate
values for the equivalent conductivities at 0°.        These were not neces
sary for the determination of ionisation, so a single value of the cell
constant, obtained by comparison of the copper sulphate measurements
at 18° with Kohlrausch's absolute values, was used, except for the
potassium chloride solutions, which were reduced by a figure given by
Kohlrausch for this salt at 0°.          The errors will be small, for the
amount of solvent left in the cell in each case was very nearly con
stant, and this is a measure       of the accuracy with which the cell is re
adjusted    after being taken to pieces.      The results, however, are not
supposed    to be  as  trustworthy  as those of the ionisation coefficients.

204                  Mr. G.  J.  Bureh.    On the Eolation     of
"On the Relation of Artificial Colour-blindness                     to  Successive
        Contrast."       By George       J. Buhch, M.A. Oxon., Beading
        College, Beading.       Communicated       by Professor Gotch, F.RS.
        Received January 30       —  Read February 8, 1900.
    I  have elsewhere pointed out that my observations on artificial
colour-blindness seem unfavourable to the theory of Hering, and
favourable to that of Young. The experiments on successive contrast
described in the following pages tend also to confirm in a remarkable
manner opinions held before the time of Young, and which must be
considered as incorporated in his theory.          The method I have pursued
throughout this investigation consists essentially in the use of the
spectroscope to analyse sensations of contrast, and I have accordingly
been able to make certain experiments which would have been
beyond the resources of those earlier writers ; but the following
account of their opinions, expressed as far as possible in the words of
the authors themselves, is intended to show in some detail how closely
their views agree with my own results.
    During the 18th century the phenomena of after-images and                  suc
 cessive contrast attracted a good deal          of attention,    and although in
 most cases the physical conditions of the experiments were too com
 plex to afford much information as to their true nature, there were
 some remarkable exceptions, to which         I  desire to direct attention.
    The opinions enunciated during the 18th century may be divided
 broadly into two groups.         The one school held that after the stimulus
 of a strong light of any given colour, a species of reaction sets in, by
 which a sensation of the complementary colour is produced.                    This
 view may      be  regarded as   belonging to  the  same  category as the theory
 of Hering.       It  may be doubted whether it was definitely adopted by
 Jurin,* who      says only that this
                                        " contrary sensation is apt to arise in
 us sometimes of itself, and sometimes from such causes as at another
 time would not produce the sensation at all, or at least not to the same
 degree," and preserves a like caution throughout his description of the
 phenomena.          Other experimenters, however, advocated this theory,
 and   it  was   strongly upheld in 1801 by Venturi,t who maintained that
 the changing tints of after-images excited by the pure colours of the
 spectrum proved the existence of a multiple function for each nerve-
 fibre, as opposed to the theory of one nerve, one function, taught by
 Bonnet.    {

   The other school, from which the theory of Young may            be considered
to have developed,     seems to have been founded by Scherffer, who, in
1761, published a long series of experiments on contrast based on
Buffon's work, but criticising his conclusions.        Scherffer's standpoint is
briefly expressed in the following passage : —
   " Perhaps the Creator has so constructed the entire organ of vision
that each kind of ray can only act upon such of the parts of which
the eye is composed as are particularly appropriated to it. But I pre
suppose that the whole action of light consists in attraction and repul
sion                  It  may be that a continuous action of, for instance,
                           ....
red light, may so change the order and arrangement of the parts of
the back of the eye                      that those rays may be no longer
strong enough to communicate to these parts the necessary vibratory
       ....
movement, until a little rest shall have restored them to their condi
tion                 and during this time the other rays of different
kinds will not cease to act . . . ."
   He points out that if this explanation of "accidental colours" is
the true one, it must follow that the after-image of a coloured object
viewed upon a ground of the same colour must be black, just as a
¦white spot upon a dark ground gives a black after-image upon white
paper.*
   Two of his experiments may be specially noted : —
   In order to determine      the complementaries       of the primary colours
by  experiment, he projected the solar spectrum on a white surface,          and
•observed   the colours of the after-image produced by it.+             He then
•compared    these   with  the   corresponding     colours,    as calculated  by
Newton's method. He gives the following list of colours observed : —
           Red '.                           Blue, verging on green.
           Orange                           Blue, almost indigo.
           Yellow                           A more violet-blue.
           Green                            Purple.
           Blue                             Red.
           Indigo                           Orange, but rather pale.
           Violet                           A  very yellow green.
   He also    made   drawings   of flowers, and painted them with colours
complementary to those they naturally possessed.            These, when steadily
looked at in a bright light, gave after-images in their true colours. He
even went so far as to copy a picture, painting it with a green face
shaded with yellow, white hair and eyebrows, black eye-balls with
white pupils, and green lips, so that the accidental image of it had the
colours of the original.}

 206                   Mr. G.     J.  Burch.        On tlie Relation    of
    He     does   not, however, deal with the positive after-image and after
 effects.     This was done by Robert Waring Darwin,* in his paper on
 the " Ocular Spectra of Light and Colours," in which he treats of the
 "direct and reverse spectra" of brightly illuminated pieces of silk
 of various colours.         He describes very clearly the           series   of changes of
 these after-images from negative to positive and back again, observable
 under certain conditions, and points out that in order to see the direct
 spectrum (positive after-image) all extraneous light must be excluded,
 whereas "      it is difficult to gain the reverse spectrum (negative after
 image) where there is no lateral light to contribute to its formation."
 "The reverse spectrum is instantaneously converted into the direct
 spectrum by excluding lateral light, and the direct into the reverse by
                                    "
 admitting it                           "The green spectrum which is perceived
 on removing the eye from a piece of red silk to a sheet of white paper,
may either be called the reverse spectrum of the red silk, or the direct
spectrum of all the rays from the white paper except the red, for in
truth it is both." Thus the " direct spectrum
                                                                   "

colours except the colour with which it has been fatigued."                        He proves
this by showing that             the   colour of     the   " reverse spectrum
                                                                                   "

                           " lateral light," i.e., the light which reaches the eye
upon that of the
after the retina has been fatigued, t He compares these phenomena
with those of taste, touch, and hearing, and shows that each of these
senses undergoes          a partial     temporary paralysis after being strongly
excited.       Although,       therefore, the unaided evidence of the senses
might      have   suggested that each pair of complementary colour-sensa
tions, such as red and green, or blue and yellow, were conjugate
functions of some nerve structure, it is plain that he desired to empha
sise the fact       that they must be regarded as due to separate nerve
structures.        One nerve, one sensation.             The sensation might be weak
or strong, according to the physiological condition of the organ at the
time, but its character could not be changed.
    Darwin, following Newton, refers to seven colours as primaries.                         In
1792 Wiinsch.t whose method consisted in the superposition of spectra
projected upon a screen, stated that a mixture of three colours,
namely, red, green, and violet blue, could be made to match any given
tint.
    For the basis of Young's theory there existed, therefore, experimental
evidence of the small number of the primary colour-sensations, and
of their being functions each of some nerve structure                                specially

 appropriated to it.                The phenomena of negative and positive after
 images were known                — it was known that certain colours are altered in
 hue to an eye previously exposed to coloured light, and that experi
 ments on this subject should be made with the spectrum rather than
with pigments.
  The following papers also  are of special interest in connection with
the present communication.
   Brewster,* by looking at the spectrum through a coloured medium,
was able to trace the green as far as C.   His mode of explaining the
phenomenon led to a controversy, in which the true merit of the
observation was lost sight of. A momentary colour-blindness      in                              is,
reality, as was shown by Hunt, produced by the contrast of adjacent
parts of the spectrum differing greatly in brightness.
  Piazzi Smyth, working with t       very long spectrum, observed the
                                                    a
boundaries of the colours to change when any alteration was made in
the intensity of the illumination.
   The earliest account of      systematic investigation
                                              a                                  of the effect of
retinal fatigue on the colours of the spectrum        in                is       a   paper of   John
Aitken.J                Similar observations were made by Edmund Hunt,§ who
also describes the appearance of the spectrum when observed through
certain coloured media, after the manner of Brewster.      Coloured
figures of the residts are given.  Both these authors used light much
less intense than that employed by me, and did not obtain the full
effect.    was not aware of their work until after my own paper had
               I
been read, and therefore take this opportunity of calling attention to

turn, or separated from the rest as in the spectrum. Four cases
arise   :

consist of white light.

and to employ spectral colours by direct observation.   Some little care
must be taken to adjust the relative intensity of the two stimuli
correctly, and to effect the change from one to the other as suddenly as
possible.

a mirror so as to reflect white light from the sky into the tube. Cover
the open end of the scale tube by      black card held in the right hand,

keeping the eye fixed on the intersection of the cross wires, and then
suddenly cover the slit and uncover the scale tube. A complementary

spectrum.
   The phenomenon of successive contrast       shown by the precedingis
method in its least simple form.    To analyse     the effect of retinal      it,
fatigue by each spectral colour on the perception of that same colour
must be determined.     This may be done by focussing with a lens A

the lens and the slit.               The   effect produced is that of a broad, continuous-
spectrum, with          a narrow but much brighter             spectrum in the middle of
it. After a few seconds a black                     card is suddenly brought behind the
lens, so as to screen off the light of the focussed lamp B. A dark band
like a shadow instantly appears in place of the narrow bright spectrum —
that is to say, the effect upon the retina of light of any wave-length is to
blind the eye temporarily for light of that same wave-length. This may be
illustrated in another way. Place near the slit of the spectroscope a

calcium or strontium chloride, or common salt, or anything that gives
a  good bright-line spectrum, in the Bunsen flame, keeping the eye
fixed on one of the lines. On snatching away the card and the Bunsen
flame a dark-line spectrum will be seen momentarily against the con
tinuous  spectrum of the lamp, so sharply defined that                                it   is   difficult to
realise that     merely an illusion.
                  it   is
    These results are               of cardinal        importance.         They mean that the
green or blue subjective impression produced by    white surface when       a
the eye has been fatigued for red does not indicate that red excites
an after-sensation of green or blue, or renders the eye more sensitive
to green or blue, but that the eye has become less sensitive to-
red. And similarly with the other colours.         This point     clearly                       is

     (1.) Place a coloured screen over the end of the scale tube of an
 ordinary spectroscope, the scale being removed, and cover the slit
 ¦with a card.      After looking at the coloured light for some seconds,
 cover the scale tube, and simultaneously uncover the slit.            This ex
  periment is easily tried, but is open to the objection that the first
 stimulus is not perfectly monochromatic.
     (2.) Illuminate the scale tube with monochromatic light from a
 prism, and proceed as before               This plan obviates the difficulty
 referred to, but does not afford sufficient light to produce the ful
 effect.

 near the back surface of the last prism D of the large spectroscope in
such a position that the rays from it are reflected into the telescope E
of the large spectroscope. This second spectrum is of course much
fainter than the one observed directly through the instrument, but
that is an advantage rather than otherwise.             It is only necessary to
arrange two black cards      with  slits in  them in such a way that when light
passes through the first spectroscope the second is obscured, and on
 touching a spring the conditions are reversed.
    In  order to make the effects more marked, a short slit should be
used    for the large spectroscope, so that it may give a band of mono
chromatic light across the middle of the field, fairly bright but rather
narrow.       The eye should be fixed on the centre of this band. After
a few moments, by the action of the spring referred to, a black card
is suddenly brought over the slit of the spectroscope, shutting off the
light, while at the same moment the screen is removed from the other
spectroscope, and the complete spectrum appears, filling the entire
field of view.       For an instant, a dark shadow is seen, not extending

across the entire spectrum, but only that part of it corresponding to
the colour-sensation excited by the monochromatic light. The effect
is very striking after red light. An intensely black band cuts through
the spectrum from the ultra-red, as far as C, where it begins to fade
away into a pure green.
   After violet light, a similar black band cuts through the spectrum
from the ultra-violet, and if care has been taken not to implicate the
blue in the fatigue, the black band fades away into blue.
   After green light, most frequently the red and blue are seen to
stretch across and meet in the middle of the b lines ; but sometimes,
if the exposure is exactly right, a well-marked darkening of that part
of the spectrum is seen.
   Blue light is the most difficult to manage, unless a wide dispersion is
used, the blue being otherwise not sufficiently separated from the green
and the violet.     After getting the adjustments right, it is better either
to wait ten minutes, or use the other eye.        With these precautions, it is
easy to see the green and violet meet in the place of the blue, and to
note that the after-image of the blue casts no shadow on the violet
near H. Sometimes a momentary shadow may be seen in the blue.
This experiment is of interest      as affording   additional   evidence of the
existence of a separate sensation for blue.
   It should be noted that the two spectra must have the correspond
ing colours on the same side. If the prism of the second spectro
scope is reversed so as to bring the red of one spectrum towards the
violet of the other,   a black   shade, very well defined, can be produced
in any part of the      second   spectrum.   For if the two spectra are so
arranged that any given portion of the one corresponds with the same
 wave-length on the other, then no part of the one spectrum on either
side of that one part will be of equal wave-length with the portion of
the other spectrum which coincides with it. Accordingly, a negative
after-image will be produced only of the short space within which the
wave-lengths are approximately the same.             But it is clear that such
an experiment is more curious than useful.
             III.  Contrast Phenomena    by Intermittent Stimulation.
   In   1868  Sigmund Exner* made a series of experiments on the fol
lowing plan. After an interval of darkness, he presented to the eye,
for a fraction of a second, the image of a small white disc. This was
succeeded by a disc of considerably larger diameter, which in turn was
followed by darkness. The illumination of either disc, and the period
during which it was visible, could be independently varied. Thus the
 portion of the retina on which fell the image of the small disc received

not merely the light of the larger disc, but in addition the light of
the smaller disc. Yet in spite of this, with certain relations of in
tensity and duration between the two images, the total sensation
evoked by the larger quantity of light was less, so that the small disc
appeared as a black spot on the larger disc.   I was curious to ascer
tain to what extent this principle could be carried.  By the following
experiment it may be demonstrated in a striking manner. A card
board disc, A, figs. 3, 4, 200 mm. diameter, of which 180° is black and
                             Fig.     3.                                 Fig.   4.

the rest white, has a slit about half a millimetre wide cut at the
junction of black with white.     It is made to revolve so that black
precedes   and white follows the slit.     An incandescent lamp B is
placed behind the disc, and another C in front of it. so as to throw a
strong light upon its surface.    While the disc is moving slowly the
incandescent filament of the lamp B, seen through the slit as it passes
across, looks bright against the white card, but when a certain speed i*
reached    it appears as a black thread against a brighter background.
     In spite of the very short duration of the intense light of the fila
ment, the fatigue induced by it is out of all proportion to the sensa
tion it excites, and in consequence the less fatiguing illumination of
the white card produces a greater effect on the senses than the sum of
the sensations due to the filament and the subsequent light. With a
single flash the filament looks, to the rested eye, black all over, but
with               of flashes there is generally an appearance as though
          a succession
the luminous filament were partly covered by an opaque black thread,
but could be seen in places behind it.         This I think is due to the
shifting of the  images   on the retina, which   after the first flash is no
longer in a uniform condition.      The retina     as   were, scarred with
                                                                 is,     it

      next attempted to get the reversed image of the sun. This was
attended    with difficulty, owing to the lack of a disc with a slit
sufficiently fine to reduce the sensation evoked by the direct light of
the sun within the limits required.    I succeeded at last by increasing
the intensity of the illumination of the white card.    This was effected
by holding in front of it a large lens by which the sun's rays could be
concentrated, the degree of concentration being regulated by adjusting
the distance of the lens from the card.   In this way I was able to see
the sun's disc black                            The experiment tended
                             upon a white ground.
to confirm the explanation   already given of the appearance of the
incandescent filament under similar conditions.   If the visual axis was
not fixed, three or four black discs would appear, and on looking
directly at one of the more central ones, the sun's disc seemed to be
partly visible behind it.    A very curious effect was produced by
" sweeping " with the eye along a faint circle marked on the
                                                             revolving
card.        A    whole series of black discs started into view one after the
other without         a glimpse of the luminous disc that produced them.
      The principle
                  underlying Sigmund Exner's method is illustrated in
an       more striking manner by the remarkable experiment of
          even
Shelford Bidwell.    In this a coloured object is placed behind a disc
half black and half white, with a sector 30° wide cut out of the white
portion.   As the disc revolves, the eye is kept in darkness for a space,
then sees the coloured object for a short time, and immediately after
wards a white surface for a considerably longer time.        The retinal
fatigue induced by the colours of the object causes a negative after
effect so strong that the object is seen in its complementary colours.
   From the point of view of my own investigations it was necessary to
repeat        experiments with the pure colours of the spectrum.
             these
There are several positions in which a disc, such as Shelford Bidwell
employs, can be used in conjunction with a spectroscope. It may be
placed between the prism and the telescope, the latter being set back
an inch or two to make room for       or  may work in a gap cut in the
                                            it,   it
body  of the telescope, being illuminated by front light through a side

the spectrum and consequently renders       less bright.

diminishes the image to one-tenth of its size, and the second tele
scope only magnifies it five times, so that it appears to the eye
half  the size it would without the      telescopes, and   correspondingly
brighter.   Although the two     telescopes   were   merely supported    by

 retort stands and roughly adjusted, the definition was quite good
 enough and the light strong enough to show the complementary
 spectrum extremely well.
    But the white light used was merely that reflected from card, and
 was in consequence weak in the extreme violet rays. By the following
 arrangement white light reflected from a mirror may be employed : —
 The disc A, figs. 7, 8, which is 25 cms. in diameter, has two sectors of
 30° aperture, and reaching within 2 cms. of the centre, cut away at
 opposite ends of a diameter. The disc B, 15 cms. in diameter, has two
 narrow slits of about 1° or 2" aperture and 180° apart.     Both discs are
 blacked and mounted upon the same shaft, which is furnished with a
 nut and broad washer, so that they can be clamped together.            The

                                                                   *
            Artificial Colour-blindness  to Successive Contrast.      215
shaft is so fixed that the slits of the smaller disc may revolve close in
front of the slit C of the spectroscope, an ordinary single-prism instru
ment, furnished with a reflected-scale tube, the scale being removed,
leaving the tube open. A mirror placed at D in front of the sectors of
the larger disc reflects light from the sky on to a second mirror E, by
which it is reflected into the scale tube, causing the field of view to be
filled with a soft white light.
    The mirrors and discs must be adjusted until on rotating the shaft
slowly the flashes occur in the following order :— First a sharp flash
through the small disc, giving a momentary view of the spectrum. As
soon as possible after this is over, but not before, there is a rather
long soft flash of pure white light, followed by a much longer period
of perfect darkness. The reason for having two slits and two sectors
on the discs is simply that they may be well balanced on the shaft,
and therefore rotate more steadily.     There should be no overlapping

 of the spectral flash by the white flash, a short interval of darkness
 between them being preferable to the smallest overlap.                     For this
 reason the shaft is fitted with a screw nut, which being slackened, the
 angular position of the slits with respect to the sectors can be accu
 rately adjusted.     On rotating the discs steadily, but not too quickly, a
 spectrum of complementary colours is seen with the greatest distinct
 ness.    By placing a narrow strip of black card across the mouth of
the scale tube, a portion of the white flash may be stopped out, allow
ing    the  normal spectrum to be seen in that part of the field.                 It is
necessary,    however,   to  shade  the  corresponding      part  of  the  slit  some
what, so that the normal spectrum may not overpower the comple
mentary spectrum.         The colours as I see them are as follows : — Red is
replaced by Prussian blue, green by purple (a red shade of Hoffmann's
violet), blue by orange, and violet by yellow.               To show the comple
mentary of violet it is necessary to use sunlight, or, better still, the
arc light.     I have never been able to see it properly by any of the
methods involving the use of white card or paper surfaces as reflectors.
   The experiments of Section 3, for which a wide dispersion was
required, were made with a large direct- vision spectroscope belonging
to the Marllx>rough Collection, for the use of which I am indebted to
the Aldrichian Demonstrator of Chemistry, Mr. W. W. Fisher.                     I have
also to thank Professor Gotch for the use of the electric light in the
physiological    laboratory.     The remainder of the work was done at
Beading College, and the expenses have been defrayed by a portion
of the sum of .£10 allotted to me by the Boyal Society out of the
Government Grant.
"
   On the Production of Artificial Colour-blindness by Moonlight."
        By Geokge J. Burch, M.A. Oxon., Reading College, Reading.
        Communicated by Professor Gotch, F.R.S.                  Received January
        30,— Read February 8, 1900.
   Since the publication of my paper on " Artificial Colour-blindness "*
I  have found a very general and not unnatural tendency to regard the
results described therein as phenomena of a pathological condition
induced by the severe strain to which the structures of the eye had
been subjected.      In my paper I indicated, perhaps too briefly, that
this could not be the case, since         " the   same   general phenomena are
observable alike with strong sunlight           and with the faintest light the
eye is capable of perceiving."
   The purpose therefore of the present communication                 is to describe
some of the experiments on which that statement was based.

                  Artificial Colour-blindness             by Moonlight.                          217
   When green-blindness is induced by exposure of the eye to intense
green light, not only is the observer unable to perceive the colour of
green objects, but the sensation of green is no longer excited by the
intense green light that caused the blindness. And the same may be said
of blue-blindness.    On the other hand, with artificial red-blindness the
exciting light still looks reddish, though greatly dulled and much paler
in hue, but all objects less brightly illuminated fail to excite the red
sensation. Probably in the case of green-blindness the green sensation
is not entirely destroyed, but reduced so much that the red and blue
sensations, which are also excited by that same part of the spectrum,
completely overpower it.     In producing red-blindness, as there are no
colours to the left of red, I have generally used a part of the spectrum
which excites only the red sensation, and which therefore must con
tinue to appear red if visible at all. But I have not thought it desir
able to push the fatigue of the retina far enough to destroy the sensation
of light.
   For the mere demonstration of the phenomena of colour-blindness,
light of quite moderate intensity is amply sufficient if the precaution is
taken of shielding the eye from all other light during the experiment,
and of giving it time to recover from the effects of previous illumina
tion. The colour-blindness so produced                   is,
                                             however, not absolute, but
merely relative, the sensation which has been fatigued, whether red,
green, blue, or violet, being still excited by stronger stimulus.
                                                              a
   The following    perhaps the most striking and suggestive way of
                       is
making the experiment —        :
   1.I  exposed my left eye to direct moonlight in the focus of       lens                   a
behind   a screen of ruby glass combined   with a  gelatine film  stained
with magenta. After three minutes        looked through
                                                  I         spectroscope           a
directed to the moon. The red had entirely disappeared, and only the
green, blue, and violet were visible.   With the right eye      could see               I
the red as well as the other colours.
   2.I  exposed my right eye in the same manner to moonlight, using                               a
screen of green glass instead of the red. On looking through the spec
troscope I  found the green sensation had entirely vanished, the red
meeting the blue in the same part of the spectrum, viz., between     and                     E
b, as in my experiments with sunlight.*    The violet was  easily distin
guished from the blue in this case also. The left eye was still partially
red-blind, and the contrast between the spectrum as seen by                             it   and by
the right eye was very marked.
I    was unable to use spectral colours for fatiguing the eye because the
full moon    not visible at this season of the year from the laboratory
             is
in which the large spectroscope       mounted, and the intensity of the
                                           is
light was too much reduced by reflection from the two mirrors of the

218                     Mr. G.     J.    Burch.         On the Production   of
heliostat.         I   did not therefore make any observation                    with blue or
violet light.
    As may be imagined, it is necessary to use a larger lens with moon
light than with sunlight. In practice I have found an ordinary reading
lens, of 4 inches diameter, sufficient. To obtain the full intensity of illu
mination, the focal length should be such that the moon's image may
be not smaller than the pupil of the eye.
    There are two points of interest in connection with this experiment.
The first is that the illumination of surrounding objects is on the same
scale, as regards contrast of light and shade, in moonlight as in sun
light — that is to say, in each case the source of light is an object sub
tending an angle of about 30' at a distance which is practically
 infinite.    Whatever difference may seem to exist must be of physio
 logical   or psychical origin. The deeper shadows in moonlight probably
afford too little stimulus to fully excite the sensation of vision even in
 an eye accustomed to darkness ; but it must not be forgotten that we
accentuate this difference by a habit of looking at the moon itself and
at the bright sky near     thus blinding ourselves to the faintly illumi
                                       it,
nated details of the shadows. If we were to do the same with sunlight
the shadows would seem equally lacking in detail.        In a room arti
ficially lighted there       seldom so much contrast between lights and
                                  is
shadows.      Light-coloured     objects are usually to be found in close
proximity    to the  lamps,  even  where white shades or globes are not used
to diffuse the light.      It less easy to demonstrate the phenomena of
                                         is
temporary     colour-blindness    under these circumstances, owing to the
greater relative intensity of the dazzle-tints* resulting from the action
of the diffused light before the experiment began. Until these are gone
the retinal fatigue    not confined to one colour.
                             is                          in experimenting
                                                                      If
with moonlight the observer accidentally looks at the moon's disc
before his eye     protected by the coloured screen,
                        is                              well-defined after
                                                                      a
image     produced, and the subsequent phenomena of colour-blindness
            is
are only locally     modified, whereas      an after-effect even of less
                                                            if
intensity, due to diffused light,   present, the colour-blindness may be
                                                   is
to   great
     a      extent  masked.
   The other point of interest in connection with this experiment                           is
that colour-blindness has been produced by light no stronger than that
reflected by ordinary pigments in sunshine. That this     so   evident         is    is
if we look at the moon's disc in the daytime through the same red
glass and lens and compare     with a piece of coloured paper. It can
                                              it
therefore be hardly maintained that the condition of temporary colour
blindness should be regarded as       pathological result of excessive
                                                        a
stimulation of the colour sonsations. Merely to look for   few seconds           a

             be convenient, in describing my own experiments, to retain this word,

at a scarlet poppy in a cornfield causes a measurable degree of red-
blindness for the next two or three minutes.              In applying the spectro
scopic method of measuring the colour sensations described in my
previous paper* it is necessary to guard against this source of error.
Last summer I had a case of a man who seemed at first to be very
nearly green-blind.         His green sensation did not reach more than half
way between b and F, even after fatiguing for thirty seconds with blue
light, and it was correspondingly shortened on the red side.                        After
conversing     with  him    for some   time  in the  subdued    light   of  the   labora
tory   I  repeated the measurements, and found that his green sensation
then extended considerably beyond             F. It appeared that he had been
strolling about the Parks on the grass in the bright sunshine. I have
myself frequently experienced a temporary green-blindness from a
similar cause.       The effect seems to be intensified by looking at a white
surface, as, for instance, in reading a book while sitting on the grass.
After a time the green leaves seem to lose their colour and become
greyish.      This effect may be often noticed during a long walk through
 the fields.    If during this condition the eyes are directed to a small red
 spot on a black surface, as, for instance, a single geranium petal on the
 black cover of a book, and the observer walks with it quickly into a
 dark shed or barn, the colour of the geranium petal will seem to
 change from red to orange and then to yellow, and finally almost
 whitish, owing to the subjective admixture with the red of the green
 dazzle-tint.     On coming out into the light again the red colour will
 reappear.      These changes are similar to those observed in the red end
 of   the spectrum during green-blindness on opening and closing the
 slit ;t and as the experiment requires no apparatus, I have recom
 mended it in my lectures for the last two years.

    In our communication     published in the Proceedings of the Royal
Society,' vol. 56 (in which we gave results of the determination of the
calories evolved and analysis of the products of combustion of various
                                                                    T 2

222               Messrs. W. Macnab and E. KistorL
explosives), reference was made to certain experiments we had then
begun for the purpose of determining the actual maximum tempera
ture reached during explosion.     We have now made a long series of
experiments in this direction, and propose to communicate some of the
results so far obtained, although the research is not yet complete.
   Some experiments have already been made by others for the pur
pose of determining     the temperature during explosion by placing
strips    metal of different melting point in a closed bomb and
         of
observing the result after firing. Noble and Abel in their well-known
communication on explosives found in this way that the temperature
produced by the explosion of black gunpowder was slightly above the
melting point of platinum.
  There have been also several communications, on the same subject,
made by others, who have deduced the temperature during explosion
from theoretical considerations, but these calculations involved assump
tions which as yet do not rest on an experimental basis. It appeared
to us desirable, therefore, to endeavour to determine experimentally,
and with greater, accuracy than has hitherto been done, the actual
temperature developed when an explosive is fired in a closed vessel.
   The practical solution of this problem     is,
                                            however, beset by several
difficulties amongst others, the intensity of the temperature, the
              ;
extreme shortness of duration of the maximum        temperature, and the
necessity of conducting the explosive reactions in   closed vessel.
                                                        a
  We were led to try       a  modification of the pyrometric method
developed by Sir W. C. Boberts-Austen,      by observing that a thin
platinum wire used for firing the explosive in the vessel by electricity
was often melted by the heat produced by the explosion, while thicker
platinum wires, which served to support the capsule containing the-
explosive, were unaffected.
   This showed that the temperature reached was above the melting
point of platinum, and also that the duration of the maximum tem
perature was very short.    In the case of the thin wire, the small mass
of the metal allows the heat to penetrate    itwith sufficient rapidity to
raise itto the melting point before the period of maximum temperature
ispast, while with the thick wire the time does not suffice for the
largermass to be heated to the same extent.
  These considerations led us to argue that          rhodium-platinum
                                                    if
couples of wires of different diameters, sufficiently thick not to be-
melted during explosion, were used in a bomb, the deflections of the
galvanometer indicated would vary inversely with the sizes of the
wires forming the couples that in this way we might get data which
                           ;
would enable us to calculate the deflection of an infinitely thin couple
which could be capable of taking up the heat in an infinitely short
time, and that this deflection, expressed in degrees, would repre
sent the actual maximum        temperature   reached.       We also expected

                      Researches on Modern Explosives.                       223
 that the indication of the galvanometer would show the rapidity with
 which the temperature rose at the moment of the explosion, as well
as the rate at which the cooling took place.
    Through the kindness of Sir W. C. Roberts- Austen we were enabled
to make some preliminary experiments in his laboratory, connecting
the wires from      a couple in our    bomb with the galvanometer in his
photographic-recording      apparatus.     The results of these experiments
were so encouraging that a similar photographic-recording              apparatus
was procured, only introducing such slight modifications as were
required to make it more suitable for our purpose.
   We   also had a special   lid made  for the calorimetric bomb previously
described    in our former communication, this lid being similar to the
other, with     the exception of two insulated conical pins, one made of
pure platinum and the other of platinum alloyed with 10 per cent, of
rhodium. These pins were used in the inside of the lid as points of
attachment for the thermo-couple, their ends outside the lid being con
nected with the galvanometer.          The couples were made of platinum
and rhodium-platinum wires in contact. Several couples of different
thicknesses were prepared for us by Johnson and Matthey, fusing the
ends of the platinum and rhodium-platinum wires together and then
drawing the junction through a die until it had the same diameter as the
rest of the wire.
    As we shall have to refer to these couples by number in future,
we give in Table I the diameters and areas, and the number by which
we distinguish each couple. As will be seen, ten different couples
were made, the diameters varying from 0-044 to 0-01 of 1 inch : —

   Fig.  1  shows the explosive bomb with the lid separate, and the
arrangement       of connections which are made through the lid are
clearly seen. Three insulated pins pass through the lid ; two of them,
as above indicated, are those which connect with the thermo-couple,
the other one is used as one of the terminals for the firing wire, the

 other terminal being attached to the body of the bomb outside.          Thus
 there are  two  electric circuits absolutely  insulated from  each other.
    The position of the cup which contains the explosive can be seen in
 the figure (fig. 1), and the position of the couple in respect to the cup
                                      Fio.  1.
 has l>een varied   in  a way that   will  be explained  later on. The con
nections from     the firing wire were led to an electric battery, which is
set in action when it is required to ignite the explosive.
    The connections from the thermo-couple are led to the galvanometer,
 which is inside the recording apparatus shown in fig. 2. The general
details of the apparatus are well known, and have been described by
Sir W. C. Roberts-Austen.
   Lime-light is used to throw a spot of light on the mirror of the
galvanometer, from which it is thrown on to a photographic plate
through a horizontal slit, equal in length to the breadth of the plate.
This photographic plate is held in a weighted frame, which falls past
the slit with a rate of descent uniformly regulated by clock-work, con

                      Researches  on Modern Explosives.                 225
trolled by adjustable    vanes.   The rate of descent of the plate in the
experiments     was one inch in 2£ seconds,  or equal to four-tenths of an
inch for   every second of time.
                                    Fig. 2.
    In using  the apparatus, a datum line is first traced, and this is done
 by letting the plate fall with the galvanometer at rest, the circuit being
 closed, when the spot of light traces a continuous vertical line at one
 edge of the plate.    The plate is then brought back to its original posi
 tion and re-started on its descent. After it has fallen a short distance,
 in order to make sure it       has acquired a steady rate of motion, the
 explosive is fired and the thermo-couple in the bomb is in consequence
 heated, and the current generated deflects the mirror of the galvano
 meter, and therefore the spot of light, horizontally and proportionately
 to the temperature attained by the couple ; and then, as cooling sets in,
 the original position of the spot of light is gradually resumed.
    The result is recorded as a curve, which shows the combined move
 ments of the spot of light and of the photographic plate.
    Fig. 3 shows one of the plates on which three records were succes
 sively taken.    In these three separate experiments, couples of different
 thicknesses, but with the same charge and kind of explosive, were
 used.

   The maximum deflections, as shown by Pi, P2, P3, are seen to be
in inverse order to the thickness of the couples used, the greatest
deflection being obtained with the thinnest couple.

    It ia also noticeable that the thinner the couple the sooner is the
maximum point reached, i.e., the steeper is the curve and the sharper
its point, while with a thicker couple the point is more rounded, and
the maximum      more slowly reached.
    Fig. 4 shows photographs of five results, two with a thick, and three
with a very thin couple.

    Many difficulties were encountered in carrying out these researches
 in order to secure reasonable accuracy in the work.    Several hundred

228                  Messrs. W. Macnab mid E. ltistori.
experiments have been made on the lines above indicated, but a large
numl>er of the results have had to l>e discarded.
    To begin with, one point which had to be studied was whether the
size of the grain of the explosive would make any difference in the
results; but after numerous experiments we have come to the conclu
sion that, within reasonable limits, the size of the grain exercises no
influence under the conditions of these experiments.
    In all the experiments about to be described, the explosives used
were all gelatinised preparations of gun-cotton alone, or mixed with
nitro-glycerine, all in the form of small grains, and the charges were
fired in the bomb full of air.
    A difficulty observed was that the deflections of the galvanometer
were different, everything else being equal, when the position of the
couples varied in relation to the position of the explosive.                 It l>ecame
necessary, therefore, to carry out a series of experiments in order to
determine which position of the couple gave greatest and most uniform
results.
    The following Table       II  gives the results of the experiments made"
to find the hottest place in the bomb.           The same charge of the same
explosive     and  the  same   couple   were  used   in all the experiments, the
only difference being that the position of the couple in relation to the
explosive which was held in a platinum             capsule.      Three experiments
were made in each position.

    These results are shown graphically in Diagram 1, where the vertical
distance represents the deflection of the galvanometer, and the hori
zontal the position of the junction of the couple in relation to the
charge.     The deflection is least when the junction is embedded in the
charge, and greatest when about 3 inches above it.
    As will l>e seen from the diagram, there is very little variation in the
results between 2| inches and 3^ inches (the maximum distance allowed
by the size of the bomb), and as the actual maximum was shown at
3  inches, we have in all future experiments placed the thermo-couple at
3  inches above the surface of the charge.

   With charges of     less than 4 grammes the results were very          irregular,
and we have not fired charges larger than 7 grammes, the bomb not
being constructed to withstand high pressures.
   Having thus ascertained the conditions of working which gave fairly
concordant results, a series of experiments was made with couples of
different diameters, and, by means of introducing some suitable resist
ance   into the circuit of the galvanometer, it was arranged that                  the

glycerine, and was in the form of thin square flakes.                    In each case
three experiments were made, and the results are shown in Table III.

      After the first experiment, the wire  was partially   fused, but not broken.
    It will be seen that the results are fairly uniform, the average
variation from the maximum to mean being only between 2 and 2i per
cent.
    In the   case of couple   No.  8, which is only 0-015 inch        in diameter, we
found that after the first experiment it was partially fused but not
broken, thus showing that we had reached the practical limit of fineness
of wire for this particular explosive.
    The character of the increase of the deflection in inverse proportion
to the diameter of the couple is clearly shown in Diagram 3, where two
similar curves are shown for two different explosives.
    The curve A shows the results given in Table III, and the curve
B the results of a similar series of experiments made with gun-cotton
fired with couples 2, 5, 8, 9, and 10.
    In the   case of gun-cotton, the temperature being so much lower, aa
clearly   shown    in the diagram, we have been able to use thinner couples,
and there was no fusion up to No. 10, which is 0 01 inch diameter, but
a thinner couple (0*005 inch) was fused.            The curves have been drawn
as   nearly as possible following the actual measurements, which are
indicated by dots surrounded by circles ; as it will be seen, the curves
are very regular, and it is particularly noticeable that the curves of the
two explosives      are very   similar in character.
    In order to get comparative data for several explosives, we made

   The vertical lines indicate, as before, the maximum deflection of the
galvanometer obtained with charges of 4 grammes with couples 2 and 5
for the following explosives : Gun-cotton, cordite, ballistite of 70 per
cent, soluble nitro-cotton, and 30 per cent, nitro-glycerine, and ballistite
containing 50 per cent, soluble nitro-cotton and 50 per cent, nitro
glycerine.
   In the same way as in Diagram 2, each of the, points corresponding
have been connected by straight lines to show the parallelism of the
observations.
    It will   be seen from        the diagram        that the larger the proportion of
 nitro-glycerine in the ballistite            the higher        is the temperature during

  explosion  ; but, on the other hand, cordite, although it contains as much
  as 58 per cent, nitro-glycerine,      owing to the fact that it contains also
  vaseline, gives a temperature lower than that of ballistite containing
  only 30 per cent, nitro-glycerine and no vaseline.            Of course, the
 minimum deflection is the one due to gun-cotton, which contains no
 nitro-glycerine.
     Similar experiments have also been repeated with other explosives
 and with different charges, and, in every case, the same comparative
 results have been obtained.
     The above refers only to a part of the experiments which have been
 carried out so far.      Another series is now in progress for determining
 the other necessary elements which will lie required before we can
 accurately express the value of these deflections of the galvanometer in
 degrees of temperature.         One important element which comes into play
 is the inertia of the galvanometer itself in connection with the short
 ness of the time during which the maximum temperature exists, and
 there are also other points which are being investigated, and these        will
 form the subject of a further communication.
     We have, however, thought it advisable not to delay communicating
 the above results, as already the described method shows the possibility
 first of all of obtaining approximately an idea of the temperature
during explosion, and, secondly, it shows a clear way by which the
comparative temperatures for various explosives can be determined.
 These, taken in connection with the results shown in our former com
munication, will serve, we hope, to give a better knowledge              of the
different modern explosives which are now commonly used.
" The Spectrum of « Aquilie."              By Sir Norman Lockyer, K.C.B.,

    The study      of enhanced lines throws considerable light on the
spectrum    of  a  Aquilae, the pecidiarities of which were first described
by Professor Pickering* and Dr. Scheinert in 1889.           In this spectrum
the lines of hydrogen are strong and broad, but the additional lines,
instead of being faint and sharp as in most other stars of this class,
are faint and diffuse.       Dr. Scheiner stated that these apparent bands
were identical with the most conspicuous groups of lines in the solar
spectrum, and further that this appearance of the spectrum             can be

imitated by holding a rather faint drawing of the solar spectrum at
such a distance that the individual lines are no longer visible.
    From a consideration of the photographs taken at Harvard College
Observatory, Professor Pickering suggested in 1891 that the diffuse-
ness of the lines in the spectrum of a. Aquilse and certain other
stars was perhaps due to a rapid rotation of the star.*                 That rotation
might        be capable   of producing   such   effects had   already l)een suggested
by Abney in 1877.1
    Photographs taken at Kensington with large dispersion, during 1892,
led to the adoption of Professor Pickering's view, and the spectrum of
a Aquila; was classed with that of              fi Arietis, in which we apparently
got the same lines quite sharp.J
   In       1895    Dr. Scheiner again referred to this spectrum,§ and sug
gested that it represents a transition stage from the first to the second
type ; as an alternative explanation, he mentions the view that the
spectrum may be a composite one, in which a spectrum of the first
type is superposed upon one of the second.
    In a recent paper|] Dr. Vogel has discussed the spectrum of a Aquila?
chiefly with reference to its motion in the line of sight, but he also
considers the question of the haziness of the lines.                He refers to some
experimental photographs which depict the solar spectrum with its
lines broadened by a cylindrical lens, or by a photograph taken out of
focus, and states that spectra of this kind have been obtained in which
the close        lines ran    together so as to produce a spectrum resembling
that of a Aquila;.           He adds that the exact comparison of the two
spectra shows that the agreement is not perfect, in particular that the
G group is hardly indicated in the spectrum of a Aquilse, while it
comes out strongly in the solar spectrum when thrown out of focus.
He accordingly places the spectrum of a Aquila; in his Class la 3, of
which a Cygni, fi Cassiopeia;, and Procyon are members,1l and further
concludes that the lines are broadened in consequence of rapid rotation,
without, however, referring to previous suggestions to the same effect.
    The general result is that while Vogel classes a Aquila; with a Cygni,
which,        on the meteoritic hypothesis, is a star of increasing tempera
ture, the work at Kensington indicates that it should be classed with
stars like fi Arietis, which there is every reason to believe to be cool
ing. This difference as to facts is so important that the whole question
has been re-investigated.

 234             Sir Norman Lockyer and Mr. A. Fowler.
                            Tlie Kensington Photographs.
    An investigation of the spectrum of             a.  Aquilae was commenced at
 Kensington in      1890, and,     with the various instruments employed up
 to 1892, fifteen negatives were obtained.*                  In all these the lines
 were ill defined, and it was decided to take a special series of photo
 graphs
         " in order to determine whether the haziness of its
                                                                          spectrum
 lines is invariable."! Since then a considerable number of photo
graphs has been obtained, but although variations have been suspected
it is found difficult to establish their reality. One thing seems quite
certain, namely, that the lines are always ill defined.
    At the Royal Society Conversazione in 1894, enlarged copies of
photographs of the spectra of a Aquilae and /J Arietis were exhibited
 which indicated that Pickering's view that the haziness of the lines is
due to rotation is probably correct.
    Dr. Scheiner's experiment of photographing the solar spectrum out
of focus has since been repeated ; but while it was found possible to
produce bands in this way, only a few of them agree with those in
a Aquilae.     Among these coincident bands are 4031 — 4036 (Mn),
4046 (Fe), 4064 (Fe), 4132—4135 (chiefly Fe), 4143 6— 4144 (Fe),
4226-9 (Ca), 4250 3— 4251 (Fe), 4260 2— 4260 6 (Fe), 4271-3— 4271 9
(Fe).
    On the other hand,         by taking an out-of-focus enlargement of a
negative  of  the    spectrum     of /J Arietis, the violet being put more out
of focus than the blue, the spectrum of a Aquilae is almost perfectly
reproduced (see Plate).         The difference in width of the bands appears
to be sufficiently explained by the gradually increasing dispersion in
prismatic spectra as the violet end is approached.                 With the instru
ment employed at Kensington a tenth-metre near X 4046 is repre
sented by a distance on the photographs about 1-4 times as great as
that corresponding to the same difference of wave-length iiear X 4384 ;
and since the velocity which woidd produce a displacement of one-
tenth metre at X 4384 would produce a displacement of 0 92 tenth-
metre at X 4046, the displacements on the photographs for the same
velocity, with the particular instrument employed, will be in the pro
portion of 1 to 1-29 at X 4384 and X 4046 respectively.
                              Classification of the    Star.
    This experiment appears to be a sufficient demonstration                 of the
essential similarity of the spectra of a Aquilae and fi Arietis,            so that
the former conclusion       that the two stars should be classed together         is
perfectly justified.

                               The Spectrum       of a. Aquilce.                     235
   According to the earlier work at Kensington, stars like (3 Arietis
were classed in Group Va,* that-            is,
                                  between stars like Sirius and those
like Procyon. The work on enhanced lines which has been done since
then enables us to carry on the work of classification with much
greater  precision, since we have now    means of estimating relative
                                                     a
temperatures with considerable accuracy.     In this way we learn that
stars at each stage of temperature fall into two groups, one of which
represents stars of increasing temperature, and the other including
stars of decreasing temperature,   a Aquilse and     Arietis fall in the
                                                                   /?
latter group, and are to be regarded therefore as stars in which photo
spheres have formed.    The later work on the classification of spectra
has shown that     itsufficient for all practical purposes to include both
                        is
in the Sirian group of stars.
  This question of classification         further elucidated by a more
                                                is
detailed examination of the spectrun of a. Aquilse in relation to a. Cygni
and the Sirian stars.     The foregoing demonstration of the likeness
between a Aquilse and      Arietis leads us to expect that the origins of
                                /?
the lines in the spectrum of a Aquilse will be the same in the main as
those of  P Arietis and Sirius.    In these stars the temperature of the
absorbing vapours      intermediate between that of the arc and that at
                          is
which enhanced lines appear alone, so that the spectra show both arc
and enhanced lines. The origins of the chief enhanced lines in the
spectrum of Sirius have already been investigated,         and practically
                                                                        t
the same lines occur in          Arietis.
                                     fi     Besides these enhanced lines
there are several well-known arc lines, such as the iron triplets and
the blue line of calcium, which can be readily identified.    The origins
of some of the lines of both classes are shown in the plate which
accompanies this paper, enhanced lines being shown at the bottom and
arc lines at the top.
   It will be seen that enhanced lines of iron appear in a Aquilse, but
have not the same relative intensity as in a Cygni the most enhanced
                                                                   ;
line of iron (X4233-3), for example, which in a Cygni        represented    is
by a very strong and well-defined line,     in a Aquilse very weak and
                                                      is
hazy.   On the other hand, some of the enhanced lines of iron less
refrangible than Hy are fairly prominent. The principal enhanced
lines of magnesium, strontium, and titanium are also certainly present, as
shown in the plate. The enhanced double line of silicium at XX 4128-1,
4131*1,   ifpresent,  very weak,
                         is         moderately strong hazy line, rather
                                            a
less refrangible than the silicium double, making      rather difficult to
                                                                    it
determine whether the latter          is   certainly present.
   Among the arc lines present are those of the iron triplet in the
violet (XX 4045-90, 4063 76, 4071 79), which are clearly seen, but the
iron triplet in the blue (XX 4383 70— 4415-27) cannot be identified

                —
(XX 4030-88 4035*88)           is covered in the spectrum of the star by what
appears to be a broad hazy line, which is probably composed of the
individual components of the quartet merged together. The arc line
of calcium at        A. 4226-90 is one of the most prominent                 lines in the
spectrum.
    The classification      of the spectrum of a Aquilse may therefore be
considered as settled;         it does not sufficiently resemble a Cygni to
justify Vogel's view that it should           be classed with that type of star,
while, on the other hand, apart from the haziness of the lines, it does
bear a very strong resemblance to B Arietis and other Sirian stars,
and should therefore be classed with them.

his Class    la  2,  with Sirius, B Arietis, &c, but this         does    not materially
modify the conclusions arrived at.]
    There are other points on which this demonstration of the similarity
of a Aquilse and B Arietis may be brought to bear, among them being
the determination of the lines most suitable for the measurement of
the velocity of the star in the line of sight, and the approximate deter
mination of the velocity of rotation necessary to produce the observed
haziness of the lines.

                                        of Sight.
     For the measurement of the velocity              of a Aquilse, Deslandres has
employed comparison spectra of hydrogen, iron, and calcium.t                        Vogel,
 however, questions the advantage of using the spectra of iron and
 calcium as comparisons for this purpose, on the ground that " the lines
 in the spectrum of a Aquilae
 and     Hj
                                     are so diffuse

 X 4481 can be identified with known lines."                He himself has used the
 Hy    line alone   as  a term  of comparison,     and   concludes     that there are no
 indications of a periodic change in the velocity of the star in the line
 of sight, such as was supposed by Deslandres.
      We now know with certainty the origins of a considerable number
  of the lines in a Aquilse, so that measurements of the velocity of the
  star are placed on a surer basis.          Since the spectrum of a Aquilae is
  simpler than that of the sun, some of the broad lines do not represent
  confused groups of lines, but are broadened individual lines. The latter
  class of lines, when of known origin, seems to be well adapted for the

measurement of the velocity of the star, for though they may he still
somewhat       wide, they are much less so than the lines of hydrogen.
Among      these broadened   individual lines are : —

    Titanium (enhanced lines).— 4417-98, 4443 98.
    Strontium.— 421566.
    The enhanced line of magnesium at 4481-3 is usually sharply denned
in stellar spectra, but the fact that it is generally fluffy in the compari
son spark disqualifies   it for accurate measurements.
                            The Velocity  of Rotation.
    Assuming that /3 Arietis represents the spectrum of a Aquilse as it
would appear if the axis were directed towards the earth, we can get
a general idea of the velocity of rotation necessary to produce the
observed broadening of the lines. For this purpose lines which occur
in groups are obviously unsuitable, but we can utilise the lines to which
attention has just     been drawn.      Taking the enhanced line of iron at
 X 4178-95, we find that its thickness is increased from about two to
four tenth-metres, and this corresponds to a surface velocity of the star
 at the equator of about 45 miles per second, supposing that the axis is
 perpendicular to the line of sight.      Similar measurements of the broad-
 ening of the magnesium line 4481*3 yield         a  velocity of about 40 miles
 per second.      Since only a small portion        of the surface of the star
 could exhibit the effects of the maximum velocity, it is probable that
 these values are too low, really representing the equatorial velocity of
 rotation resolved along the line of sight with reference to a point some
 where between the limb and centre of the star.
     Dr. Vogel gives reasons in his paper for supposing the velocity of
 rotation to be possibly 27 kilometres (16-8 miles) per second, but this
 determination does not depend upon measurements of individual
 lines.
                               General Conclusions.
     The investigation of the Kensington photographs of the spectrum of
 a. Aquilae has thus led to the following conclusions : —
     (1) Apart from the general haziness of the lines, the spectrum pre
 sents no unfamiliar features.
     (2) The spectrum is of the Sirian type, showing enhanced lines of
 various metals, and a smaller number of arc lines.
     (3) A rapid rotation of the star, as first suggested by Pickering,
 appears to be a simple and sufficient explanation of the peculiarities of
  the spectrum.

    The sum of the velocities with which the positive and the negative
ions that are produced in gases by the Rontgen rays move when in a
unit electric field has already been determined by an indirect method
by E. Rutherford.* In the experiments here described the velocity
was determined     in   a number of gases         for the positive and negative
ions separately, by comparing the ionic velocity directly with that of
a stream of gas.       The stream of gas was made to flow between two
concentric cylinders, which were maintained at different potentials.
By passing a narrow beam of Rontgen rays through the cylinders at
right angles to their length, a narrow layer of ionised gas was pro
duced. Due to the electric field between the two cylinders, the ions
of this layer tended to move radially towards, or away from, the axis
of the cylinders, but at the same time they were carried along by the
stream of gas.       Of the ions of this layer which travelled inwards,
those that started from the inner surface of the outer cylinder were
carried a distance X by the gas stream before they reached the surface
 of the inner cylinder.
    This distance is dependent directly upon the mean velocity of the
gas stream, and inversely upon the difference of potential between
the two cylinders.       For obtaining the difference of potential which
must be used to allow the ions to be carried a certain distance along
the tubes by the gas stream the inner cylinder was divided at some
distance from the beam of rays into two parts, insulated from each

  other.    That one of these parts which was not traversed by the rays
  was connected to a pair of quadrants of an electrometer, so that it
 was possible to tell when any ions reached it. A series of readings
 was taken for the charge reaching the electrometer in a given time
 for different values of the potential of the outer cylinder.                From this
 was determined the value of this potential for which the ions starting
 from the outer edge of the ionised layer were just able to reach the
 juncture in the inner cylinder.
     The ionic velocity in a unit electric field is given by the equation —
 where     U  is the mean velocity of the gas stream between the cylinders,
     b is the inner radius of the outer cylinder,
    a is the outer radius of the inner cylinder,
     A  is the potential of the outer cylinder,       corresponding to
     X  the distance defined above.
     To avoid the presence of vortices in the gas at the place where it
 was exposed to the rays, a sufficiently small velocity was used, and
  the gas was previously passed through a long portion of the cylinder
 to allow the motion to assume a steady state.
    The disturbing influence upon the electric field between the cylinders
 of the free charges formed in the gas during the conduction was
 diminished by using weak rays.           The fall of potential at the electrodes*
 was also reduced          by this means.      For diminishing the amount of
 ionisation    due to the secondary radiation produced at the metal sur
 face^ the cylinders were made of aluminium, for which metal the effect
 is the least.
    The spreading of the ions due to diffusion produces an error, the
amount of which increases with the time required for the ions to travel
between the two cylinders.
    The value of this time is found from the equation              T   =  X/U, where
 X and U have the same significance as above.
    The experimental values obtained for the velocity decreased as T
increased, and from a series of results with different values of T the
velocity could be obtained corresponding to T = O. Since in that
case the effects       of diffusion and similar causes disappear, this result
was taken as the desired value of the ionic velocity.
    For testing the accuracy of the method, in addition to using different
values of     U    and   X,    changes were also made in the intensity of the
rays, in the diameter of the internal cylinder, and in the metal which
formed the inner surface of the outer cylinder.
    Determinations were made with the gases when dry and when satu

    It is believed that in no case is the error greater than 5 per cent,
 while most of the observations indicate a considerably greater accu
 racy.    It is observed that the presence of moisture always diminishes
 the velocity of the negative ions, and that in carbonic acid the velocity
 of the positive ions is at the same time markedly increased.                        The
 velocity of the negative ions is the greater in all of the cases except
 for moist carbonic acid. The ratios of the velocities of the ions pre
 viously determined for these gases by the writert were between those
 given above for the dry and for the moist gases, as the influence of
 moisture was unknown at that time, and the gases had not been dried.
    E. Rutherford^ does not state whether he used dry gases in deter
 mining the sum of the velocities of the two ions produced by Rontgen
 rays; but his result for air (3-2 cm. per second) agrees with the sum of
 the values separately obtained above for the two ions in dry air,
 while his values for oxygen (2-8 cm. per second) and hydrogen
 (10*4 cm. per second) correspond to those for the moist gases.                       His
 value for carbonic acid (2-15 cm. per second) is higher than those

here obtained. The value obtained by E. Kutherford* for the velocity
of the negative ions produced in dry carbonic acid (0-78 cm. per second)
by the action of ultra-violet light, is quite near to that here obtained
(08 1   cm. per second) for the ions produced by Rontgen rays, but his
values for dry air (1*4 cm. per second) and dry hydrogen (3-9 cm. per
second) are considerably smaller.
   In discharge from points, A. P. Chattockt has obtained for the
velocities of the positive and negative ions in dry air 413 and 540 cm.
per second respectively for a field of 1 E.S.U. per cm., which values are
quite close to those obtained here for the ions produced by Rontgen
rays.
   J. S. TownsendJ has shown that from the coefficients of diffusion
of   the  ions and from their velocities it is possible to compare the
charges carried by the different ions, and also to compare them with
those carried by the ions in the electrolysis of liquids.                   By using the
velocities given above with the coefficients of diffusion determined by
J.  S. Townsend, the values of Ne are obtained, N being the number of
molecules in 1 c.c. of the gas and e the charge carried by each ion.
The results thus obtained for the moist gases, air, oxygen, and
hydrogen, perhaps justify the statement that the charges carried by
the positive and the negative ions are equal, and that the charge is the
same for the different gases, and is equal to the charge carried by the
hydrogen ion in the electrolysis of liquids.
    The values of Ne obtained for the positive ions in these gases when
dry are considerably larger than the above, while in carbonio acid all
of the results are over 20 per cent, smaller.

    1. In August last I presented to the Society a memoir on the inheri
tance of coat-colour in thoroughbred horses, and of eye-colour in man.
This memoir, which was read in November of last year, presented the
novel feature of determining correlation between characters which were
not capable a priori of being quantitatively measured.                    The theoretical

part of that memoir was somewhat brief, but I showed by illustrations
that the method could be extended to deal with problems like the
effectiveness of vaccination and of the antitoxin treatment in diphtheria.
More     recently, in studying the phenomena of reversion in Basset
Hounds, Mr. Bramley-Moore indicated to me how my method, although
correct in theory, differed sensibly in the numerical results with the pro
cesses of interpolating employed.             I then proposed a new method, and
the analytical discussion of its details was worked out in part by Mr.
Bramley-Moore himself, by Mr. L. N. G. Filon, M.A., and by myself.
Dr. Alice Lee also came to our assistance, and the result is the present
joint paper. On the basis of the new methods, we have already worked
out upwards of sixty coefficients of correlation, principally of heredity.
Thus the thirty-six coefficients of heredity for coat-colour in horses and
eye-colour in man have been re-calculated, as well as twelve coefficients
for heredity in coat-colour of Basset Hounds given in a paper on the
Law of Reversion presented on December 28th, and about to appear
in the ' Proceedings.' The great growth of the theoretical investigations
has, however, compelled me to break up the old memoir* of last              August
into two parts, the one (the present) dealing only with theory, and the
other with its application to inheritance in the horse and man.
    2. The theory of the present memoir depends upon a very simple
feature of normal correlation.             If z&ri&Xi  ....  &n be the frequency
of a complex of characters lying between Xi and Xi + Sxu                        and
Xs + &j                Xn and xn + Sxn, where Xp is the deviation of the pth
character from its mean, then
                                    dz          d?z
                                   drpq       dxp dxq
where rm is the correlation of the ^th and gth organs.
    This simple differential relation enables us to expand z for any
 number of characters in powers of the correlation coefficients (neces
sarily less than unity) by Maclaurin's theorem. But dince we may
 replace a differential with regard to a coefficient of correlation by a
 double differential with regard to the corresponding organs, the coeffi
 cients of correlation may be put zero before instead of after the
 differentiation.      In other words, we obtain a symboUc operator which,
 applied    to  a  normal    surface of frequency for n-uncorrelated organs,
 converts     it into    a correlated surface of frequency with \n(n-\)
 coefficients   of correlation of arbitrary values. This operator gives us by
 aid of certain symbolic equations the expansion of the Ji-fold integral

    The calculation of these functions is shown to be easy, and their
properties are investigated.      In this manner the volume of a frequency
surface of the nth order cut off by n planes parallel to the n co-ordi
nate planes is shown to be capable of calculation, and its value is
determined in the numerical illustrations given for example of 1, 2,
 3 up to 6-fold correlation.    It may be noted that by putting Z\ = z3 =
    =        = «„, we have really     obtained a result which enables us to
find the " area " of   a " spherical

 of a series ascending by powers and products of the cosines of the
angles between its faces.
    The application of these results to the correlation of characters not
quantitatively measurable, arises from the fact that the n-fold integral
above given, and which we have shown how to evalute, measures the
 total frequency beyond certain boundaries.               We can observe, for
example, whether horses' coats are bay or darker (or chestnut or lighter),
whether eyes are grey or lighter (or, dark grey or darker).               Thus by
forming   mass frequencies instead of frequency distributions for small
changes   of character, we can find equations to determine the correla
tion. The probable error of such correlation, the convergency of the
series, and other points are investigated.

coefficients allied to Mr. Yule's coefficient of association but somewhat
closer in value to the coefficient of correlation are considered, and their
relative closeness measured.

heredity in horses,   dogs, and man, and        it is shown how normality of

upon as a first approximation.

in producing superior offspring. It is shown, for example, that if an
individual who possesses a degree of character only found in one in
twenty be considered "exceptional," then eighteen times as many
exceptional men will be born of non-exceptional parents as of excep
 tional parents ; but on the other hand, exceptional parents produce
exceptional offspring at a rate ten times as great as non-exceptional
parents, the greater gross product of the latter being due to their
much greater numbers.         In other words, distinguished parents are
more likely to have distinguished offspring than undistinguished — ten
times as likely — and yet only one distinguished man in nineteen will
be born of distinguished parents.       The importance of such conceptions
for both natural and artificial breeding    can hardly be over-estimated.

    The experiments described in this paper were begun with the object
 of assisting  in the determination of the relative values of the atomic
 weights of cobalt and nickel, but were continued with the further
 purpose of testing the validity of the law of Dulong and Petit.
    The metals cobalt and nickel closely resemble each other in density,
 melting point, and other physical properties, as well as in atomic
 weight.    The pure metals were prepared for the purposes of these
  experiments with the most scrupulous care, the cobalt by taking

advantage of the slight solubility of purpureo-cobaltamine hydrochloride
in strongly acid solutions, and the nickel by deposition from the car-
bonyl compound and subsequent solution of the metal and electro
deposition.    Both were fused by means of an oxyhydrogen flame, and
afterwards    shaped into bars.       For the estimations of specific heat
between 15° C. and 100° C. the differential              steam    calorimeter     of
Professor Joly was employed.
    The  mean specific heat of cobalt    within  these   limits of temperature
was found to be 0-10303.
    The mean specific heat of nickel was found to be 0-10842.
    In order further to test the method and the conclusion from the
case of cobalt and nickel, gold was compared with platinum, and copper
with iron.
    The following are the mean specific heats for these pure metals after
fusion, and within the same limits of temperature : —
                         Gold ....
                         Platinum
                         Copper     .
                         Iron   ....
    When   these   values for the specific heats are multiplied by the
respective   atomic  weights of the several metals, the products are not
 constant, as the law of Dulong and Petit would seem to require if
applicable at all temperatures.
    The influence of impurities on the specific heat of several metals
 was then investigated, and a number of results are given, from which
 it appears that small quantities of carbon or other non-metallic element
 tend to increase the specific heat appreciably, while the presence of a
 small quantity of a foreign metal seems to produce little effect.
    A series of calorimetric experiments were next made by the method
 of mixtures on the two pure metals cobalt and nickel, at the temperature
 of solid carbon dioxide,   -  78-4°, and at that of boiling oxygen,     -  182-5°.
    The results, which are given below, show that as the temperature is
 reduced the value for nickel declines more rapidly than that for cobalt,
 and hence that, when the mean results are plotted               out, the curves
 steadily approach each other.
    The mean specific heats of cobalt and nickel now stand          as follows  : —
                                              Cobalt.          Nickel.
                                             0 10303           010842
                             -78-4°.         00939             0-0975

 and by calculation    from the last two results from        -78-4 to -182-4°,

  It seems probable that at absolute zero the values of the products of
specific heat, multiplied by atomic weight, would be identical, or differ
only by the very small amount due to experimental error.*
                                         Appendix.
  The following calculations have been made by E. R. Verity, Assoc.
R.C.S., and H. L. Mann, Assoc. R.C.S. :—
  If cobalt and nickel were in the states of perfect gases, their specific
heats at constant volume would be
                               &o
                                     = 0-04123        for cobalt.
                               k0 =    0 04 145 for nickel.
   This is on the assumption that kQ                   multiplied by the atomic weight
is the same as for hydrogen. It is not                 unreasonable to assume that in no
state can the substance have a smaller    specific heat than     It easy      k0.          is
to show that for any of the metals      the specific heat at atmospheric
pressure K     not more than
                   is           per cent,
                                       2   different from the specific heat
under any other condition, such as great hydrostatic pressure, to keep
its volume constant.   Our ignorance of the molecular state of solid                   a        is
so great, that we cannot even speculate on how         that when gramme

freely or     subjected to great hydrostatic pressure which prevents

                                                       it
real sensible heat, and the energy 0*062 enters      as some kind of     it
energy of disgregation, necessary because of change of tempera
ture, and having nothing to do with change of volume or pressure.
The facts are not explainable by assuming that the atomic weights
are wrong, because, as we             cobalt and nickel, K approaches
                                      see from
the value      at low temperatures.

                                                              if
is correctly deduced from the above measurements, we may say that
in the solid state the product of the atomic weight and specific heat
may be anything between what                 it   is   for hydrogen and       2   "7   times this
amount.  The formula            is

                                     (Abstract.)
   In this communication are presented the results of the investigation
of the group of salts of the above series in which M is represented by
zinc, R being represented by potassium, rubidium, and caesium.                   The
investigation     is similar  to   that  which   has previously   been   carried  out
for the double sulphates of the analogous series.t              The work consists
of very large numbers of measurements of the exterior angles of the
crystals, determinations of density, refractive index, optic axial angle,
orientation of optical ellipsoid, and effect of change of temperature on
the optical properties, together with the calculation of all the morpho
logical and physical constants derivable from the measurements.                  The
main results are as follows      : —
   The morphological axial angle of the rubidium zinc salt                is approxi
mately    the mean    of the axial   angles  of  potassium   zinc and  caesium   zinc
selenate.
   In the    cases of thirty-three      out of thirty-six angles between the
exterior faces, the value for the rubidium zinc salt is intermediate
between the values for the other two salts, and the exceptions are only
apparent, being due to changes of opposite sign in adjacent angles
following the rule.
   The morphological axial ratios for rubidium zinc selenate are inter
mediate between the ratios of potassium zinc and caesium zinc selenate.
   The common habit of the crystals of the rubidium zinc salt is of an
              « '
                  Koy. Soc. Proc..' vol. 64, p. 27.

              Double Selenatcs    of the Series RaM(SeOJ2,6H,0.           249
intermediate character to the habits of the crystals of the potassium
zinc and caesium zinc salts.
    An increase of density accompanies a rise in the atomic weight of
the alkali metal, and it is greater for the replacement of potassium by
rubidium than for that of the latter by          caesium in the proportion of
5:4.
    The molecular volumes show a similar progression in the order of
the atomic weights of the alkali metals, but the replacement of rubi
dium by caesium is marked by the greater change.
     The distance ratios (topic axes) indicate an extension of the distance
separating the structural units in all three axial directions, the maxi
mum being along the symmetry axis.
    All these rules relating to the exterior      morphology of the crystals
are    precisely analogous    to  those  previously shown to apply to the
double sulphates.
    The optical ellipsoid (indicatrix) is found to rotate about the sym
metry axis, when the atomic weight of the alkali metal is raised. The
amount of rotation is twice as great when caesium replaces rubidium as
when the latter replaces potassium.
     The mean refractive index (mean of all three indices) of the rubi
dium zinc salt is intermediate between the mean indices of the other
 two salts.
     The greatest change accompanies the replacement of rubidium           by
 caesium.
     The double refraction diminishes at an increasing rate as the atomic
 weight of the alkali metal increases.
     It follows from the above that the axial ratios of the optical indi
 catrix for the rubidium zinc salt are intermediate between those of the
 other    two salts, the second replacement        being  accompanied by the
 greater change.
     The optic axial angle of the rubidium zinc salt is almost exactly the
 mean of the widely different optic axial angles of the potassium zinc
 and caesium zinc salts.         The optic axes have a common plane, and
  the bisectrices are similarly situated, subject to the rotation of the
  whole ellipsoid already specified.
     The optic axial angles show a progressive change on heating the
  section plates — namely, a slight increase in the case of the potassium
  zinc salt, a slight decrease in the case of the caesium zinc salt, and an
  almost complete indifference to change on the part of the rubidium
  salt.
     The whole of the specific and molecular optical constants of rubidium
  zinc selenate are intermediate between those of the potassium and
  caesium zinc salts.     The molecular refraction and dispersion increase
   at an accelerating   rate   with the rise of atomic weight of the alkali
   metal.

250                Mr. F. G. Jackson and Dr. V. Harley.
   On instituting a comparison between the results now communicated
and those formerly published for the triplet of zinc double sulphates, it
is found that the replacement of sulphur by selenium is generally
accompanied by a change in the morphological and physical constants
similar to that which accompanies the replacement of one alkali metal
by another of higher atomic weight.      The changes due to the latter
chemical change are often smaller in the selenate series than in the
sulphate series, the greater weight of the initial molecule appearing to
offer greater resistance to change.   The intermediate character of the
constants of the rubidium salt         is,
                                    however,  the invariable ride in both
cases.

lime juice, which has been the teaching of physicians and scientists in
past years, would appear to require modification.
   In the early part of this century, through the efforts largely of
Lind, the better feeding of sailors led to the gradual disappearance of
scurvy in the naval service, and from this and other observed facts                    it
was conceived that the disease developed whenever individuals did not
receive    sufficient quantity of fresh vegetables, or some substitute,
           a
such as lime juice, in the diet.
   Garrod held that the cause of scurvy was      deficiency of potassium

organic salts, which are present in fruits and vegetables.
     Ralfe believed the        from the food of malates, citrates, and
                          absence

the blood was not diminished, and the majority of evidence showed
no diminution in the quantity of potash salts in the scorbutic blood, so
that these explanations had to be abandoned.
     Neale, in an article on      " Scurvy in the Arctic Regions," published
in the 'Practitioner,' 1896, stated that "scurvy       a disease due to

fact, scurvy begins with anaemia, and its great antidote    fresh blood."

prominent importance        in the warding off of scurvy    as the general
teaching     up to the present has led us to believe.     These remarks of
his were drawn from practical experience in the Arctic regions, as will
be later mentioned.
    It is to the sojourners in the Arctic and Antarctic climes that
scurvy nowadays is of such overwhelming importance, although in
some lands nearer home it is still rife, and occasional cases even now
occur in our marine services. Credit, as has been already stated, has
been given to the use of lime juice in the Royal Navy and the Merchant
Service for the great reduction of scurvy on board ship, but, as this
research will presently show, this conclusion is probably without justi
fication.
    In the Nares Polar Expedition the crews of both the " Alert " and
the "Discovery" suffered greatly from this affliction, although lime
juice was taken daily by all hands when on board. "When on the
sledging expeditions, in consequence of the necessities of such a con
 dition of travel, only a small quantity of lime juice was carried, yet an
 outbreak of scurvy occurred, not only amongst the sledging parties,
 but also amongst the men that remained on board ship and continued
 to take the prescribed allowance of lime juice daily.
     On the other hand Mr. Leigh Smith's party, with its medical officer,
Dr. Neale, after the loss of their ship the " Eira," spent nine months,
including a winter, upon Franz Josef Land, in the severest, and, neces
sarily, the most unsanitary, conditions imaginable.      They had no lime
juice whatever ; however, they almost entirely lived upon freshly
 killed meat and frozen blood, and no case of scurvy occurred amongst
 them.
     On comparing these two examples we see that in the case of a body
of picked men, well housed, well cared for, and with all possible means
 for procuring health adopted by those in command, taking the pre
scribed quantity of lime juice daily (except in the case of the sledge
crews when absent from the ship for a few weeks) but who lived almost
•entirely on preserved meat, we have universal scurvy ; while, on the
other hand, we have a party who had not been selected on account of
 physical fitness, who were cast upon the desolate shores of Franz Josef
 Land, and with only, the bare necessaries of existence, passed through
 nine months of their life there under conditions of considerable priva
 tion and hardship, and in circumstances which would hardly meet
 with the approval of any sanitary inspector.      They had no lime juice,
 but lived on freshly killed bear and walrus meat, and no symptoms of
scurvy appeared amongst them.
     No less striking results were obtained by Dr. Nansen and Lieutenant
 Johansen. These two individuals, after they left the " Fram," had to
 spend nine months, including the winter of 1895 and 1896, on Frederick
 Jackson Island.      They were forced to live in a rudely constructed hut,

without any changes of clothing,       and no possibilities of washing, so
that their sanitary conditions were not only of the roughest description,
but the most unsuitable possible for health, and during the whole of
this time they had no fresh vegetables whatsoever, and not even any
lime juice.    The only food they were able to use was fresh walrus or
bear's meat, which had been preserved simply by the cold.                 During
this entire period they ate no salted or tinned meats, and we can pre
sume that the bear and walrus meat, as it would freeze almost imme
diately on being killed, would remain perfectly fresh.
    In consequence apparently of the purely fresh meat, and in spite of
the most unsanitary conditions, Nansen and Johansen passed the
whole winter almost constantly in the dark, without exercise, and yet
showed no symptoms of scurvy whatsoever.                In fact, the results with
these   two  individuals   show  that  Neale's     view,   who had laid special
stress on the want of proper ventilation as one of the causes of scurvy,
was not realised, for the ventilation         of their hut must have been
extremely bad, as they describe the soot from their blubber lamps being
deposited everywhere.
    Before commenting on this a few more examples in reference to this
important subject may well be given*
    Orte of us (F. G. J.), when living amongst the Samoyads on Waigatz
Island, and the Bolshaia Zemclskija Tundra in 1893 and 1894,
observed some striking facts as to the cause of scurvy.
    Amongst those of the Samoyads who invariably winter upon
Waigatz, who never take vegetables nor know of lime juice, scurvy is
                                                  •
unknown.       They, however, live entirely         upon fresh reindeer meat.
On the     other hand     amongst those Samoyads, who in the autumn
migrate south with the Russian peasant traders from the neighbour-
hood of Yugor Straits, and live in common with them in the districts
 adjoining the large rivers in North-East Russia upon salted fish — the
 chief winter food there until the following May — scurvy is prevalent.
 That this fish is invariably tainted can be testified to from personal
experience.
    In  1893, when at    Kharborova,    a Samoyad settlement on the         Yugor
 Straits, a remarkable case pointing to the cause of scurvy came under
 his notice.    Six Russian priests, whose religion forbade them to eat
 reindeer or other such meats, but allowed salted fish, were left in a hut
 by Siheriakoff, the wealthy mine-owner, to pass the winter, a year or
 two prior to F. G. J.'s. visit.   A small Russian peasant boy — whom he
 conversed with   —  was left to wait upon them.        The priests lived almost
 exclusively  on  tea, bread, and  salted  fish ;   the  boy lived upon similar
 food, except that instead of the salted fish he ate fresh reindeer meat.
 None1 of them had any vegetables.           In   the  following May, when the
 Samoyads and peasant traders returned, they found that all the six
 priests bad died of scurvy, whereas the little boy, who had lived upon

fresh meat and had not eaten               salted fish, was alive and well, and had
buried all his late masters in the snow,             he being the     only living being
in Kharborova in the spring.
  In the experiences collected by one of ns — F. G. J., during his late
expedition to Franz Josef Land in 1894, 1895, 1896, and 1897— we
have two parties to consider : that of the crew of the " Windward,"
who spent the winter of  1894 and 1895 there, no individual of which
ever failed to take his prescribed ounce of lime juice daily, and yet
scurvy broke out, causing at least one death ; and on the other hand
the land party on shore who took no lime juice, except two or three of
them, who used it as a refreshing drink during the first few months,
after which none was used.   During the three years that they passed
in Franz Josef Land none of them suffered from any symptoms of
scurvy. The difference between these parties was principally, if not
                                                    "
entirely, due to the meat.       The " Windward       party used largely
tinned and salted meat ; while, on the other hand, the land party
principally lived on bear's meat, and when tinned meat was employed,
it passed a severe scrutiny in order that as far as possible it might be
not even tainted.
   From these and other facts it would appear that neither lime juice
nor fresh vegetables either prevent scurvy or cure       and        it,
                                                                  not the  it    is
absence of this which      the cause of the disease, but that scurvy
                             is                                                        is   a
disease produced through the eating of tainted food.
   The view that scurvy       essentially due to poisoning
                                      is                     by the
ptomaines of tainted animal food was first propounded by Professor
Torup, of Christiania, and  would appear from the foregoing evidence
                                  it
that such    isthe case, for in all the cases al>ove mentioned where any
scurvy occurred the men had lived on tinned meats or salted foods.
   Confirming this view, Dr. George M. Robertson, of the Perth
District Asylum, relates case of woman who had become an inmate
                                  a           a
chiefly owing to her malady having taken the form of eating filth from
pigs' troughs.    On arrival in the asylum she was found to be suffering
from spongy ulcerated gums — in fact, from "land scurvy," and ulti
mately all the teeth, except the canines, fell out.
   In the many instances of scurvy that we have investigated, in no
single    case    have the    circumstances       rendered       inadmissible,    or   even
improbable, the theory that this disease     due to ptomaine poisoning.
                                                     is
Before giving to lime juice the credit of having practically swept away
scurvy from the naval and marine services,       necessary to remember
                                                       it   is
that other causes have at the same time been at work to promote
health,    such    improved sanitation, better quarters for the men,
                   as
shorter voyages through the enormous increase in the use of steam,
and above all better food.
  The evidence so far shown, iii which men have unwillingly experi
mented on  the effects of ptomaine poisoning, proves that scurvy                            is

254              Mr. F. G. Jackson and Dr. V. Harley.
produced by the eating of tainted meat, and not by the want of fresh
vegetables.    In order to confirm or negative this view, it was decided
to carry out some experiments in this country.        After careful con
sideration,  it was concluded that the most suitable animals for such
experiments would be monkeys, since they are mostly nearly allied to
man. Monkeys are not naturally carnivorous, and therefore it would
be necessary to give the meat mixed with food that would not possess
any alleged anti-scorbutic properties ; and for this purpose it was
decided to feed the monkeys on boiled rice and maize. In order to keep
the standard of meat as nearly as possible always the same, a certain
brand of tinned Australian beef was employed.
   Daily the rice was well boiled,    and, after becoming thoroughly
softened, 50 grammes of meat was added to each portion of rice for
the various monkeys.      It was then well stirred and gently heated ;
by this means the meat got well mixed with the rice, and, although
the monkeys might reject some of the larger lumps of meat, a con
siderable portion of it was eaten. At the same time any soluble
ptomaines would lie absorbed by the rice, and thus eaten by the
monkeys. To this mixture daily was added a certain amount of maize.
The results can be best described by dividing the experiments into
three groups.
   First Group. — The monkeys in this group were given daily, together
with their boiled rice, 50 grammes of meat from a freshly opened tin,
together with maize.
   Second Group. — The monkeys in this group were given the same
quantities of meat as in the previous group, but from tins which had
been opened for a few days, and had stood in the laboratory.        The
meat in these was not what one would call bad, although it had a dis
tinctly sour smell. Rice and maize as before.
   Third Group. — The monkeys in this series were given exactly the
same diet as was employed in the second group, except that each
monkey received daily either an apple or a banana.
   We have found in these three groups three conditions, so far as diet
is concerned, which ought to yield definite results in reference to the
subject of ptomaine poisoning,
   In order that the general surroundings of the monkeys should be
as nearly as possible the same, and that each should be properiy
observed, every monkey was kept in a separate cage of similar con
struction,  so  that the f«ces could   be easily examined.    The  cages
were kept in a room warmed by hot-water pipes, so that they were
under as nearly as possible similar conditions as regards light and
heat.   The excreta of the monkeys were examined daily, and the
general appearance of the animals noted, more especially as regards
the condition of the gums. Every few days they were weighed.
   "We can now proceed to describe the results of the experiments.    In

In   the ease of No. 5, which lost no less than 1-100 kilos, in seventy-
three days, this loss of weight principally occurred during the last
seven days, for up to that period this monkey had only lost 300
grammes.       During the last seven days, however, severe diarrhoea set
in, followed by rapid wasting.          The same holds good as regards the
other cases. So that although the monkeys on this diet lost weight,
]X>ssibly from the food not being sufficiently nutritious, the principal
loss of weight was apparently due to the diarrhoea.
   When we come to consider the diarrhoea, we see that all six monkeys
developed this condition sooner or later.           As a rule it commenced by
being very intermittent, and becoming more severe towards the end,
when it speedily proved fatal by the general loss of strength, &c,
which it occasioned.
   The diarrhoea in monkey No. 1 did not commence until it had been
sixty-two days on the diet, when it proved fatal after seven days. In
the case of monkey No. 5, on the other hand, it began after thirteen
days, but was only slight, and at intervals of three or four days,
after which it became very severe ; during the last seven days there
was rapid wasting, and death occurred on the seventy-third day.
   In the case of monkey No. 3, the diarrhoea commenced, however, on
the third day, when it was very severe, and afterwards, although the
diarrhoea was not so acute and occurred only at intervals, the animal
became     very   feeble,   and  on the twenty-eighth        day was killed by
chloroform.      At  the autopsy no cause for the feeble condition could be

256                 Mr. F. G. Jackson and Dr. V. Harley.
found,    although     the large intestine was          somewhat congested in this
case.
    In spite of the appearance of this diarrhcea, none of the monkeys in
this group showed any signs of either blood or mucus in the motions,
the liquid stools being merely of a pale yellowish colour.                      And in all
these cases the gums, although                  frequently     examined, showed no
sponginess nor signs of bleeding.               The monkeys of this group, as they
became emaciated, sat hunched                  up in their cages, the most usual
attitude     Ixjing with their heads between their knees, as if they
were trying to keep themselves warm, although the room was, as
already stated, heated by hot-water pipes. They also showed signs of
being out of condition by the general roughened condition of their
coats.
    At the autopsy all these monkeys exhibited more or less marked
emaciation, but with the exception of No. 2, which died from
pneumonia, in no case was any direct cause of death discoverable.
In the bowels were found liquid, light-coloured                     contents, and only
in the    case of   No.  3    were there any signs of congestion to be noted
in the large intestine.

     We see in this Table           II  that we have the same loss of weight in
 these monkeys       as we had in the six monkeys               fed on the fresh meat.
 In this group        the     diarrhcea      commenced earlier than in those pre

                  An Experimental Inquiry     into Scurvy.              '257
viously described.      In only one case was it delayed forty days ; . in
¦the   other cases it commenced between the fourth and seventh day,
except in monkey No. 8, in which it did not commence until the
seventeenth day.       In these, as in the previous monkeys, diarrhcea,
although always occurring, was somewhat intermittent.
    Out of those eight monkeys, in no less than six was it seen that the
motions were not of the simple diarrhoiaic character of the former
group, but contained blood and mucus. In monkeys Nos. 7 and 12 the
blood and mucus appeared on the eighth and ninth day respectively,
while in the other cases it was more delayed, the diarrhtea having
^continued for some time previous to its appearance.        In some of the
cases the motions just before death consisted principally of blood and
mucus.
    When we turn to the appearance of the gums, we find that in five
out of the eight monkeys included in this group they showed spongi-
 ness, and in some cases even small ulcers forming.      The sponginess of
the gums was most marked around the incisors and bicuspids, and, as a
rule, did not occur around the molars at all.
    The monkeys belonging to this group sat in the same cramped posi
 tion, with roughened coats, as already described in the previous group
 They showed a more marked disinclination to move, or to take interest
 in objects around them ; but in no cases did they show any signs of
 definite tenderness of their limbs when handled.         Only in one case
 (No. 7) was there any indication of bruising.       In this monkey a few
 days before death two bruises developed on his left knee, about A- cm.
 in diameter, of a dirty red-brown colour, and also sores showed on the
 sole of the right foot and at the root of the tail.
     In all these cases, as in previous monkeys, an autopsy was carried
 out.     In no single instance was there found any signs of hsemorrhage
 or haemorrhages into the pleura, pericardium, or peritoneum.            The
 gums     in Nos. 8 and   10 were not only spongy,   but had   a tendency to
 the formation of ulcers at the root of the incisors.
     The stomach and small intestine showed little or no change, while,
 on the other hand, the large intestine was, in the majority of cases
 (except Nos. 6 and 1 3), markedly congested, the congestion being, as a
 rule, most noticeable at the sigmoid flexure and caecum.      The contents
 of the small intestine were light yellow, while the large intestine con
 tained more or less bloody mucus.
     The only thing else abnormal      to be noticed was that in No.       7
 the   liver was enlarged and fatty, showing markedly        the line of the
 ril«.
    We now come to consider the Third Group (Table III). In this the
 monkeys were fed on boiled rice with 50 grammes of tainted meat and
 maize daily, but each monkey received, in addition, an apple or a
 banana.

     In this group the animals, therefore, in addition               to the rice and
 maize and tainted         meat, received fresh vegetables        daily, and may be
 considered to have been well fed.          Five monkeys only were used, and,
 in spite of the extra food, they all lost weight.              In fact, Nos. 15 and
  17 lost   no    less than 900 and 975         grammes of      weight      in  180    and
 31   days respectively.         The others, however, did not             lose  so much
  weight.    In three of the monkeys, Nos. 14, 16, and 17, diarrhoea com
 menced from eight to sixteen days after the monkeys had been on this
 diet.    But in No. 15 diarrhoea did not commence until the 150th day
 of observation, and in No. 21 not until the 90th day.                  In four of the
 cases blood and mucus appeared               in  the motions     in    from eight to
 eighteen days. "When it first occurred in No. 21 was unfortunately not
 noticed.     The other monkey, No. 15, did not show any signs of it. In
 two of the monkeys, Nos. 16 and 17, spongy gums occurred; in the
 former, on the eleventh day, while in the latter it was only noted at
 the autopsy.        The  other three monkeys showed no signs of bleeding
 gums.
    The autopsy of those monkeys which showed scurvy exhibited, as
 in those of the second group, marked congestion of the large intestine,
 with bloody mucus in the contents.
    In all the cases there was marked emaciation but no haemorrhage,
 either into the pleura, pericardium, or peritoneum.
    After this general description of the results obtained in the three
 groups of experiments, and before discussing their significance, we can
 consider the changes produced in the blood of animals suffering from
 the results of scurvy — scurvy being defined by Bristow as " a peculiar
form of anremia arising from a deficiency of vegetable diet, and
attended with a tendency to the occurrence of haemorrhages, profound
impairment of nutrition, and great mental and bodily prostration."
                              * Only noted at the autopsy.

     Blood in  the Scurvy  of Monkeys. — In order to get monkeys with          as
 well-developed    symptoms of scurvy as possible, the animals were kept
 until not only were they passing bloody mucus by the bowels, but the
 glims were spongy and easily bled. Unfortunately, the blood of only
 two monkeys could      be examined, as the others died too speedily.       The
 monkeys     Nos. 8 and 10 in the second group, however, both showed very
 well marked      symptoms of scurvy, as found in monkeys — diarrhoea,
 wasting,   the motions   containing blood and mucus, and the gums spongy
 and easily bleeding.

    In the above Table IV the results of the analyses of the blood in
the case of these      two monkeys are compared with that of a normal
monkey, so that we can more readily see the changes produced.
    The blood to be examined was collected from the carotid artery
while the animal was kept under the influence of ether, and when
sufficient blood had been collected for the various analyses, the animal
was killed by an overdose of anaesthetic before it returned to con
sciousness.
    The Number of Bed Blood Corpuscles. — These were estimated by the
Thoma-Zeiss' Counter, and in each of these cases the average of two
blood counts     is given, the result   being the number of red blood cor
puscles contained in a cubic millimetre of blood.
   It is seen that while in the normal monkeys the number of red blood
corpuscles is 4,730,000 per cubic millimetre, in the two monkeys
suffering from scurvy it is respectively 4,220,000 and 4,500,000.
   Other observers have drawn attention to the diminution in the
number of red corpuscles in cases of scurvy as quoted by Philip Wales
in Ashurst's ' International Encyclopaedia of Surgery.'

260                  Mr. F. G. Jackson and Dr. V. Harley.
     From    these results one may conclude that there is a slight reduction
in the number of red blood corpuscles in monkeys fed on tainted meat,
although this reduction is nothing like the reduction one finds in the
human subject in many of the more severe forms of anaemia.
     The Leucocytes. — The white blood corpuscles were counted in the
same way as the red blood corpuscles.          This was carried out on one of
the monkeys affected wtih scurvy.         It is seen in the case of the normal
monkey       that  there  were 8125 leucocytes per cubic millimetre, while in
the case of the monkey suffering from scurvy there were no less than
40,000.
     Laboulbene notes the occurrence of an unusual number of white
globules in scurvy.          We certainly can conclude that there is a very
marked leucocytosis produced by the diet of tainted meat.
     The Hemoglobin. — The quantity of colouring matter in the blood was
estimated by Fleischl's ha?mometer.           In each case precautions were
 taken to use the same illumination power, and at least two calculations
 were made, the average being taken.
     It is seen in the above table (IV) that the haemoglobin present repre
sent 75, while in both the monkeys suffering from scurvy it is very
 considerably reduced, being 48 and 45 respectively. When we compare
 this with the small reduction in the number of red blood corpuscles, we
 see   that in the monkeys fed on tainted meat there is produced a very
 marked hsemoglobinaemia,         while at the same time there is probably
 oligocythajmia.
     In fact this condition corresponds with that in the human being in
 cases of chlorosis, as against those forms of pernicious anaemia or
 secondary anaemia, where either the red blood corpuscles are reduced
 out of proportion to the haemoglobin, or the hiemoglobin and corpuscles
 are reduced in equal proportions.
      The Specific Gravity of the Mood. — The estimation of the specific
 gravity of the blood in these monkeys was carried out by means of
 the picnometer.         In the normal monkey we have      a specific gravity of
  1046, while     in the case of the two monkeys suffering from scurvy we
 have a specific gravity of 1035 and 1034 ; so that we can conclude
 that there is a slight decrease in the specific gravity produced by the
 diet of tainted meat.
      Tlte J Cater and Solids of the Blood. — A given quantity of blood was
 collected in a platinum crucible and dried to constant weight at 70° C.
  It is seen that in the normal blood there was 83-37 per cent, of water
  and 16-63 per cent, solids, while in the case of the monkeys suffering
  from scurvy the percentage of water was 85-18, with only 14-12 per
  cent, of solids, in monkey No. 8, while 84-99 per cent, of water, with
  15-01 per cent, of solids, occurred in No. 10. It would appear that all
  observers who have noted the blood in scurvy speak of the marked
  tliminution in the total solids which occurs in this disease.       So that we

                 An Experimental Inquiry into                    Scurvy.             261
have with the decrease in the specific gravity of the blood a diminution
in the total solids, as one naturally would expect.
   Tlie Proteids of the Blood. — The total quantity of proteids in the
blood was estimated by precipitating a given quantity of blood in
1 5 volumes of absolute alcohol.      After allowing it to stand some days,
with frequent stirring, the precipitate was collected on a weighed filter
paper, and dried, &c, in the usual manner.         By this method it was
found that the normal blood contained 18-27 per cent, of proteids, while
in the case of the two monkeys fed on tainted meat the quantity of
proteids was only 12-37 and 15-69, so that there is a very marked
decrease in the quantity of proteids in the blood.
   The, Quantity
                   of Fibrine. — -This was estimated by the method of
Hoppe->Seyler in one case.     It is seen that in the normal monkey there
is 0'52 per cent, of fibrine in the blood, while in the case of the monkey
suffering from scurvy the fibrine was no less than 0-76, so that we see
there was a very marked increase in the quantity of fibrine.
   Ghalvet, in his analysis of a case of scurvy, comparing it with
healthy blood in the normal individual, found the fibrine 0'216, while
in the  case of scurvy it was 0-434.
  Busk, in three well-marked cases of scurvy which occurred in the
" Dreadnought " hospital ship, found the fibrine in excess of the normal
amount, the least being 0-45 and the greatest 0"65 per cent.
   Tlie Time of Cmguhdion. — The time that it took for the blood to
coagulate was estimated by Professor Wright's tubes, and it is seen
that in the normal monkeys this is three minutes, while in the case of
the monkeys suffering from scurvy it was found to be one and two
minutes respectively.
   The increase in the quantity of fibrine (hyperinosis) with the shorten
ing of the time of coagulation is what one commonly finds in hydrtemia
in the human subject, and may therefore in all probability be put down
to the same cause.
   The Quantity of Nitrogen. — The total quantity of nitrogen in the
blood was estimated by the method of Kjeldahl, and the average of
two analyses is given as before. In the normal monkey it is seen that
the total nitrogen was 2-72, while in the case of the monkey suffering
from scurvy, in which it was analysed, it was 2'31 per cent. There                     is,
therefore, a small decrease in the quantity of nitrogen, this decrease
corresponding to the decrease in the quantity of proteids, and as this
was only analysed in one monkey,            as well perhaps not to discuss
                                                 it   is
any theories as to its significance.
   The Ash  of the Blood. — The estimation of the ash was carried out in
the ordinary way, but only in the case of one monkey suffering from
the effects of tainted meat.           It   is   seen      that in the case of the normal
monkey   the ash     was      0-75,   while in the          case of the monkey fed with
tainted meat   it   was   0   79 per cent.

262               Mr. F. G. Jackson and Dr. V. Harley.
    The average amount in Becquerel's, Rodies's, and Busk's cases of
scurvy in the human subject was 0-81, the smallest being 055 and the
largest 1*15 per cent.
    Garrod, in the analysis of the blood in one case of scurvy, found a
deficiency of the potassium salts, upon which he formed his well-known
theory that scurvy was due to their want.
    We therefore  see, in reference to this monkey, that the ash does not
tend to be decreased with the low specific gravity and diminution of
the total solids.   It is apparent that the diminution in the total solids
is principally due to a lessening in the quantity of proteids.
                                  Conclusions.
    The descriptions brought forward in the first part, of several cases
of scurvy which occurred in the Arctic regions when the individuals
were under the influence of preserved or salted meats, in spite of their
taking at the same time either vegetables or lime juice, of the Nares
Polar Expedition, in which scurvy occurred, as " well as the very
striking case of the six priests already mentioned, can.be compared on
the other hand with conditions of the greatest hardship and privation
in the Leigh Smith Expedition, Nansen and Johansen, and the
Frederick Jackson land party, as well as in the instance given of the
Samoyads who winter on Waigatz and who live on fresh meat ; in all of
which cases, in spite of the entire absence of vegetables or even lime
juice, no scurvy occurred.
    If we look at this evidence alone we could almost say we have con
clusive experimental evidence that the eating of salted or improperly
preserved meat, or tainted meat in any form, can produce scurvy,
even when lime juice or vegetables are being taken at the same time.
    We have also the support of the fact that bad ventilation, believed
by Dr. Neale to be one of the causes of scurvy, was not the cause of
scurvy   with Dr. Nansen, living on fresh meat and blood — probably
owing to the fact that he introduced no ptomaine, and therefore no
scurvy occurred.
    We now come to consider the experiments on monkeys, and how
much or otherwise these experiments confirm the results already given
in man. It is necessary to consider what are the symptoms of scurvy.
In the present paper it is impossible to go through all the symptoms
of scurvy described by the various observers, since different epidemics
have shown more markedly various symptoms.                We, however, can
compare    the symptoms    in our  monkeys     with those generally described
as accompanying scurvy.        The pallor and yellowish colour of the fac«,
which is described as distinctive in scurvy, is of course impossible to
be observed in monkeys, although in those monkeys which we con
 sider to suffer from    scurvy there was generally a good deal of blue

ness   about the lips and gums.         There was a very marked disinclina
tion to bodily movement and a general tendency to mental prostration,
for the monkeys took little interest in the things surrounding them, in
ihose    cases   which  showed what we might consider the more definite
symptoms of scurvy, such as the bloody mucus and bleeding gums.
    At the same time in none of these monkeys did we find any definite
tenderness of the limbs, no swelling of the legs, or any purpura.         Only
in one case do we get the formation of bruise-like sores in an animal
 which apparently was suffering from scurvy.
    In the monkeys included in the first group, which were fed on fresh
 meat as well as maize and rice, the only symptom we note beyond the
 wasting is diarrhoea, and none of these monkeys showed anything like
 the muscular feebleness or general ill-health which was noted in the
scorbutic monkeys.
     When we compare the second group, Table II, in which the monkeys
 received the same diet, except that the meat instead of being fresh was
 tainted, we find      a very  different  state of   affairs.   These monkeys
 showed a very much greater prostration, and although it is difficult to
judge by the eye they certainly seemed paler and generally out of con
dition. No less than six out of the eight monkeys thus fed passed
blood and mucus in their motions.
     The question whether blood and mucus in the motions is to                be
 regarded as one of of the symptoms of scurvy, can be easily answered
                                                        " patients suffer from
 by the fact that, first, Bristow states that
 looseness of the bowels, the motions frequently being highly offensive
 and containing blood."        It is also stated by other observers, such as
 Hilton-Fagge and Osier, as well as in an able article on scurvy in
 Ashurst's ' International Encyclopaedia of Surgery,' by Philip Wales,
 that the occurrence of haemorrhages in the mucous membrane of the
 stomach and bowels is of frequent occurrence.
     None of our monkeys vomited, so that whether they suffered from
 haemorrhages in the stomach cannot be noted.          In the post mortem there
 •was no evidence of any such thing.
     If this bloody diarrhoea is an evidence of scurvy, we find that no
  less than six out of the eight monkeys which were .given the tainted
 meat showed this symptom.
     We now compare the third group, Table III, in which the monkeys
  were given fresh fruit, apples or bananas, every day.            One can say
 that the monkeys in this case were well fed. Five monkeys were
 observed, and out of these five monkeys no less than four developed
  the symptoms of bloody mucus in their stools, so that in spite of good
  feeding    this symptom    of scurvy   developed in four out of the five
  monkeys on full diet.
     We    come to the next symptom, undoubtedly         the most definite sign
  of scurvy that occurs in man — in fact,      it  is about the   only condition

                                           the spongy condition of the
gums.    When we consider the first group of monkeys which were
merely fed on rice, maize, and fresh meat, out of the six monkeys not
one showed any appearance of spongy gums, so that we can conclude
that in these monkeys none of them showed any scurvy whatever.
   We now come to the eight monkeys fed on exactly the same diet, in
which the meat was tainted instead of fresh, and here no less than five
of the eight monkeys showed sponginess of the gums, and some, not
only the sponginess but the gums even ulcerated, so that five out of the
eight monkeys showed this sign, which         considered by all who
                                                      is
describe scurvy as the most significant.
   We now come to those monkeys which were well fed, getting the
fresh vegetables every day.    Four of these monkeys showed bloody
mucus in the  stools, and two of them spongy and bleeding gums.
   We have further to consider the condition of the blood in the
monkeys fed on tainted meat. Scurvy           considered by all authorities
                                                is
to l»e a peculiar form of anaemia.   In two monkeys we had the oppor
tunity  of analysing  the Wood,  and       itseen by the analyses that we
                                                is
have marked changes in the blood, n very great diminution in the
quantity of haemoglobin, with   a   slight diminution in the number of
                      —
red blood corpuscles in fact,   a  condition corresponding to chlorosis,
and that  is accompanied by leucocytosis.
   The specific gravity of the blood       reduced, and this
                                           is                   due to theis
reduction in the quantity of proteids and not to       marked reduction in
                                                           a
the quantity of salines in the blood.        The fibrine of the blood                 is
increased, together with an increase in the coagulability of the blood.
   When we consider what has been found in the blood of man
suffering from scurvy, we find   it    universally accepted that there
                                      is                                              is
this condition of anaemia with low specific gravity, the blood being
distinctly watery and with marked excess in the quantity of fibrine.
                            a
So the condition of the blood of the two monkeys which we have
analysed corresponds with that found in the majority of analyses of
scorbutic blood.
  Considering therefore the occurrence, in the monkeys fed on tainted
meat, of bloody mucus in the stools, spongy gums, and characteristic
anaemia, we assume     that, although the symptom of haemorrhages into
the tissues    was not observed, we may fairly conclude that they were
really scorbutic.
  This conclusion      further justified when we consider, on looking
                       is
over the description of scurvy given by authors, that all the symptoms
except the spongy gums arc very often absent in different epidemics.
  The fact that the five monkeys fed on tainted meat, in which fresh
vegetables were given, showed in    asmaller proportion the symptoms of
scurvy   than the monkeys     in the second group,             can   be    sufficiently

explained by the fact that when the monkeys received a banana or an
apple every day, they would be less likely to eat as much of the meat
as they would otherwise do, and would thus daily receive a smaller
dose of ptomaine.
  In spite of this fact, in no less than four cases out of the five did we
get bloody motions, and in two of the cases spongy gums. In these
cases tainted  meat alone seems to have produced scorbutic symptoms,
although    the animals in this group took longer to develop the
symptoms, and seemed not to suffer in such a severe form.
  Looking at the results of our experiments on monkeys, as a whole,
we venture to think that they afford important confirmation of the
conclusion derived from Arctic experience, as referred to in the early
part of this paper, that the absence or presence of fresh vegetables or
lime juice is not alone sufficient for the prevention or the cure of
scurvy, and that we must regard the condition of the food in general,
and especially the state of preservation of the meat, as the essential
factor in the etiology of the disease.
   We have to express our thanks to Dr. Francis Goodbody for his
untiring assistance in the numerous observations that had to be made
during the eighteen months the research was continued.

   The memoir deals with a function which is substantially one-quarter
of the <r function of Weierstrass, just as the ordinary (simple) gamma
function is substantially one-half of the infinite sine product.     The
analogy   between  the two   functions determines  the nomenclature.
   In any development of the simple gamma function from the function-
 theory point of view, it is necessary to use Euler's theorem
to obtain the product T\ (:/cu) given by
 as asolution of the difference equation f(: + =     o>)

    The experiments* described in the following paper form a continua
tion of researches on thermal radiation by one of the present authors,
the results of which have been communicated to the Royal Society
from time to time since 1884.        t The main object of the present experi
ments was to push           forward the inquiry as to the amount, and the
relative quality, of the radiation from surfaces of various kinds in high
vacuum.
    When a body is maintained at a high temperature the total radiation
from its surface depends, other things being the same, on the tempera
ture and on the character            of the radiating surface. With a given
temperature the total radiation, consisting of thermal, luminous, and
actinic rays, seems to depend on the nature and on the ultimate texture
of the    radiating surface;      and the proportion in which vibrations of
longer     and shorter period are present seems to be governed by the
   *
      The experimental results of the paper were obtained two years ago. Various
circumstances   have prevented earlier publication ; and it was originally intended
to carry the investigation further before publishing.    Want of opportunity, how
ever, makes this difficult for the present ; and we therefore deem it advisable to put
our results on record just now, as tbey stand.      The present investigation, as well
as the former work referred to in the text above, has been astisted by grants from
the Government Grant Fund.

    Very little progress has yet been made towards an investigation of

    In a former paper* by one of us the loss of heat in vacuum from the
metallic surface of platinum wires was determined ; and Schleiermachert
has compared the loss from bright platinum wires and ^om platinum
wires whose surface was coated thinly with black oxide of copper.
Further experiments on this part of the subject seemed highly desirable,
and were, therefore, undertaken by us.
    The radiating body was a platinum wire. The way in which it was

stout multiple      platinum    terminals   ; and by means of these, which are
fused,   with the help of      some white enamel,       into the glass at d,d, the
current is passed through the platinum wire.                 At e,e, platinum wires
are brought through the sides of the tube, and serve as potential
electrodes ; and it is to keep the platinum wire ab in the middle of
the length     of the tube, and to avoid pulling unduly on the potential
electrodes,   that the two spiral springs, one at either end of the tube,
are   introduced.
    Two exactly similar tubes were employed,             as shown    in fig. 2. They
were connected together by a side tube, as shown ; and by means of a
branch     tube, attached to this side tube and connected to a Sprengel
pump, the air was withdrawn from both tubes at the same time ; and by
this arrangement it was provided that the vacuum in the two tubes
should be at all times precisely the same.
    In one of the      tubes  the platinum wire was brightly polished and
perfectly smooth, just as it came from the maker's hands. The other
tube contained a platinum wire cut from the same hank, but with the
surface covered with an excessively fine coating of soot.                The soot was
put on by passing the wire carefully through the upper part of a clear
paraffin flame.*
    The usual arrangements          were made for drying the vacuum of the
tube, and of the pump, by          means of phosphorus pentoxide ; and the
vacuum was measured by means of the Gimmingham modification of
the    McLeod gauge.
    The    wires were heated, as in the former experiments, by means
 of an electric      current.    Fig. 2 shows the electric connections. A
 battery consisting of a sufficient number of secondary cells was em
 ployed ; and ithe current was controlled by means of suitable resist
 ances,   including a rheostat. In the experiments here described the
 platinum wires of the two tubes, the resistances, and the battery were
 all connected    in series, so that the same current passed through all.t
     The current in the circuit was measured by means of a Kelvin
 ampere gauge, and the difference of potentials at the two ends of each
    * The texture of the soot depends greatly on the source from which it is
 obtained and on the way in which it is applied to the wire. Some preliminary
 experiments have been made with various coatings of soot, and comparisons have
 been attemped between surfaces finely coated with soot, and surfaces prepared with
 platinum black and with a fine coating of black oxide of copper chemically applied

    t In another set of experiment* the platinum wires were joined in parallel, and,
 by means of two rheostats, one connected in series with each platinum wire, an
 attempt was made to regulate the current in each wire so that the temperatures in
 the two should be the same.      This was found very difficult to carry out ; but it is
 intended to renew the attempt, and determine simultaneously the radiation from
 two wires with different surfaces, in the same vacuum, and at the same tem
 perature.

of the platinum        wires was measured by means                of a high resistance
reflecting galvanometer.
   This potential galvanometer had a resistance of about 5000 ohms,
and it was possible to insert in the galvanometer circuit an additional
resistance of 10,000 ohms.
    In order to ascertain the absolute value of the readings of the
potential galvanometer, a standard coil of platinoid wire, whose resist
ance was known very accurately, was joined into the circuit, as shown
in fig. 2.      This resistance was of considerable length, and it was
kept cool by being immersed in a bath of oil.
    The following was the order of experimenting.                  The pressure in the
tubes was first reduced as much as possible by means of the Sprengel
pump ; then a very small current, practically unable to heat any part of
the circuit, was sent through the two platinum wires and the standard
coil, and the potential difference between the two ends of each was
determined.      This gave the ratio of the resistance of each of the
platinum wires to that of the standard coil, all being cold, and at the
same temperature.        The current from the battery of storage cells_was now
suitably increased, and readings were taken in the following order : — The
current passing was first read. Then the zero of the potential galvano
meter was noted, and the deflection of the potential galvanometer
when connected to the two ends of the standard coil was observed.                  The
electrodes of the potential galvanometer were next applied to one of
the platinum wires, and the deflection noted ; then the deflection due
to the second wire was          observed.      A   second    reading was taken    from
 the first wire and also from the second wire.                  Usually these pairs of
readings    were  identical,     or  nearly   so,  as no    reading was taken until
after the strong current had been passing through the circuit for
sufficient length of time to allow the temperature of the whole to
become     perfectly    steady.      Generally     speaking, five minutes or more
was allowed     for this purpose.         Lastly the current was again read, and
the zero of the potential galvanometer noted.
    The readings detailed above enabled us to calculate the current
passing through each wire and the resistance in that wire.                 The length
and cross section of each of the platinum wires (practically identical)
were also known.             Thus the energy lost by radiation per square
centimetre per second, C-K/JS, could be calculated; C being the
current, R the resistance and S the surface of the radiating wire, and
J being the dynamical          equivalent of heat, all in absolute measure.
   The measurement of           the electric resistance of the wires also enabled
us to calculate the temperatures of the wires by means of the results
of a separate     determination         of the electric      resistances, at different
temperatures, of the wires themselves.

the                 of change of resistances of platinum wires with
          determination
temperature have been fully discussed.      In the present case each
platinum wire, after having been used in the radiation experiment, was
wrapped round the bulb of an air thermometer* of special construc
tion ; the bulb and wire were then packed in asbestos wool, and
placed in the laminated copper heating jacket described and figured
in the paper just referred to. The jacket was heated by means of one
                                     "
of Fletcher's powerful " solid flame   burners, by means of which it
could lie kept for any length of time almost absolutely steady, at any
temperature below the softening point of glass.
  By means of stout copper electrodes the platinum wire was made
one of the branches of a Wheatstone balance, and the electric resist
ance and temperature were simultaneously determined.    A consider
able numlwr of readings between 15° C. and 350° C. were taken, and
from these an empirical formula was constructed, or a curve drawn to
represent the relation between temperature and pressure at all inter
mediate points.
  In      one respect, the determinations,      an account of which is given in
the present paper, are not perfectly satisfactory.          We have not been
able to take account in a proper way of the temperature of the enclosing
envelope.   In order to be able to see the condition of the wires, and in
particular to observe their appearance when they became luminous,
glass envelopes were used in these experiments; and owing to the
nature of the arrangements and the method of experimenting, it was
not found possible to immerse the glass envelopes in a cooling bath.
Consequently the glass became more or less heated during the experi
ments, and the heating was unequal in the cases of the bright wire and
the sooted wire.   It has already been pointed outt that the proportions
in which the radiations of longer period and shorter period are present in
the total radiation depends on the radiating        surface, other things being
the same.        In   the case of the sooted wire, the quantity of long-period
radiation      is,            far in excess of that proceeding from
                     in proportion,                                                   a
bright metallic polished surface. Consequently, with the same total
electric energy supplied to both wires, the glass tube containing the
sooted wire became much hotter than the tube containing the bright
wire.
  It      has also been pointed       out| that with   a substance like glass, con
ducting badly and somewhat diathermanous,               it   is   impossible to tell how

much heat is returned to the radiating wire from the interior skin of
the tube, which no doubt rises to a high temperature during the experi
ment.     To  a certain   extent, therefore,  the   results which  we have
obtained must be considered as not affording results strictly com
parable with those formerly obtained in which a metallic envelope
cooled with water was used.
    The absolute value of the radiation observed ought to be somewhat
lower in amount than would have been found had the enclosing
envelope been of metal and properly kept cool, and the disturbance
from this cause must have been relatively greater in the case of the
dull, than in the case of the bright, wire.
    Experiments were made with platinum wires from three separate
hanks.     A pair of wires of equal length was taken in each case. One
of these was left with its surface exactly as it was on being taken
from the hank    ; the other was sooted.     The two wires were then fixed
in the glass tubes. The wires are designated Pt^Ptj, Pts.Pt*, Pt5,Pte.
The first of each pair is the bright wire ; the second is the sooted
wire.    The diameters of the wires are as follows : — Ptj and Pto,
0 0542 cm., Pt8 and Pt4, 0 025 cm.     ; Pt5 and Pta, 0-015 cm.
    In Tables I and    II specimens are given of the results obtained, in
 the manner described above, by observation and calculation.           The
 remainder of the results are embodied in the curves appended, which
 it is hoped will be found self-explanatory.      At the head of each table
 the particulars as to the wires referred to in the table are given.
    In the following tables, III, IV, V, the loss of heat per square centi
 metre of surface for the several pairs of wires, bright and sooted, at
 various temperatures, is compared ; and the ratio between the radiation
 from the sooted wire and the radiation from the bright wire is calculated.
 It will be seen that the numbers are in fair agreement. What may be
 the causes of divergence from exact agreement it is impossible to say
 at the present stage of the inquiry ; but it may be conjectured that
 part of it at least is due to the difficulty, or impossibility, of keeping
 the vacuum which surrounds the wires in these experiments unchanged.
 When the pressure is very low, the      accession of the smallest quantity
 of gas   to the surrounding space     causes  an enormous change in the
 rate of loss of heat, as has been shown in a previous part of this
 research ; and as the temperature rises it is always found that the
 vacuum becomes deteriorated, owing to the expulsion of gas from the
 body of the wire itself.     This gas must be removed by a fresh appli
 cation of the pump, and, in fact, during the experiments the pump must
be kept always      at work.    Thus the vacuum is incessantly changing ;
and, moreover, as the indications of the McLeod gauge lag very much
behind, it is not even possible to know the exact state of the pressure
at the instant when it is desired to make an observation as to current

passing and resistance.    The consequence is that owing to the con
stantly altering state  of  the vacuum an irregularity is introduced
in the loss of heat, and the irregularity tells more in the case of small
wires than in the case of larger sizes.
   In the case of the bright wire, Ptj, the loss of heat was somewhat
abnormal.     It is probable that the surface was lacking in polish.
   It will be seen that the loss from the sooted platinum wires is about
four to five times that from the bright wires at the same temperature.
In the paper of 1894, already referred to, the radiation from a very
brightly polished and burnished silvered copper globe, and that from
the same globe sooted, were determined.          The highest temperature
reached was about 230° C, and in that case the sooted globe lost about
ten times as much heat as the silvered globe under the same circum
stances.   When the silvered globe had become tarnished, the radiation
from its surface was so much increased that the loss from the sooted
globe was only three times that from the tarnished silver.

        sity of Wisconsin.      Communicated by C. V. Boys, F.B.S.

   In   a paper published   in the ' Philosophical Magazine    (August, 1899)
 I gave    an account   of a  series of  photographs  of sound-waves   under
going reflection, refraction, diffraction, &c, which were made chiefly
for the purpose of illustrating certain optical phenomena to classes.
   The waves were in every case single pulses in the air produced by
electric sparks, illuminated and photographed by the light of a second
spark, properly timed with reference to the first, the apparatus being
essentially the same as that employed by Toepler for the study of
stria;.
   I  have recently secured, by means of an improved apparatus, a very
much better and more complete series of photographs ; and at the risk
of subjecting myself to criticism for bringing matter already published
to the attention of the Society, I wish to devote a few minutes to a
very rapid inspection of them.
   The following cases, that were not represented in my first paper, I
think I may safely comment upon.
   The conjugate foci of the elliptical mirror, aplanatic for rays
issuing from a point, is very beautifully shown, the spherical wave
diverging from one focus being transformed by reflection into a con
verging sphere which shrinks to a point at the other focus.
   The transformation of a spherical into a plane wave by a parabolic
mirror is also well shown (fig. 1).
                                      Fig. I.
            |       s.
   The effect of spherical aberration of circular mirrors is beautifully
exhibited in several cases.
   When a plane wave enters a hemispherical mirror the reflected wave
front is cusped, and the cusp will bo seen to lie always on the caustic
surface.      The form of the complete wave in this      case is not unlike a
   vol. lxvi.                                                        z

284    Prof. E. W. Wood.           Photography of Sound-wares,         and    the
volcanic cone with a bowl-shaped crater, the bowl eventually collapsing
to a point, at the focus of the mirror, the sides of the cone running in
under it and crossing.    From now on the wave diverges, and goes out
of the mirror in a form somewhat resembling the bell of a medusa, the
caustic form   by twice-reflected             rays being traced by a second    cusp
(%    2).
                                             Fio.   2.
   These forms can, of course, be constructed geometrically, and we
have here a slide with a number of successive positions of the wave-
front, showing how the cusps follow the caustic surface (fig. 3). The
                                             Fig.   3.
construction shows that there     a concentration of energy at the cusp
                                        is                                          ;
consequently  we  msiy define the cusp as   moving focus, and the caustic
                                                         a
as the surface traced by it. Though hesitate in claiming that this rela

                                        at all novel,        I                      I
have been able to find,    it not brought out in any of the text-books,
caustic surfaces being invariably treated by ray rather than by wate-
front methods.
 If   the wave starts at the principal focus of   hemispherical mirror,
                                                                 a
the reflected front   nearly plane in the vicinity of the axis, curling
                      is
up at the edges, however.   As this flat-bottomed saucer moves up, the

    Kine inatographic Demonstration of Reflected Wave-fronts.        285
curved sides come to a focus along the circular edge of the flat bottom,
so that in one position the front appears as a true plane (fig. 4) ; but
                                  Fio.  4.
from this point     on the curved sides, having passed through a focus,
diverge again and follow the flat bottom.       The cusp formed by the
union of these two portions traces the caustic surface, which is in this
case a very tapering funnel, as is shown well by the geometrical con
struction (fig. 5).
                                  Fig.  5.
   If  now we substitute for the hemisphere a complete sphere, we
obtain very complex forms which cannot be followed except by
geometrical constructions, for the wave is shut up in the mirror and
reflected back and forth, becoming more complicated at each reflection
(fig. 6).  That all of these very intricate forms can be constructed by
                                                              7.2

286     Prof. R W. Wood.      Photography of Sound-waves, and     the
geometry I shall show presently ; and by means of the animatograph,
which Mr. Paul has most kindly placed at our disposal, we can actually
see the wave going through its gymnastics.
                                  Fig. 6.
   The principle of Huygens, that any small portion of a wave-front
can be considered as the centre of a secondary disturbance, and that a
small portion of this new disturbance can in turn be regarded as a new
centre, can be shown by the sound-waves, as well as the obliteration of
the shadow by diffraction, and the secondary wavelets reflected from
corrugated surfaces, interesting in connection with the diffraction
grating.
   Various cases of refraction are also shown, the only novel one being
the transformation of a spherical into a plane wave by a carbonic-acid
lens. The construction of the cylindrical lens, of exceedingly thin
collodion, a matter of considerable difficulty, was successfully accom
plished, the circular flat ends of very thin mica, free from striae,
enabling the passage of the wave through the lens to be followed
{fig. 7).  The other cases of refraction have already been described, as
                                  Fig.  7.

    Kinemaiographic Demonstration         of Reflected Wave-fronts.       287
 well as the very beautiful instance of the formation of a train of waves,
 or musical note, by the reflection of a single pulse from a steep flight
 of steps (fig. 8).
                                     Fig. 8.
    Returning now to the evolutions of plane and spherical waves after
reflection from spherical surfaces, I wish to bring to the attention of
the Society a method of demonstrating in a most graphic manner the
progressive     changes in the wave-front reflected under these con
ditions.
    Having   been unable to so control the time interval between the two
sparks   that  a progressive series could be taken, I adopted the simpler
method of making a large number of geometrical constructions, and
then photographing them on a kinetoscope film.
   As a very large number of drawings (100 or so) must be made if the
result is to be at all satisfactory, a method is desirable that will reduce'
the labour to a minimum.            I may be permitted to give, as an
instance, the method that I devised for building the series illustrating
the reflection of a plane wave in a spherical mirror. The construction
is shown in the figure.
    ABC is the mirror, AOC the plane wave.           Around points on ABC"
as centres describe circles tangent    to  the wave.    These circles will be
enveloped by another surface, ADE, below the mirror (the orthogonal
surface).    If we erect normals on this surface, we have the reflected
rays, and if we measure oft' equal distances on the normals, we have the'
reflected wave-front.      By drawing the orthogonal surface we avoid'
the complication of having to measure off the distances around a'
corner.    The orthogonal surface is an epicycloid formed by the rolling
of a circle of a diameter equal to the radius of curvature of the mirror
 on the mirror's surface, and normals can be erected by drawing the

288     Prof. E. W. Wood.      Photography of Sound-waves, and      tlie
arc  FG (the path of the centre of the generating circle), and describing
circles of diameter BE around various points on it.        A line joining
the point of intersection of one of these circles with the epicycloid,
and the point of tangency with the mirror, will, when produced, give
a reflected ray ; for example,  JK   produced for circle described around
H. This construction once prepared, the series of wave-front pictures
can be very quickly made.        Three or four sheets of paper are laid
under the construction and holes are punched through the pile by
means of a pin, at equal distances along each ray (measured from the
orthogonal surface).
   The centre of the mirror and the point where its axis meets the
surface are also indicated in the same manner.        The sheets are now
separated,  and  corresponding pin-holes  are united   on each sheet by a
broad black line, which represents the wave-front.        After a time it
becomes necessary to consider double reflections, ana to do this we are
compelled to construct twice-reflected rays (indicated by dotted lines),
and .measure around a corner each time.
   About a hundred pictures are prepared for each series, and the
pictures then photographed separately on the film, which, when run

tion of the motion of the wave-front.
   The series illustrating reflection inside of a complete sphere was the

290                 Photography of Sound-waves,     &c.
most difficult to prepare, as several reflections have to be considered.
It has been completed for three reflections, and Mr. Max Mason, of
Madison, to whom       I  am greatly indebted for his patient work in
assisting me, is going on with the series.     As will be seen, the wave
has already become    quite complicated, and it will be interesting to see
what further changes result after three or four more reflections.    I am
also under obligations to Professor A. B. Porter, of Chicago, who pre
pared the set of drawings illustrating the passage of a wave out from
the principal focus of a hemispherical mirror.
                                  Fig. 11.
   A number of points taken at intervals along the film are here
reproduced, and give a fair idea of the transformations.     Fig. 9 shows
the plane wave entering the hemispherical mirror, while in fig. 10 we
have a spherical wave starting on the principal focus of a similar
reflecting surface (compare fig. 9 with fig. 2, and fig. 10 with fig. 4).
Fig. H shows the evolutions of the wave shut upon the complete
spherical mirror, and shows the development of the complicated photo
graphed forms shown in fig.   6.

                                   1.  Introduction.
    The Blue Coral, Heliopora carulea (Pall.) is one of the most isolated
of living animals.         It is the only known species of its genus, and it
has recently been described as the only member of its family.                     Some
Palaeozoic corals have a very similar structure ; but the view that these
extinct Heliolitids are allied to the Helioporids is strongly opposed by
some     eminent     palaeontologists.       If these .authorities be right, then
Heliopora is an animal with no close living relations and with no known
ancestors.
    The only fossil that        has been     regarded with any probability as a
possible link between Heliopora and the extinct Heliolitidae is the Cre
taceous coral Polytremacis.           This genus was founded by d'Orbigny in
1 849, but unfortunately its affinities and structures          are still in doubt.
" If a genus ever was in need of revision," recently exclaimed Professor
Lindstrom [1899, 9, 28], "it is this." Lindstrom indeed suggests
that distinct genera are required for each of von Reuss' three species
of Polytremacis.
    Without a study of type-specimens in several Continental museums,
a final revision of the genus is impossible for three reasons.                     The
characters of Polytremacis bullosa d'Orb., the species on which the genus
was originally established, are quite unknown ; there is one uncertain
feature in P. blainvillei (Mich.), the acting type species ; and doubts
have been expressed as to the accuracy of von Reuss' figures of the
 specimens which he identified as P. blainvillei.             But in preparing a
 description of a new species of Heliopora from Somali-land, I have been
 led to examine      the material      in the British Museum collection.            The

292                                    Prof.    J.   W. Gregory.
results seem to confirm the old view of the affinity between the Helio-
litidae and the Helioporidas, by showing that Polytremacis is truly
intermediate between the two families.    In that case Polytremacis is of
considerable phylogenetic interest as an ancestor of Heliopora. I there
fore venture to submit this paper to the Society which has published
the two most important contributions to our knowledge of that im
portant coral.
                          2.    The Type of Polytremacis.
                was founded by d'Orbigny in 1849, when he gave it the
     Polytremacis
                                                    "
following very inadequate diagnosis [14, p. 11] : — c'est vui Stylophora
sans saillies aux calices, ceux-ci simplement creuses.  Intervalle d'un
tissu poreux, granuleux en derails. Ensemble amorphe."        The only
species named is P. bullosa d'Orb. from the Cenomanian of the He d'Aix,
Charente-Inf erieure ; it was defined the following year [15, p. 183] as
"                                                      That species has
  espece globuleuse, arrondie a calices assez grands."
never been figured, and the type specimen is apparently                   not available,
as Milne Edwards and Haime [5, p. 232] who quoted                        it,
                                                                           have simply
repeated d'Orbigny's statement.  P. bulbosa may therefore be dismissed
as   nomen nudum, and another type must be found for the genus. This
     a
task     is
       easy.   D'Orbigny's second reference to Polytremacis was in his
 Prodrome de Paleontologie,' where (vol.     p. 209) he gives a list of
                                                               2,

four      species.    The      first    of the four
                                            the Heliopora blainvUlei of
                                                          is
Michelin [10,   27, Plate
                     p.        fig. 6], from the Turonian of Vaucluse.
                                          7,
The other three were new     species founded by d'Orbigny, apparently
on mere varieties of P. blainvUlei.    The three new species were not
figured, and    were  subsequently accepted by Milne Edwards and
Haime on d'Orbigny's authority. There can therefore be no question
that of these four species P. blainvUlei (Mich.) must be taken as the
type of Polytremacis.
  The characters of this species are, however, somewhat doubtful.
Michelin's original figure represented a lobed corallum, with one short
cylindrical branch the calicles are generally crowded and separated
                          ;
by areas about as wide as themselves.    The rim of the calicle notched        is
by a series of sixteen or twenty teeth.
     In    von Eeuss [16,
          1854              136, Plate 24, figs. 4-7] figured a coral
                                           p.
from the Turonian of Gosau, and identified    as P. blainvUlei. Milne
                                                                    it
Edwards and Haime [5, p. 232], to whom Michelin's types were easily
accessible, accepted the accuracy of the determination, and described
von Reuss' figures as " very good."      But Lindstrom not only denies
the accuracy of the specific identification, but urges that the coral                  is
generically distinct from Polytremacis [9, p. 28].
   The Polytremacis blainvUlei of Michelin differs from that of von
Beuss in two respects. The coral thus named by the former author
has no lamellar septa, but only a series of " pseudosepta
                                                          "

              Polytremacis and                 the   Ancestry of Helioporidce.              293
teeth    in the coral figured by von Keuss, each calicle has from eight
          ;
to fourteen   lamellar septa.   The second difference is much less im
 portant, and consists in the more crowded arrangement of the calicles
 in Michelin's type of the species ; but the distribution is not uniform
 in Michelin's specimen, and varies enormously in a series of specimens
 from the Turonian of the Bouches-du-Rhdne recently received by the
 British Museum.     The difference in the septa    however, more signifi   is,
 cant that the septa in some of the Gosau Polytremacis are lamellar
      ;                                                                                      is
.shown by Lindstrom's own description of         specimen sent him from
                                                                    a
Vienna. It does not seem to me necessary to regard the difference as
-of generic   value         but         certainly seems reasonable to treat   as       it
                                   I it
                        ;                                                                    a
specific distinction, and                therefore propose to name the Gosau sped
mens with long septa Polytremacis                    septifera.
  The type species            of Polytremacis           is     therefore P. blainvillei (Mich.)
non Reuse.
                    3.      The Structure of Polytremacis.
     Corallum. — The corallum       irregularly lobed, or grows in thick
                                               is
 ¦cylindrical branches.    The whole surface      granulated.  The calices
                                                                    is
¦are crowded                                and  irregularly separated (P.
                (P. blainvillei) or widely
jxirtscht).   The greatest separation        due to the closure of dead
                                                         is
 calicles by growth of ccenenchymal caeca (as in Heliolites inkrstinctus                      ;

                                                                         1). is

   Thin sections show that the corallum           deeply excavated by large
                                                                  is
cylindrical calicles, the walls of which are smooth or fluted. In
typical calicles the walls are thick; but young calicles and some
internal ones may remain in a thin-walled Heliopora stage (Plate                             2,
fig. 3). The calicles are surrounded by narrow caeca, which are circular
or elliptical in section. The caeca may be irregular in arrangement, or
occur in a circle round       calicle.
                                    a   Outgrowths from the caeca or from
the calicle traverse the caecal mass like canals.
   Septal Structures or " Pseadosepta." — The external rim of the calicle                    is
marked by an irregular series of granules forming septal teeth like
those of Heliopora, as, e.g., in Michelin's original figure of P. blainvillei.
These  teeth may be continued down the sides of the calicles as con
tinuous ridges, which may be few and long, as in P. septifera, or
numerous and short, as in P. blainvillei.  The septal ridges may be
continued radially outwards   on the surface they then appear as lines
                                           ;
of radial granules (Plate     fig. 1); internally, in thin sections, they
                                          2,
appear as lamellae, continued outward as costal lamellae separating the
ccenenchymal caeca.   This arrangement       not shown in all sections
                                                               is                             ;
it    illustrated by Plate
     is                       fig. 4a.
                                     2,  Lindstrom's figure of Plasmopora
suprema   shows   similar
                    a     structure  [9, Plate    fig. 24].         7,
     In the older parts of the calicles the septal structures are absent

294                            Prof. J.  W. Gregory.
and the calicular walls are plain, as in the corresponding stages of
Heliopora (cf. 7, Plate 13, fig. 4) and some Heliolites [9, Plate 2, figs. 16,
18, and 20].
    The number of septal ridges and teeth is variable (as in Heliopora) ;
the number is from 16 to 20 in P. blainvillei and from 8 to 20 in P.
septifera.
    Aureole. — The wall of the calicle may be thin in young and some
internal calicles, but in mature calicles it is greatly thickened.        It may
                             " aureole "
be surrounded        by an                (Lindstrom) of large ca;ca, with the
walls continuous with the septa as in the Heliolitid Plasnwpora (rf.
Lindstrom's figure of P. stella, 9, Plate 11, fig. 36).
     Tabula occur across both the calicles and ccenenchymal caeca.
    Baculi.  — Eod-like pillars of compact, calcareous material,            which
Lindstrom      has   described in the Heliolitidas, occur in P. blainvillei, as
remarked by Lindstrom [9, p. 28].
                    4.  The Affinities of Polytkemacis.
              A.  Tlie Relations of  the Helioporida- and Hdiolitidw.
     The preceding account of the structure of Polytremacis shows that
the coral consists of a series of tubes, which are marked internally by
longitudinal ridges, are crossed by transverse tabulae, and are separated
by smaller caecal tubuli.        This structure agrees with that of both the
living Helioporidse      and the Palaeozoic Heliolitidae, and the affinities of
Polytremacis     are clearly with one or other of those families.
     We have, therefore, to consider the question whether the two
 families are themselves nearly related.              All the older and many
 recent authorities regard them as intimately allied.              Blainville, in
 1834 [2, p. 392], included them both in the genus Heliopora.               Dana,
 in 1848 [4, pp. 539-541], separated them generically, but left them
 in one sub-family — the Helioporinse.           Zittel, in 1879 [20, p. 212],
 Studer, in 1887 [18, p. 21], and Sardeson, in 1896 [17, p. 353], all
 included them in one family.            Bourne, in 1895 [3], has warmly sup
 ported the view of the intimate alliance of the two groups.               On the
 other hand the existence of any special affinity between the Helio-
 porids and the Heliolitids is denied by Lindstrom [9, pp. 25-26],.
 Hinde [8, p. 87], and Wentzel [19, p. 490]. It is not even always
 admitted that the corals belong to the same subphylum ; for while
 Heliopora is unquestionably an Aleyonarian, according to F. Bernard
  [1, p. 187], the Heliolitidje may be Hydrozoa.
     The proposed separation of the Helioporidse from the Heliolitidas is
 based on two characters : (1) the presence of true septa in the latter
 and not in the former ; (2) the absence from the Helioporidre of the
 calicular theca of the Heliolitidas.

             Polytremacis and        the Ancestry    oj Hclioporidcc.         295
  To determine the affinities of Polytremacis we must appreciate these
characters : —
  B. The Septal Structures. — According to Dr. Hinde [8, p. 87],
Neumayr      [11, p. 320-1], andJ. Wentzel [19, p. 490], Heliolites differs
essentially from Heliopora, in the possession of definite septa, which those
authors apparently regard as homologous with the septa of madrepora-
rian corals. In Heliopora there are no such septa; the structures
originally described as such are a series of teeth round the rim of the
calicular tube ; below each tooth a fluted ridge runs down the tube for
some distance. Neumayr, in 1899, proposed for these ridges the name
of " pseudosepta " [11, p. 306], and the term has been widely accepted ;
for, as Lind8tr6m remarks, the ridges are simply the projections of the
ccenenchymal caeca.*
   But the rule that the Heliolitids have septa and Heliopora has only
" pseudosepta," is not absolute. Lindstrom has
                                                figured sections across
Heliolites in which the septa are absent and tbe sections are identical
with those of Heliopora.  For instance, Lindstrom 's figure [9, Plate 1,
fig. 24] may be compared   with a section of Heliopora cmrulea figured
in 1895 [7, Plate 63, fig.     Both sections consist of crowded poly
                               4].
gonal, thin-walled tubes, without any sign of septa or "pseudosepta."
Moreover, Nicholson has figured a calicle of Heliopora in which the
"pseudosepta" are more strongly developed than in the "septa" of
some Heliolites [12, p. 333].
  But  it   by no means certain
            is                          that there   is   any essential difference
                                                         "
between the septa of Heliolites and the " pseudosepta      of Heliopora.
According to Bourne the large calicles of Heliopora are formed by the
fusion of nineteen ccenenchymal ca?ca into  single cavity.
                                                    a        The fusion
of the group of caeca   caused by the expansion of the central caecum,

which, as   grows,
            it      absorbs the adjacent parts of the surrounding caeca.
The outermost parts of the walls between the six peripheral caeca
remain   for    time as radial septa they are finally absorbed as the
                 a                         ;

cess may be seen along the growing edge of a lamellar corallum of
Heliopora.   It illustrated by a series of four figures. Fig. 6a shows

sense.  When the septa are greatly reduced they are referred to as septal ridges,
analogous  to the septal spines of Madreporaria.      If the pejorative prefix be
accepted in the one case, itought to be in the others, and Polyirtmaci» might be
defined aa  a coral (or perhaps a pseudocoral) composed of pscudotheca,      with a
variable number of pseudosepta,    separated by pseudocamenehymn,     traversed by
pseudotabes?,  and with   abasal deposit of pseudepitheca.

stage before the development of septa.      The next figure (fig. 64) shows
a   slight increase in the size of the central tube and reduction in that
of the peripheral tubes.     In the next stage (fig. 6r) the central tube is
large, and is surrounded by a zone of compressed tubuli.            Finally,
there is the stage in which the septal structures appear.     This stage is
illustrated (fig. &d) by a calicle with one well-developed septum, which
is the continuation  of the wall separating two adjacent tubuli.
   That the calicles and septa of Heliolites are formed by the same pro
cess appears probable from evidence cited by Lindstrom, who has given
a series of figures showing the development of a group of caeca            into a
large calicle, some of the ctecal walls remaining as septa (see Plate 2,
fig. 7, a-g).
   Hence it appears probable that the septa of Heliolites are not homo
logous with the septa of Madreporaria ; for they are the remnants of
walls and not special outgrowths from the margin of corallites. They
are as much  "             "
               pseudosepta as the corresponding ridges in Heliopom.
Why the septal structures are, as Professor Nicholson remarks,
" approximately constant " in number and large in Heliolilet, while they
are small in size and variable in number in Heliopora, is easily
explained.   It is, in fact, the necessary consequence of the difference
in size and regularity of the ccenenchymal caeca in the two genera.
The caeca of Heliopora are relatively more numerous, smaller, and less
regular than in Heliolites. Accordingly, as the calicle of Heliopora grows
and absorbs the surrounding caeca, there is left a considerable and
variable number of septal ridges.
   That the caeca of the modern representatives of the Heliolitidaj
should be smaller than those of the Palaeozoic forms is not surprising.
It is the natural line of development. Heliopora may therefore be
explained as a Heliolitid in which the caeca have decreased in size and
increased in number.
   C. The Calicular Them of Heliolitidd. — According to Lindstrom,
                                                                   " the
feature which decidedly removes it [Heliopora] far from the Heliolitidae
is the total want of a calicular theca." Professor Freeh gives different
expression to the same idea ; he states [6, p. 500] that the walls of
the calicles in Heliopora are perforated and incomplete, whereas those
of Heliolites are complete, and the calicles are closed tubes. Freeh's
statement        is,
               however, not correct, as a matter of fact [cf. Moseley, 13,
p. 112]    but his idea
             ;            apparently the same as that which has been so
                             is
beautifully worked out by Professor Lindstrom.
  Heliolites, according to Lindstrom, has   true theca,* which
                                                      a                    is   the
    *   It   may save some misunderstandingto remark that Lindstrom distinguishes
three thecal structures: (1) the calicular theca which bounds the inner axial part
of the calicle (2) the external theca, which includes the calicular theca and all
                  ;
the casnenchvma    which has developed from it; and (3) the ccsnotheca (aox
Bourne), which covers the lower part of the eorallum like the epitheca of com
pound Madreporaria.

               Polytremaeis and      the Ancestry of Hel ioporida.'.           297
first part of the skeleton to      be formed, and which persists in the       adult
as the calicular     tube or inner tube of the calicle.       In the development
of   a  young Heliolites the thecal tube is first formed      ;   when this tube is
complete      a series of septa develop from      the inner walls of the tube,
and then the ccenenchyma begins to form on the outer side of it.
     Bourne, on the other hand, gives a very different explanation of
the structure of the corallum, and holds that it is fundamentally the
same in Heliopora and Heliolites, in both of which the calicle is bounded
by a " ccenotheca," i.e., a tube formed of the walls of a group of different
elements in a colony, secondarily united into a single tube [3, p. 468].
     Unfortunately nothing is known of the development of the primary
calicle    in Heliopora, so that no direct comparison of that stage in the
two groups is possible. But the comparison of the formation of young
calicles on the growing edges of Heliopora affords some suggestive
hints. The young calicles in both genera pass through identical stages,
 which are represented for Heliopora by fig. 6, a-d, and for Heliolites
porosus     by fig. 7, a-g.   In both cases the calicular theca of the com
 plete calicle represents either the outer walls of the group of caeca
 which formed the calicle, or was formed by those outer walls being
 absorbed and re-deposited during the process of ccenenchymal gemma
 tion.
     A   direct comparison of the development of the primary calicles in
 Heliopora and Heliolites would, no doubt, afford a better basis for an
 opinion than can be obtained from the development of young calicles
 in old coralla. But until zoologists work out the development of
 Heliopora, we can only appeal to the comparison of young equivalent
 calicles, and they develop On the same lines.
     Hence, though nervous at differing from two such authorities                as
 Professor     Lindstrom and Dr. Hinde, I am bound to confess myself
 unconvinced       that any essential difference between the Helioporidse
 and Heliolitidae has yet been established.               Accordingly it is not
 unreasonable to expect in Mesozoic deposits some connecting links
 between      the living    and   Palaeozoic   representatives      of the group.
  Polytremaeis appears to me to be such an intermediate form. P. septifera,
  with its eight to fourteen or twenty well-developed septa, agrees with
  Heliolites, differing by the less regularity in the number of septa.          The
  Tiu-onian P. blainvillei and the Eocene P. bellardi agree with Heliopora,
  as the septa are reduced to septal ridges.
     If  we place any species of Polytremaeis         in the Heliolitidae,* that
  family can no longer be described as characterised by the possession of
  twelve septa.       If, on the other hand, we place P. septifera in the
  Helioporidae,     we   have to admit in that family the presence of septa
  as well-defined     as they are in some Heliolitidae.          In either case the
   distinction   between the two families, based on the septal characters,

 has broken down.          The only     escape  from this difficulty is the heroic
 course of   dividing    Pohjtreinacm   into two unrelated divisions, one species
 being regarded as an         isolated, belated survivor of the Heliolitidae, and
 another as a premature ancestor of the Helioporidae.
    Pohjlmnaris agrees with the Heliolitidae by many remarkable                 points
 of structure, such as the presence of the aureole, the closure of dead
 calicles by coenenchymal overgrowth, and the inconstancy of the septa
 in the lower parts of the calicles. Polytremacis is allied to Heliopora by
 equally    striking points of resemblance, such as the fluted calicular
 walls,   with their numerous, irregular, septal ridges, the granular
 external surface with its circumcalicular ring of septal teeth. On the
 axiom that things that are allied to the same are allied to one another,
 the close affinity of Hdiopora          and Hdiolites   seems more probable      than
 some palaeontologists are inclined           to admit.     Heliopora, in fact, may
 have descended from the Heliolitidae by the reduction in size and conse
 quent increase in number and in variability of arrangement of the
 ccpnenchym.il     caeca.

von Reuss, and Stoliczka for the Helioporids with long septa, which
almost meet in the middle of the calicles. But von Reuss has
remarked on the difficulty in using this uncertain character, and con
cludes that the separation of the genera is not based on any very firm
ground.
    The character of the calicular walls appears more reliable, especially
as   it appears to      be geographically       distinctive,    Heliopora being limited
to the Indian Ocean and Pacific, while Polytremacis occurs in the Upper
Cretaceous and Lower Cainizoic of central Europe and France.                           The
two genera seem very closely allied,               and    I should   not   be surprised if
they are ultimately united.

   " Angular Coxa." — von Reuss [16, Plate                    24. fig. 3] has show n some
angular cseea, which Lindstrom                   has referred to as stellate, and different
from anything in Heliopora. A very similar arrangement occurs in
patches in Heliopora somaliensis (rf. Plate 2, fig. 8b), where it  how                              is,
ever, clearly due to the inclusion of quartz-grains in the coral.   The
quartz-grains are scattered in patches, which sometimes (as in fig. 84)
cut abruptly across a calicle.  In some cases these patches were clearly
post-mortem    in reference to the adjacent calicles, but were formed
during the life of the corallum.

                                         [Plate 3].
    At   the beginning of September last year,             I  visited Valencia, Co.
Kerry.       It occurred to me there that coccospheres might possibly be
drifted in on the warm current of the Gulf Stream, which impinges
on the south-west coast of           Ireland, and as they float in would become
entangled      in  the sea-weeds      on the coast.    With this idea, I gathered
some of the finer marine algse, such as species of Cladophora, Polysi-
phonia, and Plocamium, &c, from the rock pools in Valencia Harbour.
Taking care to wash as little of the silt or sediment as possible from
them, I fixed the mass in dilute formalin.
    This method proved to be a most satisfactory way of collecting
coccospheres and coecoliths.              In the first sample of sea-weeds thus
gathered at a venture, I obtained several hundreds of coccospheres,
and of course innumerable coecoliths.             In practice, the most convenient
 way of gathering coccospheres in abundance was found to be to
 collect the sea-weed, and there and then to wash the sediment from it
 in sea-water and formalin, or in alcohol, or in sea-water and osmic
 acid.    The sediment which settles down in the fixing fluid will after
 wards be found to contain              large numbers of coccospheres.        In pre
 parations made from material collected in this manner, and mounted
 imder a cover-glass 22 mm. x 22 mm., I have counted as many as
 fourteen coccospheres.            Of course there are many other organisms
  present   in  addition     to  the  coccospheres, e.g., various Crustacea, mites,
  worms, molluscs, foraminifera, infusoria, diatoms, peridinese, &c.
    I am indebted for most of the material from which the following

300            Dr. H. H. Dixon.          On the Structure     of
observations are made to Miss Delap and Mr. C. Green, who kindly
gathered the algae, the former at Valencia and the latter at Water-
ville, and posted them to me, to be then fixed in one or other of the
fixing fluids mentioned above.
    All the coccospheres found agree in their characters with Wallich's
Coccospluera pelagica and all the free coccoliths observed are apparently
derived from that organism, all being oval and often possessing the
characteristic D-shaped apertures.         Throughout my search I did not
find a specimen of Coccosphcera leptopora of Murray and Blackman, so
that apparently this latter is absent from or very scarce in the ocean
near our coasts.
    The examination      of fresh   coccospheres     in   sea-water afforded no
evidence as to whether these organisms were alive or dead when col
lected ; no protoplasmic protrusions could be seen extending from the
apertures in the coccoliths nor from the spaces between the coccoliths ;
nor could any spontaneous motion be observed in the coccospheres.
In sea-water the coccospheres appear quite colourless, except for the
bluish-green appearance of the covering coccoliths, due apparently
to the fact that their refractive index is higher than the water in which
they are immersed.       No coloration due to the presence of an internal
chromatophore      nor  any sign of such a body could in any case be
made out.
    The absence of the chromatophore, recorded by Murray and Black-
man as occurring in C. leptopora, is not, I think, sufficient reason for
concluding that all the coccospheres examined had been for some time
dead, and so had lost their cell contents ; for the coccospheres            were
in the great majority of cases quite perfect, and, as we will see later
on, the presence of proteid material and probably of a nucleus in a
large number of them was revealed by various stains and reagents.
Some, however, were devoid of contents or possessed so little that
their presence eluded detection.
                              External Characters.
    As Murray and Blackman* point out, there is considerable variation
in the size of Coccosphmra pelagica.         Of about fifty specimens taken
at random and measured, the largest had a diameter measuring 0'0294
mm., and the smallest 0'0199 mm. This variation is in part due to
the inconstancy in the number of coccoliths on the coccospheres, and in
part to the varying amount of overlap of the coccoliths over one
another.    The greatest number of coccoliths           observed by me on one
coccosphere was sixteen and the smallest six.           Fig. 1 (Plate 3) shows a
coccosphere captured in 1897 in Killiney Bay,          having only six or seven
coccoliths upon it. Fig. 2 shows a fragment             of another coccosphere

equally small, taken in Valencia Harbour in 1899.             It is difficult 'to
estimate with certainity the number of coccoliths on the coccosphere
while it is intact, and one is apt to under-estimate it. But it is pos
sible to make sure of accuracy by crushing coccospheres mounted in
glycerine jelly.     The coccoliths are then sufficiently separated from
one another to enable one to count them easily, while the viscidity of
the mounting medium does not allow any of them to be lost.                It was
from coccospheres treated in this manner that the maximum and
minimum numbers here stated were derived.
   The variation in the amount of overlap brings it to pass that some
times coccospheres with a small number of coccoliths upon them have
an equal or even greater diameter than others which carry a larger
number of coccoliths.       To quote an example : — Two coccospheres were
found, each measuring 0*021 mm. in diameter; one of these carried
ten coccoliths and the other only seven.
   The coccoliths, although they do not vary so much as the cocco
spheres in their dimensions, yet differ from one another considerably
in size. From a large number of measurements of the long axis of
the oval, it was found that the extremes deviated from the mean by as
much as 20 per cent., the maximum being 0'018 mm. and the minimum
0"013 mm., while the mean was 0*015 mm.
   This variation in size of the component coccoliths is in part but
not,  I think, to a large extent, responsible for the variation in the size
of the coccospheres, as it is found that coccoliths of different sizes
occur on one and the same coccosphere.            It will be seen later that
there is some reason to believe that the smaller coccoliths are formed
in the early stages of the coccosphere's life history when it is itself
small.    It  may be noted that the smaller     coccoliths  on a coccosphere
are often,   if not usually, without the transverse bar across the central
perforation.
   Some of the finer details of the structure of the coccoliths are more
easily made out when these latter are examined in situ on the cocco
spheres, as then in the one field coccoliths may be examined in almost
every position, and views from different directions may be carefully
compared.       Broken coccospheres, too, often afford valuable evidence as
to the relations of the coccoliths to one another and their interlocking.
This last point, as well as the shape of the body surrounded by the
valves, is greatly elucidated by observations made on microtome sec
tions of material embedded in paraffin.       The most instructive prepara
tions were obtained from sections 5/* — 10//. thick - often those of 10ft
are more satisfactory     than the thinner ones, as, despite the support
afforded by the paraffin, the coccoliths in the latter are so often badly
shaken and cracked that the fine details of their structure are not so
 well seen as they are to the thicker sections.
   When    a coccolith is examined  in actual or optical vertical section, it is

308               Dr. H. H. Dixon.       On the Structure of
seen that the oval disc, which     I shall call the body of the coccolith, form
ing    the  bottom of the central depression and carrying the single slit or
two D-shaped holes, is of some considerable thickness (figs. 3, 4, and
5). Its inner surface projects very slightly inside the inner valve,
and the slit or D-shaped perforations are enlarged towards its inner
and outer surfaces. The whole coccolith consequently has the form
of a very short, thick- walled, oval tube, with its outer extremity re
curved to form the outer valve.            The inner valve is a dished collar
attached very close to the inner extremity of the tube. The projec
tion of the tube-like portion, or body, inside the inner valve is very
slight, and can only be made out either by sections or by very careful
focussing.
     An examination of the coccoliths in plan has also revealed a few
points of interest.      Where the body of the coccolith comes in contact
with the depressed portion of the outer valve, there are to be seen a
series of very minute punctations (fig. 6) corresponding, as far as could
be ascertained,     with the radiating grooves between the striations of the
 valve.      It is possible that these punctations represent the ends of
 minute passages running down the outside of the body and inside the
 valves of the coccolith.      Another point that may be noticed has refer
 ence to the material composing the transverse bar usually present,
 dividing the slit-like canal of the body into the two D-shaped holes.
 This bar is often obviously composed of somewhat different material
 from the rest of the coccolith, and this difference extends for some dis
 tance beyond the edges of the slit continuing the direction of the bar.
 In appearance the bar and its continuation are less highly refractive
 than the rest ; and the difference of material is further manifested by
 the fact that it dissolves more rapidly in weak acids than the body of
 the coccolith, while this latter goes into solution more readily than the
 collar-shaped portion uniting the two valves.                It must be borne in
 mind, however, that this difference in the rates of solution may be in
 part or completely due to a difference in the ease of diffusion round
  these    parts.  It will be seen later that the order of solution is the
  reverse of the order of development.          The oldest parts of the coccolith
  are the last to be dissolved.
      In a previous note Dr. Joly* and       I   have already noticed that there
  is no evolution of free gas when coccoliths are attacked by acids.          This
  is probably due to the fact that the amount of gas they generate is
  unable to overcome the cohesion of the liquid in which the reaction
  takes place. From this consideration it would appear that the absence
  of free gas under the action of acids is no objection to regarding cocco
  liths as composed in the main of calcium carbonate.                 To test the
  validity of this   view  I  mounted some        fine  precipitated  calcium  car
   bonate in water, which had been boiled so that it thoroughly wetted the

crystalline precipitate.     While this preparation was under observation,
dilute acid was introduced under the cover-glass, and it was found
that gas bubbles were generated in connection with the larger crystal
line aggregates only, while the smaller ones dissolved without any gas
appearing in their immediate neighbourhood, even after the liquid was
completely     saturated, and contained much free gas.              Crystalline
masses    having a diameter of 0'027 mm. dissolved in this manner
without the formation of bubbles.           In the case of the solution of
the larger masses, an increase in size of the bubbles previously
existing in their neighbourhood was observable. It seems quite prob
able that if greater care were taken to eliminate all free gas from the
water in which the crystals were mounted and from the added acid,
that much larger masses of calcium carbonate might be brought into
solution without the evolution of bubbles, as then the cohesion of the
liquid would have to       l)e overcome   before    they   could   appear.   To
overcome this woidd require a force of many atmospheres.                In any
case the observation quoted shows that solid masses of calcium car
bonate having the same diameter as a coccosphere (and consequently
containing a great deal more calcium carbonate), dissolve without pro
ducing free carbon dioxide.
   Besides their ready solution in weak acids, the behaviour of coccoliths
towards    picric nigrosine is very characteristic of calcium carbonate.
While the coccolith is dissolving in this stain a dense, dark, but
extremely fine precipitate or coloration is formed on its surface.          The
same reaction may be observed in the solution of small crystals of
calcium carbonate.      In the case of the coccolith the precipitate is most
marked in the D-shaped holes, round the collar connecting the two
valves, and along the radial striae on the valves.      It seems probable that
 the remaining parts of the valves do not possess sufficient material to-
 render the reaction apparent in their case.           Besides thus affording
additional evidence as to the nature of the material forming coccoliths,
this reaction makes several obscure points in their structure stand out
with great clearness.
    That the coccolith is not pure calcium carbonate appears from its
behaviour towards a 1 per cent, solution of sodium carbonate.             When
mounted in this reagent the coccolith after a short time assumes a
peculiar appearance. Its surface becomes lumpy and loses its clean-cut
contour.     Some coccoliths exhibit this change much more markedly
than others, and all more plainly towards their periphery than at the*
 centre.   It is probable that the change is brought about by the solution
 of the organic basis remaining over in the coccolith. The completeness
 of the replacement     of the organic basis by calcium carbonate would
 then determine      the extent of the change.*          The same change is
   * Calcareous sponge spicules undergo a similar change   when treated with this
 reagent.

noticeable, but to a much less degree, when coccoliths are treated with
a 20 per cent, solution of sodium chloride.
   On the coccosphere the coccoliths overlap each other to a consider
able extent.   The amount of overlap is not constant. It is usual for
the outer valve of one to penetrate between the outer and inner valves
of its neighbour, so far as to reach the collar uniting the two valves.
(Figs. 7, 8, 9 and 4.) In this way the coccoliths on the surface of
a coccosphere interlock with one another, and form a comparatively
rigid shell.        The bevelled         of the coccolith is evidently necessi
                                     shape
tated by the overlapping           on a curved surface. The rigidity of this
form of structure is best appreciated from the examination of fragments
of a broken coccosphere, which will preserve their curvature even
when they are composed of only three or four coccoliths.      Such a
fragment is shown in fig. 2. Indeed the interlocking of the coccoliths
is   so completethat it seems impossible to break up a coccosphere
without at the same time splitting the valves of several of its coccoliths.
Some distortion in its shape      however, possible without fracturing
                                          is,
the coccoliths.                 possibly due to the give in the outer
                        This yield   is
region of the valves, which appear to contain     considerable amount

of organic material in their composition.
  If coccospheres are dissolved in acid and subsequently or simulta
neously stained, appearances are observed which seem to point to the
existence of an extremely fine pellicle covering over the coccoliths and
enclosing the whole sphere. The simplest method of demonstrating
this pellicle   by mixing up in glycerine jelly
                   is                           stain to which a trace
                                                           a
of nitric or hydrochloric acid has been added. The coccospheres are
then mounted in this medium, and the solution and staining go on
simultaneously.    Or again the material containing the coccospheres
may bo mounted in feebly acidulated jelly, and then a drop of the
stain selected applied to the edge of the cover-glass. Either of these
methods give good results (fig. 10)   the solution

The best results are obtained when the coccoliths take a fortnight or
more to disappear.  The stains used were acid fuchsine and methyl
                                          I
green, fuchsine and iodine green, aniline blue, aniline green, and
nigrosine.

the pellicle are a number of oval holes, corresponding in position and
number to the central depressions of the coccoliths which have dis
appeared.    The edges of the oval perforations are jagged, and from
the irregular teeth extend radial striae, which perhaps correspond to
the striae of the coccoliths. The striaa from two adjacent perforations
are often continuous.  The jagged teeth of the pellicle may often be
made out by careful focussing of the surface of the coccosphere, even
before   it  attacked by acids and stained.

coccospheres there is a residue of stained material left in the central
part of the holes, corresponding roughly in shape and position to the
D-shaped perforations of the body of the coccoliths.  This residue may
possibly be the remains of protoplasmic filaments or protrusions once
extending from the central region of the coccosphere. Similar granular
slimy masses may frequently be seen in stained* and undissolved cocco
spheres occupying more or less of the central depressions of the cocco
liths; but their irregularity of occurrence and shape make it impossible
to say whether they are proteid material in connection with and de
rived from the central body of the coccosphere, or slime adventitiously
deposited from the surrounding liquid.        •
                                Internal Structure.
   By continuing  the solution with acid, several points of the internal
structure of coccospheres become apparent.        The external pellicle
gradually disappears, and  only a number   of disconnected, very minute
granules persist to mark its position.    The jagged edges of the holes
persist the longest, but finally they also dissolve. If the coccosphere
is stained in this condition it will appear tfiat immediately within the
external pellicle which has now disappeared there is a slimy proteid
material, in which the inner valves and bodies of the covering cocco
liths were embedded.    Sometimes after treatment with nitric acid and
staining with aniline blue this material has a homogeneous appearance,
and is uniformly stained, while the positions once occupied by the
coccoliths are colourless and transparent.    More frequently, however,
it is a finely and sparsely granular slime (fig. 9). It gives a faint
orange coloration with nitric acid, followed by ammonia.
   This slimy layer, in which the coccoliths are embedded, is bounded
internally by a gelatinous, transparent, and sometimes slightly strati
fied membrane (figs. 11 — 14).  There is usually no definite demarcation
between the two, but the membrane passes imperceptibly into the
slimy material outside.   The internal valves of the coccoliths rest upon
this membrame, and it is often seen to be drawn out into prominences
corresponding with the position of the coccoliths on its outside.       In
optical section discontinuities are sometimes apparent in this mem
brane (figs. 13, 14), and it may be that these represent perforations
corresponding with the perforations of the coccoliths, and through
which the internal protoplasm communicates with the external sur
roundings.    The membrane itself is difficult to stain, and      like the
                                                                         it,
  *I   have found Bismarck brown, aniline blue, acid fuchsine, and methyl green
useful stains for bringing out the structure of undissolved coccospheres. Delafield's
hematoxylin sometimes gives very good results when precipitations do not occur.
Material stained with the last mentioned       is  most satisfactory for microtome
sectioning.

312             Dr. H. H. Dixon.         On tJie Structure  of
slimy layer, exhibits a slight orange coloration when treated with
nitric acid followed by ammonia. With Schultze's solution it becomes
amber-coloured.
    Within this internal membrane in all my specimens but scanty proto
plasmic contents were revealed, but in these there was often distin
guishable a minute, more darkly staining body, presumably a nucleus.
In several specimens this nucleus was double or hour-glass shaped
(figs. 12 and 15).     My specimens did not show the structure of the
nucleus with precision, and nothing beyond its granular appearance
and probable possession of a membrane could be made out. The aggre
gation of protoplasm in which the nucleus is situated occupies a
lateral position, and is in contact with the internal membrane, and
strands of protoplasm extend from it across the cavity of the sphere.
In no case was a chromatophore, nor anything like one, seen in the
protoplasm.     In one case a colourless trilobed body was found in the
cell; its nature   is quite uncertain.     Fig. 16 is drawn of it after its
containing coccosphere was treated with liquor iodi. The unfavourable
conditions of our coasts are, perhaps, responsible for the scantiness of
the protoplasmic contents of the coccospheres obtained in the south of
Ireland. But to these unfavourable conditions can scarcely be attri
buted the absence of the chromatophore, for the existence of which in
C. pelagica we have no definite evidence.
    I now go on to a series of observations which seem to me to be of
considerable interest, as throwing some light on the manner of growth
of coccospheres, and on the origin and development of coccoliths.          If
entire coccospheres are examined in a medium of high refractive index,
e.g., balsam, or even glycerine jelly, it will be found that numerically
about 80 per cent, of them contain an internal oval colourless body.
Closer examination     reveals that this body is in many cases a complete
and perfect coccolith (fig. 17), in others it is a simple oval ring or
shallow collar (figs. 3, 7, 8, 15).     All stages of development connecting
the collar-shaped body     with  the  complete coccolith are found, so that
it becomes evident that the coccolith arises as a ring of calcium car
bonate within the coccosphere.          At first the ring is a narrow band
(fig. 3), it then deepens into a collar (fig. 8) ; on either end of the
collar are then secreted oblique flanges (fig. 15), which, as deposition
continues, are developed into the bevelled valves of the coccolith
(figs. 7 and 17).    The central body appears last, and only in its later
stages is the transverse bar secreted, dividing its single aperture into
two.    The position of the internal coccolith within the coccosphere
varies ; generally speaking, in its earlier stages of development, it
lies near the centre of the sphere, and in many cases it was found in
contact with the nucleus (figs. 15, 17).         When more mature it comes
into contact with the inner gelatinous membrane, and when the cocco
sphere   is intact, appears   in  close proximity to the external coccoliths

                  Coccospheres   and  the  Origin of Coceoliths.             313
(fig. 18).    It is presumably to be inferred that it is finally extruded
between these latter, and takes up its position in the shell of the
sphere.
    The internal coccolith gives the same reactions as the outer ones.
When a coccosphere is acted on by acids, the internal coccolith, if pre
sent, is the last (as we might expect) to dissolve (fig. 14), and in its
solution its radial striae are the last parts of it to disappear.         Under
treatment with picric-nigrosine, the behaviour of a coccosphere con
taining an internal coccolith is characteristic.            First the external
coceoliths darken, and their strife and other details stand out with
great clearness ; as solution proceeds, a very dark coloration covers all
the outer coceoliths, and when this clears away, their solution is all
but complete.        The internal coccolith then goes through the same
phases as the outer ones      ; its striae become clearer,   it darkens, and,  as
it goes into solution, the whole cavity of the sphere becomes filled
 with a dark green coloration.          The appearance of this coloration is
sometimes very sudden ; it disappears with less rapidity. When it is
 gone, the scanty protoplasm, nucleus, gelatinous and slimy envelopes
 stained with the nigrosine are all that are left of the coccosphere.
     As a general rule, only one internal coccolith can be made out in
 each    coccosphere ; sometimes, however, one mature coccolith and one
 in a very early stage are found.           In the coccosphere (fig. 16), which
 contained the central trilobed body alluded to above, so far as          I could
 ascertain a ring-shaped coccolith was in contact with each lobe. But
 this observation is open to doubt, as the coccosphere was mounted in
 water, so that the internal coceoliths were only indistinctly seen, and
 unfortunately the solution         of both internal and external coceoliths
 took place while they were not under observation.
      In the case of internal coceoliths which have almost reached maturity,
  it is generally possible to perceive that they are somewhat larger than
 any of the coceoliths already in position on the sphere.               It would
  appear from this that the coceoliths formed by a coccosphere in its
 earlier stages are smaller than those developed later in its life history.
  Indeed, measurements of coceoliths and coccospheres almost necessitate
 this conclusion.       Thus coceoliths are often found with their longer
 diameter equal to 0*018 mm., while the internal measurements of some
 of the smaller coccospheres could not accommodate a coccolith of these
  dimensions.      Again, it is found that the coceoliths with a simple slit
  like perforation in their central body are, as a rule, smaller than those
  with D-shaped perforations ; so that we may with some probability
  assume that the single perforation is the more primitive condition,
  and that coceoliths with it only are formed in the coccosphere during
  its earlier stages.      The history of the development of the coccolith
   also points  in this direction.
      It  appears that the extrusion       of a coccolith  to the surface must

   314               Dr. H. H. Dixon.        On the Structure   of
   lead to a readjustment of the coccoliths already in position.          In order
   to effect this, they must slide past each other, and take up such rela
   tive positions with one another and the new coccolith as will change
   the curvature of the surface and increase the size of the sphere. The
   dished shape      of the coccoliths and their oval outline are apparently
   adaptations to accommodate this peculiar method of growth.                   The
   oval form and the method of intercalating new plates in the skeleton,
   necessitates the overlap; but this expenditure of material is com
   pensated by the great rigidity so obtained, and the complete protection
   of the organism.
      It is evident that       these observations on the internal origin and
   development      of  coccoliths  dispose of those theories which regard the
   coccospheres either as reproductive bodies of the coccoliths or as inde
   pendent organisms which aggregate coccoliths on their surface, as some
  Rhizopoda gather diatom skeletons.            The observations also render im
  probable the view that the coccoliths are formed as precipitates in
  dead organic slimes, as has been suggested. The history of the develop
  ment shows that the coccosphere is the organism which secretes the
  coccoliths as its skeleton, and it is probable that these latter oiily occur
  free in the water after the death and disintegration of the parent
  coccosphere.
                                        Summary.
      The following conclusions may be drawn from the foregoing obser
  vations : —
      1 . The body of the coccolith extends for a short distance inside the
  internal valve.
      2. The   coccolith    is composed of calcium carbonate and a trace of
 some substance        soluble  in 1 per cent, of sodium carbonate.
      3. Coccospheres are covered over with an extremely delicate pel
 licle, which     is less  readily soluble in dilute acids than the coccoliths
 within it.
      4. The coccoliths on     a coccosphere are   partially embedded in   a slimy
 proteid material.
      5. Within the slimy layer there is a somewhat stratified internal
 spherical membrane.
      6. The specimens of coccospheres examined contained no chromato-
 phore.
      7.  In many instances the presence of          a minute internal body, pre
 sumably a nucleus, was demonstrated.
     8. Coccoliths      are secreted internally in close       proximity to the
 nucleus    ; the  collar  uniting  the  valves is first formed, then the valves
.are developed, and finally the central body of the coccolith is secreted.
      9. The coccolith, when complete, is probably extruded to the sur
 face, and takes up its position among its predecessors.               Its valves

become interlocked             with those of its neighbours.                By this intercala
tion    an increase of the volume of the sphere is provided                      for.
     10.   The oval and dished form of the coccoliths are adaptations                            to
allow of the rearrangement of the older coccoliths on the extrusion of
a new one, and of suitable interlocking on the spherical surface.

  The answer I suggested was twofold —       homogamy, which   (i) can                         I
demonstrate to actually exist in the case of man, and (ii)    possible                     a
dependence of fertility on homogamy, which would render the cross
unions relatively sterile. Either  or (ii) would be effective, but (ii)

                                                        I                                           in
mind (a) that reproductive selection, while quite capable of producing
         :

   (d) The coefficient of assortative mating p12 for parents weighted
with their fertility differs sensibly from that of unweighted parents 7Y>.
Generally the effect of a relation between homogamy and fertility is to
increase the apparent coefficient of assortative mating.
   (e) The coefficients of parental heredity are also modified when we
take all and not a single representative of the offspring.
     5. Special Conclusions.           — These depend          on   how we define homogamy.
When would the male and female be                         " alike "  ? Mr. Francis Galton, in
the case of stature in man, reduces the female to the male equivalent
by altering her stature in the ratio of mean male to mean female
stature.    In my paper on the Law of Ancestral Heredity* I give
reasons  for using as a factor of reduction the ratio of the male standard
deviation to the female standard deviation.      Mr. Galton's method and
mine agree fairly closely in the case of man, for the coefficients of varia-
tiont of man and woman (i.e., lOOo-i/wii and 100o-2/m-> in our present
notation) are nearly equal for a considerable variety of organs. In either
case we should understand by a homogamous union one in which the
female organ reduced to the male equivalent was exactly equal to the
male organ. Accordingly the ratio of j>\ to p2 would be that of mi to
mi, or of a-o to o-j according to the hypothesis adopted. In the case of
man, if either hypothesis be used, the other would be nearly satisfied.
Hence, with a reasonable hypothesis as to what we mean by homogamy,
it   follows that —
   (a) No progressive change in the mean would arise in a species owing
to  a relation between homogamy and fertility (ha — 0, since either
      =
P1/P2    nh/mi or o-a/o-j).
     (b)    With equipotency of hereditary
                                        influence in the parents, the
race would not on my hypothesis alter its variability, and on Mr.
Galton's hypothesis only by an extremely small quantity of the fourth
order       (if         = r23, then by               2s   differs from           by       term of the

      (it)   The parental coefficient of heredity will generally                  be increased
 by taking all instead of a single one of the offspring.
      For example, putting tu = 0, pi<ri/s = p*r>/s = t as before, we find
 for equipotency —
              Pli  -  T2/(l +T*),             pn =     P32

 Thus                                    psi =    rn  n/1 +P12,
 showing how the spurious coefficient of assortative                         mating     modifies
 the coefficient of inheritance.
     6.    Thus    I think it will be clear that Reproductive Divergence has not
 an effectivo existence. More generally Reproductive Selection, unless we
 suppose ab initio a fertility distribution with two modes (which is not
 given by homogamy, and wants, in any case, a special explanation),
 will not produce differentiation.                    It can produce, as I have often
 stated, progressive change.                So far as I can yet see, differentiation
 must involve natural selection, and one can only appeal to reproductive
selection as a means, but I think an effective means, of maintaining a
differentiation        already brought          about by Darwin's fundamental factor
in evolution.
     Mr. Vernon,          in    his first paper, states that given a relationship
between homogamy and fertility, then reproductive divergence "is
capable of mathematical demonstration.                         This we will now proceed to
            "
afford         (p. 182).
     In his      second     paper, he gives what he terms " the mathematical
                                            "
basis of the theory more fully                 (p. 404).       I venture to think that the
whole of his treatment is fallacious.                    In the first paper he neglects the
Law of Regression, and he thinks this justifiable, but it is not so. In
    • ' Boy. Soc. Proc.,' vol. 66, p. 30.
    t Assuming equipotent hereditary influence of father and mother for stature,              we
have from the above paper —
                           p   - 0 1783,               r„  = 0 0931,    and

Hence p^Oij' =        ^;<T;/-« ¦  * = 3-4587.      Thus from the equation for y we find

 the   second   paper he takes an arithmetical example based on 205
families.     His results, if correct, would only show a flattening of the
frequency-curve,       an increased variability, and not a divergence or
differentiation.      But I have shown that the tendency is really to a
decreased variability, and on examination it will be found that the
differences on which Mr. Vernon bases his conclusions are all of the
order of the probable errors of his results ! Apart from this, however,
the whole of his argument on pp. 405-6 seems to me invalid; we
cannot proceed by a vague threefold classification such as he adopts ;
and he nowhere introduces, so far as I can see, the difference in height
of the parents which must be the essential feature of the whole
argument.
    That Mr. Vernon has shown a relationship between homogamy and
fertility in his    '
                      Phil. Trans.' memoir is of high value, but I hold that
such cannot help us in the slightest degree to dispense with the funda
mental factor of Darwinian evolution, namely, natural selection.*
   *  Since the above paper was sent to the Royal Society —
   (a) The relationship of eye-colour to fertility in both man and woman has been
investigated for several thousand cases; while there appears to be some correlation
between eye-colour and fertility, homogamous unions do not appear to be the more
fertile. The numbers will be eventually published ;
    (4) Mr. Vernon has sent me a letter stating that, on further investigation, he
has modified his views on Reproductive Divergence.

the second paper he takes an arithmetical example based on 205
families. His results, if correct, would only show a flattening of the
frequency-curve,        an increased variability, and not a divergence or
differentiation.       But I have shown that the tendency is really to a
decreased variability, and on examination it will be found that the
differences on which Mr. Vernon bases his conclusions are all of the
order of the probable errors of his results ! Apart from this, however,
the whole of his argument on pp. 405-6 seems to me invalid; we
cannot proceed by a vague threefold classification such as he adopts ;
and he nowhere introduces, so far as I can see, the difference in height
of the parents which must be the essential feature of the whole
argument.
    That Mr. Vernon has shown a relationship between homogamy and
fertility in his ' Phil. Trans.' memoir is of high value, but I hold that
such cannot help us in the slightest degree to dispense with the funda
mental factor of Darwinian evolution, namely, natural selection.*

                                     (Abstract.)
    (1) Many    characters are such that    it is very difficult if not impossible to
form either a discrete or a continuous numerical scale of their intensity.
Such, for example, are skin, coat, or eye-colour in animals, or colour in
flowers. In other cases as in the amount of shading, degree of hairiness,
&c, it might       l>e  possible by counting scales or hairs to obtain a
numerical estimate of the character, but the labour in the case of several
hundreds or a thousand individuals becomes appalling.                 Now these cha
racters are some of those which are commonest, and of which it is generally
possible for the eye at once to form an appreciation.                A horse-breeder
will classify a horse as brown, bay, or chestnut ; a mother classify her
child's eyes as blue, grey, or brown without hesitation and within cer
tain broad limits correctly.       It is clear that if the theory of correlation

           Mathematical Contributions        to the Theory of Evolution.      325
can be extended so as to readily apply to such cases, we shall have
 much widened the field within which we can make numerical investiga
 tions into the intensity of heredity, as well as much lessened the labour
 of collecting data and forming records.
     The extension of theory required for such investigations is provided
 in   a separate memoir.      It is found that the sole conditions for applying
this theory are : (1) that      an order of intensity    must exist even if there
 be no quantitative scale       ;  (2) that the correlation must be supposed
 normal.     If these assumptions are made, individuals may even be classi
fied into only two groups of less and greater intensity, and the corre
lation still found.       For example, the correlation between stature and
hair-colour could be found by classifying all individuals simply into
short and tall, light and dark haired, although for convenience of
judgment a medium class in each case might be introduced. For the pur
pose of ascertaining the relative variability of the characters involved,
this third or medium class at least must be introduced and a ninefold
division made of the correlation table.              In the introduction to the
present     memoir    the   probable   errors   of  all the quantities involved
are considered, and illustrations given of their values for selected
 cases.
     (2) The bulk of the memoir, however, is concerned with the appli
cation of this theory to two special cases, those of inheritance of the
coat-colour of horses* and of the eye-colour of men.
     There are three recognised chief types of inheritance : the blended
 heritage, the exclusive heritage, and the particulate heritage, to which
 latter two may possibly be added the reversionary heritage as a modify
 ing factor.
     In the blended heritage the character of the parents and the ancestry
 in the direct line are in the average offspring mingled in certain pro
 portions. This heritage seems in broad lines to be described by the law
 of ancestral heredity.
     In exclusive heritage the offspring takes the character of one parent
 to the exclusion of that of the other. While in blended heritage, rever
 sion becomes very difficult, if not impossible, to distinguish from excep
 tional variation,     here  reversion    becomes   an easily detected feature    ;
 and studies on reversion ought         if possible to deal with exclusive heri
 tage.     Lastly, in particulate heritage, we have       a mixture, not a blend,
    * The twelve tables of coat-colour inheritance have been extracted for me by
 Mr. Leslie Bramley-Moore     out of Weatherby's Studbooks. He first pointed out
to me the difficulties attending my method of proportioning, which led to my
withdrawing and rewriting this paper.        The twenty-four tables of eye-colour
inheritance   I hare extracted from eye-colour data most generously placed at my
disposal by Mr. Francis Galton. The arithmetic on these tables is chiefly due to
Miss Alice Lee, D.8c, but Mr. L. N. G. Filon, M.A., Mr. Bramley-Moore and Miss
C. D. Fawcett, B.Sc., have given us friendly aid.
                                                                    2 C  2

of the parental characters as in the case of a blue eye streaked with
brown, eyes of two different colours, a piebald horse, &c. The occa
sional appearance of particulate, where we are accustomed to blended
heritage, appears to be sometimes attributed to reversion.
  Neither coat-colour in the horse nor eye-colour in man appear to
obey the law of ancestral heredity.
  (3) In coat-colour we find the horses lighter than the mares, but a
secular change appears to be going on, and thoroughbred colts and fillies
of to-day are more alike in colour than those of two generations back.
The horse is somewhat more variable than the mare.       The laws of
inheritance are in excellent accord with what we should expect from
the theory of exclusive inheritance without reversion ; they are incom
patible with the law of ancestral heredity.       The only important
divergence occurs in grandparental correlation.
  (4)    In eye-colour    we    find man lighter than woman, but a secular
change    is going on, and men and women to-day are more alike  in eye-
colour than they were two generations back. This change in eye-
colour is possibly due to a correlation between eye-colour and fertility
in woman. Man is somewhat more variable than woman. The laws of
inheritance are not in accord with what we might expect from the law
of ancestral heredity.  They are definitely divergent from    but agree it,
well with exclusive heritage without reversion to ancestral types.
Here again the grandparental correlation appears to be anomalously
large.   Great diversity exists, however, between the intensity of in
heritance as exhibited by different lines of descent.    For the first time
in this memoir, believe, the strength of heredity for the eight grand-
                 I
parental and the eight avuncular relationships          investigated.

women while less variable than men, come of more variable stock.

light, and to stimulation by tetanising currents.
     16. The positive response to light (2), the positive effect of tetanisa
 tion (10), and the positive after-effect of condenser discharges (13) are
 suppressed by anaesthetics         (ether and chloroform) and by rise of
 temperature       (to 40 — 45°).    The suppression may be permanent or
 temporary.        An anaesthetised like a dead eyeball tested by currents,
 as   in   11   and 12, manifests only polarisation currents negative in
 direction to the exciting currents.         Tetanisation, as in 10, gives only
 polarisation effect in the direction of the break shocks negative to the
 direction of the make shocks.

 "
    Observations on the Effect of Desiccation of Albumin upon its
         Coagulability." By J. Bretland Farmer, M.A., Royal College
         of Science, London.         Communicated by Dr. H. T. Brown,
         F.R.S.     Received March 21,— Read April 5, 1900.
    It has been known for some time that it is possible, under certain
 circumstances, to expose seeds to the influence of high temperatures
 without thereby necessarily destroying their power to germinate.
 Some experiments in this direction were conducted at the Royal
 Gardens, Kew, some years ago by Dr. Morris, but the results, although
 of much interest, do not appear to have been published.               However,
 the seeds were exposed to the action of boiling water, and even to a
  higher temperature in an oven, without losing their ability to germinate
  when the ordeal was over.
     It  has been noticed,   in heating    seeds in water, that if the  seed-coat

330            Mr.  J.  Bretland Farmer.       On the Effect of
through any cause becomes ruptured, or if it softens and swells, the
seeds which are thus affected are incapable of manifesting any further
evidence of vitality.      It appears to me that a fair inference to be
drawn from these facts is that the admission of water to the living
cells is a potent factor in bringing about their death.
   Jodin* has recently communicated some facts which point to the
same conclusion.     He exposed seeds of pea and cress to a temperature
of 98° C, and found that unless great care had been previously exer
cised to ensure the dryness of the seeds, they were all killed.        When
they had been previously dried he succeeded in subsequently germi
nating 30 per cent, of the peas and 60 per cent, of the cress seeds.
Perhaps the disproportion in favour of the latter may. at least in part,
be ascribed to their small size, and consequently to the less difficulty
in sufficiently drying the seeds.
   It would seem to follow from what has been said that the instability
of the complex molecular structure of which living organisms are made
up, may be lessened by appropriate desiccation, but the substances
concerned are too complex to render themselves readily accessible to
inquiry. It appeared, however, that it might be worth while to study
the effects of desiccation on albumin from this point of view. Albumin
is not only a highly complex proteid, and perhaps in some respects
akin to protoplasm itself, but it is one which gives tolerably definite
heat reactions.    It is in connection with the last-mentioned point that
the new facts in this paper are specially concerned.
   It is of course known that albumin in a watery solution is readily
coagulated on heating to a certain temperature.           This temperature,
however, is not necessarily constant for even one type of albumin,
doubtless owing to the readiness with which it undergoes change.
Thus albumin obtained from different hens' eggs will often be found to
coagulate at different temperatures, and the differences appear, in part
at any rate, to be connected with the age of the egg.        I have found in
the case of freshly-laid eggs, that the characteristic opalescence which
marks the early stages of coagulation may set in as low as 60° C, the
clotted coagulum being fully formed at 64° C. The heat was applied
by means of a large water-bath, so as to ensure its being as uniform as
possible.    Another sample of albumin from a different egg tried simul
taneously   and  under the same conditions, only exhibited opalescence at
65-6° C, and coagulated completely at 68° C.
   The albumin on which most of my experiments were made, was ob
tained from Merck, of Darmstadt, and was sent as dried egg-albumin.
It readily dissolved in water, with the exception of a little flaky in
soluble portion, which was filtered off.     The solution had a low coagu
lation-point,  the opalescence   appearing at 60°  C, and the clot at 62° C.

                 Desiccation     of Albumin upon its Coagulability.                 331
to     63°  C*     Filtering off the clot and testing the nitrate at higher
temperatures yielded no further coagulation.
     If a sample of this (dry) albumin be placed in a flask, the mouth of
which is furnished with a cork and attached to a set of drying tubes,
and the temperature of the flask raised to 80°               C,    a short exposure, of
at any rate two to three hours, is enough to completely alter the
albumin.         The object of the drying tubes is to prevent any more
 moisture than is already present in its substance reaching the albumin
from the steam or from any other source.                   Thus heated, the albumin
is found to have become insoluble in water, and in fact to have under
gone a change corresponding to coagulation.
    If, however, the albumin be carefully dried before being subjected to
these conditions, the results are quite different.               For the present pur
pose it was found to be sufficient to expose a thin layer of albumin in
a glass dish to a temperature of 52 — 55° C. in an incubator. ¦ This
ensures a very thorough desiccation.                 The process may be hastened
by introducing a vessel of sulphuric acid, though this precaution was
not found to be necessary.             Thus dried, the albumin loses its shellac
 or glue-like appearance, and easily crumbles to very small particles.
     On comparing the solubility and coagulability of this specially dried
material with the ordinary sample, no difference could be detected in
any respect.
    Numerous experiments were made with this dried material, of which
 the following may be taken as typical.                   It may be added that the
results throughout were almost surprisingly uniform in the different
 experiments made.
    A sample of the specially dried albumin was introduced in a flask so
 as to form a thin layer over the bottom.                    The flask was connected
 with drying tubes filled with calcium chloride, and with phosphorus
pentoxide.         The flask was warmed and cooled rapidly several times,
in order to cause the contained air to circulate through the drying
tubes.
    The temperature of the flask was then raised in a brine bath to
 102°   C, and kept at this temperature during the whole of one day
(six hours).        Next day, and without opening or disturbing the appa
 ratus, the temperature was again raised to 107° C, and finally to
 110° C.      It  was maintained between these limits for seven hours;             thus
the contents of the flask had been for thirteen hours exposed to a tem
perature of considerably over 100° C.
    On testing the albumin it was found to be soluble in water, and in
no way, as far as could be observed, did it differ from the unheated
material.        On gradually       warming     the solution      side by side with a
   *  It is of course known that several     factors affect the coagulation point. The
figures given represent those obtained in my experiments, which were         all kept as
uniform as possible     so as to eliminate the factor of variability.

332          Mr.   J.   Bretland Farmer.   On tlie Effect   of
similar solution of the unheated albumin, both became opalescent at a
temperature of 60° C, and both were completely coagulated at 62° C.
   It thus appears that, if precautions are taken to ensure appropriate
desiccation, it is possible to heat albumin for, at any rate, thirteen
hours to a temperature varying between 102 — 1 10° C. without producing
any obvious change in its ultimate molecular (or micellar X) structure.
It made no difference to the result whether the heat was gradually or
rapidly applied. Thus, in one experiment, the temperature was raised
from 50° C. to 103° C. in fifteen minutes, and in other examples the
flask   was withdrawn from  the hot bath, cooled, and suddenly re-
immersed. How much higher the temperature could be raised without
producing an obvious effect, I am not prepared to say ; nor did I
investigate the action   any) which might possibly be produced by a
                             (if
much longer exposure to heat within the limits already mentioned.
This, formed no part of my object, which was primarily to try to get a
point of comparison between the complex seed and the simpler but
still very complex proteid.
   Other experiments were made in order to test the sensitiveness of
the albumin to small quantities of moisture.
   For this purpose, two flasks attached to drying tubes were used, one
of them serving as      control experiment, and remaining unopened
                         a
until theend.  The other was opened three times, and small sample
                                                            a
taken out each time.    By this means the ordinary air of the room
obtained complete access to the albumin. The duration of the experi
ment was ten hours. The first sample was withdrawn after the flasks
had been heated to 102° C. for three hours;     dissolved and coagu
                                                 it
lated normally.     Asecond sample was withdrawn after three hours
more, and    was found that whilst
            it                       dissolved and became opalescent
                                     it
on heating to 60°       C,
                      the coagulation change did not at once set in,
but the opalescent solution became more milky and of a deeper fog-
yellow by transmitted light, finally coagulating at about 68° C. A
third sample taken out at the close of the experiment (i.e., four hours
after the last opening of the flask) also dissolved, became slightly
opalescent at about 64° C, but did not coagulate even at 90° C,
although the opalescent milkiness became very pronounced.      Viewed
by transmitted light, the solution was translucently yellow.     Even
boiling failed to produce anything which could be fairly termed       a
coagulum.    It appeared probable that the admission of watery vapour
had permitted   the inception of the changes which normally, at high
temperatures, result in coagulation    ; but in this case they were
arrested, some precursor of alkali-albumin being probably produced, as
is often the case on slowly coagulating albumin solutions.      Under
these circumstances, however, the entire mass of the albumin had
undergone this change.   This supposition turned out to be correct, for
the addition of   trace of acetic acid at once caused the solution to

                         to coagulation
to infer that although the slight amount of moisture introduced during
the opening of the tube did not suffice to enable complete coagulation
to occur, it did permit the early changes to begin, and to slowly, and
in a modified way, to affect the entire mass.     This experiment was
repeated several times, and always with the same result.
   It seems difficult, in the light of the foregoing observations, to resist
the inference that in the complete absence of moisture albumin may be
reduced to a state of relative molecular (or micellar) immobility ; the
rearrangements which, in the presence of water and at a sufficiently
high temperature, normally take place in its ultimate structure being
held in abeyance during the suspension of the essential condition of
the presence of sufficient moisure. The substance is brought, so to
speak, into a static condition ; chemical or physico-chemical change is
inhibited, just as is an interaction between phosphorus and oxygen
when conditions of complete dryness obtain.          It is tempting to
extend these considerations to the case of seeds and spores, e.g., of
certain bacteria, and to ask whether similar conclusions may not be
fairly assumed to obtain there, for it may well be a fact that the
protoplasm, like the albumin, which is at any rate akin to      when          it,
sufficiently desiccated withstands conditions which otherwise would
certainly promote chemical disintegration.    They, too, appear to be
reduced to      "static" condition by drying, and the researches of

to the continuous progress of those reactions which are associated with,
vitality are restored, the organism proceeds to work in the nornml

    In recent experiments by myself and by others upon the density of
hydrogen, the g<as has always been dried by means of phosphoric
iinhydride ; and a doubt may remain whether on the one hand the
removal of aqueous vapour is sufficiently complete, and on the other
whether some new impurity may not be introduced.             I thought that it
would be interesting to weigh hydrogen          dried  in an entirely different
manner, and this I have recently been able to effect with the aid of
liquid air, acting as a cooling agent, supplied by the kindness of
Professor Dewar from the Royal Institution. The operations of filling
and weighing were carried out in the country as hitherto.               I ought,
perhaps, to explain that the object was not so much to make a new
determination of the highest possible accuracy, as to test whether any
serious error could be involved in the use of phosphoric anhydride,
such as might explain the departure of the ratio of densities of oxygen
and hydrogen from that of 16       : 1.    I may say at once that the result
 was negative.
    Each supply consisted of about 6 litres of the liquid, contained in
two large vacuum-jacketed vessels of Professor Dewar's design, and it
 sufficed for two fillings with hydrogen at an interval of two days.
 The intermediate     day was devoted to a weighing of the globe empty.
 There were four fillings in all, but one proved to be abortive owing to
 a discrepancy in the weights when the globe was empty, before and
 after the filling.   The gas was exposed to the action of the liquid air
 during its passage in     a slow stream of      about half a litre per hour
 through a tube of thin   glass.
     I have said that the result was negative.      In point of fact the actual
 weights   found    were ^  to      milligrams    heavier than in the case of
 hydrogen dried by phosphoric anhydride.             But I doubt whether the
 small excess is of any significance.      It seems improbable that it coidd
 have been due to residual vapour, and it is perhaps not outside the
 error of experiment, considering that the apparatus was not in the         best
 condition.

               The  Kinetic Theory of Planetary Atmospheres.                335-
"The Kinetic Theoiy of Planetary Atmospheres." By G. H.

        1900.
                                     (Abstract.)
    The application of the kinetic theory to the atmospheres of planets
dates from the paper of Waterston, who gave an investigation based
on the then only possible assumption of equal velocities for all
molecules, an assumption since known as Clausius' law.                  Of later
papers reference is due in especial to Dr. Johnstone Stoney's memoir
" Of Atmospheres        on Planets and Satellites,"*     in which the test of
permanence of a gas in the atmosphere of a planet is made to depend
on the ratio of its velocity of mean square to that relative velocity
which would enable a suitably projected body to escape from the
planet's attraction.      If it be admitted, as Dr. Stoney assumes, that
helium cannot exist in our atmosphere, it follows that vapour of water
cannot exist on Mars.
    The author's object has been to investigate the logical conclusions
obtained by applying the Boltzmann-Maxwell distribution to the
atmospheres of planets.           In 1893 calculations were made, having
special reference to the absence of atmosphere from the Moon, but
these took no account of axial rotation.             When this cause is taken
into account, the distribution of co-ordinates and relative velocities of
the molecules is found to be the same as if the planet were at rest,
and " centrifugal force applied to the system. The surfaces of equal
                            "
 density are of the forms originally investigated by Edward Roche, of
 Montpellier, and they cease to be closed surfaces when passing to the
 outside of the point on the equatorial plane where centrifugal force
just balances the planet's attraction.         Calling the surface through this
              "
 point the critical surface," the density of molecular distribution over
 this surface must be very small to ensure permanence. The ratio of
 the density at the planet's surface to the density at the critical surface
 has been called the " critical density ratio," and the author calculates
 its logarithm for particular gases at different temperatures on the
 various planets.      The use of this logarithm has the advantage that the
 calculation can at once be extended to any gas at any temperature.
     The high value obtained in the case of helium considered in reference
 to the earth, appears to afford abundant proof that if helium existed
 in our atmosphere it would possess a very high degree of permanence
 at ordinary temperatures.         To test this point further, a calculation is
 made      of the total rate at which molecules would flow across the
  critical   surface, this rate being regarded as a superior limit to the
                              * '

  rate at which the planet would lose its atmosphere, since it takes
  no account of molecules which describe free paths beyond the limit
  and fall back again.        To further exhibit the results in a tangible form,
  the rate of flow is estimated by the number of years in which the
  total amount of gas escaping across the critical surface woidd be
  equal to the amount of the gas in a layer covering the surface of the
  planet to the depth of 1 cm.            This measure is independent of the
Actual      quantity of the     gas under   consideration existing in the atmo
 sphere, since, if this quantity be increased, the rate of flow across the
¦critical surface and the amount of gas present in the surface layer
  1 cm. thick will be increased in the same proportion.
     If   a gas of molecular weight 2, such as helium, be supposed to       exist
 in the earth's atmosphere, the loss in question would occupy          3-5 x 1036
 years at      -  73°   C, 3 x   1019 years at 27°, 8-4 x 1010 years at 127° C,
¦6   x 105 years at 227°      C,   and 222 years at 327° C.
     If we halve the absolute temperatures we have the conditions
 applicable to hydrogen, the losses in question therefore taking place
 in 8-4 x 1010 years at -73° C, 6 x 105 years at              -  23° C, and 222
 years at 27° C.
     For water vapour on Mars, the corresponding results are 1*2 x 1033
 years at       -  73°, 1-9 x 1018 years at 27°, 2-4 x 10" years at 127°,
 4-3    x  105  years at 227° and 106 years at 327°.
     These figures indicate that helium cannot practically escape from
•our atmosphere          at existing temperatures, nor can vapour of water
 escape from the atmosphere of Mars.            A leakage may and undoubtedly
 does take place which may appear considerable           when estimated by the
 number of actual molecules escaping, but it is wholly inappreciable
relative to the mass of gas left behind.
    At    a future    time  I  propose to examine the corresponding results,
 based on the hypothesis that the atmosphere of a planet is distributed
 according to the adiabatic instead of the isothermal law.

    The object of the paper is to exhibit the processes of the infinitesimal
calculus and of the calculus of finite differences as combinatorial
processes.       A large class of problems can be dealt with by designing
 on the one hand a function, and on the other hand an operation, in
 such wise that when the operation is performed upon the function a

number results which enumerates the combinations with which the
problem is concerned. The problems to which the method is applicable
are those which are, directly or indirectly, associated with lattices, and
it is remarkable that, for the most part, they are such as have been
hitherto    regarded        as    unassailable      by the processes              of pure mathe
matics.
  If    a problem be presented             for solution, it may         be a difficult            matter
to design the function and the operation, the combination of which
furnishes the solution.   The plan here adopted is to consider certain
functions and  operations, and then to inquire into the nature of the
associated problems.   The author has attempted to place the method
on  a   sure foundation,  to give illustrative examples of gradually
increasing complexity,             and to indicate some promising lines of future
investigation.  The only published work connected with the subject
is the author's paper, entitled

   The essay is divided into three chapters.
   A limit operation of any kind, for instance, simple or multiple
integration ; the formation of infinite sums or products ; or any com

leads to consequences in regard to the integrals of linear differential

                                    of a function F(z) and consists of

 - 192° C).     Further experiments have since been made in which the
organisms were again exposed to the temperature of liquid air for a
much longer period, viz., seven days.
    The organisms employed were B. typlwsus, B. coli communis, B. diph
theria, B. proteus vulgaris, B. acitli laciici, B. anthracis (sporing culture),
Spirillum cM-era      asiatwxe,  Staphylococcus   pyogenes  aureus, B.  plwspho-
rescens,  a Sarcina, a Saccharomyces, and unsterilised       milk.
    Instead of being exposed as formerly on the actual media in which
they were growing, the organisms were submitted to the cooling pro
cess in the form of a broth emulsion in hermetically sealed fine quill
tubing.     This allows of complete immersion, and effects a considerable
economy in the amount of liquid air used, besides greatly facilitating
manipulation.       The liquid air was kindly furnished by Professor
Dewar, and the experiment was conducted in his laboratory.
    In the course of the experiment, the loss by evaporation of the
liquid air was made up by adding fresh portions from time to time.
In this way the temperature of about          - 190°C.   was maintained unin
terruptedly through      the whole   period of  the  experiment.    At the same
time considerable care had to be taken in conducting the first cooling,
in order to avoid fracture of the quill tubes.          A preliminary cooling
was therefore effected by means of solid CO^.           After the expiration of
a week, the tubes were removed         with cork-tipped forceps, and placed
in   a strong   glass vessel till thawing was complete.         The tubes were
then opened, and the contents transferred to suitable culture media.
In each case, a direct microscopical examination was made to detect
any possible structural changes.
    It is a remarkable fact that, notwithstanding the enormous mechani
cal strain to which the organisms must have been exposed, a strain far
exceeding in amount any capable of being produced hitherto by direct
mechanical means, not the slightest structural alteration could be
detected.
    The sub-cultures made at the conclusion of the experiment grew
 well, and in no instance could any impairment in the vitality of the
 organisms be detected. In one or two instances only, growth was
 slightly delayed, an effect which might have been due to other causes.
 The photogenic bacteria grew and emitted light, and the samples of
 milk became curdled.
    The above experiments show that bacteria can be cooled down to
  -  190° C. for a period of seven days without any appreciable impair
 ment of their vitality.
    It has not yet been possible to undertake the experiments with
 liquid hydrogen.

 Report of the Kew Observatory Committee for the Year
                      ending December 31, 1899.
   The operations of the Kew Observatory, in the Old Deer Park,
Richmond, Surrey, are controlled by the Kew Observatory Committee,
which is constituted as follows : —
                            Mr. F. Galton, Chairman.
   Captain    Sir W. de W. Abney,           Prof. A. W. Riicker.
      K.C.B., R.E.                          Dr. R. H. Scott.
   Prof. W. G. Adams.                       Mr. W. N. Shaw.
   Captain E. W. Creak, R.N.                Lieut.-General    Sir R. Strachey,
   Prof. G. C. Poster.                         G.C.S.I.
   Prof. J. Perry.                          Rear Admiral Sir W. J. L. Whar
   The Earl of Rosse, K.P.                     ton, K.C.B.
   The work at    the Observatory      may be considered under the follow
ing heads   : —
    I. Magnetic observations.
  II.  Meteorological   observations.        >
 III.  Seismological observations.
 IV.   Experiments     and Researches       in   connexion    with any of   the
          departments.
   V. Verification of instruments.
 VI. Rating of Watches and Marine Chronometers.
VII.   Miscellaneous.
                        I. Magnetic Observations.
   The   Magnetographs      have been      in constant    operation throughout
the year, and the usual determinations         of the Scale Values were made
in January.
   The   ordinates    of the   various    photographic     curves representing
Declination,    Horizontal Force,      and Vertical Force were then found
to be as follows   : —
                       Declinometer     : 1 cm.   = 0° 8,-7.
   Bifilar, January,   1899,  for 1   cm. SH = 0-00051      C.G.S. unit.
   Balance, January, 1899, for      1 cm. SV = 0 00052     C.G.S. unit.
                                                                   2 D 2

o42             llrport of   the Kew Observatory Committee.
   In the case of the Vertical Force instrument it was found necessary
to re-adjust the magnet, and at the same time its sensibility was
slightly altered, after which the scale value was again determined
with the following result : —
          Balance, January 26th, 1899, for        1 cm. 8V = 0-00049.
   With regard to magnetic disturbances,             no very large movements
have been registered during the year.         Some of the principal oscilla
tions recorded took place on the following dates :— ¦
   January 28—29; February 12; March 10,               22, and  23;
   April 18—19; May 3—5; June 27—29;
   September 26—27       ; and October 23.
   The hourly means and diurnal inequalities of the magnetic elements
for  1899, for the quiet days selected by the Astronomer Royal, will be
found in Appendix I. A correction has been applied for the diurnal
variation of temperature, use being made of the records from a Richard
thermograph as well as of the eye observations of a thermometer-
placed under the Vertical Force shade.
   The mean values at the noons preceding and succeeding the selected
quiet days are also given, but these of course are not employed in
calculating the daily means or inequalities.
   The following are the mean results for the entire year : —
      Mean Westerly Declination                      16° 57'-l.
      Mean Horizontal Force                   ...    0-18393 C.G.S. unit.
      Mean Inclination                               67° 14'-7.
                                      *
      Mean Vertical Force                            0-43852   C.G S. unit.
   In September, in      consequence    of an accident, the two dip needles
long in use had to be replaced by two others obtained from Mr. A. W.
Dover in 1897.      As a careful comparison of the data obtained before
and after the accident showed that the difference of the inclinations
given by the new and old needles if existent was less than the pro
bable error of observation, no correction has been applied.
    Observations of Absolute Declination,           Horizontal Intensity, and
 Inclination have been made weekly, as a rule.
    A table of recent values of the magnetic elements at the Observa
tories   whoso publications      are received      at Kew     will  be  found in
 Appendix Ia.
    A  course  of practical instruction in the taking of magnetic obser
vations    has been   given to Mr. Henkel, of Markrec Observatory, and
to Lieutenants Nares and Waugh, of the Royal Navy.                 The method of
reducing    the vertical   force  curves  has  been     explained to Mr. Kitto,
Superintendent of Falmouth Observatory.
    Captain Creak, R.N., made some preliminary experiments with a
modified form of Fox Circle, and Captain Denholm Fraser, R.E.,

                Report   of the Kew    Observatoi-y  Committee.           343
experimented on the relative        merits of silk and phosphor bronze as
the suspension for magnets.
    Open scale magnetographs, devised by Mr. W. Watson for the pur
pose of testing the disturbing action of electric railways, were in
operation for a few days in December under Mr. Watson's supervision.
    Dr. van Rijckevorsel visited the Observatory in June and September,
and observed with his magnetic instruments, in pursuance of his scheme
for the intercomparison of standard instruments at various Observa
tories.
    Dr. L. A. Bauer also took magnetic observations in September and
 November with instruments belonging to the U.S. Coast and Geodetic
Survey.
    Advice  has been given to Captain Fraser,       R.E., with respect to the
 equipment    for  a   magnetic survey     of  India,  and to the Surveyor
 General, Wellington, New Zealand, in relation to the erection of a
 magnetic observatory in New Zealand, and the carrying out of a
 magnetic survey there.         At the request of the Agent General, a
 complete set of magnetographs has been ordered from Mr. P. Adie for
 New Zealand, and the unifilar magnetometer and dip circle, previously
 lent to Melbourne Observatory, have been lent for two years to the
 New Zealand Government.
    During the absence of Mr. T. W. Baker on inspection work during
 part of September and October, the magnetic work was intrusted to
 Mr. R. Forsyth, Royal College of Science, who was temporarily en
 gaged for the purpose.
    The magnetic work as a whole has been unusually onerous through
 out the year, and it seems likely to continue heavy for some time, as
 an exceptionally large number of magnetic instruments               have been
 ordered by foreign and colonial institutions with the expressed inten
 tion of having them verified at the Observatory.
    Opportunities present themselves from time            to time of getting
 valuable observations made by travellers and others if they are supplied
 with the necessary instruments. In order to be able to take advantage
 of such opportunities,    by lending instruments to competent observers,
 when it may seem desirable to do so, the Committee have obtained a
 unifilar magnetometer and a dip circle from Mr. A. W. Dover.              The
 expense was defrayed      by a special grant, amounting to £86 5s., from
 the Government      Grant Committee.                                         •
                    II. Meteorological        Observations.
    The several self-recording instruments for the continuous registra
 tion of Atmospheric         Pressure, Temperature of Air and Wet-bulb,
 Wind (direction and velocity), Bright Sunshine, and Rain have been
 maintained     in   regular   operation   throughout     the  year,  and   the

                  Report   of (lie Kew Observatory Committee.
 standard eye observations for the control of the automatic records
 have been duly registered.          The monthly mean values are given in
 Appendix II.
    The tabulations of the meteorological          traces have been   regularly
 made, and these, as well as copies of the eye observations, with notes
 of weather, cloud, and sunshine, have been transmitted, as usual, to the
 Meteorological Office.
    With the sanction of the Meteorological Council, data have been
supplied to the Council of the Koyal Meteorological                Society, the
                                                             '
Institute of Mining Engineers, and the editor of Symons' Monthly
Meteorological     Magazine.'
   Electrograph.  — This instrument worked          generally in a satisfactory
manner during the year.
   The " setting of the electrometer needle, mentioned in last year's
                    "
'
  Report,' has been considerably reduced, and the working of the instru
ment improved, by the removal of the large glass cup, with a diameter
of 100 mm.— used for holding the sulphuric acid — and the substitution
for it of a small glass beaker, with a diameter of 46 mm., resting
upon a disc of paraffin, and containing about 35 c.c. of acid. The acid
and accumulated moisture is removed at frequent intervals.
    Scale value determinations were made on January 24, May 12,
July 21, and November 7, and in addition the potential of the battery
has been tested weekly.        Forty cells only have    been employed through
out the year.
    A battery of thirty-six Clark cells has been purchased from Messrs.
 Muirhead on behalf of the Meteorological Council, with the hope of
 thereby introducing greater certainty into the interpretation of the
records.
    With the sanction of the Meteorological Council, the electrograms
for the year     1897 have been      lent to Mr. C. T. R. Wilson, of Sidney-
Sussex College, Cambridge.
    Inspections. — In compliance with the request of the Meteorological
 Council, the following Observatories and Anemograph Stations have
been visited and inspected : — Stony hurst, Fleetwood, Armagh, Dublin,
Valencia, Falmouth,        and Fort William, by Mr. Baker; and Radcliffe
Observatory      (Oxford), Yarmouth, North Shields, Glasgow, Aberdeen,
and Deerness (Orkney), by Mr. Constable.
                      III. Seismological      Observations.
                                           "
   Professor Milne's " unfelt tremor         pattern of seismograph has been
maintained in regular operation throughout the year; particulars of
the time of occurrence and the amplitude in seconds of arc of the
largest movements are given in Appendix III, Table I.
   The disturbance (No. 145) on September 10 was particularly notice

                  Report   of tJie Keio Observatory Committee.              345
able  ;  the range was beyond the limits of the instrument to record defi
nitely, but the maximum exceeded 11 seconds of arc.
    During November the action of the boom became sluggish, and
the records for some time were doubtful.             It was ultimately found,
after consultation with Professor Milne, that a part of the edge of
the agate cup resting on the pivot was scratched and jagged.                This
defect was remedied by moving the weight and tie piece round through
45°, and so bringing a different part of the agate cup on to the pivot.
The general working         has since been satisfactory.
                                                      '
    The remarks made in last year's ' Report as to the uncertainty of
the time measurements still hold good, and no attempt is made to
.give these values to nearer than 0-l minute.
    A detailed list of the movements recorded from April, 1898, to
 March, 1899, was made and sent to Professor Milne, and will be found
 in the* Report' of the British Association for 1899, " Seismological
Investigations Committee's Report."
    It is proposed to tabulate the disturbances            for the remainder of
 1899   in  a similar manner.
                            IV. Experimental Work.
    Fog and Mist. — The observations of a series of distant objects,
 referred to in previous ' Reports,' have been continued. A note is taken
  of the most distant of the selected objects which is visible at each
¦observation hour.
    Atmospheric     Electricity. — The comparisons of the potential, at the
  point where the jet from the water-dropper breaks up, and at a fixed
 station on the Observatory lawn, referred to in last year's ' Report,'
 have been continued, and the observations have been taken three or
 four times every month.
    Platinum Thermmmtry. — The results of the comparison of platinum
 and gas thermometers at Sevres, referred to in last year's ' Report,'
 were worked up by Dr. Chappuis and Dr. Harker, and embodied in a
  paper which was read before the Royal Society in June and will appear
          '
 in the     Philosophical    Transactions.'
    The experiments which were begun in           1895    into the constancy and
 general behaviour of platinum thermometers             have  led to the accumu
 lation of a large number of results.        These have been dealt with by
  the Superintendent in a critical paper, which was recently read before
 the Royal Society.
    Towards the end of the year an oil-bath was constructed, from the
 designs mainly of Dr. Harker, for the purpose of comparing thermo
 meters at high temperatures.            Some preliminary comparisons have
 already been made in it of a few German and English mercury
 standards with a platinum thermometer.

   Two Standard          Thermometers        have    been    constructed     during the
year.
   There were at the end of the year in the Observatory, undergoing
verification, 6 Barometers, 450 Thermometers, 24 Sextants, 150 Tele
scopes, 75 Binoculars, 6 Hydrometers,            2 Rain Measures,       2  Rain Gauges,

               VI. Rating of Watches and Chronometers.
   The number of watches sent for trial this year is slightly less than
in  1898, the total entries being 469, as compared with 483 in the pre
ceding year.
   The "especially good" class A certificate was obtained by 78
watches.        The highest number of marks obtained is a fraction lower
than the highest obtained in 1898, but the average performance shows
no falling off, as appears from the following figures showing the per
centage number of watches obtaining the distinction
                                                                             " especially

   The     469 watches received were entered for           trial  as below    : —
   For    class  A,  362 ;  class B, 86 ; and 21 for the subsidiary trial.               Of
these 19 passed        the subsidiary test, 62 were awarded class B, and 293
class  A    certificates, while 95 failed from various causes to gain any
certificate.
   In Appendix IV will          be found     a table   giving the results of trial of
the 50 watches which gained the highest number of marks during
the year.       The highest place was taken by Messrs. S. Smith & Son,
9, Strand, London, with a keyless fusee tourbillon lever watch, No.
238-99, which obtained 88-7 marks out of a maximum of 100.
   Marine Chronometers. — During the year, 56 chronometers have been
entered for the Kew           A  trials  ;  of these    34   gained certificates, and
22 failed.
   No movements were sent in for             the class  B trials, and    as the demand

for the B certificate     has been very    small indeed for some years past,
the question of the retention     of the class B trial seems to require con
sideration.

   The electrical contact-piece of     the                                failed
in its action frequently in the early part of the year.       This was    found
to be mainly due to the unequal wearing of the teeth of the old          escape
wheel.     The clock was sent to Messrs. Dent, who fitted a new          escape
wheel,    &c, and its general performance since        has been   much more
satisfactory.
                             VII. Miscellaneous.
   Commissions.   — The work under this heading         has  been  of a very
varied    character during the year.        The following instruments have
been procured, examined, and forwarded to the various Observatories
on whose behalf they were purchased : —
      dip circle and    extra needles for St. Petersburg.

    1 Kew pattern self-recording Robinson anemometer and sheets, and
          1 pocket aneroid for St. Petersburg.
    2 Kew standard thermometers and a barograph tabulator for Colaba
          (Bombay).
    A  standard Fortin barometer, an astronomical globe, maximum and
          minimum thermometers, and an ozone cage for Mauritius.
    Anemograph sheets, sunshine cards,       and rain-gauge forms have been
 sent to Hong Kong and Mauritius ;           prepared photographic paper to
 Batavia, Aberdeen, Fort William, and        Valencia, for the Meteorological
 Office ; and to Hong Kong, Mauritius,       Toronto, and Lisbon.

 arrived at the Observatory in February. Prior to its receipt, Dr. J. A.
 Harker went over to Germany and was shown the methods of using
 the gas thermometer adopted at the Reichsanstalt, Charlottenburg.
 The Committee are much indebted to Dr. Kohlrausch and other
 authorities of the Reichsanstalt for the courtesy shown by them on
 this occasion.    The cost of the instrument, including its carriage and
 Dr. Harker's expenses at Berlin, was borne by Sir A. Noble, who also
 kindly expressed his willingness to pay for the auxiliary appliances
 required in gas thermometry.            Owing to the want of a suitable
 building in which to erect the gas thermometer, the Committee were
 unable to take full advantage of Sir Andrew's generous offer for the
 immediate present, and they have been obliged to leave it to their
 successors, the Executive Committee of the National Physical Labora

.gas thermometer.
     Collimator Magnets.- — A critical and experimental paper dealing with
 the data obtained in the verification of collimator magnets at the
 Observatory during the last forty years was prepared by the Superin
tendent, and has been published in the Royal Society's ' Proceedings.'
     Discussion     on Platinum    Thermometry. — A discussion   on platinum
 thermometry having been arranged for the British Association meeting
at Dover, Dr. Harker attended, with the Committee's approval, and
 in concert with Dr. Chappuis gave a summary of their joint work at
 Sevres.
     Professor Carey Foster and Mr. Shaw also took part in the debate
 as well as the Superintendent, who had been instructed by the Com
 mittee to attend.
     Compass-testing    Regulations. — In consequence of representations by
 Mr.     J.  White, of Glasgow, the regulations for the testing of ships' com
 passes have been revised.           In this process the Committee had the
 advantage of the advice of Lord Kelvin and Captain Creak, whose
 views were laid before a sub-committee appointed for the purpose.
      At   the request of the Danish Legation, the methods employed at the
 Observatory for the verification of compasses, sextants, and naval tele
 scopes were shown to Commander Clausen, of the Royal Danish Navy,
 who      has charge of the verification  of naval instruments at Copenhagen.
      National Physical Laboratory. — Parliament having, on the motion of
  Her Majesty's Ministers, voted a sum of money for the establishment
 of    a  National Physical Laboratory, to     be under the management of a
  committee       nominated by the Council of the Royal Society, the Royal
  Society have drawn up, and the Government have approved, a scheme
  for the organisation of the Laboratory. In accordance with this
  scheme,       the  Kew Observatory is incorporated with the National
  Physical Laboratory, and becomes part of the organisation thereof as
 from the 1st January, 1900.            The Kew Observatory Committee as
  hitherto constituted ceases to exist at the same date, and its property
  is to be transferred to the Royal Society.         The work of the Observa
  tory    will,  however, proceed as heretofore, and will be carried on by
  the existing staff.
      The scheme of organisation already mentioned constitutes an Execu
  tive Committee as the authority having the immediate management of
  the National Physical Laboratory, and this Committee includes at
  present six members of the Kew Observatory Committee. The scheme
  also provides for the appointment of a Director, who, subject to the
  authority of the Executive Committee, is to have sole control and
   direction of the officials of the National Physical Laboratory and of
   the work done within it.          Mr. R, T. Glazebrook, F.R.S., has been
  appointed to this office.

350               Report     of tlie Kew Observatory Committee.
   The Kew Observatory Committee having been incorporated under
the Companies Act, 1867, certain legal forms have to be complied with
in order to wind it up, transfer its property to the Royal Society, and
put an end to its liabilities.        The steps required for these purposes are
being taken.
   Inspection   of tlie Observatory. — An inspection by the General Board of
the National Physical Laboratory was arranged for October 16th and
18th, when the Chairman and some other members of the Kew Com
mittee attended at the Observatory to assist in showing it to their
visitors.     On the second occasion the Observatory was visited by             fully
twenty members of the General Board, including the Vice-Chairman
of the Executive Committee and the Director of the National Physical
Laboratory.        By the courtesy of the Mid-Surrey Golf Club, arrange
ments     were   made     for examining the most likely sites for building
afforded by the Old Deer Park.
   Library. — During the year the library has received publications
from —
     21 Scientific      Societies    and    Institutions   of  Great    Britain and
          Ireland,
    103   Foreign and Colonial Scientific Establishments,           as well as  from
          several private individuals.
   The card catalogue has been proceeded with.
   Audit, &c. — The accounts for 1899 have been audited by Messrs. W.
 B. Keen & Co., Chartered Accountants.
   The balance        sheet,   with  a comparison     of the expenditure     for the
 two years 1898 and 1899, is appended.

                               APPENDIX I.
                   Magnetical Observations,        1899.
Made at the Kew Observatory,                Old Deer Park, Rich
    mond, Lat. 51° 28' 6" N. and Long.            0h  lm 15'-1  W.
   The results given in the following tables are deduced from the
magnetograph curves which have been standardised by observations
of deflection and vibration.     These were made with the Collimator
Magnet K.C. I. and the Declinometer Magnet marked K.O. 90 in the
9-inch Unifilar Magnetometer by Jones.
   The Inclination was observed with the Inclinometer        by Barrow,
No. 33, and needles 3J inches in length.
   The Declination and Force values given in Tables I to VIII are
prepared in accordance with the suggestions made in the fifth report
of the Committee of the British Association          on comparing and
reducing Magnetic Observations.
   The following is a list of the days during the year 1899 which
were selected by the Astronomer Royal, as suitable for the deter
mination of the magnetic diurnal inequalities, and which have been
employed in the preparation of the magnetic tables : —

    The object of the experiments which are described in this paper
was to investigate the nature of the conductivity produced in different
gases when cathode rays of definite strength passed through them.
   In a series of papers,* Professors J. J. Thomson and Rutherford
have   recently shown that gases become conductors, when traversed
either by Rontgen or by uranium rays, owing to the production o'f
positive and negative ions throughout their volume.
   In the present investigation        cathode rays were found to impress a
condition      of   the same   kind upon     a gas, and laws have been de
veloped which connect the absorption of these rays with tha number
of ions produced by them in the absorbing gases.
                                                                                     '

  (12)  Summary     of results.
   The tube used for the production of cathode rays was similar in
form to that devised by Lenard,* but, as the brass plate carrying the
aluminium window was found to act very well as an anode, the
ordinary positive electrode in his apparatus was dispensed with.
   The paper commences with a series of experiments illustrating the
conductivity produced by cathode rays, and the various phenomena
met with are shown to be fully explained on the supposition that
positive and negative ions are produced in a gas by the radiation, and
that the conductivity arises from the motion of these ions under the
action of an electric force.
   This view of the conductivity is also shown to explain the loss of
charge sustained by a conductor upon which the rays fall.                  Lenard's
experimentst in this connection were repeated, and, contrary to his
observations, negative charges were not in any case found to be com
pletely dissipated by the rays, but were reduced, at atmospheric pres
sure, to small limiting values of the order of 0"25 volt.             These values
were found to be slightly increased when a blast was directed so as to
remove the air close to the conductor, and when the latter was placed
in a vacuum, the limiting charge rapidly assumed a very high value.
The value of the limiting charge was found to be affected also by the
proximity of conductors        whose potentials were different to that of the
one upon which the rays fell.
    Conductors initially unelectrified gained the limiting negative charge
under the action of the rays, and positive electrifications upon con
ductors, surrounded by air at normal pressure, were completely dis
charged.
    The explanation offered regarding this limiting or steady state is
that it represents a condition of equilibrium in which the electric con
vection by the rays to the conductor is just equal to the conduction by
the ionised gas away from it.
    It has been thought by some that the ionisation             under consideration
 may be due to Rontgen         rays  sent  out   from  the aluminium window at

    Electrical Conductivity in     Gases traversed by Catliodc Rays.     377
the same      time as the cathode rays.     The results of experiment, how
ever, are entirely opposed to this view, and lead to the conclusion that,
if any Rontgen rays are present in the cathode pencil, they must be of
so weak a character that their ionising action can be neglected.            A
direct   comparison showed the ionisation by cathode rays to be about
300 times that due to an intense Rontgen radiation.
   In the conductivity produced by cathode rays, the current of elec
tricity does not increase in proportion to the electromotive force applied.
The current, after reaching a certain critical value, becomes practically
stationary and increases but little when very large increases are made
in the electric field. With Rontgen or uranium radiation fields of 400
or 500 volts a centimetre have sufficed to give saturation in the case of
most simple gases, but in the present investigation it was necessary to
go as high as 1000 volts a centimetre before the maximum current was
reached.
   In order to compare the ionisations in two different      gases, or in the
same gas under different conditions, recourse was had to the use of      two
ionising chambers. The discharge tube was provided with a double
cathode, and carried two aluminium windows.            Two pencils of rays
were obtained in this way, whose intensities were found to maintain a
constant ratio, and these were used       to produce the ionisations   in the
two chambers.
   The ionisation      in air, kept at a constant pressure in one of the
chambers, was      taken as the standard.     The gases, whose ionisations
were to be compared, were placed in turn in the other chamber, and
their conductivities, as measured by saturation currents, were found in
terms of the standard.
   An important result, obtained by this method with cathode rays of
constant    intensity,   was the agreement found to exist between the
ionisation    in hydrogen    at atmospheric pressure, and that in air at a
pressure   of   53 mm.    At  these pressures the two gases had the same
density, and in both cases, therefore, according to Lenard's absorption
law, the disposition of the rays, their actual intensities, and the amount
of them absorbed from point to point in the ionising chamber, were
precisely the same.         Under these conditions the equal ionisations
obtained not only form a strong confirmation of Lenard's absorption
law, but they also show that, where equal absorption of cathode rays
occurs, equal ionisation is produced.
   In order to test the conclusion more closely experiments were made
with air, hydrogen, carbon dioxide, oxygen, nitrogen, and nitrous
oxide, and in all cases it was found that, when these gases were re
duced to the same density, the same ionisation was produced in them
by rays of constant intensity.
   It follows, therefore, that an ionisation law exists exactly analogous
 to that of absorption, namely, that when cathode rays of a given

 378     Electrical Conductivity in    Gases traversed by Cathode        Bays.
 strength    pass  through a gas, the number of ions produced per second
 in  1 c.c. depends   only upon the density of the gas, and is independent
 of its chemical composition.
    From the results thus obtained, the conclusion is drawn that, when
 cathode 'rays are absorbed to any extent, the positive and negative
ions produced by these absorbed rays are of a definite amount, which
 bears a constant ratio to the quantity of the rays absorbed ; that is to
 say, in order to ascertain the relative ionisations produced in any two
 gases by cathode rays of the same intensity,       it is sufficient to determine
 the absorbing powers of the two gases          for the same rays. In other
 words, the coefficients of ionisation are determined when the coeffi
cients of absorption for the same gases are known.
    The paper then deals with the ionisation in any particular gas under
varying     pressures.    The inference is drawn       that, under rays of con
stant intensity, the ionisation     in a particular gas varies directly with
the pressure. The very great absorption of the rays by gases at
ordinary pressures prevented a direct verification of this relation ; but,
as Lenard has shown, the coefficients of absorption for any particular
gas to vary directly with the pressure, the conclusion seems quite
justifiable in the light of the connection established between ionisation
and absorption.
    Assuming this relation to be true, it follows at once that, if rays of
constant intensity are allowed to traverse different gases at the same
pressure, the ionisations produced would be directly proportional to
the densities of these gases.
    These numbers for the gases examined arc given in column 1 of the
appended table, while in column 2 are given the values found by
Professor    J. J.  Thomson for the relative ionisation         produced in these

    The numbers, with the exception of those for hydrogen, present a
fair agreement, and they show that although the two forms of radia
tion are so very different in many respects, still the products of their
actions on the gases examined are practically the same.

    Observations on the Electromotive Phenomena of Non-medul-
          lated* Nerve."           By Miss S. C. M. Sowton.              Communicated
          by Dr.      Waller,      F.R.S.     Received March 8       — Eead March 29,
          1900.
                                            [Plate   4.]
      Kiihne and Steiner in their work on the olfactory nerve of the pike,t
 published in 1880, showed that the laws of electromotive action in
 medullated nerve, as formulated by Du-Bois Reymond, held good in
 the case of non-medullated fibres.                 Having demonstrated the resting
 current in a suitably prepared olfactory nerve, they proceeded to com
 pare the value of this current with that obtained from medullated
 nerves of the same fish as wejl as from the sciatic nerve of the frog.
 The result showed             a much higher E.M.F. for non-medullated than for
 medullated          nerves, their diameter being about equal ; a result con
 firmed by Biedermann and others working on the non-medullated
 nerves of Anodonta.
     Kiihne and Steiner found that the resting current diminished rapidly,
 but a new transverse section restored it to, and in some cases even
augmented, its original E.M.F.
     On stimulation with induction currents, a negative variation of high
 value was obtained.              The response was unfailing while the nerve was
 fresh, provided that the stimulating electrodes were not applied too
 near the peripheral end of the nerve where its character becomes
 modified.
     While working at Leipzig during the early part of 1899, Professor
 Hering was good enough to suggest that I should use the nerve which
 had given such good results in the hands of Kiihne and Steiner for a
 further study of electromotive phenomena in non-medullated nerve,
 and especialty with reference to the occurrence in such fibres of the
" positive        after-variation

 Head§        had    made    familiar   in the case of medullated nerve.            Hering
 had himself occasionally observed this effect in 1885, while using the
¦olfactory nerve          for experiments on electrotonus.           The positive after
effect occurred most frequently on mechanical stimulation of the nerve
by cutting, more rarely it followed when induction currents were used.
     In the present experiments, the pike- used ranged from 1^ to 2§ kilos.

  380             Miss   S. C. M. Sowton.      Observations on the
  in weight. As described by Kiihne and Steiner the E.M.F. of the
  resting current of the olfactory nerve was found to be very high, and
  a few experiments, made by the " opposition method
                                                                 "
                                                                   of those authors,
  gave results similar to theirs ; that is to say, the resting current of the
  non-medullated nerve overpowered that of a medullatcd nerve of
  approximately similar thickness, whether taken from the fish itself or
  from a frog.
      The galvanometer used was a sensitive and quickly reacting instru

      Method.  — To prepare the olfactory nerves      :  the head of the pike was
  cut off, the lower jaw removed, and the head fixed to a small board. The
  bones of the upper surface of the skull, from the brain down to the
  nostrils, were removed with bone forceps, care being taken that only
  bone was cut away, the cartilage below being left uninjured. The
  cartilage thus exposed forms a thin capsule over the lobes of the brain,
  becoming thicker towards the olfactory lobes, and forming, where
  these    are prolonged into the olfactory nerves, a substantial sheath
  which encloses the nerves entirely, and through the semitransparent
  walls of which the nerves are just visible.           To expose the nerves a
  fine sharp scalpel was used, with which the upper surface of the
  cartilaginous sheath was sliced away, great care being taken not to cut
  too deeply and so injure the nerves themselves. Having removed in
•
  this way their upper covering, the two grey nerves are found lying^
  side by side in their canal : they run parallel for the greater part of
  their length, then fork, right and left, to enter either nostril.          Before
  attempting to remove the nerves, it must be carefully ascertained that
  they are freely exposed in their entire length, with no overhanging
  shreds of cartilage to catch and injure them. The way being clear,
  the end-organ of each nerve is separated from its nostril and serves as
  a handle by which the nerve is lifted from its canal ; a clean scissor
  cut then severs its central end from the olfactory lobe, and the nerve
  is ready    for experiment* (see Plate).
      The central end of the nerve was led off from transverse and longi
  tudinal sections by brush electrodes ; their distance apart was usually
  5 mm.        The stimulating electrodes were of platinum wire, with
  Hering'st extra loop to cut off unipolar effects.             The induction coil
  was supplied by a single Daniell cell, the distance between primary and
  secondary coils varying from 6 to 0 cm.
      A good olfactory nerve, freshly prepared, gave in response to single
  stimuli,    electrical  or mechanical, a negative variation that was per
  fectly legible     on the galvanometer scale, but it must be noted that
     * If, as sometimes happened, the two ncrros were united near their central end
  they were used together as one norye.

             Electromotive      Phenomena        of Non-medMated Nerve.                         '3St
only while the nerve was quite fresh could such responses be obtained
by single stimuli.         The momentary mechanical stimulus consisted in a
clean cut through the nerve with fine sharp scissors, the blades of
which had been moistened with normal saline                      ; the nerve was supported,
so that there should be no            pull upon     the  led-off      portion.
   In the tables of experiments given below, a few cases will be noticed,
in which there is a back swing + beyond the position of rest.                                  This,
is partly instrumental swing, but partly also due to a slight positive
after-effect.        The galvanometer used, although highly damped, was
not perfectly dead-beat, and the small after-effects could not be accu
rately estimated.           All that can be said is that there is a slight ten
dency towards positive after-effects on good nerves when quite fresh \
later the back swing tends to fall short of the position of rest.
   With tetanising induction currents the positive after-effect was only
once observed with any certainty.                                                                    i

    Through the kind co-operation of Dr. Siegfried Garten, Assistant
in the Leipzig Laboratory, I was enabled to make observations with
the capillary electrometer on the respanise of the olfactory nerve to
single stimuli.          The photographic records of three such observations
are given below.            The curves as reproduced are rather less than half
their original       size ; they read from left to right.                   The negative varia
tion appears as an upward movement of the mercury meniscus.

These experiments brought out very evidently what       am disposed to   I
regard as a principal difference between medullated and non-medullated
nerve.   Whereas in medullated nerve successive effects diminish very
slightly or not at all, or actually increase (" staircase effect   non-                "),
medullated           nerve always exhibits        a    comparatively     rapid decrease      of
successive        effects.
   Figs.      4   and   5    illustrate this point.

  The galvanometer used in these experiments was            Thomson, of      a
Muirhead's pattern, and was dead-beat. It was used with or without
photographic apparatus, the spot of light being in the last case reflected
on to   large transparent screen in the half -darkened room.
          a
   The highly damped Thomson reacted too slowly for such fleeting
effects as the response of the nerve to single stimuli to be made visible,
but being dead-beat was most suitable for the study of positive after
effect.
   With            olfactory nerve in its fresh state the positive after
               a normal
effect was never observed with this instrument, but       most striking      a
development of the phenomenon followed on subjecting the nerve to a
stream of carbon dioxide. The nerve was enclosed in     small moist              a

chamber with inlet and outlet tubes, and was led off in the usual way.
The stimulation by platinum wires was given at one minute intervals.
After a few normal responses — the character of which was a large
negative deflection often with incomplete return to the position of
rest — carbon dioxide was driven into the nerve chamber ; its immediate
effect was a marked diminution of the negative variation and the
appearance of a positive after-variation, which increased in size for
several minutes, attaining often as much as three times the size of the
negative variation.             At this point of highest development of the
positive after-effect, the back swing was very rapid, and began before
the close of stimulation.             The positive after-effect then began to pass
off, and a few minutes later the deflection was once more purely nega
tive. Larger doses of carbon dioxide produced anaesthesia of the nerve,
but with returning excitability the positive after-effect appeared as
above described.
    At the period when the distinct positive after-effect had                    passed off
a curious       phase was sometimes            noticeable immediately after stimula
tion, viz., a quick to-and-fro movement, suggesting the struggle of two
opposing processes before the slow return of the spot of light towards
its position of rest.             For instance, in the last line of figures in
Experiment           6 the spot stands at 19'5 ; on stimulation                  it moves

     Another condition in which the olfactory nerve gave positive after
 effects was after being kept for some time in normal saline.               Isolated
 grey nerve appears to be far less resistant than white nerve, but the
 olfactory sometimes retained its excitability for           as long as four hours
 .after excision, and the electrical response         of such a kept nerve was
  usually a negative effect followed by a large positive after-effect.              In
 frog   nerve   there is also a  development      of positive  after-effect  in  stale
  nerve ; but whereas such effects are in this case markedly reduced if
  not abolished by a new transverse section, in the case of the olfactory
  nerve the positive after-variation persists after fresh section.
     A few experiments were made to test the effect of ether and chloro
 form vapour on the negative variation of non-medullated nerve. The
 galvanometric effect was promptly abolished by brief administration of
 ether or chloroform vapour.          Recovery after anaesthesia occurred to
 some extent — more markedly in the case of ether than in that of
 chloroform.
     I wish to take this opportunity of thanking Professor Ilering for the
 means     of study which I enjoyed at Leipzig, and for his kindness in
 sparing me much of his own valuable time.
     I would also thank Dr. Waller for kind help and suggestions.

     That marked         reactions of those portions of the nervous system
which regulate the activity of the thoracic and ahdominal organs and the
skin do contribute characteristically to the phenomena of emotion has
long been common knowledge.                   In descriptions of emotion furnished
in recent years by certain leading psychologists these purely physio
logical processes have been given a place more important than was
attributed to them formerly.               To changes induced in the condition of
the heart and blood vessels, lungs, abdominal and pelvic viscera and
skin has been assigned a large causal r61e in the genesis of affective
psychological states.          Whereas the cardiac, vascular, respiratory, and
visceral phenomena accompanying                 emotion were wont to be regarded
as secondary to the cerebral and psychological,                 we find their position
reversed        in the writings of Professor W.        James,*    Professor C. Lange,t
and Professor Sergi.J;            It is true that it is claimed that this more
recent position has been foreseen and partly preoccupied by older
writers, by Descartes§ and Malebranche,|| ; but as Professor Ribot, who
with some reservation, endorses the new theory,H writes : " La supe
riority de James et de Lange, c'est de l'avoir posde clairement et de
s'^tre efforces       de l'appuyer     sur des preuves experimentales."**             It is
 scarcely fitting here to enter on a fidl statement of the doctrine.                      I
 may, however, be allowed some brief quotations from the authorities
 indicating their teaching.
     After having, in a previous chapter, given an account of the
 influence that a shock of feeling exerts on the nerve centres con
 trolling circulation, respiration, skin glands, abdominal and pelvic
 viscera, Professor James writes : " Our natural way of thinking about
                                       '
 these coarser emotions (e.g., grief, fear, rage, love ') is that the mental
 perception of some fact excites the mental affection called the emotion,
 and that this latter state of mind gives rise to the bodily expression.

My theory on the contrary is that                the bodily changes  follow directly   the

    This view      is the extreme antithesis to the spiritualistic conception of

emotion.        On it the " coarser emotions             come to consist in essence
 merely of sensations which arise in consequence of the effect of an
 idea upon the internal organs.              M. Jules Soury says,|| " Pour James
 l'emotion n'est que la conscience que nous avons des reactions organ-
 iques, vasculaires, glandulaires, matrices, &c, provoques par certaines

    Professor Lange traces the whole psycho-physiology of emotion to
 certain excitations of the vasomotor centre.                   He conceives all the
 other of the organic reflexes occurrent in emotion to be attributable
 mediately to the vasomotor.                For him, as for Professor James, the
 emotion is the outcome and not the cause or the concomitant of the
 organic reaction ; but for him the foundation and corner-stone of the
 organic reaction is as to physiological quality vascular, namely, vaso
 motor.      Emotion is an outcome of vasomotor reaction to stimuli of a
 particular kind.          The stimulus is some sensation acting often by inter
 mediation through some memorial-idea linked to it by association. This
 stimulus   induces a vasomotor action in viscera, skin, and brain.                   The
¦change thus induced in the circulatory condition of these organs induces
 changes in the actions of the organs themselves, and these latter changes
 evoke sensations which constitute the essential part of emotion.                    It is
 by  excitation      of  the vasomotor    centre  therefore  that  the  exciting  cause,
 whatever it may chance to be, of emotion produces the organic phe
 nomena     which        as  felt constitute    for Lange the whole essence of
emotion.       It    is noteworthy      that in Lange's view the action of the

392           Dr. C.      S.   Sherrington.    Experiments       on the       Value of
vasomotor centre upon the blood-vessels of the brain, as well as on
those of the viscera and skin, plays an important part.
   The teaching of Professor Sergi closely approximates to that of
Lange.   He argues that the exciting stimulus acts on nervous centres
in the bulb           (medulla oblongata) producing cardiac vascular and respi
ratory        effects   as well as effects upon the abdominal and pelvic viscera.
He writes            recently :
                                 " Lange hat gemeint, die Affekte hingen von
dem vasomotorischen                Zentrum    ab   ;         zu eng,
                                                       doch ist dieses Zentrum
um die Mannigfaltigkeit der visceralen Erscheinungen des Ernah rungs
lebens erklaren zu konnen.  Dagegen hat mich die Analyse zu der
Erkenntniss gebracht dass der Bulbus rachidicus, wo die reflex und
automatischen Zentren der Nerven, die das ganze Ernahrungsleben
regulieren, zusammenlaufen, das Zentrum der Affekte und im allge-
meinen das der Gefiihle ist."*
   The views of James, Lange, and Sergi have common to them this,
that according to them the psychological process of emotion is secondary
to a discharge of nervous impulses into the vascular and visceral
organs of the body suddenly excited by certain peculiar stimuli, and
depends upon the reaction of those organs.   Professor James's position
in the matter              is,
                   however, not wholly like that of Professor Lange.
In the first place, he does not consider vasomotor reaction to be
primary to all the other organic and visceral disturbances that carry
in their train the psychological appanage of emotion     and to   certain ;              a
extent Professor  Sergi, though   more  nearly  in harmony   with Lange,
agrees with James in this.   In the second place, Professor James seems
                                      "
to distinctly include other " motor      sensations and centripetal im
pulses from musculature other than visceral and vascular, among those
which causally contribute to emotion.   Thirdly, he urges his theory as
one which     completely competent only for the
                    is                             " coarser " emotions,
among which he instances
                              " fear, anger, love, grief." For Lange
and Sergi the basis of apparition of all feeling and emotion     physio                  is
logical, visceral, and organic, and has seat for the former authority
exclusively, and for the latter eminently, in the vasomotor system.
   This view, which some may conceivably tax with " materialism,"!
has      merit that materialism
          a                         does   oftentimes possess, namely,
relative accessibility to experimental test.     Such test   \attempted        it   is
in certain measure to apply in the observations which          herewith             I

the    spinal cord has been severed in the lower cervical region.
Such a severance lies headward of the exit and entrance of all that
system of nerves usually embraced under the term " sympatltetic
system."     It therefore sunders from the brain all nexus with the
thoracic, abdominal and pelvic viscera, except that existent through
certain    cranial nerves.    It also cuts off all the blood vessels from the
bulbar vasomotor centre, except for certain scanty communications
through the cranial nerves. The skin and motor organs are, as far as
the shoulder, likewise cut off from all communication with the brain.
 Therefore behind that level they are precluded from contributing to
nervous processes of emotion, either in their centripetal or their centri
fugal phases.
    In each of these dogs the observations have been prolonged for
several months subsequent to the operation of transection ; in none
 has   any impairment       whatever of emotional character, so far as
demonstrable, been detected. To study emotion in a lower animal is
 not altogether easy — even in a dog. But if reliance be placed on the
 signs that are usually taken to signify pleasure, anger, fear, disgust,
 then these animals showed them as unmistakably after as prior to the
 transection of the cervical spinal cord. The sight of, or the sound of, the
attendant who kept them evoked from them the same joyous activity
and animated caressful pose of head and feature as formerly.          Towards
 friends and enemies     among their fellow-inmates of the animal house
 they displayed as markedly as ever their liking or their rage.              To
 give an instance,    I saw  fear notably displayed by one of the dogs, a
 young animal, approached and threatened by a powerful old Macaque
 monkey.       The lowering of the head, the dejected half-averted face,
 and the drooped ears contributed to indicate existence of an emotion
 as lively as the animal had ever shown us before the spinal operation
 had been made.
     An observation of confirmatory kind I once obtained in the labora
  tory of my friend Professor Mosso of Turin. In a young dog under
 deep chloroform narcosis, I had performed a spinal transection close
  behind the origin of the phrenic nerves. Six weeks later, the trauma
  having completely healed and the condition of spinal shock having
  largely subsided, I placed the animal once more under chloroform,
  but this time not profoundly.         I connected the femoral artery with
  the mercurial kymograph        and   proceeded to record the arterial pres
  sure, allowing the chloroformisation gradually to pass off.           As the
 depth    of   the narcosis waned,   the breathing   became   quicker  and  less
  regular.     The waking of the animal was accompanied by no pain,
  because the whole body was insentient behind the cervical region, and
  the kymograph attachment was in the femoral region.             I was intend
  ing to faradise a branch of one of the nerves of the right hind limb.
  Inductorium, electrodes, galvanic cells, and whole electric circuit stood

 394       Dr. C. S. Sherrington.       Experiments on     the  Value of
 on a table near, but not on that on which the kymograph observation
 was in process.       In order to be sure that all was ready, I closed the
 electric key and touched the vibrator of the inductorium.              The harsh
 rattling noise of the vibrator lasted a few seconds, and I then stopped
it by re-opening the key. Turning thereupon toward the arterial
record, I was a little disappointed to see that a marked oscillation had
 suddenly upset the already somewhat undesirably irregular line that
had to serve as starting level for the vasomotor reflexes I was wishful
to study.      It was clear that one would have to wait for greater
quietude to re-establish itself again.        I waited ; the disturbance of the
arterial pressure subsided ; the previous fairly equable cardiac beat,
despite somewhat disquiet respiration, returned.                A few minutes
later   I  again started, by force of habit, trying the inductorium for
a couple of seconds preparatory to proceeding to excite and observe
the vasomotor reflexes. Again, on turning toward the trace running
on the kymograph, I was met by a sudden disturbance that had
altered it.    This time it occurred to me that the sudden whirring noise
of the magnetic interrupter might have caused the reaction.                   This
supposition I proceeded to test, and soon found that each time the
noise was repeated the disturbance of the circulation followed.             If the
reaction had become less, as it frequently did after a number of repeti
tions, it was only necessary to wait for ten minutes or a quarter of an
hour in order to re-obtain it in its original extent.
    I then remembered that in examining the limits of the cutaneous anaes
thesia in this animal from week to week, I had at several times employed
the inductorium ; sometimes the electrodes had in making the delimi
tation been applied to points of skin still sentient, and no doubt had
there caused sensations of unpleasant quality.            The recurrence of the
sound     to the  awakening     animal    occasioned   now   emotional anxiety.
But in this animal the vasomotor centre cut off by the spinal section
from practically the whole of the rest of the vasomotor mechanism
was quite unable to affect the arterial pressure.*           Hence that rise of
pressure observed by Couty and Charpentiert to occur under emotion
of fear was impossible in this case. All the more obvious and un
complicated for that reason appeared the inhibitory action exerted on
the heart.     The heart that had been beating at the rate of 180 per
minute, suddenly fell for twenty seconds to a rate of 54 per minute.
The respiratory rhythm was easily seen to be also altered, but no
graphic record of the respiratory movement was being employed.                   A

 after the possibility of vasomotor reaction had been                set aside,   and
 after the vastly larger portion of all visceral reaction            had also been
 removed.
    All the evidence I obtained from all the dogs went              absolutely con-
 cordantly to show that in spite of exclusion of such               a huge field of
 vascular, visceral, cutaneous, and motor reaction the emotional states
 of anger, delight at being caressed by the master or at approach of a
friend, fear, and disgust were developed with as far as could be seen
unlessened strength.         The horripilation of the coat along the crest of
the back between the shoulders, so usual an accompaniment of anger
in the dog, was of course absent in these dogs, the spinal pilomotor*
nerve-fibres having had all connection with the brain ruptured.                   But
absence of this reaction could not for a moment mask emotional dis
turbance so vividly indicated by other features of expression. Regard
ing emotions of feiir and disgust, the former was evoked by threatening
with the voice or gesturing with a whip, the latter by the expedient
of substituting dog's-flesh for horse- and ox-flesh in the dog's food-pan.
Few dogs, even when hungry, can be prevailed on even to touch dog's-
flesh as food ; almost all turn away from it at once with obvious signs
of repugnance and dislike.            Fear and disgust in answer to these tests
seemed     as   indubitable   in  these   dogs as in normal.       Great care was
taken throughout not to establish in the dogs under observation by
too frequent repetition or encouragement a habit or trick of response
by emotional signs that might thus become so to say pseudo-emotional
with the artificiality of an acted performance. No employment of
the special tests for eliciting the emotions was made in them until
after performance of the spinal section.              Even then the tests were
never frequently rehearsed ; nor were the animals ever encouraged
or incited to respond unduly or in a particular manner.               It was sought
to as far as possible approximate the tests to natural incidents, and
to as far as possible collect the observations from natural incidents.
    The above was the condition found to obtain in the animals after the
cervical spinal transection.          I then proceeded in two animals to carry
the test further by additional severance of both the vagi nerves in
the neck. The vagus may be regarded as the great visceral unit of the
cranial series of nerves. Its section subsequent to prethoracic spinal
transection relegates to the field of insentience the stomach, the
lungs, and the heart, in addition to the other viscera previously
rendered apsesthetict          It also limits still more narrowly the number

      Of the animals chosen for these further observations, one was selected
  because we soon noted marked emotional characteristics in her beha
  viour even on her first arrival in the laboratory.        She was a mongrel-
  bred fox-terrier with rather wiry coat, white in colour.          She was older
  than the other dogs ; her exact age we did not know. She quickly
  showed herself affectionate toward the laboratory attendants, one of
  whom had her in charge ; but toward some persons and toward several
  inmates of the animal house, she frequently exhibited violent dis
  plays of anger. Her ebullitions of rage were sudden. Their expres
 sion accorded well with a description of the symptoms of rage in
 the dog furnished by Darwin.* Besides the utterance of the growl,
  ¦"
     the ears are pressed closely backwards, and the upper lip is retracted
 out of the way of the teeth, especially of the canines." The mouth
 was slightly opened and lifted ; the eyelids widely parted ; the pupils
 ¦dilated.     The hair along the mid-dorsum, from close behind the head
  to a point more than half way down the trunk, became rough and
 bristling.       A particularly violent outburst of anger was once
 suddenly, without warning, exhibited against a visitor who happened
 to enter with me, and had not before visited the room. Spinal tran
 section in the cervical region was performed on this animal (under
 deep anaesthesia). Subsequent examination months later at the autopsy
 proved the section to have been through the 6th cervical segment,
 where it trenches on the 7th.              The severance was complete, as was
 confirmed by microscopic examination.               Rapid recovery from the
 trauma followed.          An interval of depression of the spinal functions
 behind the site of lesion was succeeded by gradual restoration of reflex
Activity, surface temperature, &c. Sensation, superficial and deep, was
 found to be lost behind the limit shown by the skin line indicated in
 the accompanying figure (fig. 2, p. 400, the lower diagram).                The
 flexors of the elbow were not paralysed, but the extensors were com
pletely so        I have shown t that the sensory nerve supply and motor
 nerve supply to any muscle have both of them the same segmental
 position in the spinal cord.         Therefore the only muscle still sentient
 behind the shoulder region must have been the diaphragm.
     No alteration whatever was detected in consequence of this lesion
in the occurrence of emotion, as judged by anger, by delight, or,
when provocation arose, by fear. Her joy at the approach or notice
of the attendant, her rage at the intrusion of a cat with which she
was unfriendly, appeared as active and thorough as before.* But
among the signs expressive of rage the bristling of the coat along
the back no longer occurred.                On the other hand, the eyes were

398       Dr. C.   S. Sherrington.    Experiments on   the Value of
well opened, and the pupil distinctly dilated in the paroxysm of
anger. Since the brain had been by the transection shut out from
discharging impulses via the cervical sympathetic, the dilatation of pupil
must have occurred by inhibition of the action of the oculomotorius
centre. That the cervical sympathetic had been cut off from its normal
bulbar and cerebral excitation was shown by the semi-paralysis of the
membrana nictitans in this dog, as in all the others, after cervical spinal
transection.      This partial closure of the eye, due to impaired tonus in
the third eyelid, was little if at all diminished during the outburst of
rage ; but we sometimes thought that during the fit of anger the third
 eyelid was a little more retracted than in its usual paretic condition.
    As in the other dogs after spinal transection, so in this, the spinal
 transection markedly enfeebled the voice. This we thought traceable
entirely to the enfeeblement of the respiratory     muscles,  the only respi
ratory muscle left unparalysed after the transection being the diaphragm.
 The viciousness of the enfeebled and short-winded growl and bark
remained as unmistakable and virulent as ever.             Apart from this
change in the ocular and vocal factors of the facial and respiratory
expression of anger, we detected no departure from their previous
 normal in any direction whatsoever.          The heart-beat could be felt
to be altered, sometimes becoming quick and sometimes slow, but
rarely remaining unchanged during the exhibition of wrath.         I thought
               "
I could feel vagus beats," but the upset of respiratory movement made
the judgment difficult.
    One hundred and eighty days after the spinal transection, I divided
under deep chloroform anaesthesia the right vagus nerve in the neck,
about the level of the cricoid cartilage, and therefore well below the
superior laryngeal branch, but above the recurrent laryngeal.              The
cervical sympathetic trunk in the dog is contained in the same sheath
as the vagus, so also is the depressor branch of the superior laryngeal,
and all three were divided by the same section.          This operation pro
duced curiously small obvious result.           There ensued little or no
difference between the       pupils; the right was generally     a  little the
smaller.     Absolutely no difference was discoverable between the degree
of protrusion of the third eyelids right and left.      The palpebral open
ings on the two sides appeared the same.       The pose of the pinna of the
ear of each side, both right and left, seemed quite similar.              The
voice, after the first day succeeding the operation, when it seemed
altered   in some quality difficult of description, reassumed the char
acter   it had had since the spinal transection.         The exhibition of
emotion,    as   tested by delight, anger, and fear, indicated emotional
states   as  marked and violent as ever.         The trauma was rapidly
recovered from as regards the healing of the small wound necessary.
    Twenty-eight days later the left vagus nerve was similarly divided
under deep anaesthesia, and at the same level as the right.          The left

depressor nerve and the left sympathetic trunk were severed at the
same time.   Subsequent examination    at the autopsy proved that
both nerves had been completely cut.       An additional guarantee
was given by the absolute absence of all effect on stimulating the
distal end of each of the four trunks before proceeding to the autopsy
— that         is,
          twenty-one days after the second vagotomy, when complete
nerve degeneration had been allowed time to occur.
    In this animal, the superior laryngeal was the lowest branch of the
vagus remaining intact and connected with the brain.    The recurrent
laryngeals proceeded from the vagus trunks, below the level of the
sections. The results of the operation were dyspnoea tending to occur
in short-lasting attacks, but often passing off entirely some loss of
                                                                 ;
appetite, which was in the course of seven days recovered from    con        ;
siderable enfeeblement of, and alteration of, the growl and bark, both
these     however still
                    remaining, although modified. The attacks of
dyspnoea diminished, and in the course of ten days disturbed the
animal rarely and but little.  We began to think they might be
avoided   altogether.   The animal seemed quickly to learn what
postures were least hampering to respiratory movement, and this had
as result    marked improvement in breathing and general condition.

   In this animal the capacity of the nervous system differed from that
obtaining in those subjected solely to the spinal transection, in that

rendered anaesthetic and put beyond power of contributing to con
scious reaction, there were added in this case the. stomach and lower
half      of oesophagus, the lungs and lower half (?) of the trachea, and

   Of any diminution or change in the emotional character of the
animal we could detect no trace. The following illustrates her condi
tion in that regard.
   The approach of the visitor whose advent months previously elicited
such violent anger, again provoked an exhibition of wrath as significant
as before.    The expression was indubitably that of aggressive rage.
The animal propped itself against its kennel, and followed each
movement of the stranger as though of an opponent, growling viciously,
and barking in spite of increasing dyspnoea under the excitement.
On other occasions a cat with which she was never friendly, and
a monkey new to the laboratory,  approaching too near the kennel,
excited similar ebullitions. No doubt was left in our minds that-
sudden         attacks      anger were still easily excited in this
                         of violent
animal.   She also gave evidence daily that she experienced the acces
sion of joyous pleasure and delight she had always shown at the
approach of the attendant the first thing of  morning, or at feeding
                                                     a
time, or when caressed by him, or encouraged by his voice.

            we proceeded to this observation.     Flesh was given her
daily in  bowl
            a  of milk, and this (after return of her appetite   week            a
subsequent to the second vagotomy) she took with relish.    The meat

was always already cut into pieces of a size rather larger than the
lumps of sugar usual for the breakfast table.                It was generally
horse-flesh, sometimes ox-flesh. On the tenth day after the final
operation the bowl was placed by the attendant, as usual, in the
corner of the stall, with milk and meat in it in every way as usual ;
but the meat was flesh from a large dog killed in the laboratory on
 the previous day.       Our animal eagerly drew itself toward the food ;
 it had seen the other dogs fed and evidently itself was hungry.               Its
 muzzle    had almost dipped into the milk before it suddenly seemed
 to find something amiss there. It hesitated, moved its muzzle about
 above the milk, made a venture to take a piece of the meat, but before
 actually seizing it stopped short and withdrew again from it. Finally,
 after some further examination of the contents of the bowl (it was usual
 for it to begin the attack of its food by taking out and eating the pieces
 of meat), without touching them, the creature turned away from the
 bowl and withdrew itself to the opposite side of the cage.                 Some
 minutes later, in result it seemed of encouragement from us to try
 the food again, it returned to the bowl.        The same hesitant display of
 conflicting desire and dislike was once more gone through.           The bowl
 was then removed by the attendant, emptied, washed, and horse-flesh
 similarly prepared and placed in a fresh quantity of milk was offered
 in it to the animal.      The animal once more drew itself toward the
 bowl    and   this time began to eat the meat, soon emptying the
 dish.    This test was similarly applied afterwards on various occa
 sions ; always with the above result, except that twice the animal did,
 after much hesitancy, lap some of the milk out of the bowl, although
 dog's-flesh was immersed in it. We have occasionally seen a normal
 dog do likewise when hungry.           To press the flesh upon our animal
 was of no real avail on any occasion ; the coaxing only succeeded in
 getting her to, as it were, re-examine but not to touch the morsels.
 The impression made       on all of us by the dog's behaviour    has been   that
 there   existed   in  the  dog's-flesh something which was        repulsive    to
 the animal and excited in it disgust unconquerable                by ordinary
 hunger.     Some odour attaching to the flesh seemed the          mark for its
 recognition.
    Fear   seemed to be clearly elicitable     in this animal.    While   I  held
 her in my arms the attendant, approaching from another room the door
 from which was open, chid the dog in high scolding tones.                    The
creature's head sank,        her   gaze  turned   away   from   her advancing
master, and her face seemed to betray dejection and anxiety.                  The
 respiration   altered  and  became   unquiet, but the pulse  was  never  altered
in rate although perhaps slightly in volume.
    Twenty days after the last vagotomy the animal                suddenly de
 veloped a serious attack of dyspnoea ; this was recovered from, but in
 the course of the following day a similar attack occurred.              Fearing

 402      Vascular and Visceral Factors for            the Genesis    of Emotion.
 lest in our absence       such an attack should recur and prove fatal, pre
 cluding    the  possibility of testing the excitability of the vagi and
 sympathetic and of thus examining the completeness of their functional
 removal, I therefore on the 21st day after the latter vagotomy and
 the 229th after the cervical transection killed the animal under deep
 chloroform narcosis.
     A   second dog, a quite young puppy, was made the subject of a
 ¦course of similar experiments.            The animal was hardly so suitable,
 because it at no time, either before commencement of or in the course
 •of  the experiment, exhibited to similar degree the signs of anger.                Its
 ¦exhibitions   of joy and pleasure, as also, on occasion, of fear, were
 well marked. The spinal transection in the cervical region, and the
 double section of the vagi and the cervical sympathetic nerves in the
  neck, seemed not to dull at all its emotional character as tested
 by these tests. The spinal transection was through the seventh cervical
 segment, the section of the vagi above both recurrent laryngeal
 branches and of the sympathetic trunks at the same level. The animal
 was preserved under observation 174 days from the time of the first
 operation, namely, from the spinal transection.                The autopsy proved
 all the sections to have been complete. The results have substantiated
 those noted in the previously related observations.               The only point of
 difference worth remarking seems that in this last case the reactions
  were given by a very young animal practically reared in the laboratory,
 whereas in the just mentioned older bitch there was a past history,
 with habit and education, of the details of which we in the laboratory
 knew nothing and have failed to obtain information.
     These experimental observations yield no support to the theories of
 the production of emotion quoted at the opening of this communica
 tion.    On the contrary, I cannot but think that they go some way
 toward negativing them.*             A vasomotor theory of the production of
 emotion seems at any rate rendered quite untenable.                  I am not sure if
 I understand Professor Sergi aright when I think that he suggests
 that in absence of vascular and visceral reactions, the very quality of
 affective tone must be lacking to sensations. Such a suggestion is
opposed by the ease with which evidence of unpleasant, e.g., painful
 quality of sensation could be evoked by appropriate excitation of the
still sentient regions of skin in the animals we had before us, the
 subject of this note.
     It need hardly be added that the importance of the concurrence,
 together with the other reactions in emotion, of marked vascular and
    * All who have visited and seen the animals, the subject of this communica
tion, have fully concurred in the opinion of myself and others in the laboratory

mention    and thank   for their attention  to the  matter, Dr. Abram,   Professor Paul,
Dr. Warrington,    Sir James   Russell, and  Dr. James Mackenzie.

the here given observations affect the position of affairs   that they,    is,
I think, render    necessary to attribute to these elements of emotion
                        it

" On        the Brightness of the Corona of April 16, 1893. Preliminary
            Note."  By H. H. Turner, M.A., F.R.S., Savilian Professor.
            Received March 29 —Read May 10, 1900.
   The visual brightness of the corona was measured at the total
eclipses of August 29, 1886, and April 16, 1893, by Professor T. E.
Thorpe, using     method arranged by Sir W. Abney

A,      1889,   p.and 1896, p. 433).
                     363,              Soon after the first of these
eclipses, Sir W. Abney devised  method of measuring the brightness
                                         a
photographically, by exposing   portion of the plate, which was not
                                         a
exposed to the sky, to  standard light passed through a row of small
                                a
square screens of varying and known thickness.       The result                      is
                                                                                     a
series of "                 "
            standard squares on the plate, which show the density of
deposit due to standard lights of known values and by comparing ;
the density of the coronal image               we find the brightness of the corona
in terms of these standard lights.
   These squares were first put on the coronal photographs by English
observers at the eclipse of December, 1889, and have been syste
matically used by them since. The 1889 photographs have not yet
been measured.              Some measures      of the 1893 photographs were made
by      me    in Sir W. Abney's      laboratory     at South Kensington, in July,

   1894; but the standard squares had not received a sufficiently long
   exposure and additional experiments were required.                  These were
   carried out by Sir W. Abney during the year ; but causes which need
  not here be dwelt        on (chiefly the desire to make further measures
  which other work has hitherto prevented but which are now being
  made) have delayed the publication of the results far too long : and,
  while still reserving the details for a more complete account, I publish
  one or two general results which may be useful to others in preparing
  for the forthcoming eclipse.

     The plates measured were those numbered 3a (large scale), 3 and 5
 (small scale), of which the first was measured rather elaborately along
 four radii extending due N., S., E., W, from the limb respectively, and
 the reference table or curve of standard lights was constructed for this
 plate.
    The following table shows the actual measures, each number being
deduced from the mean of three sector readings by application of the
curve of standard lights.
    The unit of the table is the effect caused by an amyl acetate lamp
shining on the plate from a distance of 9 feet for 1 second.
    The numbers represent powers of 2, giving the intensities in terms of
this unit.      Thus 7-7 means 2"-", or 208 times the unit.
    The distances from the limb are in terms of a cardboard scale, and
it  was found by measurement of the moon's diameter that
                     100 div.  = 15''6  = solar radius nearly.
Hence 10 div. may be regarded as 0-l solar radius.

   This table shows —
   (1) The accuracy of the method.              The intensity of the light is
clearly determinable within an error of 0-1 or 0-2, i.e., of 20'1 or 20"2,
which are ratios of l-07 and 1-15 respectively.
   (2) The intensity falls off in nearly the same manner in all four
directions.      [It may    be  remarked     that     1893 was near a sun-spot
maximum, and the corona of the kind approximating                    to symmetry all
round the limb.]        Such differences as there are do not arise from the
excentric position of the sun behind the moon ; for the photograph was
taken after the middle of totality, when the moon would have advanced
towards the east, and hence the western radius should be brighter
than the eastern at the same distance from moon's limb ; whereas the
contrary is the case. Also there is a marked difference between the
N. and    S. radii.

   (3) The falling off in intensity is very rapid at first.  At one radius
from the  limb   it has  fallen to  one-twentieth,  at   two radii to one-
hundredth.
   (4) As regards the absolute intensity, it will be more convenient to
refer the brightness to the more familiar unit of the moon's brightness.
It is a fair assumption to take the total brightness of the moon as
0'02 candle at one foot ; or (since an amyl acetate lamp = 0-8 candle)
to 0"02 x 81 -r 0-8 of the units (amyl acetate lamp at 9 feet) adopted
in the intensity scale : that                     is,
                                  to 2'025 of such units.  Now     the                               if
moon were to shine for 50 seconds (the exposure of the photograph)
instead of  we must multiply this number by 50; and
                 1,                                      further                          if              it
shines on the plate through      4-inch object glass, so that the light
                                                   a
falling on this 4-inch circle   collected into an image of
                                                  is             inches                     1   -5
diameter, the brightness of any point of this patch would represent
                                        2   025   x      50   x
                                                                  (4/1 -5)2
                                       = 720 units = 2r6 units.
Thus      if   we subtract         9"5                           shall
                                             from all the numbers in Table                 I,   we
get numbers fairly expressing the coronal brightness in terms of that
of the moon, in powers of as before.         2

this preliminary note) in detail    they confirm those already given

gradual indeed after 45 minutes from the limb.     They also seem to
show that the readings near the edges of the plate in 3a are too low
by about 1*0 which;     due to the fact that the magnifier
                                   is                        too small                     is
to take in the whole object glass at the edges of the field.

•observations. The results from plates                            3   and    5   are preferred to those
of 3a far from the limb, for the reason  stated in the last paragraph,
and for measures near the limb, results obtained from special measures
with a plain glass reflector.

give  their visual readings for the 1886 eclipse in terms of a Siemens'

1   -2   candles or   1   -4   Siemens' units             on the      same    scale.   Hence we must

    No measures of brightness were made visually within 0-6 of a
radius of the sun from the limb.            It would be interesting to have this
comparison made.            For the region where we have a comparison, it
appears      that the light falls off photographically              more rapidly than
visually. This is in accordance with experience, the faint extensions
having been seen more easily than photographed.
    As regards the central portions, we have some indirect information ;
for the total brightness of the 1893 corona was found to be -equivalent
to 0"026 Siemens' unit at one foot or 0'022 candle, i.e., rather more
than the value assumed above for the moon.
    Integrating numerically for the part in the annulus extending from
0-6 radii to 2-6 radii, we find that this portion is equal to 0-20 moon
photographically        and 0'25 moon visually.            This leaves about 0-75
moon (visual) for the part within this distance (i.e., from the limb to
0-6 radius), while photographically the value got from the curve is only
0-44 moon.        It  seems as though       the corona were altogether brighter
visually than photographically,          in the ratio of about 3 to 2 ; but this
conclusion      needs confirmation.

radium, bodies of enormous radio-active powers, it was suggested that
uranium might possibly owe its power to the presence of a small
quantity of            one of these bodies.                But in a paper published in the
  Revue Gdne>ale des Sciences for January, 1899, Mdme. Curie says :—
'                                               '
" This does not
                              appear probable, for if such were the case different
samples      of uranium            compounds would have very different radio
activities, but in the course of a number of experiments made with
various samples of metallic uranium, as well as with oxides and salts
from      various        sources,      I   have never found any marked difference
between the relative activities of the same compound."
    In another paper* the same author says that "the property of
emitting rays               .  .   .      which act on photographic plates is a specific
                    uranium      and      thorium."         " The
property of                                                         physical condition of the
metal seems to be of an altogether secondary importance." " Uranium
and thorium alone are practically active."
    3. When the discovery of radium was announced, and it was said
to have " to all appearance the properties of almost pure barium,"t it
occurred to me that radium might be found in detectable quantities in
some     barium minerals were search made among them from different
localities.        Accordingly specimens of the following minerals were put
on sensitive plates, a sheet of black paper separating them from the
sensitive surface.             As it was probable that the radio-active substance
would be present, if at all, in very minute quantities, the sensitive
plate was exposed to their influence for forty-eight                        hours.

                            Radio-activity of Uranium.                                 411
  Not    one of these minerals           showed the slightest action on the sensi
tive plate.
  4.   Having obtained negative results with barium compounds,                              I
went    through every mineral in my cabinet — a somewhat extensive
collection, numbering   many fine specimens.    Large photographic
plates were covered with black paper, and the minerals were laid on
them as close as they could conveniently be placed, accurate note of
their names and positions being recorded.    They were exposed in
total darkness for forty-eight hours.    By this means a list of radio
active minerals was ultimately obtained.   They were then tested for
order of intensity of action.  The following is a list of active minerals
arranged in order, the most active heading the list              :   —
                1.   Pitchblende.                      9. Broggeritc.
                2.   Uranite.                         10.    Monazite.
                3.   Autunite.                         11.   Xenotimc.
                4.   Orangite.                         12.   Arrhenite.
                5.   Thorite.                          13. Sipilite.
                6. Euxenite.                           14.   Fergusonite.
                7. Samarskite.                        15. Chalcolite.
                8.   Alvite.                           16. Hielmite.
  It   will   be observed      that   these minerals all contain     either uranium or
thorium.
   5. Pitchblende was the most radio-active mineral, but it varied
much in different parts.   A slice was cut from a piece of pitchblende
from Cornwall and the surface was polished.        A sensitive photo
graphic plate was pressed against             it,
                                      and after twenty-four hours the
plate was developed.     The impression showed the structure of the
mineral  in a remarkable manner, every little piece of pitchblende
showing  black, those portions in which the radio-active substance was
not so operative showing in half tint, while the felspar, quartz, pyrites,
&c, having no radio-activity, left the plate transparent                 (see   Plate 5).
  Pitchblende from different localities differed greatly in action.
  6.   A large crystal of orangite from Arendal was ground flat and
polished at one end and side, and a piece of sensitive celluloid film,
cut half through so as to allow     to bend sharply, was put on the
                                             it
polished surfaces, one half pressing against the end and the other
half against the side. The exposure was continued for seventy-two
hours.  On developing, no difference could be seen in the intensity of
the impression, whether made by the end or the side of the crystal.
The impression also was uniform over the surface, the cracks in the
surfaces not having impressed themselves.
  These experiments were repeated with the interposition of a thin
sheet of celluloid between the mineral and the sensitive plate. The
results were practically         the same as before.

                                      Sir W. Crookes.
  7. Roughly speaking, the action of pitchblende is in proportion to
the percentage of uranium in the mineral.    Finely powdered pitch
blende of different degrees of richness were experimented with. Cells
were made of thick lead pipes half an inch internal diameter and one
inch long, closed at the lower ends with card. They were filled with
powdered pitchblende, one containing 43 per cent. Ur308 and the
other 12 per cent. Ur3Os. A sensitive plate being covered with black
paper, the lead cells were laid on it and kept in total darkness for
120 hours.   The intensity of the spot under the 43 per cent, ore on
development was found to be at least three times that of the one under
the 12 per cent. ore.
   Two lead cells were taken, one being a quarter of an inch long and
the other two inches long.   They were filled completely with the 43
per cent, ore, and a sensitive   plate exposed to their action for forty-
eight hours.   On  developing  it  was doubtful whether any difference
existed in the intensity of the two spots, proving that the action does
not pass through much thickness of active material, a quarter of an
inch being equal in effect to two inches.
   No difference in the action was noticed when the bottom of the cell
was made of thin glass cemented on, instead of card.
   Four cells were filled with pitchblende and placed side by side on a
sensitive plate. After having acted twenty-four hours the first was
removed, the second after forty-eight hours, the third after seventy-
two hours, and the last was kept on for ninety-six hours. On develop
ing the plate the spots had intensities varying with the lengths of
exposure, and in about the right proportion, on the assumption that
double the time of action gives double the intensity of blackening.
  8. For convenience of comparison I had' a number of glass cells
made, three-quarters of an inch wide and deep, so that they could
either be sealed up or closed with a cork.  A piece of , apparatus was
made so as to take radiographs of samples with more ease and cer
tainty. A lead plate, 2 mm. thick, 6£ inches long, and 2| inches wide,
has circular holes punched in       one inch in diameter.
                                             it,            Under the
thick plate of lead   is                plate, made of pure assay foil,
                           another thinner
and having holes in        it,
                         concentric with the others, but barely   inch
                                                                  f
in diameter, so that one of the small cells will not pass through the
lower hole, but will pass easily through the upper hole, and thus be
kept in place.    To prevent contact between the lead plate and the
sensitive surfacea  thin sheet of celluloid   fixed beneath, with holes
                                                       is
punched in  it   concentric with those in the lead plates.  In the top
left corner of the lead plates      short steel pin, which can be pressed
                                        is
                                        a
on the sensitive plate and so register its position in respect to the cells
experimented with.      The lead and celluloid plates are then bound
together and the whole       fitted into
                                 is          shallow wooden tray with
                                                   a                     a
light-tight cover.

                              Radio-activity of Uranium.                               413
  A   sensitive film is laid face upwards at the bottom of the wooden
tray ; on this are put the lead screens, and then the experimental cells
of radio-active bodies in order, careful note being taken of their rela
tive positions.
  9. Wishing to prepare compounds of radium and polonium, the
very curious bodies discovered by M. and Mdme. Curie, I arranged
with my friend Mr. Tyrer, Stirling Chemical Works, for the systematic
working up of half           a ton of pitchblende.     It   was necessary to examine
every precipitate and filtrate in each stage of the operation, and for
convenience of registration they had to be compared with a standard
cell filled with a substance unvarying in action.  After many trials, I
selected crystallised uranium nitrate as being strongly radio-active and
easily prepared pure. This led me to the observation which forms the
subject of the present paper.
   10. The following compounds of uranium were tested simultaneously,
being put into glass cells and arranged on a lead screen with seven
holes   :   —
                      1.   Metallic uranium, from M. Moissan.
                      2.   Uranium nitrate, U02(N03)2.6H20.
                      3.   Uranium acetate.
                      4.   Uranium persulphate.
                      5.   Uranium protosulphate.
                      6.   Uranium oxide (green), UO22UO3.
                      7.   Uranium oxide (black), UO2UO3.
  For twenty-four hours              the       was exposed to the
                                           sensitive   plate
influence of these bodies. With the exception of metallic uranium,
which showed least action, there was not much difference between the
effect produced by any of the others.
   11. In order to prepare uranium    nitrate of great purity for a
standard, I took some pounds of the commercial salt and purified                        it,
first by solution in ether (13), and then by repeated crystallisation.
After many operations      cell was filled with the crystals, and
                                a                                    was          it
used as a standard.    To my surprise, after having acted on sensitive       a
plate  for  twenty-four hours, on development not         trace of image
                                                                  a
could be seen.
  12. Thereupon      tried the following experiments to ascertain
                       I                                           the            if
great radio-activity of some uranium compounds and the absence of                       it
in others might be caused by some variation of physical, crystalline,
or chemical condition.
  Commercial uranium nitrate was taken, and —
  (1)
        Aportion was heated with excess of nitric acid to dryness on
the water-bath.  It was powdered and put in cell.           a
  (2)   similar
        A       portion of the salt was dissolved in alcohol, and the
solution             to dryness over the water-bath.
                evaporated                                                The resulting
orange-coloured pasty material was ground and put in                  a   cell.

414                               Sir W. Crookes.
    (3) The salt was treated in the same way as No. 1, except that the
excess of water and acid were not driven off.
   (4) A small quantity was heated for some time on a water-bath till
it was thoroughly dry.         It was then powdered and    put in a cell.
    (5) 50 grains were put in a glass cell and heated on a water-bath to
about 75° C. till it had dissolved in its water of crystallisation.
    (6) 50 grains in a glass cell were heated on a sand-bath to about
230° C.      The water of crystallisation having been driven off the salt
fused, and on cooling remained a hard, yellow, glassy mass.
    (7) A similar quantity of the same salt was heated to a little above
230° C.   till it commenced to      decompose.
    (8)  A  similar quantity was heated more strongly, till about half the
nitrate   had   decomposed.
    (9)  The   same   quantity was heated till decomposition was complete.
    (10)  As    a  standard,  some of the same lot of commercial uranium
nitrate from which these lots were taken was put in a cell.
    These ten cells were placed in a lead screen apparatus, and a sensi
tive plate was exposed to their influence for twenty-four hours.              On
development there was not much difference between any of the impres
sions, that under No. 9 being a little the strongest.
    Thus it appears that no modification of physical or chemical con
 dition materially affects the radio-active property of a uranium com
 pound when, to begin with, the salt experimented on possesses it ;
other    imilar experiments show that, starting with an inactive uranium
salt, nothing that can be done to it will cause it to acquire this property.
It   is therefore     evident  that, as  I had suspected, the radio-active pro
perty ascribed to uranium and its compounds is not an inherent
property of the element, but resides in soma outside body which
can be separated from it.                                                 . .
    Having by repeated crystallisation succeeded in preparing a photo
graphically       inactive   uranium nitrate, I started experiments with
several pounds of the commercial salt to ascertain the readiest means
of separating from it the active body.
    13. Into a stoppered cylinder I put 1 lb. of crystallised nitrate and
poured on it a pound of methylated ether, sp. gr. 0*7 2. The salt
easily dissolved on shaking, and after a few hours the whole of the
crystals had disappeared, leaving at the bottom of the cylinder 1000
fluid grains of a heavy aqueous solution.           I separated the aqueous
solution     from the ethereal solution, and evaporated it to dryness to
remove     traces   of ether.   The ethereal solution was allowed to evapo
rate spontaneously.         Equal quantities of the soluble and the insoluble
in ether I put into glass cells and added sufficient dilute nitric acid to
dissolve the salt, and then evaporated each lot to dryness on the
water-bath.        When dry the two cells, and a third containing some of
the original nitrate, were put on a sensitive plate for twenty -four hourB.

                          Radio-activity of Uranium.                       -115
    On development       it was found that the action of      the  part undis
solved by ether was very strong, that of the original nitrate not more
than half as strong, while no action whatever could be detected on the
part of the plate covered by the salt soluble in ether.
    The portion insoluble in ether, after evaporation to dryness with
nitric acid, and then crystallisation in water, in no way differed in
appearance from ordinary uranium nitrate.              The portion soluble in
ether, when dried, heated with dilute nitric acid and crystallised, also
had the same appearance as the initial salt.
    14. The crystallised nitrate from the portion insoluble in ether           I
again extracted with ether.        Most of it dissolved, and a small portion
of heavy aqueous liquid settled at the bottom.           As before, the nitrate
which dissolved in ether had scarcely any radio-active power, while
the residue from this second extraction possessed it in a strong degree.
The residue after the second extraction was about double the activity
of the residue after the first extraction, showing that ether, while
dissolving uranium nitrate itself with facility, does not dissolve the
 body to which it owes its radio-activity.
    15.  The uranium      nitrate  from the portion insoluble in ether was
 submitted to fractional crystallisation in the following manner : —
    The solution   was    evaporated until on cooling about three-fourths
 would crystallise out.        The beaker in which this operation was per
 formed was called No. 1. When crystallisation had finished, the
 mother-liquor was poured into a beaker called No. 2. A little water
 was added to No.     1 and it was warmed to dissolve the crystals ; No. 2
 was evaporated a    little, and both were set aside to crystallise.     When
 cold the mother-liquor from 2 was poured into a beaker No. 3, the
 mother-liquor from 1 was poured into 2, a little water being added to
 dissolve the crystals in 1, and the contents of the three beakers were
 warmed and allowed again to crystallise separately.            This operation
 was continued as long as the uranium salt would hold out, or till the
 tests showed that the operations had gone far enough.
    16.  Tests were made to see how the operations were proceeding.
 A portion    of the crystals from No. 1 beaker was dried and put into
 a cell.   Some mother-liquor from the last beaker was         also evaporated
 and crystallised, and the crystals were put in a cell.          The two were
 placed side by side on a sensitive plate and the action        was allowed   to
 proceed for twenty-four hours.            On development       there  was    no
 visible spot beneath No. 1 nitrate, while that beneath the nitrate
 from the other end of the fractionation was strong and black.
     17. The crystals were removed from their cells, ignited to the
 green oxide, and replaced.          Tested again on a sensitive plate the
 results  were  similar   to  those  given by the unignited nitrates. ¦ The
 active substance,' therefore, is seen to reside in the mother-liquor.
     18. In making photographic        tests it is not necessary to take much

41G                               Sir W. Crookes.
of the substance.        On an ordinary microscopic slide I put a small
drop of liquid from each of the highest five fractionations, Nos. 10, 9,
8, 7, and 6.     The drops were allowed to crystallise and the slide was
 aid on a sensitive plate.        In twenty-four hours a good impression of
No.   10, the highest fraction, was obtained ; a less strong impression
of the next, No.       9 ; a fainter one of 8; a scarcely perceptible          one
of  7 ; and no impression at all from No. 6. The slide containing              the
five crystalline spots was then covered with another glass, and                the
whole cemented together with Canada balsam and mounted in                      the
manner usual with microscopic slides.             When the balsam was dry the
slide was put on a sensitive plate.              In twenty-four hours a good
graduated image was developed.
    19. There are    in commerce two kinds of uranium nitrate : one, the
commercial variety,      and another called " purissimum."          I am informed
                             "
that the " purissimum           is prepared      from the former by repeated
crystallisation.     I  purchased    some  of  each  of these nitrates and tested
them on a photographic plate.            The commercial variety proved to be
at least twice as radio-active as the " purissimum
                                                            "
                                                              salt.
    20. Experiments       were now instituted with a view of obtaining a
wholly inactive uranium nitrate.           About two pounds of the salt that
had been     obtained    from  the   solution   in ether was repeatedly crystal
lised, pouring off the mother-liquor each             time.   This and the next
succeeding two lots of crystals (Nos. 1, 2,          and 3) were put into cells,
and kept on a sensitive plate for seven               days.   On developing the
plate no image could be detected where               No. 1 had been ; a scarcely
perceptible    impression could be just detected at No. 2, and a little
stronger impression at No. 3.
    21. Other methods were attempted for the separation of the active
substance from uranium.              Uranium nitrate fuses at a moderate
temperature, and after some time it becomes darker, and nitrous
fumes come off.         Finally, the mass becomes semi-fluid, and will not
run.    The operation is then stopped, and the mass transferred to
water ; the undecomposed nitrate is dissolved out, leaving an insoluble
basic nitrate.      The basic nitrate is of an orange-yellow colour, easily
dissolved in nitric acid to again form the normal nitrate.                By using
this method      of  fractionation     the  active  body gradually     accumulates
towards the basic end.         But the method is neither so complete nor so
easily effected as the crystallisation method, and therefore I have not
pushed it very far.        I have, however, proved that the radio-activity of
nitrate of uranium can be concentrated by fractionation to the basic
nitrate end, the nitrate at the other end being diminished in radio
activity.
   22. A highly active uranium nitrate, prepared by fractionation
from the part insoluble in ether, was dissolved in water, and ammonia
in excess was added. Yellow ammonium uranate was precipitated.

The     filtrate was evaporated to dryness, and heated with nitric acid.
The yellow precipitate and the residue of the filtrate were put into
cells, and laid on a sensitive plate.       After twenty-four hours' action
the plate was developed, when it was seen that the whole of the
radio-activity resided in the ammonium uranate, the other substance
showing nothing.         This experiment proves that the active body is
precipitated by ammonia, and is insoluble in excess.
    23. Another portion of active uranium nitrate was dissolved in
water, with an excess of ammonium carbonate.                The first formed
precipitate almost entirely re-dissolved, leaving a small quantity of
insoluble light brown flocculent precipitate.     This collected on warming,
like alumina.       It was filtered off, well washed and dried, and put in a
glass cell.
    The filtrate from the above precipitate was evaporated to drive
the ammonium         carbonate, when a yellow precipitate came down
This was filtered, washed, dried, and put into a cell.
    These precipitates were exposed for twenty-four hours in a lead
screen apparatus.       On developing, it was seen that the residue insoluble
in ammonium carbonate instantly flashed out black and dense, while
the salt precipitated from the ammonium carbonate solution gave a
scarcely discernible image.
    24. The action of the precipitate insoluble in ammonium carbonate
was so strong that another experiment was tried, exposing the sensitive
plate to its action for one hour.        On development, the disc of action
came out strong and black, although not so black as in the twenty-
 four hours' experiment. It was now laid for five minutes on a sensitive
plate.       Here the action was distinct — about as strong as that given
by ordinary uranium nitrate in twenty-four hours. These experiments
prove that the active body can exist apart from uranium.
    If a sheet of thin glass or celluloid is laid on a sensitive plate, and
the dried filter-paper with its contents laid on that, and kept down by
a weight, an impression is given in as short a space of time as if a glass
cell had been used.
    25.    The radio-active   body is not entirely insoluble in ammonium
carbonate.       A portion of the very active precipitate left after separa
tion from the uranium was dissolved in dilute hydrochloric acid, and
an excess of ammonium carbonate added.             The precipitate was very
brown due to the presence of iron ; it was dried and tested. The
filtrate was well boiled, and as the ammonium carbonate evaporated
a slight precipitate came down.          This was collected on a filter and
tested by the side of the first precipitate.        On developing the plate
the images produced by each precipitate were of about equal intensity.
The brown precipitate was digested in very dilute hydrochloric acid
in the cold.      The iron partially dissolved before the rest of the sub
stance, leaving the residue decidedly paler in colour.         This pale body

413                                  Sir W. Crookes.
was just as radio-active as before the partial removal of the iron.
Therefore the presence of iron does not interfere with the activity of
the substance.
   26. Having thus definitely proved that the supposed radio-activity
of uranium and its salts is not an inherent property of the element,
but is due to the presence of a foreign body,* it is necessary patiently
to determine the nature of the foreign body.      Several radio-active
bodies claimed to be new have already been extracted from pitch
blende, and experiments have been instituted to see if the newly found
body UrX had similar chemical properties to those of the older active
substances.

                               and over this     sheet of aluminium  a
foil, 0-05 mm. thick.  On this double layer were put two cells, one
containing basic polonium nitrate, the other active UrX.      Action
was allowed to proceed for twenty-four hours, and the plate was then
developed.      disc of blackening was seen under where the UrX
                 A
stood, the action having passed through the glass, celluloid, and
aluminium.       Under the polonium nitrate no trace of action could                             be
detected.
   The experiment was repeated, minus the aluminium foil, and the
action continued only two and  quarter hours. On development, the
                                                a
UrX      was found    to have acted well, while the polonium                      showed no
trace of action.

                           Radio-activity of Uranium,                             419
to the direct emanations from the polonium nitrate.                   On the top of
the plate was laid a sheet of lead to press it tight to the edges of the
watch-glass.
   The exposure was continued for twenty-eight hours. On develop
ing, a strong action was seen, strongest in the middle where opposed
to the thickest part of the heap of polonium nitrate, and weaker
towards the edge.         A well-marked action took place all over the
plate exposed to the interior of the watch-glass, but it was sharply
cut off at the edges.         This confirms the previous results — that the
emanations from polonium are of a different character to those from
radium or UrX, both of which pass through glass, aluminium, and
lead.
   29.   Another property of polonium sharply distinguishing it from
UrX     is volatility.     The discoverers first obtained it by subliming
pitchblende      in wctio. Afterwards they used this property to separate
it from bismuth, the polonium and              the bismuth     sulphides depositing
at different parts of the hot tube.
   A strongly        radio-active compound of UrX was ignited in a
blowpipe flame with the addition of a drop of sulphuric acid. Its
radio-activity, on a sensitive plate, was not diminished by this treat
ment.      This experiment was tried several times at increasingly higher
temperatures, and always with the same result.
   30. Polonium is precipitated by sulphuretted hydrogen, in an acid
solution.      An acid or neutral solution of UrX is not precipitated
by this reagent. Therefore I am justified in saying my UrX is not
polonium.
    31.  But it is not      so easy    to settle whether     UrX is distinct from
radium,      although many arguments point             to  its  not being radium.
The discoverers of radium give several of its chemical properties,
and in most of these UrX and Ra are entirely different. Thus,
radium sulphate is said to be insoluble in water and acids, while
UrX dissolves easily to a clear solution in dilute sulphuric acid.
Radium salts are said not to be precipitated by ammonium sulphide or
by ammonia, while UrX is precipitated by both.
    32.  It  was hoped that doubtful points might be settled conclusively
by the spectrum, as both radium and polonium give well-defined and
characteristic lines, especially in the ultra-violet part of the spectrum
where     I have chiefly worked. M. Demarcay* has given a list of some
of the principal lines in the radium spectrum between the wave-lengths
3649-6 to 4826 3, the one at 381 4 7 being very strong, and those
at 4683 0, 4340-6, and 3649 6 being next in intensity.                     He draws
special attention to the line at 3814-7 as the line showing first
in a compound poor in radium.             In none of my UrX compounds have
I been able to detect a trace of this line ; on the other hand I have

 failed   to photograph this line in products which I know contain
 radium.     The reason is my radium compound is too weak. M.
 Demarcay says the line is scarcely visible with a radium compound
 only sixty times as active as uranium.                 My substance containing
 radium was still weaker, judging from its action on a photographic
 plate.
     33. The same reasoning applies to polonium.                 With polonium        I
 have obtained strong lines in the ultra-violet, but          I can detect none of
 them in the spectrum of my compound of UrX.                    All  that  I  can see
 are lines belonging to —
                            Platinum (from     the poles),
                             Uranium,
                            Calcium,
                            Aluminium,
 and a few of the strongest air lines, besides a large number of faint lines
 difficult to identify.
     34. Spectrum experiments having failed to show a difference between
 radium and     UrX, it was thought that possibly        some   information might
 be gained    by submitting       them to the radiant matter test, which has
 proved so fruitful in its application to the yttrium earths.                    Some
 of the most active UrX was put in a tube furnished with a pair
 of   terminals,   and    it was exhausted to        a  high    point,  heat    being
applied     during exhaustion.        Simultaneously     a self-luminous radium
compound was sealed in a vacuum tube and exhausted, heat being
likewise applied.       "When fully exhausted a strong induction spark was
passed through      each   tube. The UrX compound phosphoresced of a
 fine blue colour.     In the spectroscope no discontinuity coidd be seen
in the spectrum of the phosphorescent light.
    Under the influence of the induction spark, the radium compound
phosphoresced of a luminous rose-colour, showing in the spectroscope
a concentration of light in the red-orange, and a very faint citron
band, due to a trace of yttrium, probably an impurity.
    35. A powerful radium compound and one of UrX, each in a glass
cell, and a paper tray full of polonium sub-nitrate, were placed side by
side, and a strip of white card was put as a reflector at the back.                In
front a photographic camera was arranged so as to throw full-sized
images of the polonium, UrX, and radium compounds on a sensitive
plate, and the whole was kept in total darkness for five days.                     On
development      the  image    of  the  radium   with  the  containing    bottle  was
visible, but not a trace of image from the polonium                 could be seen.
This confirms previous observations that the radiations from polonium
will not pass through glass.             Those from radium and UrX easily
penetrate glass and other media (28).
    36. Recently claims have been put forward             for the oxistence of a

                         Radio-activity of Uranium.                          421
 third radio-active body in pitchblende.       In the 1 Comptes Rendus ' for
 October 16, 1899, and April 2, 1900, M. A. Debierne describes a radio
 active body, to which he gives the name of "Actinium."                  At first
 he said " actinium
                      "
                         showed the principal analytical properties of tita
 nium, but later he describes it as not resembling titanium in all its reac
 tions.    M. Debierne gives many reactions of the new substance, and in
 some instances they are like those of radium.       But he qualifies them by
 the statement that they cannot yet be considered as belonging definitely
 to the new radio-active substance, because up to the present it has not
 been obtained sufficiently concentrated.       He believes rather that these
 reactions should be looked upon as the result of retention, analogous
to that of iron oxide by barium sulphate.          He says that the chemical
reactions of the most active substance which he obtained, together
 with its spectroscopic examination, showed that it chiefly consists of
thorium.      He cannot, however,      be sure that  it resembles thorium in
all its reactions.
    37. Experiments have been commenced to see if it is possible to
separate thorium compounds into an active and an inactive body.               A
strong solution of thorium sulphate was slightly acidulated with sul
phuric     acid, and gradually raised to the boiling point.         A    copious
precipitate of sulphate came down, and was filtered hot.              The pre
cipitate was dissolved in cold water, and the solution re-heated,
when a precipitation of the sulphate again occurred.            The mother-
liquor from one crystallisation was added to the crystals from another
in the systematic manner adopted in fractionation, and when the opera
                                                                          "
tions had proceeded some time a test was made on the " head and
" tail." A small
                     quantity of solution from each was evaporated to
dryness and strongly ignited before the blowpipe.           The two lots of
earth were put in cells and a sensitive plate exposed to their action
for seventy-two hours. On development not the slightest difference
could be detected between the impressions produced by either of the
fractions.
    I next tried partial  crystallisation  of thorium nitrate, fractionating
it in the way already described in the        case of uranium (15).       Great
difficulties were here encountered, owing to the tendency of a strong
solution of thorium nitrate to remain supersaturated for several days,
when     it would suddenly crystallise to a solid mass. After some
weeks, however, six fractionations were effected, and tests were made
on the first and last of the series.
    The sensitive plate was exposed to their action for 120 hours. On
development, the fraction at the first end (crystals) gave a very feeble
action, while that at the other end (mother-liquors) gave an impres
sion about three times as intense.         This points to the possibility of
separating from thorium its radio-active substance.

  nitrate by the ton, I have at my disposal some specially prepared
 thorium nitrate, which is chemically pure. Thoria prepared from this,
  tested on a sensitive plate, gave a feeble impression in 120 hours.
     38. In the present state of our knowledge of these radio-active
 bodies it is safest to retain an open, or even a slightly sceptical, mind.
  We recognise them mainly by the photographic and the electrical
 tests— reactions which are so sensitive that they give strong results,
 even when the active body is present in too small a quantity to
 be detected by its spectrum — one of the most delicate of tests.
 Knowing the tendency of ordinary chemical bodies to be carried down
 when a precipitate is formed in their presence, even when no question
 of sparse solubility is involved, it is not surprising that radium and
 actinium, to say nothing of UrX, appear to simulate elements which
 may ultimately prove to be very different from them in chemical
 characters.    For instance, UrX dissolves easily in dilute sulphuric
acid, and,    I  have reason to believe, forms a soluble sulphate ; still,
 when chloride of barium is mixed with it and precipitated as a
 sulphate, I invariably find strong radio-activity in the precipitated
sulphate as well as in the filtrate from the barium sulphate.
    To adduce    a simile from   my previous researches, the first surmises
 as to the chemical characteristics of the bodies now   known to be yttrium
 and samarium, were widely different from reality.            The differences
 were entirely due to the perturbing cause which is active in the
present case — the tendency of the bodies to be carried down and
entangled in precipitates, where, according to ordinary chemical laws,
they ought not to occur ; and to the extreme delicacy of the radiant
matter test, which in the case of samarium detects one part in 2§ million
parts of calcium, and in the case of yttrium detects one part in the
presence   of a million parts of extraneous matter.
    39. The   radiographic test for these active bodies presents another
point to be borne in mind. Other tests for the presence of an element
either act quickly, or do not act at all, with a comparatively narrow
 margin of debateable land where the indications of the test may be
doubtful.      Here, however, the test is cumulative.    Like an astronomer
photographing     stars  too faint for his telescope to disclose, he has only
to expose the plate for a sufficiently long time and the star reveals
itself on development.       So, in the case of radio-active minerals or
precipitates, if no action is apparent at the end of an hour, one may
be shown     after twenty-four hours.       If a day's exposure will show
nothing, try    a  week's.   Considering my most active UrX does not
contain sufficient of the real material to show in the spectrograph,
yet is powerful enough to give a good impression on a photographic
plate in five minutes, what must be its dilution in compounds which
require an hour, a day, or a week to give an action 1

   Honoured President, my lords and gentlemen, — It is to me the very
greatest honour that I have been summoned here by your most highly
esteemed Society, which for more than two centuries has represented
and still represents the centre of the scientific life of England, in
order that I may deliver the Croonian Lecture.             I consider I am not so
much personally concerned in the honour that you bestow on me, and
that I shall not err if I see in it a recognition of the scientific path
which I, in company with many others, have sought to follow, and
which in your eyes suflices to place the field in which I work on a
footing alongside of exact science.          It is an extreme pleasure for me
to have the privilege of addressing so many medical colleagues with
whom for so many years I have been bound in close ties of friendship,
and who have always been the first to welcome and to give recognition
to the results of my work.
   Since Jenner made his great discovery of the protective action of
vaccinia against small-pox, a century has passed away.              During these
years that terrible scourge of mankind has been almost completely
eradicated from      the civilised   world.     The beneficial consequences of
Jenner's discovery are so evident to all who have any wish to properly
appreciate them, that one wonders why, during so great a portion of
the long period of 100 years, they were allowed to stand alone, with
out any endeavour being made to induce an artificial immunity in
the case of other infectious diseases.         This is all the more remarkable
because Jenner's discovery demonstrated in their entirety those essential
principles which, in later times, have been established for other infec
tious diseases.
   In the first    place, it was shown that by the          use of an attenuated
virus,   which of itself     was   non-injurious     to   the organism, it was
possible   to ward off       the   disease    caused    by the virulent virus.
Jenner also established — what is most important from the practical
point of view — that by the inoculation of the weakened poison
there was produced not only an immediate, but also an enduring,
protection.     That Jenner's discovery remained so isolated was due
essentially to the fact that the theoretical conceptions of the cause
and nature of infectious diseases made no advance during the sub
sequent decades ; indeed, it would be an interesting topic for some
historian of medicine to trace step by step the gradual advance in the

            Ore Immunity tvith Special Reference     to Cell   Life.       425
knowledge of infectious diseases during the past century.           Schwann's
classical investigations   must   be  regarded as the  first link  in the long
chain.    Schwann it was who, in an unsually brilliant manner, first
demonstrated that the decomposition of organic bodies in the processes
¦of fermentation    and putrefaction     was never spontaneous, but con
stantly arose through the agency of micro-organisms coming from
without.    This line of investigation reached its zenith in the fundamen
tal work of Pasteur, of which the first and the greatest result — Lister's
method of wound treatment — worked a revolution in surgery.               Then
followed the profound investigations of Koch on Anthrax, and the
pure cultivation of the most important pathogenic bacteria.
   The work of Pasteur and of Koch afforded the first basis on which the
study of artificial immunity could be again undertaken.        The possibility
of voluntarily producing a number of the most important infectious
diseases of men and animals, and of modifying at will pure cultiva
tions of bacteria, either, according to Jenner's precedent, by passage
through the animal body, or otherwise in artificial culture media,
laid the foundation on which advancement could proceed. Pasteur
himself was the first, after Jenner, to produce an artificial immunity
by using   an   attenuated virus   ; and he was also able to introduce the
procedure to some       extent into practice with most beneficial results.
Still the theoretical    explanations of all these facts lagged far behind
their practical effects. The very able investigations of Metchnikoff and
his theory of phagocytosis were, to many investigators, inconclusive.
   With Bebring's discovery, that in the blood serum of animals immu
nised against diphtheria and tetanus, there were contained bodies which
were able to specifically protect other animals against the toxines of
these diseases,    an altogether new factor was introduced into the
question.    This remarkable discovery seemed at one stroke to open
up an entirely new and extremely promising prospect of immunising
mankind against the majority of the infectious diseases.                It was,
therefore, somewhat disappointing when there did not follow, on the
successful practical application of diphtheria antitoxic serum, a rapid
succession of similar achievements.       It may with truth be Baid, that
during recent years there has been somewhat of a standstill in the
further following-out of a work at first so enthusiastically received.
By purely empirical methods, e.g., by the production and use of sera of
very great antitoxic value, the results attained showed no improve
ment. Better success was only to be hoped for when by an accurate
knowledge of the theoretical considerations underlying the question
of immunity, explanations of the previous ill-success were forthcoming.
Impelled   by these considerations I laboured for years trying to shed
some light into the darkness that shrouded the subject.
   In all exact work with chemical bodies — for only as such can we
regard   the toxines produced by the living bacteria — the first desider
                                                                2 K 2

atum     in the investigation     is the oxact numerical determination of
action and       counteraction.     The words of the gifted natural philo
sopher Clerk Maxwell, who said that if he were required to symbolise
the learning of our time he would choose a metre measure, a clock,
and a kilogramme           weight, are equally apposite in reference to
progress in the field of inquiry in which we are at present in
terested.      And   so at the very beginning      of my theoretical work on
immunity I made it my first task to introduce measures and figures into
investigations regarding the relations existing between toxine and anti-
 toxine.     From the outset it was clear that the difficulties to be over
 come were extremely great.           The toxines, i.e., the poisonous products
 of bacteria, are unknown in a pure condition.                 So great is their
 potency,    that  we  are  obliged  to assume   that  the  strongest  solid (feste)
 poisons which are obtained by precipitating toxic bouillon with ammo
 nium sulphate, represent nothing more than indifferent materials, pep
 tones and the like, to which the specific toxine attaches itself in mere
 traces beyond the reach of weighing ; for up to the present time, by
 the purely chemical methods of weighing and measuring, it has been
 impossible to ascertain anything         as to their presence     or the intensity
 of their action.
     Their presence is only betrayed by the proof of their specific toxicity
 on the organism.       For the exact determination, e.g., of the amount of
 toxine contained in a culture fluid, the essential condition was that the
 research animals used should exhibit the requisite uniformity in their
 susceptibility to the poison.       Uniformity is not to l)e observed in the
 reaction of the animal body to all toxines.          Fortunately in the case of
 one important body of this nature, viz., the diphtheria toxine, the con
 ditions are such that the guinea-pig affords for investigations the degree
 of accuracy necessary in purely chemical work.            For other toxines this
 accuracy     in measuring the toxicity cannot            be   attained.    It  was
  necessary    for me to try to eliminate, as far        as possible, the   varying
 factor of   the  animal  body,  and  bring the investigations more nearly into
  line with the conditions necessary for experiments of a chemical nature.
  In the course of these endeavours it was shown that it was possible to
  obtain in a comparatively simple manner an insight into the theo
 retical   considerations necessary to a proper understanding of immu
  nity, by means of test-tube experiments with .suspended animal
  tissues. The relations were simplest in the case of red blood cor
  puscles. On them, outside the body, the action of many blood poisons,
  and of their antitoxines, can be most accurately studied, e.g., the actions
 of ricin, eel-serum, snake-poison, tetanus toxine, &c. In an experiment
 of this kind, in which are employed a series of test-tubes containing
  definite quantities of suspended blood corpuscles, each test-tube repre
  sents   as it were a research animal, uniform in any one series, and one
  that can be reproduced at will. By means of these test-tube oxperi

            On  Immunity with Special Reference           to Cell  Life.        427
ments, particularly in the case of ricin, I was able, in the first place, to
determine that they yielded an exact quantitative representation of the
course of the processes in the living body.          The demonstration of this
fact formed the basis of a more extended application of experiments of
this nature.     It was shown that the action of toxine and antitoxine
took place quantitatively as in the animal body.                   Further, these
experiments yielded a striking series of facts of importance for the
theoretical valuation of the reaction between toxine and antitoxine.
It was proved in the case of certain toxines — notably tetanus
toxine — that the action of antitoxines is accentuated or diminished
under    the influence of the same        factors which bring about similar
modifications in chemical processes       — warmth     accelerates, cold retards
the reaction, and this proceeds more rapidly in concentrated than in
dilute solutions.     These facts, first ascertained by means of test-tube
experiments, have since been confirmed by Behring and Knorr for
tetanus within the animal body, and by Martin and Cherry in the
case of snake-venom.*         The knowledge thus gained led easily to the
inference that to render toxine innocuous by means of antitoxine was
a purely chemical process, in which biological processes had no share.
Yet again insurmountable obstacles seemed to present themselves to
this conclusion.
    It must be postulated that in chemical processes the bodies sharing in
the action react with one another in definite equivalent quantities.
This proposition appeared, however, not to hold in the case of the
action of antitoxine on diphtheria toxine.              When, in the case of
diphtheria toxines of different stocks, that quantity of toxine bouillon
which is exactly neutralised by a certain definite quantity of diphtheria
antitoxine (the official German immunity Tuiit, as laid down for the
control examination of sera), was determined, so that every trace of
toxic action was abolished, the figures obtained were not in aecord.
Of one toxine bouillon 0-2 c.c, of another 2-5 c.c, were so neutralised
by one immunity unit. Such a relation need not have given rise to
surprise,   because it was well known that the diphtheria                  bacillus,
according to outside circumstances, yields in the bouillon very dif
ferent quantities of toxine.          It was therefore allowable to infer
that the different quantities of toxine bouillon, which were saturated
by one immunity unit, were exact expressions of the toxicities of the
various   bouillons, or, to use other words, indifferently whether the
bouillon was strongly or feebly toxic, the same multiple of the minimal
lethal dose would be constantly neutralised by one immunity unit,
   * Note during revision. — The credit of first drawing attention to these points
belongs to Professor Fraser, who, as far back as 1896, carried out extraordinarily
precise experiments on the conditions of neutralisation in respect both of time and
of amount of snake-poison   and anti-venin  (Lecture, Royal Institution, March 20,
 1896).

so  that in every    case the law of equivalent   proportions   would hold
good.
   But when looked into more closely, the relations showed themselves
to be by no means so simple.         In what manner could one obtain a
satisfactory estimation    of the strength of a toxine ? As the constant
factor in such an estimation, it was only possible to proceed from a
previously determined standard reaction in the case of a definite
                                                         " toxic unit " that
species of animal, and so we came to regard as the
quantity of toxic bouillon which exactly sufficed to kill, in the course of
four days, a guinea-pig of 250 grammes weight.
   When we employed this standard unit, or " simple lethal dose," to-
estimate the amount of toxic bouillon neutralised by one " immunity
unit," the facts which presented themselves were far more surprising
than it was possible to have foreseen at the outset. These results
were, that of one toxine, perhaps 20, of a second, perhaps 50, and of
yet a third, it might be 130 simple lethal doses were saturated by one
immunity unit.      Since, however, we had previously assumed that the
simple lethal dose alone afforded a standard on which reliance could be
placed in determining the combining relations of toxine and antitoxine,
it appeared from these results that the neutralisation of toxines by
antitoxines did not follow the law of equivalent proportions, and,
 notwithstanding all earlier work in agreement with such a conception
of the action, we were obliged to conclude that between toxine and
antitoxine a purely chemical affinity did not exist. The seemingly
inexplicable contradiction between the results just stated and previous
work   was very soon explained.    When the neutralisation point of toxine
and antitoxine was investigated for one and the same sample of poison,
the following results were obtained.      Immediately on its preparation,
fresh from the incubator, it was found that one immunity unit neu
tralised a c.c. of toxic bouillon, and this quantity represented /3 simple
lethal doses.   When the same toxic bouillon was examined after a con
siderable interval, the remarkable fact was discovered that exactly
a c.c. of the toxic bouillon were again neutralised by one immunity unit -r
but that these a c.c. now represented only f3 -x simple lethal doses. It
therefore followed     that the toxic bouillon had retained exactly the
same combining affinity, but possessed feebler toxicity.      From this it
was evident that the toxic action on animals and the combining
capacity with antitoxine represented two different functions of the
toxine, and that the former of these had become weakened, while the
latter had remained constant.
   Treated from the chemical standpoint, this circumstance was most
simply explained by assuming that the toxine was characterised by
the possession of two different combining groups : one, which may be
designated hqitophore, conditions the union with antitoxine, while the
other group, which may be designated toxophm; is the cause of the

              On Immunity with Special Reference      to Cell  Life.       429
toxic action.      From the constancy of the combining capacity, and the
diminution in the toxicity, it was to be inferred that the toxophore group
was very unstable, but the haptophore group more stable, and also that
the deterioration of the toxophore group proceeded of necessity quits
independently of any relation to the haptophore group.
    If we now designated a toxine molecule, of which the toxophore
                                                                     " toxoid,"
group is destroyed, but its haptophore group retained, as
then the above-described process will represent the quantitative pro
gress of the conversion of the toxine molecules into toxoid molecules.
Such a toxoid molecule has the same quantitative combining affinity
for antitoxine as the original toxine molecule, in spite of the disappear
ance of toxicity to the animal body.          In other words, the affinity of
the haptophore group for the antitoxine is absolutely independent of
the existence of a toxophore group.        Also, in the original toxine mole-
culo, both groups must be to such a degree non-related or independent
of one another, that a mutual reaction between them does not take
place.     This conception of the constitution of diphtheria toxine, after
more extensive, very exact, and much varied experimentation, based
on its  partial neutralisation by antitoxine, has been confirmed in the com-
pletest manner possible. At this time it would be superfluous for me
to enter into all the details pertaining to these investigations.       It need
only be remarked that in principle the same relations have been
established for tetanolysine by Madsen, for snake-poison by Meyers,
and for the milk-curdling ferment by Morgenroth.
    The separation of the characteristic atom groups of the toxine mole
 cule into a haptophore and a toxophore group, afforded not merely a
satisfactory chemical explanation of the process of neutralisation : the
 possession of the knowledge of the existence of these groups yielded us,
 at the same time, the key to the nature of the toxic property of
 toxines, and to the mystery of the origin of the antitoxines them
 selves.     After it had been established by the already described method,
 that the toxine molecule was possessed of a definite haptophore group,
 which accounted for its capacity to enter into combination with other
 bodies,    it was immediately necessary to inquire into the question
 whether, and if so to what degree, this group entered into the causa
 tion of the symptoms of illness.        That chemical substances are only
 able   to exercise an action on the tissue elements with which they are
 able to establish an intimate chemical relationship is a conception of a
 general nature, which has been entertained since the birth of scientific
 medicine.
     It  is astonishing, almost astounding, that this axiom, of which the
 theoretical importance has been so long recognised, and which has
 served indeed as the first ground for certain therapeutical procedures,
 should as a matter of fact have played in the building up and furtherance
  of scientific pharmacology a role so insignificant in proportion to its great

430                           Dr. Paul Ehrlich.
importance.      In glancing through the modern text-books of pharma
cology,  with   rare exceptions, as, e.g., Stokvis, one finds absolutely no
mention of the distribution of drugs in the organism, a matter which
is of so much moment for arriving at a true comprehension of the
relations existing between pharmacological action, location in the
organism, and chemical constitution.           As a matter of fact, the
methods for obtaining any knowledge of the exact distribution of
drugs in the body are as yet very imperfect.          Even if we can prove
that certain alkaloids are again recognisable as being, e.g., present in
the brain, we are but little further advanced in our knowledge of
the process, because we cannot determine in which cells and which
system of fibres the alkaloid is localised.
   I may say, indeed, that as yet the investigation of the laws pertain
ing to the minute distribution of a- chemical substance in the body is
only possible when, as in the case of coloured bodies, these are at once
recognisable by the eye.      But that it is possible at once to draw con
clusions of therapeutic importance from the laws governing the distri
bution was shown in the case of methylene-blue, in which I was able,
knowing its distribution in the body, to anticipate for it certain anti-
neuralgic and antimalarial properties which were both established by
subsequent investigation.      It may be permitted me to call to mind,
that in malaria methylene-blue is especially of service in the case
of persons who, on account of susceptibility, cannot be treated with
quinine, and that in the hands of Koch it has shown itself of eminent
value in haemoglobinuric fever, since as opposed to quinine it exercises
no destructive action on the erythrocytes.         If we are not able to dis
cover the principles governing the localisation of common chemical
bodies, which can be used in suitable quantities in chemical purity,
and which     chemical and other reactions render perceptible, it was <l
priori very unlikely that efforts directed to locating the toxines, which
are potent in the slightest traces, and which are bodies we have no
means of rendering perceptible to our senses, would be anything else
than absolutely without result.
   But that this is not so, has been shown by experiments carried out by
Professor Donitz, in the Steglitz Institute, to which, on account of their
great importance, I shall refer somewhat extensively.         When a rabbit
receives  a suitable dose  of diphtheria  or tetanus  toxine injected directly
into the circulation, the animal remains for many hours well, and
then begins to show symptoms of illness, which gradually increase till
they end in death. In order to arrive at an explanation of the incu
bation period,     Donitz determined the amount of antitoxine          which,
injected intravenously immediately after the toxine, absolutely neu
tralised the latter.    This neutralising dose is able to render all the
toxine circulating in the blood innocuous.             When, however, the
neutralising dose so determined was injected not immediately, but

             On   Immunity with Special Reference        to   Cell Life.     431
seven or eight minutes after the injection of the toxine, death occurred
from tetanus exactly as if no antitoxine had been given.     Part of the
toxine, equal at least to the minimal lethal dose, must within this time
have disappeared from the blood, in which it would have been neu
tralised, and passed over to the tissues, especially to the brain. The
experiments of Ddnitz were afterwards confirmed by an investigation
conducted in quite a different manner by Heymans, who showed that
a research animal from which the blood had been removed imme
diately after the injection of the minimal lethal dose of tetanus toxine,
and replaced by transfusion of fresh blood, succumbed from typical
tetanus.     In this    case,   therefore, in that brief interval     of time the
minimal      lethal   of toxine had passed
                      dose                           through    the walls of the
vessels and been taken up by the tissues.
  Regarding  the nature of the processes here concerned, a satisfactory
explanation was also afforded by the experiments of Donitz. It ad
mitted of demonstration that the toxine held in the tissues could still
be withdrawn from them, if not the simple neutralising     dose were
injected but larger quantities of the same.
   The quantity necessary was greater in proportion as the interval
elapsing after the injection of the toxine was longer. However, after
a definiteperiod was exceeded, all possible doses of antitoxine, even
the very greatest, were impotent, notwithstanding that the animal at
the time of the injection of the antitoxine had not developed any
symptoms.     Since a very great number of other chemical substances,
narcotics, alkaloids, and other neurotropic bodies, were not in a posi
tion to withdraw the toxine once deposited in the central nervous
system, and as the property to do so was solely the characteristic of
the specific antitoxine, one was obliged to come to the conclusion that
the union      between the toxine and the tissues, which           could only be
overcome by means of a specific chemically-related antagonising agent,
must itself depend on a chemical combination.       One was therefore
forced to accept the idea that the central nervous system, that is to
say certain ganglion cells in          it,
                                  possessed atom groups resembling
those of the antitoxine, in having      maximum affinity for tetanus
                                             a
poison.  The predilection of the nervous system for tetanus toxine,
the rapid union of the toxine with the nervous tissue, the gradual
onset of the symptoms and their long duration could only be explained
by the existence of such toxophil groups.   The statement of Donitz
that the tetanophile atom groups are in the guinea-pig essentially con
fined to the central nervous system, whereas in the case of other
species, especially rabbits, these are also present in other organs, one   is
of prominent importance.
   The beautiful experiments          of Roux on intracerebral    injection of
toxine have yielded absolute confirmation          of the statement of Donitz.
Roux found in guinea-pigs that the           same close of tetanus toxine was

432                           Dr. Paul Ehrlich.
lethal, whether given by intracerebral or by subcutaneous injection ;
for rabbits, however, the lethal dose was twenty times greater sub-
cutaneously than it was in intracerebral injection.       This can only be
explained in the terms of Donitz's observation, viz., that in the case
of direct injection of the toxine into the brain, the toxophile atom
groups there present at once seize on all the toxine, while when the
toxine is administered through the blood stream, the toxophile groups
present in other organs also take up the toxine in equivalent quanti
ties. In the case of rabbits the absorption of the toxine in this way
is very considerable : indeed of twenty parts only one part finds its
way into union with the nervous system.
      We now come to the important question of the significance of the
toxophile groups in organs.         That these are in function specially
designed to seize on toxines cannot be for one moment entertained.
 It would not be reasonable to suppose that there were present in
the organism many hundreds of atomic groups destined to unite with
toxines, when the latter appeared, but in function really playing no
 part in the processes of normal life, and only arbitrarily brought into
 relation with them by the will of the investigator.       It would indeed
 be highly superfluous, for example, for all our native animals to possess
 in their tissues atomic groups deliberately adapted to unite with abrin,
 ricin, and crotin, substances coming from the far distant tropics.
      One may therefore rightly assume that these toxophile protoplasmic
 groups in reality serve normal functions in the animal organism, and
 that they only incidentally and by pure chance possess the capacity
 to anchor themselves to this or that toxine.
      The first thought suggested by this assumption was that the atom
 groups referred to must be concerned in tissue change ; and it may be
 well here to sketch roughly the laws of cell metabolism.          Here we
 must in the first place draw a clear line of distinction between those
 substances which are able to enter into the composition of the proto
 plasm, and so are really assimilated, and those which have no such
 capacity.     To the first class belong a portion of the food-stuffs par
 excellence ; to the second almost all our pharmacological agents, alkaloids,
 antipyretics, antiseptics, &c.
      How is it possible to determine whether any given substance will
  l>e assimilated   in the body or not 1      There can be no doubt that
 assimilation is in a special sense a synthetic process — that is to say,
  the molecule of the food-stuff' concerned enters into combination with
  the protoplasm by a process of condensation involving loss of a portion
  of its water.    To take the example of sugar, in the union with proto
  plasm, not sugar itself as such but a portion of it comes into play, the
  sugar losing in the union some part of its characteristic combining
  reactions.    The sugar behaves here as it does, e.g., in the gluco-
   sides, from    which  it can  only  be obtained  through   the agency    of

              On Immunity \eith Special Reference to Cell Life.                  433
 actual   chemical cleavage.          The glucoside itself yields no trace of
 sugar   when     extracted    in  indifferent    solvents.    In a quite analogous
 manner the sugar entering into the constitution                      of albuminous
 bodies    (glycoproteids)      cannot be obtained by any method of ex
 traction ; at least, not until chemical decomposition has previously
 taken place.      It is therefore generally easy, by means of extraction
 experiments, to decide whether any given combination in which cells
 take part is or is not a synthetic one.             If alkaloids, aromatic amines,
 antipyretics,    or  aniline   dyes  be  introduced     into the animal body it is
 a very easy matter, by means of water, alcohol, or acetone, according
 to the nature of the body, to remove all these substances quickly and
 easily from the tissues.        This is most simply and convincingly demon
 strated in the case of the aniline dyes. The nervous system stained
 with methylene blue, or the granules of cells stained with neutral red,
 at once yield up the dye in the presence of alcohol.               We are therefore
 obliged   to  conclude     that  none    of  the  foreign   bodies  just mentioned
 enter synthetically into the cell complex ; but are merely contained in
 the cells in their' free state.       The combinations into which they enter
 with the cells, and notably with the not really living parts of them
 (Kupffer's paraplastic portions), are very unstable, and correspond
 usually only to the conditions obtaining in solid solutions, while
in other cases only a feeble 3alt-like formation takes place.               I myself
in 1887 placed on a sure footing the fact that the nervous system and
the fatty tissues allow of alkaloids and aniline dyes being mechani
cally shaken out of them, as in the poison-detection                 process of Stas
and Otto.
    Hence with regard to the pharmacologically active bodies in general,
it was not allowable to assume that they possessed definite atom
groups, which entered into combination with corresponding groups
of the protoplasm.           This corresponds, as I may remark beforehand,
with the incapacity of all these substances to produce antitoxines in
the animal body.           We must therefore conclude, that only certain
substances,     food-stuff's   par excellence, are endowed with properties
admitting of their being, in the previously defined sense, chemi
cally bound by the cells of the organism. We may regard the cell
quite apart from its familiar morphological aspects, and contemplate
its constitution from the purely chemical standpoint.                We are obliged
to adopt the view, that the protoplasm is equipped with certain atomic
groups, whose function especially consists in fixing to themselves certain
food-stuffs, of importance to the cell-life.           Adopting the nomenclature
of organic chemistry, these groups may be designated side-chains.
We may       assume that the protoplasm consists of a special executive
centre    (Leistungs-centrum)        in connection with which are nutritive
side-chains, which possess a certain degree of independence, and which
may differ from one another according to the requirements of the

434                                  Dr. Paul Ehrlich.
different cells.        And     as these side-chains have the office of attaching    to
themselves certain food-stuffs, we must also assume           an atom-grouping
in   these food-stuff's     themselves, every group uniting with a correspond
ing combining           group of a side-chain.   The relationship of the corre
sponding groups, i.e., those of the food-stuff, and those of the cell, must
be specific. They must be adapted to one another, as, e.g., male and
female screw (Pasteur), or as lock and key (E. Fischer).        From this
point of view, we must contemplate                the   relation   of the toxine to the
cell.
     We have already shown that             the toxines possess     for the antitoxines
an attaching haptophore group, which accords entirely in its nature
with the conditions we have ascribed to the relation existing between
the food-stuffs         and the cell side-chains.     And the relation between
toxine        and cell ceases to be       shrouded in mystery if we adopt the
view that the haptophore groups of the toxines are molecular groups,
fitted to unite not only with the antitoxines but also with the side-
chains of the cells, and that it is by their agency that the toxine
becomes        anchored to the cell.
   We do not, however, require to suppose that the side-chains, which
fit with the haptophore groups of the toxines, i.e., the side-chains
which are toxophile, represent something having no function in the
normal cell economy.     On the contrary, there is sufficient evidence
that the toxophile side-chains are the same as those which have to do
with the taking up of the food-stuffs by the protoplasm.   The toxines
are,        in opposition to other poisons, of highly complex structure,
standing        in their origin and chemical constitution in very close rela
tionship to the proteids and their nearest derivatives. It therefore,       is,
not surprising    they possess
                      if        haptophore group corresponding to that
                                        a
of   afood-stuff.  Alongside of the binding haptophore group, which
conditions their union  to the protoplasm, the toxines are possessed of
a                which, in regard to the cell,
     second group,                                 not only useless but
                                                              is
actually injurious.   And we remember that in the case of the
diphtheria  toxine  there  was reason to believe that there existed
alongside of the haptophore group another and absolutely independent
toxophore group.
   Now for certain cellular elements of the body       can be proved in
                                                                   it
the test-tube that between these tissues and certain toxines an "anchor
        "             takes place exactly similar to that between toxine and
ing         process
antitoxine.           Wassermann first demonstrated this in the case of the
brain substance.           In   a   mixture of tetanus toxine and broken-down
fresh guinea-pig brain the latter so bound or
                                                 " anchored the toxine      "
that not only was the surrounding fluid toxine-free, but the brain sub
stance laden with the tetanus toxine had also lost its own toxic action,
and so the mixture when injected into an animal was borne without
any harm.

      The deduction             is,   that in this case,   a   chemical union between the
    brain substance and the tetanus toxine had taken place, and this was
    of so firm   nature that on introduction into the body the union was
                  a
    not broken up and therefore the toxine remained innocuous. The brain
    of the normal animal had, in keeping with my theory, acted exactly
    like real antitoxine.
        a                   There are present in the brain, i.e., in the
    ganglion cells, tetanophile protoplasmic groups, which unite themselves
    with the toxine. The presence of such groups          the necessary pre
                                                                        is
    liminary and cause of the poisonous action of the tetanus toxine in the
    living animal. That the process here was not one of simple absorp
    tion is proved by the fact that,   the group concerned was destroyed
                                                  if
    by heat, the brain substance became as incapable of removing                                   the
    toxine as an emulsion of any other organ of the guinea-pig.
      As    has been said, the possession of
                                         toxophile group by the cell
                                                       a               the                    is
    necessary preliminary and cause of the poisonous action of the toxine.
    This can be most sharply demonstrated in the case of certain blood
    poisons, viz., the haimolysines, which exercise solvent action onlya
    on such red blood corpuscles as are able to unite chemically with
    them. The union with the red corpuscles can be proved, and one
    has here the great advantage of dealing with living and intact red
    blood     cells instead of broken-down                 cellular   material.      Under     these
    conditions        it   is   easy    to determine   the quantitative           relations   of the
    union.       If   we now regard the action of the toxines with which we are
    concerned in accordance with the views we have just been discussing,
    we are obliged to conclude that these are only in a position to act
    prejudicially cn the organism  they are able, by means of their hapto-

    phore groups, to anchor themselves to the side-chains of the cells of
    organs essential to life.   the cells of these organs lack side-chains
                                            If
    fitted to unite with them, the toxophore group cannot become fixed
¦
    to the cell, which therefore suffers no injury, i.e., the organism                               is
    naturally immune.    One of the most important forms of natural im
    munity       is    upon the circumstance, that in certain animals the
                      based
    organs essential to life are lacking in those haptophore groups which
    seize upon definite toxines.   If, for example, the ptomaine occurring in
    sausages,          for man, monkeys, and rabbits
                      which                                 toxic in exces   is
    sively minute doses,    for the dog harmless in quite large quantities,
                                       is
    this     because, the binding haptophore groups being wanting, the
            is
    ptomaine cannot, in the dog, enter into direct relation with organs
    essential to life.    We see, then, that the haptophore groups act
    especially in bringing definite areas of the cell within the sphere of
    influence of the toxophore group.                  In the behaviour of the haptophore
     and toxophore groups there exists   difference essentially great, as we
                                                       a
     have already pointed out when referring to the work of Donitz and
     Heymans.     The haptophore group exercises its activity immediately
     after injection into the organism, while in all toxines — with the, perhaps,

 436                            Dr. Paul Ehrlich.
 solitary exception of snake-venom — the toxophore group comes into
 activity after the lapse of a longer or shorter incubation period,
 which may, e.g., in the case of diphtheria toxine, extend to several
 weeks.   It is in the highest degree interesting that it is possible, by
 voluntarily influencing   certain    of the outside        conditions,   to exclude
 absolutely the action of the toxophore group.      Courmont has shown
 that frogs, when kept at a temperature lower than 20° C, manifest no
 sign of tetanus, even after very large doses of tetanus toxine, but they
 succumb to fatal tetanus   if they          in surroundings of a higher
                                          are placed
 temperature.   Dr. Morgenroth, working in my Institute, has thrown
 light on this behaviour   by proving that in frogs maintained in cold
 surroundings the tetanus toxine is fixed in their central nervous
 system, and that the absence of action at lower temperatures can only
be explained by the toxophore group of tetanus toxine having its
action restricted within a certain temperature minimum, while inde
pendent of this the haptophore group exercises its action on the
nervous system at all temperatures.
   The theory above developed allows of an easy and natural ex
planation of the origin of antitoxines.     In keeping with what has
already been said, the first stage in the toxic action must be regarded
as being the union      of the toxine by means         of its haptophore group
to certain "side-chains" of the cell protoplasm.       This union      as      is,
animal experiments with     agreat number of toxines show, a firm and
enduring  one.   The  side-chain  involved, so long as the union lasts,
cannot exercise its normal physiological nutritive function — the taking
up of definite food-stuffs.  It     as
                                     is    were shut out from participat
                                             it
ing, in the physiological sense, in  the life of the cell. We are there
fore now concerned with a defect which, according to the principles so
ably worked out by Professor Carl Weigert,             is
                                                 repaired by regenera
tion. These principles, in fact, constitute the leading conception in
my theory.  If, after union has taken place, new quantities of toxine
are administered   at suitable intervals and in suitable quantities, the
side-chains, which have been reproduced by the regenerative process,
are taken up anew into union with the toxine, and so again the process
of regeneration gives rise to the formation of fresh side-chains.     In
the course of the progress of typical systematic immunisation, as this               is
practised in the case of diphtheria and tetanus toxine especially, the
cells become, so to say, educated or trained to reproduce the necessary
side-chains in ever-increasing quantity. As Weigert has confirmed by
many examples, this, however, does not take place as     simple replace
                                                                 a

sary limit indeed, over-compensation
         ;                               the rule. Thus the lasting and
                                              is
ever-increasing regeneration must finally reach    stage at which such

and are, after the manner of a secretion, handed over                  as  needless
ballast to the blood.
   Regarded in accordance with this conception, the antitoxines represent
nothing more than side-chains reproduced in excess during regeneration,
awl therefore puslied off from the protoplasm-, and so coming to exist in a free
state.    With this explanation the phenomena of antitoxine formation
lose   all their strange, one might say miraculous, characters. I have
deemed it advisable to represent by means of some purely arbitrary
diagrams (Plates 6 and 7) the views I have expressed regarding the
relations of the cell considered in the manner I have been describing.
Needless to say, these diagrams must be regarded quite apart from
all morphological       considerations, and as being merely a pictorial
method of presenting my views on cellular metabolism, and the
method of toxine        action and antitoxine     formation during the process
of immunisation.
    In the first place our theory affords       an   explanation of the specific
nature of the antitoxines, that tetanus antitoxine is only caused to be
produced by tetanus toxine, and diphtheria antitoxine through diph
theria toxine.       This very specific nature of the affinity between
toxine and cell is the necessary             preliminary and cause of the
toxicity itself.    Further, our theory makes it easy to understand the
long-lasting     character of the immunity produced by one or several
administrations      of   toxine,  and   also   the    fact that the organism
reacts to relatively small quantities of toxine by the production
of very much greater quantities of antitoxine.              By the act of immu
nisation, certain cells of the organism become converted into cells
"secreting" antitoxine        at the same     rate as this is excreted.       New
quantities of antitoxine        are constantly produced, and so through
out a long period the antitoxine        content of the serum remains nearly
 constant.    The secretory nature of the formation of antitoxines              has
been     very strikingly illustrated by the beautiful              experiments    of
Salmonson      and Madsen,      who   have shown        that  pilocarpine,   which
augments the secretion of most glands, also occasions in immunised
animals a rapid increase in the antitoxine content of the serum.
    The production of antitoxines must, in keeping with our theory, be
regarded as a function of the haptophore group of the toxine, and it
is   therefore easy to understand why, out of the great number of
alkaloids, none are in a position to cause the production of antitoxines.
Conversely, indeed, I recognise in this incapacity of the alkaloids, in
opposition to the toxines, to produce antitoxines,                  a further and
salient proof of the truth of the deduction I have previously based on
chemical grounds, that the alkaloids possess no haptophore group which
anchors them to the cells of organs. To formulate a general statement,
 the capacity of a body to cause the production of antitoxine stands in
inseparable     connection with the presence of a haptophore atomic

438                            Dr. Paul Ehrlich.
group.    In the formation of antitoxine the toxophore group of the
toxine molecule     is,
                      on the contrary, of absolutely no moment.     But
the toxoid modifications of the toxines, in which the haptophore
group of the toxine      retained, while its toxophore group has ceased
                          is
to be active, possess the property of producing antitoxines.
   Indeed, in some cases of extremely susceptible animals, immunity
can only be attained by means of the toxoids, and not by the too
strongly acting toxines. The toxoids are certainly able to cause the
production of antitoxines.   To quote an example,         hardly possible
                                                         it   is
in an animal, which, like the guinea-pig, has all the tetanophile groups
confined to the cells of the central nervous system, to produce im
munity by means of the unaltered tetanus toxine, whereas this                   is
attained with extraordinary rapidity and ease by means of its toxoids.
   The symptoms of illness due to the action of the toxophore group,
therefore, play no part in the production of antitoxine. On the con
trary, we may consider that the severe symptoms, which indicate
injury to the cell-life, disturb the regenerative functions,    and thus
hinder or entirely  frustrate the course of the immunisation process.           I
have from the first adopted this view, and     it was simply    misundera
standing  when  Knorr,   who  has been all too soon taken  from  the field
of his labours, affirmed that, according to my theory, sickness of the
cell constituted the necessary condition precedent to the new forma
tion and pushing-off of side-chains.
  If
   I   am not altogether deceived, the toxoids, where        question
                                                                   it   is
                                                                        a
of producing an active immunisation (and this will always be the case
when the immunisation concerns human beings), are destined to play
an important role in practical medicine.
  In their theoretical relations the toxoids are also of far-reaching
interest, in that they provide a transition to that immunisation which
can be called forth by substances which would a priori be considered
entirely devoid of toxic character, and which are sometimes, like the
autochthonous ferments {i.e., those normally present in blood), pro
ducts of normal cell-life, and in some cases food-stuffs proper. Thus
Dr. Morgenroth, working in my laboratory, has proved that the rennet
ferment,   ifintroduced in great quantities into the organism, behaves
exactly like    real toxine, in that
                a                    causes the production of
                                     it                         typical     a
anti-rennet, which up to a certain limit accumulates in proportionally
greater quantity, the greater the injected doses.    Here, however, we
have to do with processes which are altogether within the region
of the normal, as    ismost clearly shown in certain animals, e.g., the
horse, in the blood serum of which there            normally present
                                                    is                          a
quantity of anti-rennet, equal to that attained in the goat only after a
systematic immunisation carried on for months.    The rennet ferment
present naturally in the body of the horse     the cause of this great
                                               is
formation  of anti-rennet.   According to Bordet's experiments,                 if

               On  Immunity with Special Reference            to  Cell Life.       439
 injections of milk be given to animals, their serum acquires thereby
  the capacity to cause flocculent curdling.             This action is seemingly
  rigidly   specific because (according to Morgenroth's             experiments) the
  body produced by the injection of goat's milk, coagulated goat's milk,
  but not human or cow's milk.
      The  behaviour      is also    similar when different       kinds of albumin,
  e.g., the sera of different animals or the white of egg, are injected.
  There appear constantly in the serum of the animal so treated new
  substances — specific coagulines — which act only in a specific manner,
  i.e., precipitate     only the form of albumin injected.            Thus there are
 produced, by         the  injection   of   common     food-stuffs,   typical
                                                                                " Anti
  korper," which unite with the substances used to occasion their produc
  tion, and form with them insoluble combinations.
      My investigations have shown me that in the blood of animals which
 have not been subjected to any treatment we must accept the presence
 of a number of normal bodies analogous to the " Antikorper," having
 their origin in the most widely diverse organs, and representing
 nothing more than nutritive side-chains, which in the course of the
 normal nutritive processes have been developed in excess and pushed
 off into the blood.
      From all these considerations       I think myself warranted in concluding
 that    the formation       of antitoxines lacks all the characters of that
 purposeful, intelligently directed, and remarkable process which it at
 first seemed to be, and that it is to be regarded merely as a process
 analogous to those constituting an essential portion of the normal meta
 bolism of the organism. We must admit that the majority of the food
 stuffs and of the intermediate products of tissue-change must be able
 to cause     the   production and throwing-off of nutritive side-chains.            It
 may be that the new formation only takes place to limited extent, and
                                                                a
 that the replacement of any side-chains which have been shut out from
 their physiological function is all that is accomplished ; but the forma
 tion    may occur in greater proportions, may become excessive, and
                                           "              "
 therefore lead to the presence of Antikorper               in the blood.
     In this way is easily explained the fact of the occurrence in the
normal blood serum of antitoxines and of bodies inimical to bacteria,
without the animals having ever              been  brought into relation with the
corresponding        toxines   or bacteria.     Here I need only refer to the
fact that diphtheria antitoxine is not uncommonly present in normal
horses and in men who have never suffered from diphtheria.                    Particu
larly weighty in this connection            are  the observations    that  have been
made on horses, because, on the one hand, these animals never suffer
from diphtheria, and, on the other hand, Cobbett has brought forward
experimental proof that this normally occurring antitoxine corre
sponds absolutely as to its properties with the antitoxine produced by
artificially immunising.         The conclusion, therefore, is that in the body
     VOL. LXVI.                                                            2  L

of the normal       horse certain substances may be present which possess
side-chain    affinities similar to those of the diphtheria toxine, and
which, therefore, are quite as capable as the latter are of taking posses
sion   of the cell side-chains, and occasioning the regeneration and
pushing    off of these from the cells       ; in other words, of causing the
presence   of  an  actual  diphtheria   antitoxine  in a normal animal.
    Such occurrences direct attention to the possibility of producing
immunity in some cases by the administration of definite food-stuff's.
Perhaps    we have in some         such peculiarity of feeding and tissue-
change the explanation          of the fact so difficult to understand, viz.,
that individuals of the same race and species react in such diverse
manners to the same infection.            Certainly we are very far removed
from the solution of this important question, which, as yet, has scarcely
assumed    a tangible     form.   Still it is our duty to strive with tenacity
to overcome the difficulties         which surround this point, bearing in
mind the words of your illustrious countryman, Francis Bacon : " Sunt
certc ignavi regionum exploratores, qui, ubi nil nisi ccclum ct pontus
videtur, terras ultra esse prorsus negant."
    I have now laid before you the fundamental facts which up to the
present constitute our knowledge in the field pertaining to immunity,
and wbich can be most easily and successfully explained through the
agency of
             " the side-chain theory."        I wish in a few words to dispel
some erroneous ideas which have been advanced in opposition to this
theory.
   Roux has shown that very small quantities of tetanus toxine, if
injected directly into the brain, cause the death of the animal.           Roux
assumes that such an occurrence is not compatible with my theory.
Roux is of opinion that according to my theory the brain must be
 quite immune against tetanus toxine, as the toxophile side-chains of the
brain-cells must be identical with the antitoxine, and therefore must
 exercise an immediate protective action.           Experiment showing quite
 the reverse, the theory is overthrown.
    Roux   came    to this incorrect conception through an erroneous con
 ception of antitoxine.       The toxophile side-chains of the brain cells
 draw directly to themselves the toxine molecules, and, according to
 my theory, are thus a necessary preliminary condition of the illness.
 The toxophile groups are therefore really inducers of the action of the
 poison, and not its preventives.
    Those toxophile groups which,' like the antitoxines present in the
 serum, are able to lay hold of toxine immediately on its entry into the
 blood, and so to divert       it from organs essential to life, can alone     be
 regarded as being possessed        of any antitoxic action in the true sense
 of the word.       I  may be allowed to call to mind Weigert's excellent
 simile of iron and the lightning conductor.           Iron attracts electricity,

            On   Immunity with Special licfcrence     to Cell Life.     441
and    is therefore   used as a lightning conductor.       Great masses of
iron present in buildings give rise to, or increase, the risk of their
being struck by lightning, and the metal only becomes protective
against lightning when it is so employed that the electricity is con
ducted away outside the building. It would never occur to anyone to
speak of great masses of iron machinery present in buildings as if they
were lightning conductors.        It is equally unreasonable to speak of
the antitoxic property of the brain cortex, in which the toxophile
groups are present in great quantity, but also retain their relations
with the nerve-cells. When this really considerable misunderstand
ing is eliminated from Eoux's results these become entirely confirma
tory of my views, and it is difficult to understand how, subsequent
to Weigert having placed the matter in so clear a light, the beautiful
experiments of Roux can be utilised by another eminent authority
as a means of combating my theory.
    Much more complex than in the cases hitherto discussed are the
conditions when, instead of the relatively simple metabolic products
of microbes, the living micro-organisms themselves come to be con
sidered, as in immunisation against cholera, typhoid, anthrax, swine
fever, and many other infectious diseases.           There then come into
existence alongside of the antitoxines, produced as a result of the
action of the toxines, manifold other reaction products.            This is
because the bacterium is a highly complicated living cell, of which the
solution in the organism yields a great number of bodies of different
                                                                      "
nature, in consequence of which a multitude of " Antikorper              are
called into existence.      Thus we see, as a result of the injection of
bacterial cultures, that there arise alongside of the specific bacterioly-
sines, which dissolve the bacteria, other products, as, for example,
 "             "
   coagulines     (Kraus, Bordet), i.e., substances which are able to cause
the precipitation of certain albuminous           bodies contained in the
culture fluid injected; also the so-much discussed " agglutinines
                                                                           "
 (Durham, Gruber, Pfeift'er), the antiferments (von Dungern), and no
doubt many other bodies which we have not yet recognised.
    It is by no means unlikely that each of these reaction products
finds its origin in special cells of the body ; on the other hand, it is
quite likely that the formation of any single one of these bodies is
not of itself sufficient to confer immunity. Thus in case of the intro
duction of bacteria into the body we have to do with a many-sided
production of different forms of
                                          " Antikorper," each of which is
directed oidy against one definite quality or metabolic product of
 the bacterial cell. Accordingly, in recent times, the practice of using
for the production of immunisation definite toxic bodies isolated from
 the  bacterial cells' has been   more and more given up, and for this
 purpose it is now regarded as important to employ the bacterial cells
 as intact as possible.    The beautiful results obtained for plague by

 442                        Dr. Paul Ehrlich.
 Haffkine, and quite recently by Wright in your own country for

     The most interesting and important substances arising during
 such an immunising process are without doubt the bacteriolysines,
 in the investigation of which Pfeiffer has done such yeoman's service.
 How really wonderful it is that after the introduction of the cholera-
 vibrio into the animal body a substance is formed endowed with the
 power of dissolving the cholera vibrio, and that vibrio only !
    This seemingly purposeful and novel phenomenon seems at first
 sight to have nothing to do with those forces which are normally at the
 disposal of the organism.   It was of the greatest importance to explain
 the origin of these substances from the standpoint of cellular physi
 ology. The solution offered very considerable difficulties, and was first
 attained when instead of bacteriolysines, hsemolysines came to be
 employed in experiments.       Hsemolysines are peculiar toxic bodies,
 which destroy red blood corpuscles by dissolving them. Hsemolysines
 may occur in a normal blood when they exercise a solvent action on
 the red blood corpuscles of other species, or they may be artificially
produced, in which case, after an animal has undergone a process of
immunisation against the blood corpuscles of another species, there
appear in the serum hsemolysines which destroy the kind of blood
 corpuscles employed in the production of the immunity.          In their
essential characters they are absolutely comparable with the bacterio
lysines : but they possess over them the great advantage that they
admit of being employed in test-tube experiments, and thus afford
opportunity for exact quantitative work altogether independent of the
variability of the animal body.
    Belfanti and Carbone first discovered the remarkable fact that
horses which    have been treated with the blood corpuscles of rabbits
contain   in their serum constituents which are poisonous for the
rabbit, and for the rabbit only.   While the serum of the normal horse,
to the quantity of 60 c.c, could be intravenously injected without
harm to the rabbit, a very few c.c. of serum from horses previously so
treated with rabbit's blood, proved fatal.
   Bordet showed shortly thereafter, that in the case quoted there was
present in the serum a specific hiemolysine which dissolved the blood
corpuscles of the rabbit.    He also proved that these hsemolysines — as
had already been shown by Buchner and Daremberg in the case of
similarly acting bodies which   are present  in normal blood — lost their
solvent property on being maintained during half an hour at a tem
perature of 55° C.     Bordet added, further, the new fact, that the
blood-solvent property of these sera which had been deprived of solvent
power by heat, the solvent action could be restored if certain normal
sera were added to them.
   By this important observation an exact analogy was established with

              On Immunity       with Special Reference      to Cell Life.       443
 the facts of bacteriolysis as elicited by the work of Pfeiffer, Metchni-
 koff, and Bordet.       In the work on the Pfeiffer phenomenon of bacteri
 olysis,  it had already      been   ascertained that the solution of bacteria
 by specific bacteriolysines was brought about by the combined action
 of two different bodies : one which was specific, arose during the im
munisation and was stable ; and another, a very unstable body, which
was present in normal serum.
    In collaboration with Dr. Morgenroth,            I have sought in regard to
 this  question,   for which      haemolysis    offered prospects favourable to
 experimentation, to make clear the mechanism concerned in the action
 of these two components — the stable, which may be designated " im
 mune body," and the unstable, which may be designated "comple
 ment" — which, acting together, effect the solution of the red blood
 corpuscles.     For this purpose, in the first place, solutions containing

brought      in contact    with   suitable   blood    corpuscles,  and  after  sepa
ration of the fluid and the corpuscles by centrifugalising, we investi
gated whether these substances had been taken up by the red blood
corpuscles or remained behind in the fluid.              The proof of its location
in the   one position or     in the other was readily forthcoming, since to
restore to the hsemolysine its former activity, it was only necessary to
add to the " immune body             a fresh supply of " complement," or to
                                   "

the presence of the hsemolysine in its integrity might be shown by
the occurrence of solution of the blood-cells.
    The experiments proved that, after centrifugalising,             the " immune
       "
body     is quantitatively    bound to the red blood corpuscles, and that the
" complement," on the
                              contrary, remains entirely behind in the fluid.
The presence of the two components in contact with blood cor
puscles only occasions the solution of these at higher temperatures, and
not at 0° C. And an active hsemolytic serum (with " immune body
                                                                                   "

red blood corpuscles and maintained for a while at 0° C, it was found
after centrifugalising that, under these circumstances also, the " immune

components must, at a temperature            of 0°  C,  have existed alongside of
one another in a free condition.
   But when analogous experiments were undertaken at                a higher   tem
perature     it was found that both components were retained in the
sediment.
   These facts can only be explained by making certain assumptions re
                                                                          "

and with which at lower temperatures it quickly unites, and another
haptophore group of a lesser chemical affinity, which at a higher tem
perature becomes united with the "complement" present in the
serum.      Therefore, at the higher temperature, the red blood corpuscles
will draw to themselves those molecules of the " immune body " which
in the fluid have previously become united with the " complement."
In this case the " immune body " represents in a measure the connect
ing chain which binds the complement to the red blood corpuscles, and
so    brings them under its deleterious influence.                  Since under the

not seriously err if we ascribe to this " complement

    It is obvious   that when the normal serum of             one    animal possesses

considerable    solvent     action upon guinea-pig's blood, but loses this pro
perty if warmed.          If dog's serum, thus rendered inactive by warming,
is brought into contact with suspended corpuscles of guinea-pig's blood,
these are not dissolved ; but, if to such a mixture there be also added
guinea-pig serum, i.e., the serum normal to these red blood corpuscles,
the erythrocytes are at once dissolved.                Here the only explanation
is that the "intermediate body," which possesses a specific affinity
for guinea-pig erythrocytes, and is present in the inactive dog's serum,
is able to seize on one of the many " complements
                                                                 "

normally     attach    itself   to  the  corpuscles,   comes    now    to  exercise its
destructive influence.
    We see at the same time from this experiment that the hsemolysines
occurring naturally, obey the same laws as those produced through the
process of immunising.             In fact, for them also, in a great number of
instances, precisely similar behaviour h;is been demonstrated.

   The character of the specific union made it possible to find solutions
for a number of important questions. In the first place, regarding the
multiplicity of the haemolysines, which occur normally in serum, it is
well known that numerous sera are able to dissolve blood corpuscles of
different species.   For example, serum of the dog dissolves blood
corpuscles of the rabbit, guinea-pig, rat, goat, sheep, &c. The complex
nature of these ha:molysines has been already indicated.
  Another question arises whether in a serum that is capable of such
manifold action there is present one single hsemolysine that destroys
different   red blood-cells,       or whether        a whole   series   of haimolysines
come   into action, of which        one is adapted to guinea-pig blood, another
to rabbit blood, &c.    The solution of this question may be approached
in another way.      The serum may be rendered inactive by heat, and
then placed in contact with red blood corpuscles of a given kind.
Then, supposing, for example, that rabbit blood has been employed, it
is found that if the fluid is freed from the erythrocytes by centrifugal-
                                  "
isation and the " complement        afterwards added, it is no longer in a
position to dissolve rabbit blood, but has not suffered any impairment
of its action on other kinds.
  By this method of         elective   it is proved that the normally
                                         absorplvm
occurring haemolysines which chain the  blood corpuscles of the rabbit
to themselves, are specifically adapted to this purpose.      If with
suitable adjustment of conditions similar experiments be conducted
with other kinds of blood, results are obtained which force us to the
conviction that in such a serum acting on various kinds of blood

ment."   Each one of these haptophore groups can be bound by an
appropriate "anti-group."  Three anti-groups are thus conceivable,
any one of which, by uniting with one of the haptophore groups of
the lysine, can frustrate the action of the lysine. To my mind, of these
three possible " Antikorper," that one which can lay hold of the hapto
                        " complement," and so
phore group of the                               prevent this from uniting
with tho " immune body,"        is   the most important.               Dr. Morgenroth and
I have experimentally succeeded in producing such bodies by processes
of immunisation, and in proving that they unite with the " comple
     "
ment (anticomplement).
    Dr. Neisser at the Steglitz Institute sought to find an explanation of
Sobernheim's experiments.       He was able to determine that anthrax
serum failed in mice, even        great quantities of fresh sheep's serum
                                 if
(i.e.,            excess of
                             " complement    were at the same time intro
    containing                                       ")
duced. The failure in this case appears to be due, on the one hand, to
the destruction, in the body of the mouse, of the " complement "
present in the sheep's serum, and, on the other hand, to the fact that
the " immune body "yielded by the sheep does not find in mouse serum
an appropriate new " complement."
    From this     appears, that in the therapeutic application of anti

Perhaps the non-success which as yet has attended the employment of
typhoid and cholera serum will be converted into the contrary   the                         if
serum be derived   from apes and not taken from species so distantly
removed from man as the horse, goat, or dog. However this may be,
the question of the provision of the appropriate " complement" will
come     more and more into the foreground, for  really represents the

  of the organism against elements standing biologically much higher in
  the scale than erythrocytes and much less foreign to the body than
  those exceedingly lowly organisms, the bacteria.             I refer here to the
                     "
  production of Antikorper against
                                   "
                                              cells  of  the  higher animal organi
  sation, e.g., ciliated epithelium (v. Dungern), spermatozoa (Landsteiner,
  Metchnikoff, Moxter), kidney cells, and leucocytes.                 These " Anti
          "
  korper     are also of a complex nature.            They obey the already de
  scribed law of elective absorption, and their origin is in keeping with
  the " side-chain
                       "
                          theory.   It is to be hoped that such immunisations
  as these, which are of great theoretical interest, may also come to be
 available for therapeutic application.             The idea has already been
 mooted by v. Dungern, of attacking epithelial new formations, particu
 larly carcinoma, by means of specific " antiepithelial sera," and
  Metchnikoff has expressed the somewhat bold hope of being able to
 delay old      age    by means    of a serum       directed    against phagocytes
 (macrophages).          But even if in the immediate future no great practical
 success is attained, we must remember that we are only at the very
 beginning of a rational investigation of properties                 of cells which
 hitherto have been far too lightly regarded.
    The sifting of the material obtained by observation is rendered more
 difficult by the occurrence under normal conditions of a great number
 of quite unlooked for bodies furnished with haptophore groups and
 arising from diverse organs, and which we may designate collectively
 as haptines.      It is to be expected that the study of these haptines will
 not only throw light on the more minute details of cellular metabolism,
 but also prove fruitful in the fields of pathology and therapeutics. By
 the fact that we can cause the individual haptines of the cells to pass
 out into    the blood serum by a process of specific immunisation, it
 becomes possible in the test-tube to analyse more accurately the mode
 of operation of their binding groups than is possible in the case of
 the complicated conditions which present themselves in the animal
body.      The importance, for the study of immunity, of considering the
 circumstances from a purely cellular standpoint is evident from all that
I have said.
    I trust, my lords and gentlemen, that from what I have said you
may have obtained the impression, to allude again to my quotation
from Bacon, that we no longer find ourselves lost on a boundless sea,
but that we have already caught a distinct glimpse of the land which
we hope, nay, which we expect, will yield rich treasures for biology
and therapeutics.

     In my previous communication* an account was given of the con
 tact sensitiveness of elementary substances to electric radiation.                It
 was shown that though many substances exhibit a diminution of con
 tact resistance, there are others, of which potassium may be taken as
 an example, which show an increase of resistance — an increase which,
 in some cases, lasts during the impact of electric waves, the sensitive
 element quickly recovering on the cessation of radiation.               There are
 thus produced two opposite effects, which depend on the nature of
 sensitive substance.
      As the normal action of radiation is to produce opposite effects on
  the two classes of substances, it would be advisable, in order to avoid
  confusion, to use a simple term to indicate these actions, and to dis
  tinguish them from one another, by calling the one positive and the
  other negative.         The sensitiveness is found confined to the outer
  .surfaces in contact, and not extended to the substratum ; I have there-

fore used the term " Electric Touch," in the restricted sense of sensi
tiveness to electric radiation, the touch being regarded positive when
there is a diminution of resistance by the action of radiation, and
negative when radiation produces an increase of resistance.
   In continuation of my previous investigation, I have completed a
systematic inquiry into the action of nearly all the elements, including
the metalloids and non-metals ; also of alloys, amalgams, and com
pounds.    Very great difficulty was at first encountered in working
with the non-metals, which are extremely bad conductors. The diffi
culty has, however, been overcome by the successful working of a new
method of radiation balance.    As a result of these investigations, it is
found that the increase of resistance exhibited by elements is far from
being a rare phenomenon, nearly half the number of elements exhibit
ing this effect.
   In the exhibition of the phenomenon of contact sensitiveness, various
causes give rise to actions which appear at first to be very anomalous.
These causes have been isolated and their effects separately studied.
Results have thus been obtained which are uniformly consistent.
  Experiments have specially been carried out in the following sub
jects      :   —
   (1) On the passage of electricity through imperfect contacts.
   (2) The effects of various physical causes on the contact sensitive
ness.
   (3) On the difference between mass action and molecular action.
   (4) On the changes produced in the sensitive substance by the action
of radiation.
                        "
   (5) On the cause of fatigue."
   (6) On electric reversal.
   The study of the above supports the following hypotheses                       :   —
   (a) That the                contact sensitiveness     depends on     the chemical sub
                   stance.
   (b)         That the sensitiveness of       an element is a periodic function of its
                 atomic weight.
    (<¦)       That the effect of radiation   to produce
                                                   is      molecular change or

                 stance less negative. The change may in certain cases produce

  [* In      the various investigations            on the properties of electric waves,
one property      has not yet attracted so much attention                    as   it   deserves   —
the action of long ether waves in modifying the molecular structure
of matter.   Apart from the interest attached to the relation l>etween
ether, electricity, and matter, the subject is of importance as affording
not only a very important verification of the identity of visible and
electric radiation, but also establishing the continuity of all radiation
phenomena. These phenomena occupy the borderland between physics
and chemistry, and their study may therefore be expected to throw
much light on several subjects at present imperfectly understood. The
study of the action of electricity and of ether waves on matter in the
form of solids presents many difficulties, owing to the great com
plexity of atomic and molecular aggregation which characterises the
solid state ot matter.  But the phenomena often met with in theory
and practice    unfortunately, in reference to matter in

action of ever-varyingchanges in physical environments.    In the fol
lowing investigationsthe difficulties mentioned above were constantly
present, and the attempts to meet them may therefore be of some
interest.]
   In my former papert   described the contact-sensitiveness of various
                                  I
elementary substances to electric radiation. It was shown that though
many substances exhibit a diminution of contact-resistance, there are
others which show            an    increase of resistance — an increase which, in
certain cases, lasts only during the impact of electric waves, the sensi
tive substance automatically recovering its original conductivity on the
cessation of radiation.    There are thus produced two opposite effects,
either an increase or a diminution of resistance, depending on the nature
of the substance.

filings. These two specifically different effects have to be recognised,
and it would be advisable, to avoid misunderstanding, to use a simple
term to indicate both these effects, and distinguish them from one
another, by calling the one positive and the other negative. The term
" coherence " applied to the normal diminution of resistance exhibited
by certain metals by the action of electric waves cannot be applied in
all   cases, as there       is,
                      as has been said before, another class of sub
stanceswhich exhibits under normal conditions an increase of resistance.
                         "
The term " decoherence     has been used to indicate the effect of
mechanical tapping on fatigued substances of the former class this                  ;
produces an increase of resistance, and at the same time restores the
sensitiveness.  The action of tapping on fatigued specimens of the
latter class     is,
               however,   diminution of resistance.
                                    a
 I   have shown in    former paper that the seat of sensitiveness
                            a                                         con           is
fined mainly  to the surface layer of  the sensitive substance, and that
the nature of the substratum has little or no effect on the sensitiveness.
Thus,   asubstance which exhibits a strong diminution of resistance,                       if
coated with an extremely thin layer of    substance of the other class
                                                     a
which shows an increase of resistance, will now exhibit an increase of
resistance. It   seen that the action

which means the skin      and as the phenomenon dealt with in the pre

" electric touch " in the restricted sense of contact sensitiveness to elec
tric stimulus, the touch being regarded as positive when electric oscilla
tion produces an increase of conductivity or diminution of resistance,
and negative when the contrary effect    produced.is Substances which
exhibit a decrease of resistance will be called positive, and those which
show an increase will be regarded as negative.       The above terms are
to be regarded as convenient substitutes for long descriptive phrases.
  The phenomenon ef contact-sensitiveness seems at first to be
extremely anomalous, and there appears to be little relation between
substances which exhibit similar electric sensitiveness.  Taking iron
as an example of     very sensitive substance,
                            a                        seen to be easily

surface    favourable for sensitiveness.
           is                              This view obtains some support
from the consideration  that the so-called noble metals are not as sensitive
as iron.   But the metals nickel and cobalt, which are bright and not
easily            are also very sensitive.
          oxidised,                             The very sensitive metals
iron, nickel, and cobalt are all magnetic, and      might be thought that

on the electro-positive character of the metal ; but potassium, one of
the most electro-positive metals, exhibits an unusual increase of resist
ance, a property w hich it will be shown in a future paper it shares
 with  some of the moBt electro-negative           elements.
   There is one property, however, which at first would seem to be in
some    way related to the sensitiveness of metals — the volatility of
metals    under   the cathodic       stimulus,     investigated   by Sir William
Crookes,* who gives the following list of metals, arranged according to
their volatility : —

   In this list the substances which         are  most volatile, e.g., Pd, Au, Ag,
are   not very sensitive, whereas Fe, Al, Mg, which are least volatile,
are strongly sensitive.     But the above series does not exactly coincide
with the series of electric sensitiveness.               Again, the volatility of
platinum is retarded in hydrogen gas, but an experiment carried out
to determine the sensitiveness of platinum in hydrogen failed to show
any great increase in the sensitiveness.
   None of the above suppositions give any satisfactory explanation of
the numerous anomalies in the contact-sensitiveness of metals. It
then appeared that the observed effect is not due to a single cause but
to many causes.      An observer studying the dilatation of a gas under
reduced pressure, and ignorant of the effect of temperature, will
doubtless encounter many anomalies.                In the phenomena of contact-
sensitiveness the variables       are, however,      far more numerous, and the
different possible combinations are practically unlimited.               It therefore
became necessary, by a long and tedious process of successive elimina
tion, to find out the causes which are instrumental               in producing the
observed effect   ; the results obtained throw some light on this intricate
subject.    The following are some of the principal directions in which a
systematic inquiry was carried out : —

   I  intend    to treat   the above subjects in some detail, and in the
present paper will especially deal with the first five lines of investiga
tion.     These, it is hoped, will afford an explanation of some of the
mo6t    perplexing anomalies.        All  the subjects mentioned above are
more or less interdependent,         but their treatment in one paper would
make the subject very complicated.             It would be easier to take a
more generalised and complete view of the subject as a whole, after
each of the above-mentioned         inquiries has been separately considered.
With reference to the flow of electricity through imperfect contacts, I
need only mention here that the phenomenon seldom obeys Ohm's
law.     In many instances the phenomenon appears more allied to the
discharge of electricity through a gaseous medium.
                        Mass Action and Molecular Action.
    Of the attempts made to explain the action of contact-sensitiveness,
Professor      Lodge's   theory of coherence has been the most suggestive.
The     coalescence     of water and mercury drops in Lord Kayleigh's
experiments, and Professor Lodge's observation of the welding of two
metallic spheres by powerful oscillatory discharge in the neighbour
hood, apparently lend much support to the theory of electric welding,
 which explains in a simple manner the diminution of contact-resistance
 of various metallic filings when subjected to strong electric variation.
    On this theory it follows that all imperfect contacts should exhibit a
 diminution of resistance when subjected to electric radiation.              In
 carrying out a systematic investigation of the contact-sensitiveness of
 metals,   I, however, found that there    are substances,  of which potassium
 may be taken        as a type,   which exhibit an increase of resistance.
 Potassium is not a solitary instance ; I have found a large number of
 elements exhibiting this action ; the number of compounds which
 exhibits a similar action is also considerable.        Other experiments will

be presently described which    would show that the theory of coherence
is  inadequate.   From the above it would appear that the subject
is far more complex than was at first supposed. For various reasons
it would be best to distinguish between the two different actions, which
may conveniently be described as mass action and molecular action.
   Mass Action.- — By this is meant the general action, say, between two
masses when placed in a very strong electric field.     Under the given
circumstance, sparking may take place between the bodies, and the
two may thus be welded together.        From what has been said it will
be seen that such action is rwn-discrimt 'native — that is to say, the
action will be the same whatever the chemical or physical nature of
the substance may be.     The best way of showing this action is with
ilrops of liquid, with surface contamination, for any incipient welding
will be at once exhibited by the complete coalescence of the drops. The
non-discriminative nature of the action is shown in a striking manner in
the following experiment.    I may mention here that fragments of solid
potassium, and in a lesser degree sodium, exhibit an increase of con
tact-resistance under the action of electric waves.     I made a liquid
alloy of potassium and sodium, and drops of this alloy were allowed to
float on the stratum separating dense Rangoon oil from lighter kero-
sine, the alloy being of an intermediate density.    The drops coalesced
when placed in an intense alternating electric field.   The next experi
ment was made with potassium heated under melted (hard) paraffin.
By stirring the molten K with a glass rod, the metal was broken up
into numerous spherical drops.      These also coalesced under similar
electric influence.   It    however, to be borne in mind (1) that in the

this particular condition certain important molecular changes, to be
presently described, cannot very well take place            ;   (2) that the condi
tions of the experiment are abnormal.
  Experiments will be presently described which will show that the
observed variation of conductivity produced by radiation not due to   is
coherence,    but to certain molecular changes of an allotropic nature.

and therefore molecular, appears to be decisively proved by the experi
ments described below.             If further proofs are necessary, they are
afforded by the characteristic curves of variation of current with the
E.M.F. given by the three types of substances, positive, negative, and
neutral   ;  by the continuity      of radiation    effect  on matter     ; and, lastly,
by certain remarkable results          I obtained, which show that the effect of
ether waves on elementary substances depends on the chemical nature
of the substance ; in other words, the effect is found to be a periodic
function of the atomic weight of the substance.                A detailed account of
the above will be given in a future paper.
   On the Change     of Sign of liesqwnxe in the Receiver,     due to a Variation of
                                Intensity of Radiation.
    After finding the increase of resistance exhibited by certain sub
stances,    I wished to see whether these showed any further difference
as compared to substances which exhibit a diminution of resistance.
 In my determination of the " Index of Refraction of Sulphur for the
Electric Ray,"* I used the method of total reflection.                  I often noticed
that just before total reflection, when the intensity of the transmitted
beam became comparatively feeble, the receiver indicated an increase
instead of the usual diminution of resistance.                       Professor Lodge
mentions in one of his papers that an iron filing coherer exhibits an
 increase of resistance when acted on by feeble radiation.                     Thus, if
 positive substances like iron give a negative reaction, with the diminu
tion of radiation intensity, negative substances may be expected to
give a positive reaction with feeble radiation.                  Very sensitive sub
stances     are,  however,    not so well adapted for an exhibition of this
reversed action, possibly because the range of sensibility is compara
tively great. But it is not difficult to demonstrate this property in the
case of moderately sensitive substances.
    The following experiment           with a moderately negative substance
(arsenic)    and   a moderately positive substance (osmium) will bring out
this interesting peculiarity in a clear manner. The intensity of incident
radiation may be varied in two ways — (1) by removing the radiator
further and further from the receiver, or (2) by using polarised radia
tion, whose intensity may be varied by the rotation of an analyser.
In the experiment to be described, the first method was adopted.
    Experiments     with A rsenic Receiver. — A receiver was made           of freshly-
powdered       arsenic.    The radiator      used    emitted radiation of strong
intensity. It was at first placed close to the receiver, and there was
produced a moderate increase of resistance.                  It was then removed

further and further, and the increase of resistance became less and less.
When the distance was increased to 25 cm. the action was reduced to
zero.   When the distance was increased to 30 cm. there was a diminu
tion of resistance, showing that 25 cm. is, in this case, the critir.nl
distance.  The receiver continued to exhibit a diminution until the
radiator was removed to a distance of 70 cm., when the radiation
intensity was too feeble to affect the receiver.   Now this critical
distance may approximately be regarded as a measure of the sensi
bility of the substance. In this particular case the electric touch has a
negative sign. If by any means (some of which will be described
later on) the substance becomes more sensitive, i.e., more negative, the
critical distance will be increased. On the contrary, if the sensitiveness
becomes    less (the substance tending towards positive direction) the
critical distance will be decreased.   The application of this principle
is of importance as affording a means of determining the variation of
sensitiveness under different conditions.
    Ejperiments         with Osmium        Receiver.   — Substances which              are    feebly
positive give a diminution of resistance when the radiator is close to
the receiver, and an increase of resistance when the radiator is beyond
the critical distance. Thus the critical distance for an osmium receiver
(whose normal action is moderately positive) was found to be about
250 cm.   The radiator at a distance of 300 cm. produced a deflection
of - 3 divisions in a galvanometer placed in the receiver circuit. But
at the distance of 200 cm. the deflection became + 4, and at the
reduced distance of 50 cm. the deflection became + 1 50 divisions.
   In order to avoid confusion, we may choose to call the effect due to
strong intensity of radiation as the normal action. The sign of normal
action might further be verified, wherever possible, by obtaining a
reverse action         with   feeble   radiation intensity.

   A sensitive receiver made, say, of iron powder, has its conductivity

sitiveness can then only be restored by the mechanical separation of the
particles.  This supposition, however, fails in the case of substances
which exhibit an increase of resistance by the action of radiation.                                 It
may, however, be supposed that by some process, little understood, the
particles are slightly separated by the action of electric waves, thus
producing the observed increase of resistance. On this view, however,
the restoration of sensitiveness by tapping remains unexplained.

particles, suitable  small  increase  of   pressure ought to restore the

exhibits, as indicated in my last paper, sometimes an increase, and at
other times a decrease, of resistance. The difficulty in this case cannot
be explained on the supposition of variations of radiation intensity, as
the anomaly persists even when the intensity of radiation  maintained          is
uniform by keeping the radiator at   fixed distance.

   As regards the action of radiation in producing allotropic modifica
tion, several such instances are known in the case of visible radiation.
In the familiar example of the conversion of yellow phosphorus into
the red amorphous variety, the efl'ect quite apparent. isBut this    not                        is

and has to be indirectly inferred from the insolubility of the solarised
product in carbon bisulphide.    The reason why    far larger number of   a
instances of allotropic transformation produced by light   not known                     is
is  not because such effects are not more numerous, but because we
are unable to detect such changes.      It must be admitted that our
knowledge of molecular changes, specially in a solid, and the means of
their detection, at present extremely limited.

     There   is   one method of detecting these molecular variations                          to which
little attention        has          given, but which appears to be of

of this class. It   evident that changes in molecular structure must be

attended with changes of physical properties, electric conductivity
being one of them.     Among other instances of allotropic changes
attended with changes in electric conductivity may be mentioned the

only such extreme cases to show the influence of molecular or atomic
aggregation in influencing the conductivity.               This effect is brought into
painful prominence by the variation produced in spite of all precautions

    Experimental Proof of AUotropk Changes being attended with Varia
tion, of Condudiriti/. — I shall now describe a direct experiment by
which the change of conductivity produced in a substance by molecu
lar change is exhibited.           Red mercuric iodide is converted into the
yellow variety by        the   application       of heat, and the substance does
not    return   to its   original state till after a considerable lapse of
time.      The    recovery here is very slow.                 A small quantity of
mercuric     iodide was now placed in a tube provided with sliding elec
trodes, and a current          was    made     to puss through the substance by
siutable compression.          The conductivity of the substance is rather
small, and therefore a thin stratum should be taken for experiment.
The current       is observed by means            of a delicate galvanometer.        On
the application of heat to the tube (which converts the red into the
yellow variety), there was at once produced, simultaneously with the
molecular transformation, an increase of conductivity.                   This effect is
not due to a rise of temperature, for the increased conductivity was
still exhibited on cooling the tube. From this experiment it is seen
that the molecular changes can be inferred from changes in the con
ductivity. In the case described above, the recovery from the B, or
second stage, to the first stage, A, is slow ; but there may be substances
(and there are such substances) where, under the given conditions of
temperature and other physical surroundings, the first stage is far
more     stable   than the second       ;  the substance       will  then   pass   back
quickly from the B condition to           the   primitive state,   on the cessation of
the exciting cause, which gave rise to the transient B effect.                The sub
stance will in this case be

                   [Electrical  Reversed   in  the  lladwtwn Product.
    In the hypotheses given above, it             was said that the reaction     of the
radiation product, or B variety, should be opposite to that of the sub
stance in the normal condition, or in the A state. Thus a negative
substance which by the action of radiation shows an increase of
resistance during conversion from the A to the B state should exhibit
a  diminution of resistance when B variety is acted on by electric
waves.      The contrary would be the case with positive substances.
   The following tabulated statement indicates the phenomena exhi
bited by two classes of substances           : —

   Negative, e.g., arsenic  . . ,  Increase of resistance.     Diminution of resistance.
    We have thus two distinct              classes  of phenomena dependent on the
sign of electric touch.             If KA represents the conductivity of the fresh
.substance,   and    K„   the   conductivity of the radiation product, then
    (1) With positive substances, as the conductivity of the radiation
product is greater        (KB>KA), the first action of radiation would               be to
 produce a diminution of resistance.                  This diminution will continue to
be exhibited      till the maximum amount of B variety is produced. The
further action of radiation now will be to reconvert B into A ; but as
 KA< KB there would now be produced a diminution of conductivity,
and a galvanometer in circuit will indicate an electrical reversal.                    The
 reconverted     A variety may again be transformed to a greater or less
 extent   to B,  and in this way a series of reversals may take place, due
 to the continued action of radiation producing oscillation in molecular
or atomic groupings.              I shall designate this as the         phenomenon       of
 radio-molecular oscillation.
    {2)  With negative substances tho conductivity of the radiation pro
 duct is less (K < KA), and the first action of radiation will therefore be
an increase of resistance.              The phenomena exhibited by these negative
 substances will precisely be opposite to those shown by the positive
substances.
    The above is but an approximate representation of the phenomena.
 To lie more accurate, one has to take into account the partial changes
 and the effect of radiation on these changed products.                    Thus, at first
 suppose the substance to lie entirely made up of A variety (this would
 rarely be the case).           The first flash of radiation converts a large por
 tion of A into B, the substance now being a mixture of A and B. The
 action of the next flash would be to convert the unchanged A into B,
 and reconvert to a more or less extent B into A. The electric response
 will thus be very strong at the beginning, but will become con
 tinuously less and less. When the proportion of B has attained a
 maximum value, the reconversion of B into A will become relatively
 large, and thus give rise to reversal effect.
     I spoke of the conversion "to a greater or less extent" of one
 variety into the other.                There is also the question of the relative
 stability of the two varieties under the given conditions.                     From the
 above it will be seen what possibilities there are in the way of different
  combinations, and the varied phenomena thereby rendered possible.                        I
  will presently describe some of the typical cases.

             Changes produced       in Matter   by    Electric Waves.                     463
  In the above it has     been assumed  that the reaction of B variety is
opposite to that of A.    As previously mentioned, in working with a
silver receiver I found       it,
                            when fresh, exhibiting at first   diminution     a
and, subsequently, an increase of resistance.     The anomalous action
may be explained by supposing the normal fresh silver Ag to be
positive, and the radiation product Ag' negative.    These two varieties
would thus give rise to opposite reactions.   To justify the assumptions
made above,    it became necessary to obtain by some other means                             a
variety of silver Ag', analogous to the hypothetical negative variety.]
                              Tim Varieties   of   Silver.
    After many unsuccessful attempts,   I     at last obtained         a   variety of silver
which   gives a moderately negative reaction (increase of resistance).
Silver chloride  was first precipitated by the addition of dilute hydro
chloric acid to silver nitrate solution. The precipitate was then reduced
to metallic silver by zinc filings, the excess of zinc being dissolved on'
by the action of HC1.      This form of silver gives negative reaction.
                                                                   a

AgNOs   solution  gives a positive variety.  The negative product Ag'                         is
perhaps better formed at relatively low temperatures, for the products
obtained on certain warm days, the thermometer registering 27° C,
were very feebly negative, and passed into the positive state after an
interval of twenty-four hours.But on cold days (temperature = 22° C.)

tive property     not due to any accidental impurity, for pure silver
                  is

negative reaction may, however, be supposed to be due to  thin film  of      a
chloride formed during reduction.     washed the Ag' with NH3, then
                                         I
 with water, and, after drying, the result was still  negative reaction.
                                                                   a

 filings. Two separate quantities were taken one was shaken with only

 HC1, the other was mixed with zinc filings, and the excess of zinc was
 dissolved off with HC1   ;the two specimens were then washed and dried.
 Both gave   the positive reaction of ordinary silver.  The above experi
 ments are interesting for the production, by chemical means, of an
 allotropic variety analogous to the transitory radiation product.
    There are other differences of electric behaviour between Ag and
 Ag' for instance, when made into voltaic cell, the two varieties give
     ;                                   a
 a P.D. of about 0-12 volt. There are other interesting peculiarities
 about   this cell, the consideration     of which           is   postponed      to   a   future
 occasion.

    It  now remains to be proved that the radiation product                      exhibits
a change of sign       of   electric   touch.    The   sensitiveness   of   certain  sub
stances belonging to each of these two classes is very great.                     On the
other hand,      in  the  transition    from   one  class  to  the   other,   substances
are    met with the sensitiveness of which is rather feeble.                The experi
mental verification       of  the  hypotheses     mentioned    above   seemed     at first
very difficult, as the reversed action was likely to be masked by
the stronger       normal    action of the still unconverted portion of the
substance.      It  however occurred to me that if slightly sensitive sub
stances    were   taken, then the direct and reversed actions were likely
to be obtained with less difficulty.               For this reason I took for my
first experiments arsenic, which is moderately negative.                 It is however
possible, though the adjustments are difficult, to exhibit the reversed
actions even with strongly sensitive substances, and as a type of such
actions that of iron will be taken as an example.
    Observations with Arsenic Receiver.
                                                — Experiment I. — A receiver was
made with freshly powdered arsenic ; the critical distance was found
to be 25 cm. ; that is to say, when the radiator was moved from 1 to
25 cm. there was always produced an increase of resistance, while
beyond this distance there was a diminution of resistance ; the critical
distance, 25 cm., may therefore be taken as an approximate measure of
the negative character of the specimen. As has been said before, if
through any cause the substance becomes more negative, the critical
distance will be increased; but if the substance tends towards the
positive direction by becoming less negative, then the critical distance
will be decreased.         The receiver was now continuously subjected to
radiation for ten minutes.              After this it was found that the receiver
gave a diminution         or  positive reaction, even when the radiator was
brought close to the receiver.                The action of radiation has thus
reversed the sign of electric touch.
    Experiment II. — Any arbitrary length of exposure labours under the
defect that what is observed is the final effect, the intermediate effects
not being taken into account.               In order to observe the intermediate
effects, a very laborious series of observations is necessary.               The experi
ment was therefore        modified    in  the following   manner   : — A fresh   receiver
was subjected to radiation, and observations at intervals of fifteen
seconds were taken to test the nature of reaction of the sensitive suit-
stance. The first action of radiation on the fresh specimen was a great
increase of resistance — so very great that the current was reduced to
zero   ; it was no longer      possible to make any further observation with
out re-establishing the current.              This was done by a very gradual
increase of pressure, effected by         means   of a fine micrometer screw which
moved the compressing electrode in a perfectly parallel manner.                    There

                Changes produced     in Matter    by Electric Waves,           465
 should be no jarring motion, as mechanical disturbance was found to
 break up the complex atomic aggregation in the radiation product.
 During eight minutes of exposure the receiver continued to exhibit an
 increase of resistance, after which the substance became positive, being
 converted to the B state ; this positive state lasted for a minute under
 exposure to radiation, then there was a reversal to the original nega
 tive state —as     if the structure    so  laboriously built up suddenly gave
 way.      Subsequently there were series of reversals, the specimen
 becoming more and more inert, and, after an exposure of about thirty
 minutes, the sensitiveness was practically lost.
    The curve given below represents approximately the results of the
 experiment.      During certain periods the substance became so nearly
 neutral that it was difficult to interpret whether the substance was
 positive or negative.        The lower halves of the curve represent the
 negative and the upper halves the positive states, and the correspond
 ing numbers represent, in minutes, the duration of           these states.
                                                                  n

                           [Iiadio-molecidar Oscillation.
    It  was said that, owing to molecular reversals due to radiation,
 there should be a corresponding series of electric reversals.              In this
investigation     it is essential that the substance examined should             be
 completely protected from all disturbances, such as mechanical vibra
 tion, &c, and only subjected to the action of radiation.          The experimen
 tal difficulties are very great.      If we take a strongly sensitive positive
 substance — say iron, the effect of the first flash of radiation (a diminu
tion of resistance) is very great, and the subsequent relatively feeble
reversal effects, unless caref idly looked for, are liable to pass unnoticed.
After the first adjustment, the receiver should on no account be
touched, as mechanical jars are found to undo the effect of radiation.
Though by special care the mechanical jars coidd be reduced to a
minimum, yet it appeared advisable to devise appropriate means
by which the necessity of touching the receiver for subsequent adjust
ments is altogether avoided.          The method adopted to this end varies
with individual cases.          In the case of arsenic, for example, the
action of radiation is often to produce a very great increase of
resistance, and thus convert the substance into a non-conductor.
The pressure has therefore to be so adjusted at the beginning, that
the    substance    can  never     become     altogether    non-conducting   ;  the

to be observed — viz., the effects due to continuous action of radiation.
The  time of exposure is accurately measured by counting the indi
vidual flashes of radiation, due to interruption of the primary current
in the Ruhmkorff coil by a tapping key.        The conductivity of the
substance at a given moment is inferred from the deflection of the
galvanometer in circuit with the receiver.     When feeble radiation is
used,   it takes an inconveniently
                                 long time to obtain reversals ; there
is,besides,  tendency of self-recovery in the receiver.

produced a negative deflection of five divisions, the fourth flash pro
duced + 5, the fifth flash gave            -  90 divisions, and the sixth flash a
deflection of + 90.         The reversals followed           each   other almost regu
larly, till the substance became insensitive.
    III. Lastly, we may have a class of substances where the conver
sion from one state to the other is not complete. Here, again, we get
two sub-divisions, owing to the distinction between positive and
negative substances.
   Taking first the case of a positive substance (see fig. 4 (/J) ), the
original conductivity of which is represented by a, the action of the
first few flashes of radiation would be to produce a great increase of
conductivity by the formation of B variety ; the next flashes convert

to the right shows that at the inert stage, b, the substance as a whole
ought to become more conducting the fresh specimen, a.

        will now consider the                    case of a negative substance               exhibiting
damping ; arsenic will be taken                      as an example          where the damping               is
not so great as in the case of iron.
  Fig. 7 represents the actual curve obtained with arsenic (compare
with the hypothetical curve for a negative substance, fig. 4 (a) ).
     It will    be observed        that      the substance      in fatigued state

whole, less conducting than in the               fresh condition, as we were led to expect
from the hypothetical curve.                    It will also be seen that the oscillations
are very regular towards the end.   The curves given in figs.     and                            6          7

 however, evident that in substances exhibiting damping, two opposite
 electric conditions are induced in fatigued specimens    the positive                ;
 becomes on the whole more conducting and the negative less con
 ducting than in the fresh specimens. At the inert stage the rate of
 mutual conversion from one state to the other probably becomes equal,
 and the apparent fatigue  thus not due to the absolute want of sensi

   We may now apply     some    further crucial tests to verify the supposi
tions made above.

470      Prof. J. C. Bose.      On Electric Touch and tlie Molecular
             Restoration   of Sensitiveness to a Fatigued Substance.
    It was said that the inertness of the substance, after long exposure,
is due to the presence of a relatively large amount of strained B variety.
It therefore follows that if by any means we can transform B into A,
then after such a transformation there ought to be a restoration of
the sensitiveness.     It has also been stated that the B variety under
ordinary circumstances is less stable than A. If now we apply a
disturbing cause which is unilateral in its action — that is to say, if it
converts   B into A and not A into B— then such              a  disturbing cause
will resensitise the fatigued substance.
   Effect of Mechanical Disturbance.
                                        — Of the unilateral actions, mechani
cal vibration is one ; for it is known that by the action of friction a
substance may pass from one modification to another in one direction
only.     Thus the change of monoclinic into rhombic variety of sulphur
is hastened by scratching with a glass rod, but the change does not
take place in the opposite direction.          We may now apply the crucial
tests. Mechanical vibration will transform B into A, and with posi
tive fatigued substances this ought to produce an increase of resistance
(as A is less conducting than B) ; with negative substances the same
disturbance ought to produce a diminution of resistance.
   Effect of Heat.
                    — There are other methods by which the B variety
may be transformed into A ; the more subtle molecular disturbance due
to heat may be expected to be even more effective in producing the
transformation.     Here, too, the crucial test is that by slight heating the
fatigued positive substance ought to show an increase of resistance,
and the negative substance a diminution of resistance.                   The two
following curves (figs. 8 and 9) confirm in a remarkable manner my
anticipations.
   Effect of Heat and Mechunical Disturbance         on. a Positive Fatigued Sub
stance. — I shall at first deal with the curve for iron.            At  the end of
No.   6 curve, the substance was left in the inert stage        b.   While in this
state, the receiver was heated to a slight extent.                 Observe in the
dotted portion of the curve the sudden fall of conductivity (increase
of resistance).    I should like to say here, that, though the fall has
been indicated by a straight line, as representing the somewhat sudden
fall of conductivity,    I sometimes noticed on careful inspection a slight
oscillatory movement of the galvanometer spot during this process.
The significance of this I will notice on a future occasion.              The ulti
mate effect of slight heating (excess of heat produces other complica
tions) is the restoration of the original reduced conductivity.             If the
application of heat transforms B into A, we may expect the substance
to regain its sensitiveness, which it lost in the fatigued stage b. The
receiver was now exposed to radiation, and it at once responded,
exhibiting almost its original sensibility.       Observe how the subsequent

               Changes produced in Matter by Electric Waves.                      471
portion of the curve is a repetition             of the curve No. 6, and how the
substance arrives       at the second       fatigued     state V.    To observe    the

 effect of mechanical disturbance a gentle tap was given to the receiver,
 and at once there was produced an increase of resistance due to the
 transformation of B into A, the receiver regaining its sensitiveness by
 the transformation.        The action of radiation was continued, and after
 a few reversals the substance once           more arrived at the third fatigued
 state,  b".    The process described above could            be repeated any number
 of times.
       Effect  of Heat and Mechanical      Disturbance     on a Negative Fatigued
                                       Substance.
     Experiments similar to the above were carried out with an arsenic
 receiver.      From the curve given below (fig. 9) it is seen that the
 reaction of the negative substance is in every respect opposite to that
 of a positive substance. It will be noticed that the same cause — i.e.,
 heating or tapping      — produces,   as necessary consequences of the hypo
 theses previously      stated, two opposite reactions in the two classes of
 substance.       I have been able to verify this deduction by observations
 with nearly      a dozen different      substances, and have not, so far, come
 across any to contradict it.         It thus appears that tapping restores the
 sensitiveness not by the separation of the electrically-welded particles
 (in which case tapping ought to have produced an increase of resist

472       Prof.   J.   C. Bose.     On Electric Touch and live Molecular
ance  in both the classes of fatigued substance), but by removing the
strain in B and thus converting it into A.
   The effect of electric radiation is thus to produce rearrangement of
atoms and molecules in a substance ; so does light produce new
atomic and molecular aggregation in a photographic plate — a subject
to be dealt with in detail in a future paper. Some of my audience at
the Royal Institution (January, 1897) may remember my attempt at
explaining the action of the so-called coherers (which, perhaps, may be
better described as " molecular receivers ") by analogy with the photo
graphic action.  I had then no proofs for the assertion. I have since
been able to obtain experimental evidence                    that the two phenomena are
                                       Time   of Exposure.

identical.      The coherer may therefore be regarded as a linear photo
graphic      plate; since we are more likely to understand the complex
photographic action from the consideration of the much simpler action
of electric radiation on elementary substances, where the effects are not
complicated by secondary reactions, a photographic plate may be
regarded as merely an assemblage of
                                         " molecular receivers." I
                                                                     hope
also to prove that nearly all the detectors of radiation are molecular
receivers in reality. The investigation of this aspect of the subject
has given me some extraordinary results ; they seem to connect
together many phenomena which at first sight do not seem to have
anything in common. Another interesting question, the consideration
of which has for the present to be postponed,  Why               is,
                                                           that the          is   it

   (1) That ether waves produce molecular changes in matter.
   (2) That the molecular or allotropic changes are attended             with
         changes    of electric conductivity, and this explains the action
         of the so-called coherers.
   (3) That there are two classes of substances, positive and negative,
        which exhibit opposite variations of conductivity under the
         action of radiation.
   (4) That the production         of  a particular  allotropic modification
         depends on      the intensity   and  duration of incident electric
         radiation.
   (5) That the continuous action of radiation          produces oscillatory
         changes in the molecular structure.
    (6) That these periodic     changes are evidenced by the corresponding
         electric reversals.
    (7) That the "fatigue" is due to the presence of the "radiation
         product," or strained B variety.
    (8) That   by means of mechanical disturbance or heat, the strained
         product can be transformed into the normal form, and the
         sensitiveness may thereby be restored.
   The    method     described   above of detecting    molecular changes is
extraordinarily dolicate, and is full of promise in many lines of inquiry
in molecular physics. It is also seen that the phenomenon of contact
sensitiveness, contrary to previous suppositions, is perfectly regular.
There is no capriciousness in the response of sensitive substances to the
external stimuli, which may be mechanical, thermal, or electric.         The
curves given above show it ; but they fail to give a fair idea of the rich
ness and variety of the molecular phenomena, seen as it were reflected
in the fluttering galvanometer spot of light ; of the transitory varia
tions, of the curious molecular hesitation at critical times as to the
choice of the structure to be adopted, and of the molecular inertia by
which the newly-formed structure is carried beyond the position of
stability, and the subsequent creeping back to the more stable position.
The varieties of phenomena are unlimited, for we have in each sub
stance to take account of the peculiarity of its chemical constitution,
the nature     of its response to ether waves, the lag and molecular
viscosity. All these combined give to each substance its peculiar charac
teristic curve ; it is not unlikely that these curves may give us much
information as to the chemical nature arid the physical condition of the
different substances.       I am at present trying to arrange an apparatus
which will, by means of the pulsating galvanometer spot of light,
automatically record the various molecular transformations caused by
the action of external forces.
   Before concluding, I take this opportunity of expressing my grateful
acknowledgments        to the Royal Society for the encouragement T

College.    I  may say that the difficulties have been very numerous and
disheartening, and that without this encouragement the work which it
has been    my good fortune to carry out would in all probability have
remained unaccomplished.          The Government of Bengal has also been
pleased to evince a generous interest in these investigations.            My
assistant, Mr. Jagadindu Ray, and my pupils, Messrs. P.         K. Sen, B.A.,

"
   Contributions     to the Comparative Anatomy of the Mammalian
       Eye, chielly based on Ophthalmoscopic Examination."                By
       George Lindsay Johnson, M.D., E.R.C.S.                 Communicated
       by Hans Gadow, F.R.S.            Received May 7,— Read May 17,
       1900.
                                   (Abstract.)
    Observations were made on the eye of the living animal, 181 dif
ferent species being examined, and frequently several individuals of the
same species.      The species comprise representatives of all the Mam
 malian orders except the Cetacea and Sirenia.
    The conclusions arrived at can be summed up as follows : —
    The colour of the Fundus oculi in animals devoid of a Tapetum is
 mainly determined by reflection from the choroidal pigment ; in those
with   a Tapetum     cellulosum   (Carnivores) by the colour of the retinal
pigment ;     in those with     a   Tapetum fibrosum (Ungulates)       by the
structural   colour of the Tapetum modified by the colour of the retinal
pigment.      All the animals examined may be classed under three types
 — red, yellow, and green.
    The vascularisation of the retina can be summarised as follows : —
    1. Indirect supply by means of osmosis from the vessels of neigh
 bouring parts.       A. Hyaloid supply.         («) The corpus vitreum is
 nourished by a processus falciformis, the hyaloid vessels lying well
 inside the corpus vitreum (Elasmobranchs).           (b) The hyaloid vessels
 spread  over   the surface  of the  corpus vitreum,  being in consequence in
 the immediate vicinity of the retina (e.g., holosteus and many tele-
 osteous fishes).    Hereto belong also the Amphibia and most of the
 Reptiles devoid of a pecten.       B. Choroidal supply.     This is probably
 the chief supply     of the retina in those animals which possess a well-
 developed     pecten (most Sauropsida), but are devoid of superficial
 hyaloid vessels.      This choroidal supply by osmosis is also with cer
 tainty demonstrated in the Mammalia for at least part of the thickness
 of the retina.
    2. Direct supply.      A. From the superficial hyaloid vessels.    This is

              Comparative   Anatomy of      the Mammalian Eye                475
known to be the case when the hyaloid vessels are directly continued
into the retina, where they produce two vascular layers.              B. From
special retinal vessels cumulating in the art. centralis.        This mode is
restricted to the Mammalia and some of the Snakes.
    The vessels of the falciform process of the fishes and the central
hyaline artery, wherever this occurs, are essentially the same.              The
falciform   process and the pecten are analogous, but not homologous,
structures.    In Eeptiles and Birds the hyaloid artery is superseded by
a new development, viz., the Pectinal system.           In some of the lower
Mammalia both systems actually occur side by side, but both are
rendered unnecessary by the development of a third system of supply,
viz., special retinal vessels, which ultimately culminate in the posses
sion of an art. and vena centralis retinae.
    Some of the normal conditions observable in certain animals closely resemble
those which we find in Man as congenital defects or vestigial relics.          1.
 Membrana nictitans.       A fully developed nictitating membrane active
enough to sweep the whole cornea, exists only in the Ungulata, and
 not even throughout this order.       In the Carnivora and Marsupials it
is much less developed, whilst throughout the Primates, Bodents, Eden
 tata, and Echidna it is still more reduced, and, with rare exceptions,
 entirely without movement. The primary use of this third lid, viz.,
that of cleaning the corneal surface, is lost within the class of the
 Mammalia, and seems to serve chiefly to protect the eye in the animals
which graze and poke their heads down into the long and sharp grass.
 2. The retractor muscle of the eyeball is of frequent occurrence, chiefly
 in Marsupials, Edentates, Bodents, and Ungulates, i.e., in the lower
 orders of Mammals.       3. Opaque nerve fibres.       All stages of opacity
occur congenitally in Man, and are to be found normally throughout
 the Mammalia.       Opaque nerve fibres are most marked in some of
the Bodents      and Marsupials.     4. Physiological     cup and congenital
discoloration of the disc frequently occur          in Man.    An appearance
 similar to the physiological cup occurs in all the Felida?, and in a con
siderable number of the other Carnivora ; also in the Flying Squirrels
and some of the other Bodents.         White and grey discs occur normally
in a number of animals widely separated in classification, such as the
Skunk, Bhinoceros, Porcupine, Armadillo, and Echidna.            5. Structures
protruding from       the  disc into the     corpus vitreum.    A. Persistent
 hyaline artery.     This congenital defect in Man is found as a normal
 condition in nearly all the Buminants and in a large number of
 Bodents.     B. Vestiges of a pecten. In some of the Bodents, more
 especially  in all the Agoutis, a button-shaped vascular pigmented
 rudimentary pecten protrudes from the disc into the vitreous.              It is
 remarkable to find in the Mammalia a relic of this Sauropsidan organ.
In   a number of Marsupials vascular protuberances from the disc into
 the vitreous occur in different forms.       6. Colobomata.    The papillary

476              Dr. G. L. Johnson.          Contributions   to the
coloboma (Fuchs' Coloboma) has its analogy in a white or coloured
scleral ring, which is normally met with in a large number of animals.
7. Retinitis pigmentosa.        In the Galagos and Lorides a spreading of
pigment occurs circumferentially         in the retina, which greatly resembles
Retinitis pigmentosa.       If   these    nocturnal animals are exposed for
prolonged periods to daylight the pigment advances concentrically,
similar to the manner in which it progresses in Man, so that the
animals gradually go blind.         8. Visible choroidal vessels and stippled
fundus.     Visible choroidal     vessels   occur in most of the Simian below
Hylobates,     and in a number        of   the  other orders.     They are most
marked in the Macropodidae, and some of the other Marsupials, which
present the appearance observable in the extreme cases of the analogous
congenital defect in Man.           Stippled fundi are found in the feline
Douroucouli and in the Lemurs, an appearance occasionally met with
in Man. 9. Ectropion of the Uvea. In a number of the Ungulates,
which have large oval pupils, pigmented excrescences of the iris are
met with, and these evidently serve to screen the eye against glare,
since their pupils only contract moderately to light. In the Hyracoidse
we meet    with  a distinct specialised organ, which can be projected         from
the iris towards the cornea, like a small screen, and this          I  propose to
call the " Umbraculum."
    The divergence of tlie optic axes follows the classification to a marked
degree.     The higher the order the nearer the axes approach parallel
vision.    Parallel vision with the power of convergence only occurs in
those animals which possess a true macula, viz., Man and all the
Simiae.    In other words, convergence appears to           be the necessary   out
come of a macula.       This macula, which is bounded by a reflex ring,
exists in all the Simiae without exception, and in no other Mammals,
so that it ceases with the last of the Simiae.
    If we eliminate the domestic animals in which the refraction varies
over considerable limits in all directions, we find throughout the
Mammalia, with a few notable exceptions, vision is hypermetropic.
The    eyes of amphibious and marine Mammals are adapted             for vision in
two ways.       Those which live in fresh water have immensely developed
ciliary   muscles   and proportionally increased accommodative power,
enabling    them   to compensate for the loss of the refractive power of
the cornea when the eye is submerged.                  In the marine Mammals,
i.e., Pinnipedia and Cetacea, not only            is this ciliary muscle greatly
developed, but there is always a large area of the cornea which is
flattened in the horizontal meridian, producing an extraordinary degree
of astigmatism.
    Binocular Vision. — It seems that        if Mammals below the     Simiae have
binocular vision, they do not rely entirely on it. With the exception
of Man and the Simiae, Mammals very rarely move their eyes for the
purposes of vision, but move their heads instead.

               Comparative     Anatomy of     the Mammalian Eye.           477
     In all the Mammals below the       Simiae which have no macula we find a
larger   sensitive area.    Sensitive areas of restricted dimensions, omitting
those cases in which the area is limited to a macula, exist in the
Carnivora, in which order the divergence is not great.            In the Ungu
lates, Eodents, Edentates, and Marsupials, where we find great diver
gence of the axes, large cornese, and nearly spherical lenses, the
sensitive areas are larger, and probably the degree of difference in
perception over such areas, compared with the more peripheral parts, is
 but little.
     The great transparency of the retina and the extreme brilliancy of
 the reflecting surface of the choroid in the vast majority of Mammals,
 and an extraordinary         prevalence of colours of every hue, lead one
 irresistibly    to  the  conclusion  that the rays of light do not form an
 image on the retina as usually taught, but that the image is formed
 behind     the retina on the brilliant surface of the Tapetum or fusca
 pigment layer of the choroid, and is then reflected back on to tho
 terminals of the baeillary layer.        This arrangement for vision certainly
  bears a close resemblance to Lippmann's method of obtaining coloured
 negatives.       He obtained negatives in natural colours by placing a
 reflecting mercury surface in direct contact with the sensitive film, thus
  reflecting the light which had traversed the film on to the particles of
  sensitised    silver.    In  the eye the light passes through the nearly
  transparent retina (which is analogous to the photographic film) to be
  reflected from the Tapetum, or choroidal pigment, on to the terminals
  of the retinal elements (which may be compared to the particles of
  silver   haloid).     In Lippmann's     device the colours are produced    by
  interference.       If we venture    to carry our analogy still further,   we
   may presume       the  same occurs in the eye.       One difference between
  the two methods is that in nature the reflecting surface is always
  coloured, and only reflects a portion of the incident light. The colour
   of the fundus, however, is remarkable for the absence of blues and
   violets and the great prominence of red, yellow, and green colours.
   Yellow and orange are the prevailing colours in nocturnal animals.
   The peripheral area, which is characteristic of animals possessing a
   Tapetum, is usually dark brown, and reflects but feebly. It is probably
   nearly insensible to light, as     it never occurs in animals having great
   divergence of the optic axes.
       The   eye is no exception      to the rule    that domestication  greatly
   increases variability.     The colour of the Fundus oculi of domesticated
   races differs not only from that of the wild species from which the
   races are supposed to be derived, but the colour varies also individually,
   an occurrence almost unknown in wild .species.              The influence of
    domestication     is also indicated   by the frequent occurrence of myopia
    and astigmatism.       Myopia is almost unknown in wild animals, but it
    may occur in wild specimens which have long been kept in captivity.

478       Mr. L. Hill,       Thf Influence of Increased AtmospJieric
    Although no sound damfication can be based on one single organ, a
striking concordance exists between an attempted arrangement of the
 Mammalia according to the Fundus oculi and the most modern classifi
 cation. The cases of disagreement are wonderfully few.                   These are
 restricted to the following : —
    Chrysothrix leans towards the Arctopitheci.               I find it necessary to
separate the Galagos from the rest of the Lemurs — at least, as a sub
 family.    In the smaller Carnivores it       is advisable to establish a separate
family, the Cynirtulu', to include the otherwise viverrine genera, Cynictis
and Galictis, together with Mephitis, hitherto placed with the Mus-
telidse.    The Sciuromorpha should         be divided    into Sciuridse and Ptero-
myidae, and Castor should decidedly be removed into the Hystricomorpha
group, perhaps into the vicinity of the Octodontidse.                 The Bats rank
very low so far as the eye is concerned, possibly on account of their
nocturnal     habits.    Among      the Marsupials         the Diprotodontia are
decidedly lower than the Polyprotodontia chiefly on account of the
high degree of development of the eyes of the Didelphidse and
 Dasyurida;.     Since we meet with genera of the lowest type along with
others of the highest type of retinal vascularisation, and again some
 without and others with the additional relic or specialisation of a
Tapetum, it follows that the details of the vascularisation and of the
Tapetum have been developed independently in the various main
branches of the Mammalia.
    In fine, the whole Fundus oculi affords a striking illustration of the
working of progressive evolution, an example all the more valuable,
since it illustrates the direct modifying effect of external factors upon
a  highly specialised organ — in      the present case the continued       influence
of light upon the eye.

    Paul Bert* recorded the arterial pressure in two dogs which he
introduced, together with the kymograph, into a chamber, and sub
mitted to a + pressure of 53 cm. Hg. The atmospheric pressure was
raised to this height in the course of three-quarters of an hour.                The
mean arterial pressure rose in one dog 16 mm. Hg., in the other
40 mm. Hg. ; the pulse frequency fell in the first from 216 to 200,
and the respiration from 41 to 29 per minute.                The respiratory oscil
lations of blood-pressure became increased. Bert ascribes the results

                                                       —
from the compression of the intestinal gas and the consequent in
creased    play of    the  intrathoracic    organs. He was confirmed in this
opinion by the fact that         the substitution of oxygen for air made no
difference in the results.
    A. Smith* attributes the symptoms which arise in caisson workers
partly to the effect of the increased pressure on the nervous tissue,
and partly to the congestion of the blood in the neural axis.               He sup
poses that the blood is driven by the compressed air from the periphery
 to the cranio-vertebral cavity.         This mechanical explanation of caisson
disease is contrary to the supposition which, theoretically, seems cor
rect, viz., that the atmospheric pressure is equally transmitted by the
blood to all parts.
    I  have pitt the matter to the test of experiment.
    Method. — An anaesthetised dog or cat is placed at the bottom of an
autoclave after the insertion of a cannula in the carotid artery, and, in
some     cases, of one in     the vena cava superior, has been carried out.
 The cannulas      are connected with Hg. monometers, and these, together
 with a slow-movement recording drum, are also placed in the autoclave.
    The drum is then started and the monometers set to record the
 arterial and venous pressures. The lid of the autoclave is next screwed
 on, an oxygen bottle connected with the inlet tube and the pressure in
 the autoclave rapidly raised to + two atmospheres (30 lbs.). The
 outlet tap is finally opened, the pressure rapidly lowered, the lid taken
 off, and the record observed. The times of increasing and diminishing
 atmospheric pressure are noted with a watch.                The whole operation
 only takes two or three minutes.
    Remits— Although exposed to this rapid change of atmospheric pres
 sure, the circulation of the blood scarcely varies. The arterial pressure
 and venous pressures either continue at the same level or very slightly
 fall.   The respiratory oscillations are increased, and the pulse becomes
 slightly less frequent.       The gas injected contains, roughly, 80 per cent,
 oxygen, and thus the oxygen tension is raised from 21 per cent, to about
  190 per cent, of an atmosphere.             The results are the same whether
 compressed air or oxygen are employed.

 untenable.

    1.  Cerebral Ancemia produced by Immobilisation in the Erect Posture.
   Many hutch rabbits when immobilised in the erect posture become
convulsed and after a short period of time die (10' — 20') from failure
of respiration.*
   The blood,      owing to its weight, congests within the abdominal
vessels,   while   the abdominal viscera drag on and so kink the vena
cava inferior.     The heart, therefore, gradually empties, and the cere
bral circidation ceases.        These results are due to the flaccid and
atonic nature of the abdominal wall of the hutch rabbits.             Chloralisa-
tion hastens the onset of death by dilating the arteries and by stopping
the convulsions, for the spasms help to return the venous blood to the
heart. Compression of the abdomen by a bandage, or immersion of
the animal     in a bath of water up to the neck, entirely prevents the
onset of symptoms.         In the case of the bath the hydrostatic pressure
of the water outside balances, but not completely, the hydrostatic
pressure of the blood within. At the same time the water causes the
viscera to float upwards, and so removes the kinking of the vena cava
inferior.
   Wild rabbits, owing to the better tone of their abdominal muscles,
arc not affected by immobilisation in the erect posture until after the
lapse of some hours, and the same is the case in respect of dogs, cats,
and monkeys.         When the tone of the skeletal and vascular muscle
becomes exhausted       in  these animals, owing to exposure, shock,      &c, or
is abolished     by  anaesthetics,   the blood congests to the lower parts.
Death finally results from cerebral anaemia.              Immersion in a bath or
compression of the abdomen has the same restorative effect on the circu
lation of these animals as on that of the hutch rabbit.
   Intense congestion and cedema of the lower parts, accompanied by
thirst, is said to occur in men under like conditions,             and death no
doubt results from cerebral anaemia.
   Hutch rabbits, when thrown into syncope by immobilisation in the
erect posture, recover almost immediately on their return to the hori
zontal position, or on immersion in a bath, or on compression of the
abdomen. The animals when returned to the horizontal posture may

pupils' light reflex may have                 been abolished for 15' — 20'.
              2. Cortical Excitability after Ligation                 of    Cerebral Arteries.
     The author        has produced         clonic spasms in himself by
                                                 contra-lateral
sudden   compression                 of    one
                                       artery.    Consciousness of the
                                                   carotid
cortical discharge arises from the sensations received from the parts
in movement. The cortical discharge itself is unaccompanied with
consciousness.
     The     cortex        cerebri    of      dogs remains excitable and even hyper-
excitable      to electrical              excitation after both carotid and ¦ vertebral
arteries have been tied.                    The brain under these conditions is supplied
with blood by the branches of the superior                     intercostal artery which
enter the anterior spinal artery.
     The brain       is,
                 however, rendered profoundly anaemic by the operation,
and the animals are in consequence rendered more or less demented,
anaesthetic, and paralysed. The paralysis results from block established           a
by the  anaemia in the sensory projection, and association fields of the
cortex cerebri for the motor cells are unaffected, in so far as not only
purposive movements but typical fits can be excited on stimulating the
" motor area." The " motor centres " are clearly not autonomous, and
these experiments confirm the previous deductions concerning the origin
of the paralysis which was obtained by Mott and Sherrington after divi
sion of the posterior nerve-roots of a limb, and by Exner after circum-
vallation of the cortex.   Isolation of the cortical motor cells from
sensory impulses produces paralysis, although the cells remain directly
excitable.
  In many monkeys the two carotids, and even the two carotid and
one vertebral artery, can be tied without lessening the cortical excit
ability. The ligation of all four arteries  followed within one minute
                                                                 is
by loss of cortical excitability. In some monkeys (especially those in
bad condition) ligation of both carotids abolishes the excitability.
        3.   The Effect      of   Absintlw after Ligation             of   the Cerebral   Arteries.
     The     injection       of      absinthe,         after   ligation       of   the four      cerebral
arteries    in cats and of the two carotid arteries in monkeys, produces
as a rule    only extensor rigidity of the fore limbs and dyspnoeic respira
tion.      No clonic convulsions occur. On loosening the carotids violent
clonic and tonic convulsions ensue, and these can be again cut short by
re-clamping the carotids.   So soon as the carotids are re-clamped, the
extensor      rigidity reappears.                 It    is   deduced from
                                                              these experiments
that clonus       is   of cortical, and tonus of sub-cortical, and probably of
cerebellar, origin.

482            Mr. L. Hill.     On Cerebral Anccmia and the
   4. The Late. Effects which follow Ligation of the Four Cerebral Arteries.
    These vary in different animals.       Almost all rabbits die from failure
of respiration within three minutes, after convulsions of an asphyxia]
type.     There occur vagal inhibition of the heart, general vaso-constric-
tion, and a high arterial pressure, prior to the failure of the circulatory
system. The symptoms are in every way similar to those produced by
clamping the trachea.
    Cats become comatose and die within a few hours from respiratory
paralysis,, which is gradual in onset. Cheyne Stokes respiration some
times results, and at a later stage long-drawn spasmodic gasps of the
diaphragm occur at rare intervals.           Extensor rigidity often occurs
before death. Cats may survive the ligation of the two carotids and
one vertebral artery.
    Dogs recover from ligation of the four cerebral arteries, some after
scarcely any symptoms, others after passing through a stage of
dementia, accompanied by paralysis and anaesthesia, which lasts three
or four days. The dogs during this period of dementia behave exactly
like the dogs in which Goltz produced extensive destruction of the
cerebrum.      The spatial sensations depending on the nerves of skin,
joints, and muscles are no longer brought into association with the
 sensations which are derived from the higher senses.           Reflex defence
and locomotor movements alone persist.              Monkeys almost all die
within twenty-four hours after ligation of the two carotids and one
vertebral artery.      The animals become soporose and then comatose.
 Extensor spasms, extensor rigidity, and failure of respiration follow.
Monkeys recover without symptoms after ligation of both carotids.
    In  one monkey, after the two carotids and one vertebral artery had
been tied, there ensued extensor        rigidity and profound    paralysis and
dementia.      This animal was kept alive by spoon feeding and continued
 in the same state.     It was killed on the fifth day. The stage of sopor
 and coma or dementia may not appear in dogs or monkeys for an
 hour or so after the ligation of the arteries has been effected.            On
 recovering   from   the anaesthetic  the animals may at first appear lively
 and intelligent.
     In man the ligation of one carotid artery is not free from risk, while
 the ligation of both carotids is recognised as a most dangerous opera
 tion.    The two arteries can be tied successfully at intervals of time.
     Attention is more particularly drawn to the following conclusions
 deduced from this research : —
     1. The cerebral circulation of man, in the erect posture, depends on
 the tone and activity of the skeletal and respiratory muscles. The
 blood and lymph are returned from the lower parts to the heart by
  the expressive action of the muscles and constant change of posture.
     2. The functions of the brain may continue after       a great diminution

          Effects which follow Ligation     of tlie Cerebral Arteries.     483
in blood supply.       This substantiates previous work of the author in
regard    to the   slight metabolism of the brain as measured by the
exchange in blood gases.        At the same time it does not favour the
anaemic theory of sleep.
    3. The electrical excitability of the motor area of the cortex cerebri
persists when the sensory side of the brain is to a large extent para
lysed, and the animals rendered more or less demented by profound
cerebral anaemia.
    4. The functions     of the brain    rapidly return so soon as efficient
 anastomosis is established.         The period of partial paralysis and
dementia lasts in dogs two or three days.          Eabbits recover after the
                                            —
 pupil reflex has been abolished for 15" 20".
    5. The limits between the degree of anaemia required to produce
dementia and that which paralyses the respiratory centre are extremely
 narrow.     For example, monkeys recover witliout symptoms after ligation
of both carotids, but    as a rule   die after ligation of both carotids   and
 one vertebral artery.
    6. There is considerable variation in the number of arteries which
 can be safely tied in various animals, e.g., in man, birds, goats, and
 horses (Mayer) one carotid ; in monkeys both carotids ; in rabbits and
 cats both carotids and often both carotids and one vertebral ; in dogs
 both carotids and both vertebrals.
    7. The four cerebral arteries can be safely tied in monkeys in
 successive operations.
    8. The cortex cerebri is the place of discharge of clonic convulsions.
 Tonus is of sub-cortical origin.      The clonic stage of an epileptic fit can
 be cut short by compression of both carotid arteries.
    Dr. Mott, to whom I am greatly indebted for help and advice in
 this research, has determined by microscopical examination of the
 anaemic brains by Nissl's method, that —
    1.  The cortical cells in the brains of the demented animals are
 swollen and diffusely stained.      The stichochrome granules are absent.
 The nuclei are swollen.      The veins are congested and there may occur
 haemorrhages in the cortex.
    2. The large pyramidal     cells are least affected.
    3.  The   changes   occur very    rapidly after ligation of the cerebral
 arteries, and disappear synchronously with the recovery of the animals
 from the stage of dementia.
    In the case of the monkey, described above, the cerebrum was
 softened in patches, many of the cortical cells were degenerated, and
 there were signs of active phagocytosis.          No changes in the neurons
 were displayed by the Golgi method.

were obtained from the meteorological and hydrographical departments
of the countries bordering on the North Atlantic, and special arrange
ments were made with the officers     of a number of ships for the con
tinuous supply of samples of surface waters for analysis.
   The salinity of the samples obtained was determined by volumetric
estimations of the amount of chlorine present.        Over 4,000 samples
were dealt with in this way, and special attention was devoted to
ascertaining the accuracy of the methods employed.       A large number
of estimations were also made of sulphates present in the waters, and
the limits of variation from a definite ratio of chloride salinity to
sidphate salinity determined.
   The specific gravity of over 500 of the samples was determined with
the pyknometer, and a formula connecting the results of these deter
minations with the salinities derived from chlorines investigated.
   The numerical results of the chemical and physical determinations
are exhibited in a table, forming a substantial addition to the material
available for the discussion of oceanographical problems of this kind.
   The principal conclusions arrived at with reference to the circulation
may be summed up as follows : —
   1. The surface waters along the whole of the eastern seaboard of
North America north of (about) lat.    30°  N, consisting partly of water
brought from the equatorial currents by the Gulf Stream, and partly
of water brought down by the Labrador current, are drifted eastward
across the Atlantic towards sonth-western Europe, and banked up
against the land outside the continental shelf.   This continues all the
year round, but it is strongest in summer, when the Atlantic anti
cyclone attains its greatest size and intensity ; and the proportion of
Gulf Stream water is greatest at that season.
   2. The drifts in the northern part of the Atlantic area are under the
control of the cyclones crossing it. The circulation set up accordingly
reaches its maximum intensity in winter, and almost dies out in
summer. In winter the drifts tend to the south-eastward from' the

                 Surface    Waters     of the North Atlantic      Ocean.           485
mouth  of Davis Strait, eastward in mid- Atlantic, and north-eastward
in the eastern region. In spring and autumn the movement is more
easterly over the whole distance, and a larger quantity of water from
the Labrador stream is therefore carried eastward.
  3. The water banked up in the manner described in (1) escapes
partly downwards, partly southwards, and partly northwards.         It
occupies the whole of the eastern  basin of the North Atlantic, and to
the north  it extends westward to Davis Strait, being confined below
300 fathoms depth by the ridges connecting Europe, the Faeroes,
Iceland, and Greenland.   Above that level it escapes northward by a
strong current through the Faeroe-Shetland       Channel and between
Faeroe and Iceland, and by the two branches of the Irminger stream,
one west of Iceland the other west of Greenland.
   (As it seems desirable that this northerly current should have a
distinctive name, it might be well to call it the European stream, and
its branches the Norwegian, Irminger, and Greenland streams respec
tively.)
   The strength and volume of the European stream is liable to con
siderable variation, according to the form and position of the Atlantic
anti-cyclone, which causes the amount of banked up water, and the
proportions escaping northward and southward, to vary.   It is also
modified by the strength and direction of the surface drifts in its
course.     It   is,
               however, always strongest in summer.
   4.The Norwegian stream         by far the largest branch of the
                                         is
European,  and   traverses
                       it  the Norwegian    Sea and enters the Arctic
Ocean.   The warm water thus sent northward melts enormous quan
tities of ice, and the fresh water derived from the ice moves southward
in autumn, chiefly in a wide surface current, between Iceland and Jan
May en, which may entirely cover other parts of the Norwegian
stream. Part of the surface water also comes southward through the
Denmark      Strait, but the amount                is much smaller, probably    chiefly
because   the melting       of the ice        is   slower, and the channel is   longer
blocked.
   The Greenland branch of the European current also causes melting
of ice in Davis Strait, but the warm winds from the American con
tinent and the water received from the land are probably more effective
in increasing the volume of the Labrador current.
   5. The water from the melted ice        spread over the surface of the
                                                        is
North Atlantic during late autumn and winter by the increasing
drift circulation, and        gradually absorbed by mixing with the
                             it   is
underlying water.
   6. The circulation described      liable to extensive irregular varia
                                          is
tions, corresponding to variations in the atmospheric circulation.

" Paleolithic Man in Africa."
                              By Sir John Evans, K.C.B., F.E.S.
              Received May 15,— Eead May 31, 1900.
      In April,    1896,   just four years    ago,     I   ventured to call the attention
of the Society* to some palaeolithic implements found in Somaliland
by Mr. H. W. Seton-Karr. In doing so, I pointed out the absolute
identity in form of these implements with those from the valley of the
Somme and numerous other pleistocene deposits in Northwestern
Europe and elsewhere ; and I cited others from the high land adjoining
the valley of the Nile and from other places in Northern and Southern
Africa. I was at the same time careful to point out that though there
could be no doubt as to this identity in form, no fossil mammalian or
othor remains had been found with these African implements.       I did
not, however, hesitate in claiming them as palaeolithic.
   Since the publication of my short note, an extensive collection of
stone implements formed in Egypt by Mr. H. W. Seton-Karr has been
acquired by the Mayer Museum at Liverpool. I have not had an
opportunity of examining the specimens, but a detailed accountf of
them, with numerous illustrations, has been published by the Director
of the Liverpool Museums, Dr. H. 0. Forbes.        The majority of the
implements are of Neolithic Age or even of more recent date, and with
the account of these I need not here concern myself ; but the author is
at considerable pains to dispute my view that the instruments of palaeo
lithic forms belong to the Palaeolithic Period.  As he says, Mr. Seton-
Karr's statement that he sometimes found spear-heads " on the ground
surrounded by a mass of flakes and chips as though the people had
dropped their work and fled," is very suggestive and important.      He
adds, however, that " one such occurrence is almost sufficient in itself,
I venture to think, to disprove the high antiquity claimed by Sir
John Evans for these implements."
  Were it certain that the so-called spear-heads were really of                            palaeo
lithic form, and had the flakes and chips been fitted on to them so as to
reconstitute the original blocks of flint, as has been done in the case of
undoubted palaeolithic specimens by Mr. Spurrell and Mr. Worthing-
ton Smith, the question would still remain to be discussed as to the
condition of the localities in relation to subaerial denudation.
   It      is,
          however, hardly necessary to discuss these points, as some
recent discoveries made in Algeria will,     venture to think, go
                                                      I              long                 a
way towards settling the question.      propose, therefore, very briefly
                                                  I

                           Palaeolithic   Man in Africa.                       487
 of Oran, and about ten miles to the north of Tlemcen, on the plateau
 of Remchi, about a mile to the south of the River Isser, lies a small
 lake known as Lac Kar&r. It occupies a depression in lacustrine
 limestone of comparatively recent geological date, superimposed on
 beds   of Lower Miocene Age.            The level of the water, which is some
  15° centigrade warmer than that of the ordinary springs of the dis
 trict, and appears to    be derived from some deep-seated        source, seems to
 be about 600 feet higher than that of the River Isser.                  The lake
 originally filled a much larger part of the depression than it now does,
 and from its old bed a considerable amount of material has of late
 years been extracted for the Service des Ponts et Chaussees.                 This
 material consists of sand     and    gravel rich  in  iron pyrites, in the midst
 of which lie, pell-mell, bones of animals and stone implements fashioned
 by the hand of man.
    These have for some years been diligently collected by M. Louis
 Gentil,   a geologist, and form the subject of a memoir that has just ap
              '
 peared in l'Anthropologie
                                   '* by my friend M. Marcellin Boule, of the
 Galerie de Pal^ontologie at the Jardin des Plantes, Paris.             Some 200
 specimens of implements have been submitted to him, of various sizes,
 and all or nearly all of well-known palaeolithic forms, including several
 with a broad chisel-like end, of which examples have been found in
 the laterite of Madras and the gravels of Madrid. They are for the
 most part formed of an eocene quartzite, though some smaller speci
 mens of the type known as that of " le Moustier are formed of flint.
                                                            "
 The fades of these latter is not so distinctly palaeolithic as that of the
 former, of which some, through the kindness of M. Marcellin Boule,
 are exhibited.
    The most important        part of the discovery is that which relates to
 the mammalian remains found with the implements.                   These are of
 elephant,   rhinoceros,   horse,   hippopotamus, pig,    ox, sheep, and certain
 cervidse.    I will not detain the Society with the details given in
 M. Boule's memoir, but I may call attention to the fact that the
elephant is not the African elephant, but one more nearly related to
the quaternary      or even    pliocene elephants of Europe, to which the
designation Atlanticus       has been given.      Some teeth seem closely allied
to those of E. meridionalis and even E. armeniacus.             Having regard to
the whole fauna, M. Boule arrives at the conclusion that it is identical
with that of the fossiliferous         deposits of Algeria, which from their
topographical     or stratigraphical     characteristics have been assigned to
the Quaternary or Pleistocene Period.             He also cites other instances
in Algeria, such as Ternifine and a station near Aboukir, in which
palaeolithic implements have been found associated with the remains of
a similar pleistocene fauna.
    Altogether, these recent discoveries in Northern Africa tend immensely

488      Influence of Temperature of Liquid Hydrogen on Bacteria.
to strengthen my position with regard to the truly palaeolithic
character of the implements found in other parts of that vast con
tinent, and I am tempted to bring for comparison some few specimens
from     South    Africa. One of these, found by Mr. J. C. Rickard at the
junction of the Riet and Modder twenty years ago, is almost indis
tinguishable from those of the Lac Karar, as is also one from the
valley of the Embabaan in Swaziland.               But the most remarkable is an
implement of typically palaeolithic character found in 1873 under
9 feet of stratified beds at Process-fontein, Victoria West, by Mr. E. J.
Dunn.* May the day be not long distant when researches for the
implements of palaeolithic man may again be carried on, and trenches
be dug in South Africa for peaceful instead of warlike purposes.
"
   Influence of the Temperature of Liquid Hydrogen on Bacteria."
        By Allan Macfadyen, M.D., and Sydney Rowland, M.A.
        Communicated by           Lord Lister, P.R.S.           Received and read
        May 31, 1900.
    In a previous communication we have shown that the temperature
of liquid air has no appreciable effect upon the vitality of micro
organisms, even when they were exposed to this temperature for one
week (about       -  190° C.).t
    We have now been able to execute preliminary experiments pro
jected in our last paper as to the effect of a temperature as low as that
 of liquid hydrogen on bacterial life.          As the approximate temperature
of the air may be taken as 300° absolute, and liquid air as 80° absolute,
hydrogen as 21° absolute, the ratio of these temperatures roughly
is respectively as 15 : 4 : 1.        In other words, then, the temperature of
liquid hydrogen is about one-quarter that of liquid air, just as that of
liquid air is about one-quarter of that of the average mean tempera
ture.     In subjecting bacteria, therefore, to the temperature of liquid
hydrogen, we place them under conditions which, in severity of
 temperature, are as far removed from those of liquid air as are those
 of liquid air from that of the average summer temperature.                    By the
 kindness of Professor Dewar, the specimens of bacteria were cooled in
 liquid hydrogen         at the Royal Institution.        The following organisms
 were employed       :  Bac. acidi lartici, B. typhosus, B. diphtheria', Proteus vul
 garis, B.    anthracis,     B.  coli  communis,   Staphylococcus    pyogenes   aureus,
 Spirillum    cliolera:,  B.  phosphorescens,   B.  pyocyaneus,    a Sarcina,   and   a
yeast.

           Vapour-density of Bromine at High Temperatures.                   489
and introduced directly into liquid hydrogen contained in a vacuum
jacketed vessel immersed in liquid air.           Under these conditions they
were exposed to a temperature of about -252° C. (21° absolute) for
ten hours.    At the end of the experiment the tubes were opened, and
the contents examined microscopically and by culture. The results
were entirely negative as regards any alteration in appearance or in
vigour of growth of the micro-organisms.            It would appear, therefore,
that an exposure of ten hours to a temperature of about            - 252° C. has
no appreciable effect on the vitality of micro-organisms.
    We hope to extend these observations upon the influence of the
temperature of liquid hydrogen on vital phenomena, and to make them
the subject of a future communication, and to discuss their bearing
upon problems of vitality.

   Vapour-density of Bromine at High Temperatures. — Supple

       Atkinson, B.Sc. Communicated by Professor Ramsay, F.E.S.
       Received April 28,— Bead May 31, 1900.
    The authors regret that they had overlooked a monograph by C.
Langer and V. Meyer, entitled " Pyrochemische Untersuchungen,"
containing an account of some experiments on the vapour-density of
bromine.      Their method was to pass a mixture of bromine vapour
and nitrogen into a porcelain tube with capillary ends placed in a
furnace in a horizontal position.          The bromine and nitrogen were
then displaced by a current of carbon dioxide, the bromine being
absorbed    by potassium iodide solution, and the carbon dioxide by
potash solution, while the nitrogen was collected and measured.
Temperature was ascertained by displacing the tube full of air in a
 similar way. By this method Langer and Meyer carried out experi
ments at " Zimmer-temperatur
                                     "
                                       100°, 900°, and 1200°.
    The only results comparable with the authors' are those at 900°.
Their results at this temperature are 5-478, 5-414, 5-433, 5-382, 5-59,
mean 5-459 (air = 1), or 78-88 (H = 1).               They say that tliese results
indicate that the vapour-density of bromine, even when diluted with eleven
times its volume of air, is still normal  at 900°.
    The mean of our results at this temperature is 78-6, and the density
read from the curve (p. 17, vol. 66) is 78-8.             This close agreement
shows    that Langer  and   Meyer's    results really  indicate a small amount
of dissociation at 900°. Diminution of pressure appears to have little
effect  at that temperature, as Langer and Meyer used bromine much
diluted with nitrogen, while in our experiments there was no decrease
of density on reducing the pressure from 767 mm. to 365 mm.

"
    The Sensitiveness of Silver and of some other Metals to Light."
       By Major-General J. Waterhouse, I.S.C. (late Assistant Sur
       veyor-General of India).    Communicated by Sir W. Abney,
       K.C.B., F.E.S. Received April 25,— Read May 31, 1900.
    During    some recent investigations on the Daguerreotype   process, the
question presented itself as to which of the elements forming the sensi
tive surface of the plate — the silver or the halogens — the sensitiveness
was due ? Now, although the fact that nearly all compounds of silver,
especially the haloids, are more or less sensitive to, and decomposed
by, the action of light, has long been known, the sensitiveness of
metallic silver itself to light, though observed in 1842, by Moser, has
never been generally recognised either by chemists or by pho
tographers.
  Moser's Experiment. — Before describing my own experiments, it may
be as well to give a description of Moser's experiment taken from the
original paper in ' Poggendorff
                             's Annalen,' vol. 56, 1842, p. 210.
   "A            new silver
      perfectly           plate was thoroughly cleaned and polished.
A black tablet with various excised characters was fixed above it,
without touching      it,
                    and the whole placed in the sun for two hours
or more and directed towards it. After the plate, which naturally did
not show the least change, was cooled,       was held over mercury,
                                                 it
heated as usual to about 60" R. (167° F.). To my great delight a
distinct image of the screen was produced in which those parts where
the  sunlight (which during the course of the experiments was always
weak and changeable) had acted, had attracted    quantity of mercury.
                                                      a
This interesting experiment was repeated several times with the same
result. Sometimes the plates after having been placed in the mercurial
vapours were exposed to those of iodine and then placed in the sun,
by which the images usually improved."
   "  Ifwe compare this remarkable fact of the action of light upon
surfaces of silver with the above-mentioned phenomena produced            by
contact, we can no longer doubt that light acts on all bodies, modifying
them so that they behave differently in condensing the vapours            of
mercury.    A similar experiment was made with copper during un
favourable weather.   The copper was not well polished, and, conse
quently,  the image produced by the mercurial vapours was faint,
although clearly visible.  By exposing the plate to the vapour            of
iodine the image became stronger, and this method was found useful
in experiments with copper.     A plate of clean mirror-glass was

                  of Silver and of some other Metals            to Light.            491
 exposed in the same way to light and the action was as plain as on the
silver, if the glass were afterwards breathed upon, the image remaining
 visible for a long time afterwards.               We may therefore assume that
 light acts on all     bodies, and its influence may be tested by        all vapours that
 adhere to the substance or act chemically upon it."
    Robert  Hunt 's    Views. — Although Robert Hunt recorded              the3e experi
                  '
 ments in his Researches on Light,' he does not seem to have repeated
 them as regards the direct action of light upon metallic silver, but to
have paid more attention to Moser's experiments on the images pro
duced by contact or proximity of dissimilar substances, and his theory
of invisible     light,   as well as the effects of heat. Hunt's own experi
 ments    were      chiefly carried out on copper plates, and led him to
attribute Moser's results to calorific or thermic radiations rather than
 to light.      Knorr, Karsten, Grove, and others seem also to have
investigated Moser's theories, but again without taking notice of the
fact of images, either directly visible or developable, being produced
on metallic silver by the direct action of light.
    I have not been able to find a record of a visible action of light
upon ordinary silver plate, though its occurrence should be well
 known to silversmiths.
    Carey Lea's Observations. — Carey Lea found that the three forms of
allotropic silver he obtained were all sensitive to light: A the red
soluble,    and    B the dark brown or blue insoluble variety,                 becoming
brown      after some       hours' exposure,       while    C, the golden      coloured,
became lighter by exposure.*
    Electrolytically Deposited Silver. — In a series of electrolytic experi
ments made in Calcutta, in 1892, I found that a golden-yellow or light
 olive-coloured deposit of silver on the cathode plate (silver or platinum)
of a decomposition cell formed with two pure silver plates, as
anode and cathode, or with a silver anode and platinum cathode,
in distilled water, through which a weak current was passed, was
slightly sensitive to light and became lighter in colour by exposure.
This seems to confirm Carey Lea's observation, if my golden-yellow
silver deposit was analogous to his C-product.                      My deposit being
made by electrolysis of pure silver in fairly pure distilled water,
must have been nearly pure silver with no traces of foreign sub
stances beyond those contained in the silver or the water, unless
there was a small amount of occluded hydrogen, which other experi
ments of the same series, but with a stronger current, showed might
not   be impossible.

tions on the electrical action of light upon silver made in Calcutta

Society of Bengal,' Part II, No. 1, for 1893, I found that the action of

492          Major-General      J. Waterhouse.         The Sensitiveness
bright sunlight on      a plate of almost pure silver, as indicated      by a very-
sensitive     Rosenthal    galvanometer,     was    to   make   the exposed half
positive to the unexposed, or as zinc to copper, which would seem to
point to some slight oxidising action. The observation, however, was
a difficult one, not readily repeated with certainty, and no very definite
result was obtained.        The currents observed did not appear to be due
to unequal heating of the two halves of the plate, because the direct
application of heat to the exposed side produced at once a clearly
marked current in the opposite direction.             This effect was always the
same, and could be readily repeated.
   In further observations of the same series, in which pairs of pure
silver plates were partly immersed in distilled water or good tap water,
one plate being exposed to light while the other was covered, as in
Becquerel'8 electric actinometer, the current in nearly all cases, though
small, was as above, the exposed plate being positive to the unexposed,
as it generally was when the silver plates were placed in dilute sul
phuric, nitric, phosphoric, or hydrochloric acids.
   Confirmation    of Moser's  Observation. — Recent observations of the action
of light upon silver, made in connection with the working of the
Daguerreotype        process,    have fully confirmed Moser's observation
quoted above, and shown that silver, when exposed under ordinary
conditions, shows distinct sensitiveness to light, and that not only can
an invisible developable image be obtained, as was done by Moser, but
by prolonging the exposure printed-out impressions are produced
which are clearly visible after exposure.               The difficulty is to make
sure of obtaining       a surface   of pure   silver,  free from the presence of
condensed gases or other foreign matter which might affect the plate
and give it a sensitive surface. The silvered glass plates used have
generally been cleaned and polished with well-washed tripoli, and the
metal plates in the same way, sometimes after being well cleaned
with fine emery paper, and, in some cases, after making the metal
red hot.
    V 'irions Silver Surfaces Sensitive to Light.
                                                  — Repeated observations     with
silver surfaces of different kinds, pure silver plates and foil, silver leaf
on varnished glass, Daguerreotype plates and silvered glass, have shown
that by an exposure in bright sunshine of about half an hour to one or
two hours, under an ordinary black and white negative, or a cut-out
design, photographic images can be obtained, which are sometimes
clearly visible after exposure, under favourable conditions.
   Development of Images on Plain Silver Plates. — Whether visible               or
invisible, these images can be developed by the vapour of mercury, or
by ordinary physical development with acid solutions of ferrous
sulphate or pyrogallic acid, to which a little silver nitrate is added, as
in the old wet collodion process.         The images were also produced when
the negatives or cut-out masks were separated from the silver surfaces

                    of Silver and of some other Metals      to  Light.           493
by   sheets of     thin mica, which,    as Dr. W.  J.  Eussell, F.E.S., has shown,
stops the action of vapours upon a sensitive gelatine dry plate, and no
doubt would do so upon a silver plate.                 As a rule, the mica itself
makes no difference in the action of light, and is quite transparent to
it, though, in      some cases, it may exercise a slight retarding action.         It
was found, however, that when the silver surfaces were exposed to
light in hydrocarbons, such as fluid paraffin, benzene, turpentine, &c,
no action took place under the parts screened by mica, though the
fluids were perfectly clear and colourless.            Under ordinary conditions
of exposure in a printing frame, the mica appeared to exercise no
special influence upon the plates, except at the cut edges, as will be
noticed further on.
    Effects  of Pressure. — That the images were not produced by differences
of pressure was proved by leaving the mica screen, with the cut-out
black paper design at its back, in contact with a polished silvered glass
plate in darkness for twenty-four hours. There was no visible image,
but on development with mercury vapour the mercury was deposited
fairly evenly all over the plate, except just where the outside edges of
the mica and the edges of some initials cut in it had been in contact
with the silver. Here there was very little deposit, and the edges
appeared as dark lines on a white ground.              There was no sign of the
black paper design. The fact that the images were readily obtained
from ordinary black and white photographic negatives is further
evidence against the results being due to pressure.
   First Experiment with Silver Leaf. — My first experiment was made on
the 14th August last with a piece of silver leaf laid down on a plate of
glass coated with varnish, and exposed in the sun for a short time
under a plain cut-out cardboard screen.            On developing with mercury
vapour     a  faint   image  was  visible, the  mercury   having deposited on the
part exposed to light.
   Next day the experiment was repeated.              A similar plate was exposed
under a black and white gelatine negative of some lace for half an hour
in bright sunshine.           On developing with mercury, a very distinct,
though      faint,   image   of the lace pattern was produced, the mercury
again depositing on the parts exposed to light, as in Moser's experi
ment.
                                           — Thinking that these results might
    Effect on Polished Silvered Glass.
be partly due to some action of light upon the varnish underlying the
silver leaf,     a piece    of polished silvered glass was exposed under the
same negative for about an hour.                  Again a distinct image was
developed      with    the  mercury,   but  partly positive and partly negative.
A somewhat similar result was obtained on another plate developed
with the ordinary acid iron and silver developer already noticed.
                                    — The next experiment was with a piece of
   Effect on Pure Silver Plate.
                                              cleaned with   " Globe   "
nearly pure silver plate, carefully                                      polish, and

494         Major-General     J.  Waterhouse.      Tlie Sensitiveness
washed with benzene        to remove all greasiness. After half an hour's
exposure in dull sunlight and development with mercury, an image was
produced similar to the two first on silver leaf, i.e., the mercury had
deposited upon the exposed parts.
   These experiments with three different forms of silver surfaces and
two     methods of development, all giving results similar to those
obtained by Moser, seemed at any rate to prove the correctness of his
observation, and the sensitiveness of ordinary forms of silver to
light.
   With the exception of the first, the foregoing trials were all made
with a black and white negative on glass.             Others were then made
with cut-out black paper      screens  and with  like results.
    Observation of Printed-out Visible Image.
                                               —  The first observation of an
image visible on the silver surface after exposure and without any
development was on a plate of nearly pure silver, cleaned with tripoli
and ammonia, polished off with dry tripoli, and exposed on the 21st
August for about half an hour in sunshine under a black paper cut-out
screen. The parts exposed to light appeared lighter than the unex
posed, but on development the mercury was deposited upon the unex
posed parts.      In this case, the surface may have been affected by the
ammonia used in cleaning, but it is also likely that the black paper
 used for the mask exercised some effect, as was afterwards found to be
 the case.
    Another silver plate exposed for the same time under the same cut
out mask, but separated from it by a sheet of mica, did not show the
visible image after exposure, though an image was readily developed
 with mercury vapour.
    A   day or two later, on the 24th August, the same experiment was
 repeated upon a plate of silvered glass exposed
                                                         in the sun for half an
hour under the cut-out mask, with a mica screen between it and the
silvered surface.        The image of the black paper design could be
 faintly but distinctly discerned in a suitable light, again appearing
 dark upon a lighter ground.         Development with acid iron and silver
 brought out clearly the images of the paper mask, and of some letters
 cut out of the mica screen, as well as the edges of the mica screen
itself.
    A   piece  of silvered glass was then exposed for forty-five minutes
 under the same black and white negative as used in the first experi
 ments, the silvered surface being protected from contact with the
 negative by a mica screen. In
                                      this case also a faint image was visible
 after exposure.
    Several other prints, both from the lace negative and the paper
 masks, were made on silvered glass with longer exposures, so as to
 obtain a distinctly visible image, and it was then found that there was
 a tendency     to reversal   of the image when developed with mercury

                of Silver and of some otlur Metals    to Light.           495
vapour, i.e., the mercury deposited upon the unexposed parts instead
of upon the exposed.       In one plate the image thus produced from the
negative of lace, exposed for two hours in the bright August sunshine,
has quite the appearance of an ordinary Daguerreotype picture on an
iodised silver plate, though no halogen or other sensitiser was used.
    Further trials of prolonged exposures of pure silver foil or plates
carefully cleaned with dry tripoli powder have given very distinct
printed-out images on the metal, so that there is no doubt about the
fact that visible images   can be produced on clean plain silver surfaces   by
light.
     Blue Bays found to be Active. — In order to ascertain, if possible, what
rays were active in producing these visible images upon the silver, and
as it was hopeless to expect to obtain satisfactory results from obser
vations with the solar spectrum, a slip of silvered glass was exposed
under a small artificial spectrum of seven coloured glasses.             After
forty-five minutes' exposure in sunshine, very faint images of the
violet and cobalt blue glasses were distinguishable, but showed more
 distinctly when breathed upon. A similar result was obtained upon a
 pure silver plate, and on developing with acid iron and silver the
 space exposed under the cobalt blue glass developed out quite clearly,
 with traces of the violet and blue-green glasses.         This result quite
 agrees   with  an   observation  made   by  Moser  that only the blue and
 violet rays have any influence on pure silver, for he obtained very
 clear images by means of glasses of these colours, while only traces
 could be rendered visible when red glasses were employed, although
 they transmit more light and heat.
     On another silvered glass plate, exposed under a similar colour
 screen or artificial spectrum, consisting of fifteen coloured glasses, for
 three hours in bright sunshine, the image has apparently reversed by
 over-exposure, the mercury being deposited on the spaces exposed
 under the red, orange, yellow, and yellow-green glasses, but not on
 those which were under the blue-green, blue, and violet glasses.
     Developable Images produced on Silver by Heat. — As we have seen,
 Robert Hunt was inclined to attribute Moser's results to the effect
 of heat or differences of relative temperature, rather than to light
  or solar radiations, but his experiments were mostly carried out on
  copper, which is, as I have found myself, much more sensitive to
  rays of low refrangibility and to heat than silver.
      Towards the end of September, when the weather was much cooler
  than it had been at the commencement of my experiments in August,
  I  found that there was a distinct falling off in the sensitiveness of the
  silver surfaces, and it  seemed   that Hunt's view might, at any rate to
  some extent, be correct.     I therefore  tried an experiment to see if the
  same developable images could be obtained by heat as by light. A
  silvered glass plate was polished and put into a printing frame with

 496         Major-General   J. Waterhouse.      Tlie Sensitiveness
 the cut-out paper mask and mica screen, in which were cut-out initials,
 just as if it were going to be exposed in the sun, but it was gently
 warmed for about five minutes over a spirit lamp, and then developed
 with mercury.       The cut-out initials and edges of the mica came out
 distinctly in dark lines, just as they did in the pressure experiment
 but   there was also a clear image of the black paper mask, which
 developed lighter than the ground, by the deposition of mercury, or
 the opposite of the ordinary action of light.
    This is a very interesting observation, but recent repetitions of it
 with silvered glass plates and clean silver foil have quite failed to give
 such a distinct image of the black paper, though traces of it have been
 visible, and the edges of the mica and of the cut-out initials were always
 clearly impressed.     In one case, when the silver foil was well heated
 to redness on both sides before being placed in the printing frame and
 the subsequent heating, no image of the initials was obtained, and only
 part of one edge of the mica screen with a faint trace of one corner of
 the paper mask where there was extra pressure.           From this it would
 seem that heat does not play any active part in the production of the
images, though the higher temperature of the summer sunshine, as
 well as its greater actinic power, may accelerate their formation by
light.    This is to a certain extent proved by the fact that the most
perfect printed-out image obtained on a pure silver plate was exposed
for three days at the end of September, when the thermometer
exposed in the sun at the same time did not rise above 64° F., so that
there could have been no question of heat producing the effect, as there
might have been under the hot, clear sunshine of August.
    Protection from Air.
                         — In most of the experiments the plates were
protected by glass during exposure, so that the outer air had no
direct access to them. When plates were exposed under mica screens
and without the protecting glass, the outside unprotected surface
became    distinctly yellow and tarnished during long exposures.
    Under Surface of Silvered Glass Plate not Sensitive. — In order, however,
to ascertain the effect of cutting off all atmospheric action on the
exposed side, a silvered glass plate was exposed from the back or glass
side under a cut-out mask made of thin aluminium sheet, and exposed
for four days in October, two days being sunny and two cloudy.
There was no visibh image on either side of the plate after exposure,
but breathing     showed an image on both sides.         The plate was then
developed with acid iron and silver, and showed the image not very
distinctly, but as development was prolonged traces of it appeared at
the back of the silver film quite clear of deposit, so that apparently
the developer had worked through the protected parts of the film,
while the exposed part had taken the deposit of silver. When the plate
was dry there was, curiously enough, no trace of the image on either
side of the plate.

                  of Silver and of some ot]itr Mefah   to   Liyht.           497
   This experiment was repeated in January, two silvered glass plates
being exposed face to face for fifteen days, of which five or six were
sunny and the rest fairly bright, with the object of also seeing whether
an impression could be made through the upper plate on to the silvered
surface of the under one.  On developing with mercury, a fairly clear
image of the cut-out design was obtained on the inner surface of the
exposed plate, dark on a lighter ground, but neither on the outer
exposed silver surface of the upper plate nor on the silvered surface of
the lower plate was there any trace of an image. The experiment was
repeated with a similar result.   The only other case in which images
have been obtained through the silvered film was on a plate partly
fumed with hydrogen peroxide and developed with mercury, but much
overdone.    As far as they go, the experiments show that the visible
image is not produced on the silver except more or less in contact
with the air. Further trials in bright sunshiny weather are required
to prove this.
   Liiayex formed on Both Side* of E.cimed GUins Plafc. — In connection
with this action through glass, a curious result obtained on a plain
glass plate may be mentioned.      A piece of clean glass plate was
exposed for a day and a half in October under the same aluminium
screen, with  another glass plate over      it,
                                           so as to protect the surface
from the air.     showed
                   It       clear breath image, but mercury vapour did
                             a
not produce any image. Iron development, however, brought out part
of the design very clearly, the silver depositing upon the unexposed
parts and giving an image darker and clearer than            the ground.     The
image of the design appeared by breathing on both sides of the exposed
glass plate, so that the action of light went through both plates.
   Effect prodwed on Varnixked Silver Gla<s.
                                             — With the same object of
ascertaining whether the images could be produced when the silver
surface was protected from the air by varnish,      silvered glass plate
                                                       a
was coated over cue half with photographic negative varnish and then
exposed in the usual way, under the cut-out paper mask and mica screen,
in October.  After exposure for two days the image of           the black paper
mask, the cut-out initials, and edges of the mica screen        were not repro
duced so clearly as usual, though they appeared readily          enough on the
unvarnished half when breathed upon.        The distinct        heightening of
the effect under the varnished part     apparently due to some chemical
                                       is
combination, probably oxidation, or the formation of an organic silver
compound sensitive to light. When the varnish        removed, the strong
                                                       is

part of the silver surface, which takesa sort of yellowish olive-grey tint.
Recent   repetitions of the experiment with silvered glass and with           a
plate of nearly pure silver gave exactly the same results.           It
                                                                   may, be
noted that with iodised silver plates the same varnish has been found
to exercise   decidedly retarding effect on prinfed-out images.

  Pivlxihh' Caii.n <of the Effort* <k.tciilied. — As regards the cause of the
peculiar effects tlescribed, and the nature of the visible and invisible but
developable images produced by the action of light upon plain silver
surfaces,     is very difficult to give any definite opinion.
                 it                                               It would
seem that  in  this, as in most photographic processes, the first action of
light is principally molecular, but if the exposure Iks prolonged and
takes place in the air under ordinary conditions, there is a certain
chemical decomposition of the surface of the plate, and the impressed
image becomes distinctly visible.
   Moser.    — Moser was of opinion that the action of light                               does   not   neces
sarily consist in the separation of two chemically combined bodies,
even in the Daguerreot3-pe, in which process he maintained there is no
separation of iodine from silver under the action of light. (We now
know that the iodine evolved is absorbed by the underlying silver.)
He brought forward his experiments on pure surfaces of silver, where,
he says, there can be no possibility of a chemical action, to show that
the effects of the Daguerreotype                       could be produced in quite a different
way.
  WnuMv.              — Waidele,* although             he does       not refer to Moser's observa
tion of the direct action of light upon                              silver,    and concerns himself
more with the contact actions attributed     to invisible light, concludes
that Moser's effects are  not produced by any action of invisible light,
but must lie rather explained by the action of atmospheres on iKxlies
and the absorption of gases.     He points out that polishing powders,
such as tripoli, charcoal, &c, ordinarily contain moisture and absorl>ed
gases,      for which they have                      and if used in this
                                                   a strong     attraction,
state they give up these vapours to the surface polished.      however,                       If,
they  are heated to  red  heat to
                                a drive off all moisture and gases, they
then act as absorbents, drawing out the moisture and gaseous impuri
ties from the surface of the metal, and producing  far purer and more           a
perfect polish.  He also notes the effect of carbonic acid, hydrogen,
and other vapours on iodised silver Daguerreotype plates.
      So far as my experiments go,                   I   do not think that the nature of the
polishing             materials has          had    much influence   on the results obtained,
though       it      is   an interesting      point which should be looked into.
      Itoscoe.   — Roscoef also attributes the Moser effects to absorbed gases,
 and says        — "Almost all of the singular phenomena first

 more rationally explained by the authenticated facts of the absorption
 of gases by solid bodies." He also refers more particularly to the con

                                   is
the most favourable  conditions. From the fact that in most of my
experiments the external air has been excluded      the outer glasses                  by
of the printing frames, we may,  think, conclude that the effects are
                                                      I
due more to the gases or vapours occluded in or attached to the silver
surface or to the screens, rather than to any outside atmospheric
influences.
    Oxygen found in Silver  G-raiuxm. — With regard to the presence of
                                           by
oxygen in silver, Graham found that silver heated and allowed to cool
in oxygen could occlude                    0-745         volume of oxygen,                  which    was      per
manently         fixed in the metal at all temperatures below an incipient                                    red
beat.    didIt          not     bright metallic surface of the silver or
                              tarnish the
produce any appearance suggestive of the oxidation of a metal.        He
further showed that silver in the form of sponge can occlude volumes                                 8
of oxygen without any visible tarnish. Silver appears to have       rela                                 a
tion to oxygen similar to that exhibited by platinum, palladium, and
iron to hydrogen.    Silver can also occlude variable quantities                                               of
hydrogen, nitrogen, and carbonic acid.*
   Dumas' Observations. — According to Dumas,

riOO      Major-Genera,!         WaterhouBe.         On the Sensitiveness
weighing 82 milligrammes.           In two other experiments, in which silver
was fused in a more oxygenated atmosphere, as much as 158 e.c. of
oxygen, weighing 226 milligrammes, and 174 c.c., weighing 249 milli
grammes, were obtained from 1 kilo, of pure silver in each case.                     He
found    also  that  silver  which   contains    oxygen     does  not lose  it all in a
cold vacuum.
   Mallet's Observations. — Professor J. W. Mallet, in some investigations
on the   Atomic Weight of Aluminium, notes these results obtained by-
Dumas, and states that in his own observations of the same kind, but
using a lime support for the silver heated in a hard glass tube to a
moderate redness, he obtained only 34 63 c.c. of oxygen from 1 kilo,
of silver.*
   These different observations        show that silver, apparently pure, may
contain a very considerable quantity of oxygen, and I believe it is
a well-known fact, especially in the Mints, that oxygen is nearly
always present in silver, with or without hydrogen, carbonic acid, and
other gaseous impurities in much smaller quantities.
   Whether occluded oxygen is the cause of the photographic effects
produced on surfaces of apparently pure silver, might readily be
proved by extracting all the oxygen from a silver plate by the above
methods, and then exposing the resulting purified silver to light, a
similar   plate from which the oxygen had not been extracted being
exposed at the same time.            I have not the appliances at my disposal
for making this experiment.
   Effects of Heating Silver Plates     to Rcdn>ss. — With regard, however,           to
the effect of simply heating the silver plates to redness, the following
experiments may be of interest, and seem to show that the heating,
whether accompanied by subsequent "blanching" or "pickling" in
dilute sulphuric acid or not, causes a distinct loss of sensitiveness, and
in some cases seems to destroy it entirely unless the exposure is greatly
prolonged.
   A  piece of thin, pure      silver plate    was   first of all heated      to a red
heat over a spirit lamp, then plunged into dilute sulphuric acid, and,
after being washed with distilled water and dried, was exposed for
about two days and a half, partly in sunshine, at the end of September
last, under a screen of mica carrying a cut-out design in tinfoil, which
had also been passed through the name of the lamp.                         No visible
image   was   produced,     nor  did  one    appear    by  breathing   on   the plate.
Development with acid ferrous sulphate and silver nitrate brought out
traces of the opaque tinfoil mask and of parts cut out of the mica.
The free ends of the plate, which were exposed to the air all the time,
did not show any distinct attraction for the developer.
                                                                 " meteoric "
   Another plate of pure silver, well cleaned with                               polish
(No.  2) and     exposed as usual under a mica screen              with black paper

                      vf Silver and of some   other Metals to Light.                501
mask, only one day longer than the last plate, gave a very strong
visible image requiring no development. There must, therefore, have
Keen       a considerable difference    in the conditions of the surfaces of the
two plates.
   In the plate which was heated and then treated with dilute sulphuric
acid, it may be assumed that any surface layer of condensed gases
must have been destroyed and a surface of pure metal exposed — which,
as one would expect, was not  visibly sensitive to light.  In the other
case,in which the plate was probably oxidised         had been lying by
                                                              (it
for several years) and was simply well cleaned with        dry polishing
                                                                    a
powder, the surface of the metal was left so sensitive to light as to
give    strong visible image.
        a                      This difference of action in two plates
which were exposed to the same conditions of light, seems to show
that the effects produced by light on surfaces of metallic silver are
chemical rather than merely molecular in their nature.
  A repetition of this observation gave similar results.                  Further,    a
plate of thin silver foil, well heated over the spirit-lamp and exposed
under a mica screen, which was also heated, for two days, including
some hours of sunshine, showed no image, even on development with
mercury, although distinctly visible images had been obtained on the
same piece of foil when cleaned in the ordinary way and exposed
under the same or similar screens.   Further experiment on this point
is   still   necessary.
     Ejf'ectx Silver Surface* fumed with Add and other Vapours.—
                 mi                                                                  A
good many experiments have been made with silvered glass plates or
silver foil, fumed with various vapours, which might possibly be
present in small quantities during the exposure to light, among them
hydrogen peroxide, nitric acid, ammonia, also sidphurous acid these             ;
plates have all shown visible and developable images of a somewhat
similar character to those formed on the plain metal.
   Nitrir Acid. — By fuming silvered glass plates with ordinary piu'e
nitric acid (l-420) or, better, with the same acid diluted with an equal
volume          of water,
                   very clear positive  printed-out images have been
obtained, even with the comparatively   short exposure of one hour in
the February sun.     With longer exposure the image was clearer, the
                             a
exposed parts appearing lighter than the protected parts, as  also the     is
case  with the plain silver surfaces.
   Dilute Ammonia. — Dilute ammonia containing one part of the solu
tion at 0-880 in 30 of water, gave a similar image, but the film was
not so sensitive as with the nitric acid. Further experiments have
however, to be made.
   Dilute Sulphurous Acid. — Dilute sulphurous acid, formed by acidify
ing    solution of sodium sulphite with sulphuric acid, gave
       a                                                         weak           a
image of much the same character.
  Ili/dtvijen Peroxide Solution. — Silvered           glass    plates,   fumed      with

502        Major-General            J.   Waterhouse.         On the Sensitiveness
various strengths of hydrogen peroxide solution, have given fairly
sensitive films, sometimes a little white in appearance, hut as a rule
the printed-out images produced on exposure to light are just the
reverse of those produced on plain plates and those fumed, as noted
above, i.e., the parts exposed appear darker than the unexposed parts
and do not attract mercury vapour, so that a positive picture is pro
duced from an ordinary black and white negative.     By long exposure
this effect is sometimes reversed.    The visible images produced on
silvered  glass plates fumed with the peroxide quickly fade away,
though the details may still remain visible on breathing.       The same
effect of fading out has  also been observed on plain silver plates, most
markedly on the thin foils.
   Rain or Boiled Distilled Water. — Silver plates exposed under fresh,
clean rain water, or boiled distilled water, gave distinct images on
development with mercury, but not very readily, and further observa
tions are necessary.
   Exposures in Flute/, Hydrocarbons. — In order to" ascertain whether the
images would be produced on silver surfaces exposed in fluid hydro
carbons containing no oxygen, silvered glass and pure silver foil were
exposed in fluid paraffin, benzene, xylene, and toluene.
             — In clear, colourless, fluid paraffin very strong dark olive-
   Paraffin.
yellow images were produced by light on silvered glass and silver foil
on the parts exposed freely in the fluid or under the parts cut out of a
black cardboard         mask but under a mica screen, which covered part of
the black mask, and of the plate itself, there was     no darkening action
whatever.   The darkening appears to be due to sulphuration, but why
it should not occur under the mica is not clear, unless the latter cuts
off the rays which are active in producing it.
   Benzene. — Silver foil well cleaned and exposed in ordinary rectified
benzene under a cut-out black paper mask, and also half covered with
mica, showed very clear, yellow images of the cut-out design on the
part uncovered by the   mica, apparently by decomposition of thio-
phene or other sulphur   compound present in the benzene.       This
darkening required strong sunshine to produce     and on prolonging    it,
the exposure in the sun the metal became quite bronzed in the un
covered exposed part, while the part protected by the mica also took a
light tint. It may be noted that, as    rule, the backs of these slips of
                                                         a
foil (which were             in test-tubes) were not protected by any
                         exposed
covering, but showed no perceptible change of colour        the darkening    :
of the exposed foil was therefore solely an effect of strong light.
   Effect  Heating the Foil. —
            of                   piece of the same foil was exposed in
                                             A
the same way in the same benzene after being heated to redness.
This did not show such  strong image, even by long exposure in
                                         a
the sun.
  A     piece    of   pure   foil    (assay      foil)   was exposed    in   a   purer sample of

               of Silver owl of   some,  other Metals to Light.
benzene, and also gave a    distinct yellow image as soon as the sun acted
upon it after some days' exposure, the light being dull till near the end
of the period. Another piece of the same foil, heated to redness and
exposed at the same time, only showed a very pale yellowing.
   Xylene. — A similar very faint, but browner, change of colour was
noticed on a piece of the same foil, not heated, exposed for several days
in commercial pure xylene.
   With toluene, similar results were obtained after long exposure.
   Effects of Liaht upon other Metals.
                                        — A few observations have been made
as to the action of light upon other metals, but with the exception of
lead none of them have proved very            sensitive, and further work is
necessary in good weather.
   Gold. — Images developable with mercury            have been obtained on
gold   leaf by prolonged exposures,     but scarcely any trace of a develop
able image could be obtained on some highly-polished well-gilt buttons
exposed for several days in good sunshine in October.
   Lead Fail. — On     pu.e lead foil I have obtained a very distinct
darkened image visible after exposure.          Very distinct darkening was
also produced on lead foil exposed in pure benzene.
    Copper. — On copper distinctly visible images have been obtainable
sometimes, but the metal is not so sensitive as silver to light, though
I have readily obtained heat images on it developable by mercury.
 Pure copper foil exposed in sunshine in pure benzene showed a distinct
darkening, but exposed in xylene it did not change colour.
    Nickel, Platinum, Aluminium, Palladium. — Nickel, aluminium, and
platinum appear to be quite insensitive to light, but with a small
button of palladium, kindly lent to me by Mr. T. Bolus, which was
exposed for some days under a black paper mask, there appeared a
slight but fairly distinct trace of deposit of mercury on the exposed
parts.     The spot was too small to make sure of.
    Trial with Jlbntgen Rays. — With the kind assistance of Mr. F. H.
 Glew I was able to make a few experiments with the Rontgen rays
upon silvered glass and pure silver plates, exposed for several hours to
the rays, but without any visible or developable effect.
    The above is a summary of my observations in this direction so far as
 they have gone.      I hoped to have made them more complete, but the
 dull winter weather has been very much against such work.            I hope,
 however, to go on with it during the summer, but think it advisable
 to publish the results already obtained now, in order that others may
 be able to extend them at the same time.            They show, I think, that
 most of the phenomena that occur by the exposure of ordinary pho
 tographic    plates containing haloid compounds of silver can be
 observed upon a plain silver plate exposed to light in the air under
 ordinary conditions.     It seems not impossible, therefore, that the key
 to the hitherto   unsolved  problem of the production and constitution of

 504     On the Sensitiveness  of Silver and other Metal*   to Light.
the so-called " latent photographic    image" may lie found within these
limits.
   Note, added   Jane 6. — Since the above was written, I have tried the
effect  of fixing agents, such as hyposulphite of soda and weak solutions
of potassium cyanide and ammonia, upon the printed-out images on
silvered glass.     Neither of them destroys the image, but a very
peculiar effect was noticed when a somewhat indistinct printed-out
image on silvered glass was treated with potassium cyanide.        The un
exposed parts wrinkled up, but not the exposed parts ; after drying,
the plate recovered its polished surface, but the exposed parts, instead
of appearing light upon a darker ground, appeared darker than the tin-
exposed parts — the image generally being much clearer and more
distinct than it was at first. This effect points to a very strong physical
modification of the thin silver film, but requires further examination
with fresh images upon silver plates.
