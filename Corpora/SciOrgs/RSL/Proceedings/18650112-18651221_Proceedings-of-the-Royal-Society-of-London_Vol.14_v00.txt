" On     a Colloid Acid,      a  Normal Constituent of Human Urine." By
      William       Marcet, M.D., F.R.S. Received May 28, 1864 *.
In   the autumn of 1802,        feeling assured that, besides the known normal
crystalloid compounds         found in urine,       this secretion contained colloid
substances,    I  submitted     samples    of the healthy secretion, after concen
tration, first, to the process of dialysis, and then to the action of reagents,
and finally succeeded in precipitating with alcohol a colloid substance ex
hibiting a faintly acid or neutral reaction, and containing a small proportion
of ash. For a while my endeavours to obtain a definite compound from
this amorphous mass were fruitless, until, on observing that basic acetate
of lead produced a precipitate in its aqueous solution,             I thought of examin
ing this precipitate, and, by decomposing it with sulphuretted hydrogen,
found it to consist of an organic acid combined with lead.                  This new acid
is possessed of the properties of a colloid substance ; it may be considered
as having a definite combining proportion or equivalent weight, and is
undoubtedly destined to become of great importance in physiological che
mistry.
   After having satisfied myself of the presence of a colloid acid in urine,            I
tried every means to obtain as much of it as possible from a given volume
of the secretion, and prepare it in the pure condition ; and after having
experienced many difficulties,     I  adopted the following method as the simplest
and that yielding the most satisfactory results.
                    Mode    of Preparation of the Colloid Acid.
   Urine is mixed with animal charcoal and concentrated until reduced to
about one-fourth     of its original bulk. It is filtered, and a solution of caustic
baryta is added until complete precipitation by this agent be effected. The
fluid filtered from the baryta precipitate is dialyzed without further evapo-

small quantity of colouring-matter,     some hydrated oxide of lead, more or
less chlorideof lead, and perhaps traces of sulphate of lead. In order to
effect the removal of these impurities, the insoluble compound     first de                        is
composed with sulphuretted hydrogen or sulphuric acid         sulphuretted           ;    if

   The acid fluid being now heated with animal charcoal and filtered, loses
the whole, or nearly the whole of its colouring-matter, and apparently much
of its urinous smell. Any hydrochloric acid present can be easily separated
 from the free organic acid by treating the colourless fluid with carbonate of
 silver and filtering the dissolved silver
                                   ;        afterwards eliminated by means of

 careful addition of baryta- water will precipitate any sulphuric acid present.

    would    occur  by concentrating with heat    strongly alkaline urine, the fluid

    A.s the lead precipitate appears to be slightly soluble in water, it is diffi
cult to ascertain precisely the period at which the washing may be con-
sidered sufficient.     I  usually continued pouring distilled water into the
filter until   sulphuretted hydrogen gave but a faint dark colour in the
filtrate.   The decomposition of the insoluble compound by means of sul
phuretted hydrogen is a slow process, and takes some hours before it is
complete ; and it will be advisable to leave the precipitate in contact with
sulphuretted hydrogen overnight : the excess of sulphuretted hydrogen
may be expelled by boiling, or by a stream of air, by which latter method
the coloration caused by heat is avoided.
    The Acid. —The fluid prepared as stated above has a strong acid reaction;
exposed to the air for a fortnight, and even for a longer period, it is not
altered. When concentrated even by very brisk boiling, it may be con
sidered as undergoing no loss and no decomposition, as shown by the fol
lowing experiments : — 75 cub. centims. of the acid, 5 cub. centims. of which
were neutralized by 24*3 cub. centims. of a normal potash solution, were
boiled down to 15 cub. centims., then diluted with water to 75 cub. cen
tims., and tested with the normal potash solution ; 23-4 cub. centimi. of
this solution were found necessary to neutralize it. Any decomposition
 must have been very slight, as the difference between the volumes of the
potash solution added before and after the boiling was only of about 1 cub.
centim.
    As a further proof that the acid is not volatile,     I  distilled a sample of it
in a retort, in the free flame, carrying on the operation until nothing but a
dark semifluid mass remained in the retort.         The distillate was just faintly
 acid to the most delicate test paper. In most of my experiments the acid was
 slightly coloured, and evolved a urinous smell when hot. Under the impres
 sion that this odoriferous substance might be a volatile acid, such as those
 discovered by Stadeler *,    I was led to examine very carefully the distillate
 obtained as above. This fluid had a strong smell of urine and the faintest
 acid reaction.    After the fluid was rendered alkaline by baryta, the smell
 was in no way diminished ; so that it could not be owing to an acid ; more
 over, considering that the colloid acid loses its colour, and apparently in a
 great measure its odour, after agitation with animal charcoal, we may infer
 that the odour   of urine is owing to a very slight decomposition of the col
 loid acid which takes place under the influence of heat, and more especially
 in the presence of free mineral acids.
    Returning to the solution of the colloid acid in water : after concentra
 tion by heat its colour darkens and it becomes syrupy, with a sharp acid
 taste, and a slight acrid and astringent after-taste.        This taste is percepti
 ble in the solution, even when very dilute.           I  could never obtain any
 crystals in this syrup beyond those resulting from inorganic impurities.
 When dried, the acid assumes the form of a transparent varnish, which,
 by a temperature     of 120° Cent., becomes much darkened.               The dried

substance is very hygroscopic, and dissolves readily in water (with the ex
ception of some few dark flukes) after exposure for some time at 120° Cent.
Alcohol,       sp.   gr. 827, gives it a dull, opaque appearance, and slightly dis
 solves it.        The dry acid is insoluble in ether, and its solution in diluted
 alcohol is rendered turbid by ether.                     When burnt it chars, emitting a
 pungent      smell     ;  the   ignition   is attended    with but a very faint flame, show
ing that very little hydrogen enters into its composition ; nothing but a
 trace of fixed inorganic residue remains after complete incineration of the
 acid.     The colloid acid was found to have no action on polarized light ; it
failed to precipitate egg-albumen, but precipitated casein in milk ; the pre
 cipitate was not redissolvcd in nn excess of the acid, as in the case of
 acetic acid ; although strictly a colloid, it passes through the diaphragm of
a dialyzer, but the phenomenon is not near so rapid as in the case of crys
 talloids.        In an alkaline fluid, however, the acid (under the form of a
compound) does not find its way so readily through the dialyzer, and its
passage      is thereby checked in a considerable degree.
     The qualitative composition of the colloid acid of urine was obtained by
subjecting to analysis its insoluble lead-compound.                       I   found the organic
substance to consist only of carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen.                           I have not
yet determined the ultimate quantitative composition of the acid, but
have succeeded in showing                   that it possesses an atomic weight, or com
bining proportion, thereby proving the acid to be a definite substance ;
the atomic weight of the acid was determined by the analysis of its inso
luble lead-salt and of its baryta-salt.                   In order to analyze the insoluble
lead-salt, a weighed quantity of the compound, dried at 1 20° Cent., was
dissolved in acetic acid, and precipitated by means of sulphuric acid, with
the addition of alcohol ; the sulphate of lead was collected in a filter, the
filter burnt, and the inorganic residue treated with sulphuric acid; the
sulphate       of lead was finally weighed.

    Five out of the six analyses were made with the acid slightly coloured, to
avoid possible inorganic impurityfrom the use of animal charcoal. In analysis
No. VI. the acid had been treated with animal . charcoal, and in this case
the percentage of lead was a little higher.         It is possible that 33* 7 is not
the exact percentage of acid in the insoluble lead-compound, although it
cannot be far from correct ; but when the difficulty of obtaining the lead-
precipitate in a pure condition is taken into account,              I  think it will be
admitted that the results of these analyses approach each other closely
enough to show that the lead-precipitate of the colloid acid is a definite
chemical compound.         Adopting the number 33-7 as the percentage                   of
acid, the equivalent weight of the acid and of the compound will be

    To prepare the baryta-compound          of the colloid acid,       I  began by de
composing with sulphuric     acid  a known weight      of the  lead-salt  ; and by pro
ceeding as in the case of the analysis of the lead-compound, the amount
of the colloid acid present was determined. The acid was entirely washed
through the filter along with some free sulphuric acid, and I treated the
acid filtrate with carbonate of baryta, the mixture being heated for four
or five hours, and filtered the next day ; the precipitate on the filter was
finally washed with hot distilled water for from four to six days, and even
after this lapse of time the washings still contained a trace of baryta.           I shall
only report   two  out  of several  of these   analyses,    as  in  the  others   the  de
ficiency  of baryta dissolved was obvious. I have calculated the atomic
weight   of  the acid from the baryta-compound which yielded most baryta,

6                     Dr. Marcet on a Colloid Acid of Urine.                        [1864.
    If we   now compare the atomic weight of the acid in the baryta-com
 pound (29*5) with that in the lead-compound (56-7), it will be readily seen
 that the relative proportion of these two numbers being very nearly one to
 two, the lead-compound contains two equivalents of colloid acid (2 X 28-3),
 and the baryta-salt one equivalent of the acid (28*3) ; the insoluble lead-
 compound is therefore an acid salt of the colloid acid.                  I shall  propose
 the number 28*3 as the atomic weight of the new acid.                      We    are   now
 able to explain why the insoluble          lead-salt   of the colloid acid is soluble in
 an alkaline fluid such as potash.            Of  the two equivalents of colloid acid,
 one combines with oxide of lead, and the other with potash, forming two
 soluble neutral salts,

                      Compounds     of the Colloid Acid of Urine.
    Lead-salts. — Basic acetate of lead added to the free acid, or solutions of
its neutral salts, gives rise to a white precipitate.               When a glass rod
 moistened with a solution of basic acetate of lead is immersed into a mode
rately strong solution of the free acid, a precipitate forms, which disappears
 on agitating the fluid ; this can be repeated- several times before the pre
cipitate becomes permanent.             When the fluid no longer turns clear on
agitation, the application of heat will dissolve the precipitate, but on the
further addition of the precipitant, the hot liquid will soon remain turbid.
An excess of basic acetate of lead redissolves the precipitate ; this re
solution appears to take place more readily when an excess of the precipi
tant is added to neutral salts of the colloid acid, than when added to the
free acid.
    After mixing basic acetate of lead with urine, treated as described above,
and filtering, I observed that the filtrate still contained much organic
matter, although the further addition of the reagent caused no turbidity.
I at first naturally thought       that this was owing to the presence of another
colloid substance in urine ; but my surprise was very great when I found
that the pure acid obtained by decomposing its insoluble lead-compound
could be but partly re-precipitated             by means of basic acetate of lead, a
comparatively large portion       of  organic matter remaining dissolved, as shown
by evaporating a few drops of the fluid and incinerating the residue, which
charred and burnt away, leaving a little oxide of lead on the spatula.
Having previously        ascertained     that   the pure basic lead-salt was nearly
perfectly insoluble in water,       I  could not for some time explain the phe
nomenon. On reflecting upon the fact,             it occurred to me that,    as the  liquor
in which the acid had been precipitated             appeared to contain some neutral
acetate   of  lead*, possibly this salt bad the power of dissolving the preci-
   * The formation of this compound might be considered to have taken place as shown
in the following equation :—

pitate  ; and on mixing some of the precipitate with a solution of neutral
acetate of lead, and boiling,      I observed a solution of the colloid compound
to take place. This experiment, repeated several times with different
samples of the insoluble lead-compound of the colloid acid, yielded invari
ably the same result : although it happened in most cases that the preci
pitate was not entirely dissolved, it was very obvious that the greater
portion of it had disappeared.            The phenomenon in question is very
interesting, not only because it accounts partly for the fact that basic
acetate   of lead  does not precipitate     the whole  of the colloid acid of urine,
 but also  because   it affords additional proof of the insoluble lead-compound
 being an acid lead-salt of the colloid acid.        A piece of wet blue test-paper
 is reddened when held over the opening of a test-tube in which the mixture
 of the precipitate and neutral acetate of lead is being boiled, showing that
 acetic acid is given off.     This would not happen unless there was an acid
 present  to  displace   the acetic acid from the neutral acetate of lead ; and
 this acid must be the acid lead-salt.            There is now no difficulty in ac
 counting for the solution of the acid lead-salt in neutral acetate of lead :
 one equivalent of the colloid acid combines with one equivalent of lead of
 the neutral acetate, two equivalents of neutral lead-salt of the colloid acid
 being formed, PbO . 2 (acid) + PbO C4H503=2 (PbO . acidHC, K,03,
 while free acetic acid is evolved.       On incinerating the acid lead-salt of the
 colloid acid, it chars and leaves a residue consisting of metallic lead.
     By boiling the free acid with a small quantity of hydrated oxide of lead,
 I  have often been surprised at the small proportion of lead dissolved,
 which is apparently owing to the lead being entirely transformed into the
 insoluble acid salt. After being boiled with a larger quantity of the oxide
 and filtered, still acid, a precipitate takes place in the fluid on cooling.
 This precipitate must      be a lead-salt   of the acid.    I have not determined
 its quantitative composition.       1With an excess of hydrated oxide of lead,
 the colloid acid forms a compound in a great measure insoluble in hot
water.     After boiling the colloid acid with hydrated oxide of lead, it was
observed     that  a yellowish-green      crystalline deposit had formed in the
capsule ; these crystals, on being      burnt,   appeared to contain but traces of
organic matter.       I have not yet been able to determine their nature ; but it
is difficult to believe them to be a compound of the organic acid with lead,
this acid being strictly colloid in all its other properties.       When a solution
of the salts of the colloid acid is boiled with hydrated oxide of lead, a
portion only of the acid is precipitated ; so that this method is not available
for the extraction of the acid from urine.
    1When the colloid acid is boiled with peroxide of lead, some lead is dis
solved, and the solution becomes neutral, or but very faintly acid.              The
acid dissolves silver from the carbonate, but        it is not possible to neutralize
it completely thereby.         When boiled with black oxide of copper,          some
copper is dissolved by the colloid acid.
    The Baryta-Salt. — 1When the colloid acid of urine is boiled with carbo

  nate  of baryta, carbonic acid is evolved, the fluid becomes neutral, or very
 slightly alkaline, and is found to contain baryta.        If the insoluble lead-salt
 of the acid be decomposed       with  sulphuric  acid, and the filtrate from the sul
 phate of lead boiled with carbonate of baryta, the fluid becomes more deci
 dedly alkaline.      The analysis and composition of this baryta-salt has been
 given   above  ; the  solution in a syrupy condition deposits no crystals.        The
 concentrated solution of the baryta-compound              behaves as follows with
 reagents.
    Basic acetate of lead     : — A bulky  precipitate soluble in an excess ; the
 precipitate   reappears on addition      of dilute nitric acid ; the further addi
 tion of nitric acid redissolves it.
    Neutral acetate of lead : — A slight precipitate.
    Nitrate of silver : — A slight precipitate readily soluble in nitric acid.
    When the baryta-salt is boiled with carbonate of silver, but a small pro
 portion of the metallic carbonate is decomposed even after long-continued
boiling.
    Acid nitrate of mercury      : — A white precipitate   becoming     darker after a
short time.
    Tannic acid : — A slight precipitate.
    It  should be understood       that the more concentrated        the solution, the
more abundant are the precipitates.
    The Lime-Salt. — The lime-salt exhibits the same characteristic reactions
as the baryta-salt ; it is formed by boiling the free acid with precipitated
carbonate    of lime.    The fluid remained acid after it had        been boiled  with
pounded marble, although some lime was dissolved ; concentrated to a cer
tain point, the solution becomes thick and syrupy, but deposits no crys
tals ; ammonia and oxalate of ammonia do not appear to precipitate com
pletely the lime from the solution, but the precipitation is perfect by means
of sulphuric acid and alcohol.
    The Potash- and Soda-salts. — We may infer from the earthy salts that
the potash- and soda -compounds of the colloid acid of urine have a slightly
alkaline reaction.      There is no difficulty in neutralizing a given volume of
the colloid acid with a potash solution, but it is questionable whether a
definite chemical compound is thus obtained.
             Physiological Relations      of the Colloid Acid of Urine.
    I  have invariably found the colloid acid present in the urine, but its
mode     of extraction described above is calculated to give us but a verv
rough insight into the quantity naturally contained in the secretion.            After
decomposing the lead-precipitate          by sulphuretted hydrogen, a process
which it must     be remembered is a slow one, a given       proportion of the fluid
may be evaporated to dryness, the residue dried at between 101° and 110°
Cent., and its weight ascertained ; the result will be obtained somewhat
more accurately by determining the ashes of the residue, and subtracting
this weight from that of the residue.           I  have extracted     from 8 litres of

 1864.]             Dr. Marcet     on a  Colloid Acid   of Urine.                 9
 urine 4-46 grammes of the colloid acid. This is probably hardly half the
 quantity contained in that bulk of the secretion.          I have some reason to
 believe that the colloid acid described in this paper is not confined to the
 urinary fluid, but is found elsewhere in the human body ; indeed its        secre
 tion by the kidneys shows that it very probably exists in the blood.          My
 experiments   on the blood     have not yet been carried far enough to enable
 me to communicate the results obtained from this inquiry.
    The functions of the colloid acid of urine while in the blood, assuming
that it enters into its composition, must be very important.         There can be
little doubt that it is intimately connected with the secretion of gastric
juice, by displacing the hydrochloric acid of the chloride of sodium in the
 blood, and transforming the soda into a colloid salt, which, from its colloid
nature, would be retained in the blood, while          the free hydrochloric acid
would pass into the stomach to form gastric juice. I have undertaken an
experiment in connexion with this point, which showed that, after dialyzing
for five hours a mixture of chloride of sodium and of the colloid acid of
urine, the hydrochloric acid had nearly entirely passed through the dialyzer,
while rather less than half the amount of the colloid acid had remained on
the diaphragm, holding some soda, though a small quantity, in solution ;
from an accidental omission in my notes,         I  regret being prevented from
giving   the details   of the experiment.
    The free colloid acid being capable to    a certain extent of passing through
a membrane,      its secretion by the kidneys, urine being generally acid, is
easily  accounted    for.
    As to the mode of formation of the colloid acid of urine in the human
body, we have, so far, no positive knowledge.           From its composition and
 colloid nature, it may probably be derived from some transformation of the
 colloid non-nitrogenous       product of the liver, known as the glucogenic
substance.
    Neubauer and Vngel's book on urine contains an account of the mode of
preparation and characters of four organic acids discovered in this secretion
 by Stadeler, these substances being phenylic, taurylic, damaluric and
 damolic acid.      They are obtained from urine by distillation, and are
crystalloids,  and    therefore can have no relation to the substance I have
described in this paper.
    When better acquainted         with the chemical composition and physio
logical relations of the colloid acid of urine, I shall be able to give it an
appropriate   name.

       College, N.S.        Communicated by Professor William Thom
       son, F.R.S. Received December 21, 1864.
    My former paper* embraced the six months from October               1 862 to March
1863.      Since the latter date my observations have been continued as before,
the water-dropping method being employed until December 1 st, since which
time burning matches have been used, as in the previous winter.
    The glass fibre of the station electrometer remained unchanged till July
31st, when it became loosened from its attachment, and was replaced by a
new and much thinner fibre, which has continued in use ever since.                From
comparisons made with the portable electrometer, iu the manner described
in my former paper, it appears that the change of fibre has increased the
indications in the ratio of 20-2 to 3*1.
    The principal observations have, as before, been made three times a day,
namely at 8 or 9 a.m., 2 p.m., and 9 or 10 p.m. ; but additional observa
tions have frequently been taken at other hours, especially during the
months of May, June, and July, when they were much more numerous
 than in any month included in the former paper.               Each observation has
generally contained five air-readings
                                          — the interval between the readings
 being a minute, until September 16th, since which date it has been only
 half a minute.     I assume that this change cannot affect the mean result,
 though it may to some extent influence the observed range. It was adopted
 for convenience, the new fibre being found to admit of more rapid observa
 tion than the old.
    The following is   a summary   of the results of observations during rain or
 other downfall,   fog, and thunder and lightning — the period included being
 the eleven months from April 1863 to February 1864.
    Rain.  —With light rain    the electricity is generally moderate, sometimes
 very weak, and sometimes about double the average fair-weather strength.
 These remarks do not apply to light rain immediately following heavy, the
 electricity being often as strong during the intervals between heavy rain,
 and for some time after its conclusion, as during its descent.             Very heavy
 rain is almost invariably accompanied by very strong electricity.
     Snow. — Almost always positive, but occasionally a little negative inter
 mixed with positive ; and on one solitary occasion (February 16th) strong
 negative sparks were drawn during a heavy fall of snow.              On this occasion
 strong positive electricity was also observed.       It  is worthy     of remark that

on the following morning and midday strong positive sparks were drawn,
and the electricity continued very strong positive during the remainder of
the day.        No snow fell, but a strong west wind filled the air with drifting
snow.
    Hail. — I     have nothing to add under this head, except that on one occa
sion (February 26th) strong positive sparks were drawn during hail accom
panied by lightning and thunder.
     Sleet. — One observation : rather strong negative.
     Fog. — Always positive, and generally above the average strength, but
sometimes rather below.         The fogs embraced in this account were few and
inconsiderable, never lasting more than a few hours, whereas the former
paper included some of a more decided character.
     Thunder-storms. — None of these occurred during the period embraced by
the former paper ; but there have been several since, and always marked
 by very strong electricity.
     The first occurred June 15th, distant thunder commencing about 1 p.m.,
aud a violent thunder-storm           continuing from 4h 30m to 6h p.m. with a
 deluge of rain, three-quarters of an inch falling in half an hour.              Silent
lightning continued all the evening, and to an unknown hour in the night.
 The electrometer showed, as usual, moderate positive, while the thunder was
 distant ; but observations from 4" 36m to 6h 2m showed electricity exces
 sively strong, with frequent changes of sign.            The extremes were +104
 and —121, the average fine- weather strength being 3 or 4.
     The next storm occurred June 24th.              Observations were taken from
 5h   llm   to  5h 39m  p.m., during  which   time much    thunder was heard, but no
 lightning     seen.   The electricity observed was constantly negative, increa
                                                          — 214, this last being the
 sing by a nearly regular advance from —29 to
 strongest electricity that I have ever yet found.           No rain fell during this
 observation, but *39 of an inch fell before 9 p.m., with some heavy peals of
 thunder and vivid lightning.          Immediately after the heaviest peal strong
 negative electricity was found, but was not measured.
     On the evening of July 6th there was much silent lightning, the flashes
 being at the rate of four or five a minute, some of them very vivid. The
 electricity observed was weak, never rising higher than 1*8.
     The next storm occurred July 18th, and closely resembled that of June
  1 5th, but on a reduced scale as regarded its external features.           The indi
 cations of the electrometer,     however,    were quite equal    in strength to those
 observed      on that occasion.     The next day      (July 19th) there was distant
 thunder and lightning, with what appeared           to  be rain in the distance, from
 about 3 to 4 p.m. ; and the electricity observed was very strong negative,
 observations extending from 3h 1 lm to 3" 57m.             The observations on these
 two days are given in extenso at the        end  of this  paper.
     Silent lightning was observed on the evening of August 6th, the electri
 city indicated being moderate positive.
     On August 10th there was a deluge of rain with           some thunder   and light

12                       Prof. Everett — Observations of                         [Jan. 12,
ning, during which frequent observations were taken, showing very strong
electricity, generally negative.
   No more instances occurred till the evening of February 2Gth, when hail
fell, with short intermissions, from a little before 9h 30m p.m. till after mid
night, accompanied by much lightning and some thunder.                     The only obser
vation   of  the  electrometer was at  9h  30m,   when    strong positive sparks were
obtained.
    It appears from these instances, that thunder-storms in the neighbour
hood of the place of observation are accompanied by extremely strong
indications of atmospheric electricity, but that neither silent lightning nor
the distant rumbling of thunder is accompanied by any marked effect on
the electrometer.
   For the sake of comparison with numerical data given in the former
paper, applying to the six months October 1862 to March 1863,                     I subjoin
the corresponding data for April to September 1863, thus completing a
year from the commencement of observations.

   There were 34 days on which both positive and negative electricity were
observed    ; and on 29 of these,      rain or other downfall occurred.                 The
remaining 5 days, with the strongest negative observed, and the state of
cloud and wind at the time, were as under (the scale for cloud being 0-10,
and for wind 0-6).

   It  will be observed that in all     these   instances the weather was cloudy
and the negative electricity weak, characteristics which also belong to the
corresponding instances- in the former paper.               The remark there made,
that on every day on which negative electricity had been observed, positive
had also been observed, holds good down to the present date (March 1864).
   The monthly means of the results of fine-weather observations, for dif
ferent hours     of the day, from April to September          1 863, are shown in the
following Table. They have been computed in the same manner as the
corresponding numbers in the former paper.

14                           Prof. Everett — Observations of                          [Jan. 12,
results agree very well with those derived from the previous six months,
allowing for the difference between the length of the day in summer and in
winter.
    The following Table of the variations of electricity in fine weather, from
month to month, embraces the whole period of observation down to Febru
ary 1864. These results, as well as those above given, are expressed in
units of station electrometer with second fibre, being the same unit that
was employed in the previous paper.
     The day is supposed to be divided into three portions — before noon,
noon to 6 p.m., and after G p.m.                 For each month, all the observations in
each portion have been summed and divided                    by their number, giving the
means shown below.

    c. The electricity on February 17th and part of 18th was out        of range,   and has not
           been reckoned.
     These results show that atmospheric electricity is stronger in winter than
in summer, and seem to indicate a double maximum and minimum within
 the year, — the principal maximum occurring about February, and the other
 maximum       about October          ; the principal minimum in June, and the other
 in November.          It   will be observed that in every case the numbers in the
 column
           "  after   6  p.m." are the smallest.
     At the suggestion of Professor Thomson, 1 have made a careful compa
 rison of the states of electricity, as regards both strength and variableness,
 for different directions of wind.                                I
                                              For this purpose have tabulated accord
 ing to direction of wind (separating also fine-weather from wet-weather
                                                                            p.m. for the first
 observations) the daily entries of mean potential at 2
 twelve months, also the variableness as measured by the difference between
 the entries of highest and lowest potential for the same hour.                           Where
 there was no observation between 3 and 4 p.m. the day was passed over ;

    and where more than one observation was entered between these hours, that
    which was nearest to 2 p.m. was alone reckoned.
        From these data, the monthly means of strength and variableness were
    computed ; but in neither case was any regularity exhibited.                                   The only
    results of this comparison which seem worthy of record are the annual
    fiue-weather means (derived from the monthly) for the prevailing directions
    of wind.          These are —

       I append,         by way of specimen, the observations taken on June 29, July 1,
     1 8, and 1 9.          The first two days contain instances of some of the weakest
     electricity      that    I have ever found in clear weather (I allude particularly to
     the observations at              2h 10m June 29th, and at 3" 4/m July 1st).                   The other
     two days afford fair instances of observations during thunder and lightning*.

        No. II. Action of Ziuc upon a Mixture of Iodide of Ethyl and
        Oxalate of Methyl."        By Edward FranklanT), F.R.S., and
        B. F. Duppa, Esq. Received December 20, 1864.
    In  our former communication * on the action of zinc upon a mixture of
iodide and oxalate of methyl, we described a process by which the use of
the zinc-compounds of the alcohol radicals may be dispensed with in the
production of the     series of acids which      we    are  now investigating.     We
then described this process as being conducted at a temperature of 70° to
 1 00° Cent, for twenty-four hours, until the mixture had solidified to a yellow
ish gnm-like   mass,  which on distillation yielded      a mixture  of water, alcohol,
and the ether of the new acid.        Subsequently we have found it more ad
vantageous to continue the operation for a much longer time at a lower
temperature, thereby obtaining a crystalline instead of a gum-like pro
duct, the former giving a much         better result as regards the production
of ether.
    In  the reaction which forms the subject of the present Note, we have
proceeded in the following manner.           Two atoms of iodide of ethyl were
mixed with one     of oxalate of methyl and placed in          a capacious flask, with
zinc in sufficient quantity to be barely covered by the ethereal mixture.
We prefer to use zinc which has been employed in a previous operation,
as we find it to act not only with greater rapidity, but also at a much
lower temperature.      The time required for the completion of an operation
is about ninety-six    hours   at a temperature of from 30° to 50° Cent.
During the first eighteen or twenty hours no apparent action takes place,
the liquid remaining perfectly limpid, and the zinc apparently untouched ;
but after this period a straw-coloured tint gradually makes its appearance
and slowly increases in intensity, until the liquid solidifies to a mass of
crystals which scarcely fuse at 50° Cent.         The operation may now be con
sidered as ended, although a considerable quantity of the mixed ethers is
still unacted upon.       Water being now added by slow degrees until it
equals three times the volume of the crystalline mass, a copious effer
vescence    takes place ; oxalate and oxide of zinc are formed in abund
ance,   whilst, on the application of heat, alcohol, accompanied by a con
siderable quantity of an ethereal body, distils over along with the iodide
of ethyl that has not been acted upon. The addition of water to the
distillate effects an approximate separation of the ethereal from the alco
holic portion ; the former is then decanted and distilled for the purpose
of separating alcohol and iodide of ethyl. When the temperature of
ebullition rises to 100° Cent., the liquid left in the retort is placed over
chloride of calcium for twelve hours, after which it is again submitted to
distillation, when its boiling-point almost immediately rises to 165° Cent.

liquid, possessing a peculiar ethereal odour only remotely resembling leucate

number 4-84, the above formula corresponding to two volumes of vapour
(H2 0=2 vols.) requires the number 5-03.
   Treated with caustic alkaline bases this ether is readily decomposed, even
in the cold, yielding methylic alcohol and a leucate of the base.      A quan
tity of it was thus decomposed with solution of baryta, the       excess  of the
base being afterwards    removed.     It  yielded on evaporation a crystalline
mass very soluble in water, alcohol, and ether, and which, on analysis,
yielded results closely corresponding with those calculated from the formula
of leucate of baryta.

 from centres standing up freely from the capsule, and containing half an

 differs from that above described by becoming rapidly discoloured when

    Until recently the molecule of aluminic chloride had always         been repre
sented by the formula Al3 Cl3, or, selecting the high atomic weight of alu
minium,     as required by its specific heat, Al Cl,.   But since Deville's deter
mination of the vapour-densities of aluminic and ferric chlorides, many
chemists of eminence, both in this country and abroad, have adopted the
formula Al2 Cle, and have consistently doubled the previously received for
mulae for the entire series of aluminic compounds.           In our opinion, how
ever,   the hitherto existing    data seemed hardly sufficient    for the definitive
establishment of either set of formulae ; and it occurred to us that an exa
mination of the so-called organo-compounds of aluminium might not im
probably throw some important light upon the question at issue between
them.      We regarded the determination of the question as a matter of coa
                                                                      c 2

siderable interest from the bearing it would necessarily have upon the posi
tion of aluminium in a natural classification of the elements ; upon the
molecular formulae of chromic, ferric, cuprous, and perhaps mercurous
compounds ; and consequently upon Laurent and Gerhardt's general law of
even numbers.    Moreover a satisfactory investigation of the organo-
compounds of a metal certainly not belonging to any one of the recognized
classes of metals with whose organo-compounds chemists have become
familiar, seemed likely to furnish a useful contribution to the common know
ledge of orgauo. metallic bodies.     Cahours, in an admirable paper on the
organo-compounds     of  tin, published early in 1860, observed incidentally
that aluminium was attacked by the iodides of methyl and ethyl at the
temperatures 100°-130°, and that the crude ethylated product reacted
violently with zinc-ethide    to form a very inflammable liquid, which was
doubtless aluminium     ethide. Our experiments in confirmation of Cahours' s
results have been as yet merely preliminary ; but by acting on aluminium
with mercuric methide and ethide at the temperature of 100°, we have ob
tained pure aluminium methide and ethide without difficulty, and in not
inconsiderable quantity. This mode of experiment was obviously suggested
by Frankland and Duppa's recently described processes for making methide
and ethide, and for transforming these compounds into zinc methide and
zinc ethide respectively.
                            Aluminium Ethide.
   Mercuric ethide with excess of aluminium-clippings contained in sealed
tubes was heated for some hours in a water-bath, when the mercury was
found completely displaced by the aluminium,      thus,
                  Ala+3 HgEt2=Hg3 + 2AlEt„ or AL,Et,.
After distillation off fresh aluminium   and rectification in an atmosphere     of
hydrogen, the resulting      aluminium   ethide boiled steadily at 194°.        It
occurred as a colourless mobile liquid, which did not solidify at .the tempe
rature of — 18° C.    It evolved dense white fumes on exposure to air, aud
when in thin layers took fire spontaneously, burning with a bluish red-
edged flame, and producing an abundant smoke of alumina.       On analysis
it yielded 61-4 per cent. of carbon, 12-9 per cent, of hydrogen, and 24-0
per cent.     of aluminium, numbers which accord reasonably well with the
formula Al     Et9, or Ala Et„ the carbon and hydrogen being slightly deficient
from   some    unavoidable oxidation of the substance analyzed.    Its vapour-
density, taken by Gay-Lussac's process at the temperature 234°, was found
to be 4*5, the theoretical density calculated for the formula Al Et3 being
3*9, and that for the formula Al»Et, being of course 7-8.    Hence alumi
nium   ethide would appear to have the simple molecular formula Al Et3 ;
for the difference between the experimental number 4-5 and the theoretical
number 3*9, is an obviously necessary consequence         of the extreme oxidiza
bility of the compound.    Water effected a complete decomposition of alu
minium ethide with explosive violence.   Iodine reacted upon       it,
                                                                to produce
iodo-derivatives and iodide of ethyl.   Oxygen  in the form  of dry air was
simply absorbed with production of      body apparently analogous to boric

been submitted to a preliminary examination only.
                              Aluminium Met hide.
   This compound was obtained by     a process strictly analogous to that which
yielded us aluminium ethide.       On heating mercuric methide with alumi
nium-clippings in a water-bath, the replacement of the mercury by alumi
nium took place with even greater facility than was manifested during the
similar treatment of the ethylated body.     After a single distillation, alumi
nium methide occurred as a colourless mobile liquid, boiling steadily at 130°,
and solidifying a few degrees above 0° into a beautiful transparent crystal
line mass. The liquid to#k fire spontaneously on exposure to air, burning
with a very smoky flame, and producing abundant flocculi of alumina dis
coloured by soot.     On analysis, aluminium methide gave 48*4 per cent. of
carbon, 12-3 per cent. hydrogen, and 38-2 per cent. aluminium, numbers
which are quite sufficiently in accordance with the formula AlMe,, or
Al, Me,. Three separate determinations of vapour-density, made at the
temperatures of 240°, 220°, and 220°, the last with hydrogen in the tube,
gave the numbers 2-80, 2-80, and 2-81 respectively, which agree closely
with the theoretical number calculated for the formula Al Me3, namely 2*5.
But the corrected density increased very rapidly with every decrease of
temperature, a peculiarity of behaviour also noticed by Frankland in the
case of boric methide.    Thus three separate determinations, made at 1 63°,
 160°, and 162°, the last with hydrogen in the tube, gave the densities 4*1,
4-1, and 3-9 respectively; while the determinations made at the boiling-
point of aluminium methide, of course with hydrogen in the tube, as re
commended     by Playfair and Wanklyn, gave the densities 4-36 and 4*40
respectively, which approximate somewhat to the theoretical density 510,
calculated for the formula AL, Me,.      Hence aluminium methide appears
to be a member of that class of bodies whose vapour-densities are under
certain circumstances anomalous, either because the bodies exist in two
molecular states  of condensation, or because their vapours   are not possessed
of perfect elasticity until heated considerably above the boiling-points of
the respective liquids.   In either case the question naturally presents itself,
May not the only observed vapour-density of aluminic chloride correspond
to the high vapour-density   of aluminium    methide, and may they not both
be equally anomalous, and consequently     untrustworthy as a basis for deter
mining the general formulae of aluminic compounds      ?

      Sir HENRY HOLLAND, Bart., Vice-President,                        in the Chair.
     The following communications          were read   : —
I. "On Bubbles."               By Frederick. Guthrie, Esq., Professor of
        Chemistry and Physics at the Royal College, Mauritius.                      Com
        municated by Professor Stokes, Sec. R.S.                   Received December
         22, 1864.
     As it was found necessary, in considering drops *, to define the term, and
 limit its application, so we must understand once for all in what sense and
 under what restrictions the term bubble is to be employed.                   This is the
 more necessary, because the word bubble is used even more loosely than
 the word drop.        In Plate I. fig. A, 1,2, and 3 show the meaning of a drop
 as we have defined and used the expression ; 4 shows the condition of a
 bubble as it is understood in the following investigation.
      Under this limitation, a bubble XGLf only differs from a drop XLa                 L,
  (3, fig. A) in consisting of a gas instead of a liquid. A bubble is a mass            of
 gaseous matter compelled to assume a more or less spherical form by the
 cohesion and weight of the liquid medium in which it is formed, and sepa
 rated from other matter by the action of gravity.                 Since, under like con
  ditions    of pressure, all    gases  are lighter than all liquids, the separating
  force is the gravity of the medium, as was the case with the drop (3, fig. A) .
  Accordingly, a bubble invariably ascends. Owing to the universal diffusion
  of gases, no case can exist of a gas- bubble in a gaseous medium (XGG) ;
  and for obvious reasons a solid medium is inadmissible.                   So defined, a
  bubble must therefore invariably be a case of XGL.
      It is, however, worth while, in passing, to notice the construction of some
  other bodies which are also called drops and bubbles.                Thus all the states
  of matter shown in fig. B are called, in common speech, drops or bubbles ;
  and some of them, indeed, are one or the other, according to the aspect
   in which they are viewed.          All of the ten modifications in fig. B are very
   common : the Nos. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 are usually called drops ; the Nos. 7, 8,
   9, 10 are called bubbles.         Nos. 4 and 5 show the two instances of what is
   called spheroidal state.        Nos. 7, 8, 9, 10 are the commonest forms of the
   soap-bubble.       The equations under each figure show the possible identity
   of two matters of the same kind. All the above ten cases are at once dis
   tinguishable from the true drop and bubble by the existence in them of an
   additional factor, which is not present in the true drop or bubble, namely
   the cohesion of a film.         Such drops and bubbles may therefore be con
   veniently distinguished       from  the true ones of fig. A by being called film-
   drops and film-bubbles.          In the spurious drops 1, 2, 3, 5, the film partly
   enclosing and restraining the drop is a film          of liquid : so also in the bubble

9.   In     the drops 4, 6, and in the bubbles 7, 8, the restraining film is a gas.
There is      a remarkable inverse analogy between the cases 4 and 9.       In 4 r
gaseous film hinders a liquid from reaching a liquid ; in 9 a liquid film
hinders a gas from reaching a gas.       The cases 7 and 10 are also called
bubbles, although their only title to the name is the liquid film in each.
Viewed as film-envelopes, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 are bubbles ; viewed as spheroidal
liquid masses they are drops.
    Further, the spurious drops and bubbles differ from the true ones which
we have to examine in a very important particular. The spurious ones are
essentially statical phenomena, and retain their indefinite size for an inde
finite time.   The true drops and bubbles, on the other hand, grow until
their exact equilibrium is established, and they acquire their definite size at
the instant of the overbalancing of that equilibrium — that       at the instant                 is,
of their motion.     It          is,
                           in fact, this overbalancing which determines the
definiteness of their size, by withdrawing them from the size-determining
effect of the action of the contending forces which accompany and condition
their growth.
    All attempts to get perfectly uniform succession of bubbles of the pure
                                 a
form SGL (corresponding to water dropping from              glass sphere) failed    a
through the.impossibility of getting the immersed solid protected by the gas
from the adhesion of the liquid.        But by     contrivance similar to that
                                                                         a
described in the case SL,L2, where                           L,
                                           was lighter than La*,      was found                        it
possible to get bubbles of uniform size, and to measure them.
    The most obvious manner of doing this         to force a gas at    fixed rate
                                                                         is                             a
through        an   ordinary gas-delivery tube, and to collect and measure                                       a    given
number         of the bubbles in            a       calibrated        tube over the pneumatic                    trough.
This plan, however,          is   open to the objection                  of requiring        a   large quantity of
liquid medium.

rounded with water contained              in the vessel       N.      The tubes G and              J   are
firmly bound to a flat piece of cork held by the heavy clamp P, which rests
on the bottom of N.     A thermometer T is placed in the water of N.
   The apparatus   is used  as follows : — B and F being disconnected, the
bottle   A   is nearly filled through C.               The end of     F
                                                is closed by the finger,
and, the stopcock E being opened, the siphon D is filled once for all by
applying the mouth to its longer end. E being then closed, the tube G
is filled up to the required mark with the liquid which is to serve as a
bubble-medium.     The cotton-wool in                   J
                                         is moistened with the same liquid.
All the joints are made fast, and the tube K is connected with the gas-bag
L.    On turning the stopcock E, water flows through the siphon D into
the flask M : to supply its place, gas must enter by F ; that           gas must        is,

to count the bubbles, and to watch without difficulty, at the same time,
the rise of the liquid in M. The contents of M, divided    the number of           by
bubbles, gives the mean volume of                  a   single bubble.  The use of the cotton
wool in the joint between   and      B         F   is   to check the flow of gas through the
 apparatus.     When this plug       absent, the considerable volume of gas in

volume    of A, moreover, prevents the level of its water from undergoing
more than a very slight variation during a single experiment.
    Certain modifications were introduced in the apparatus for special
purposes, which will he described in their proper places.
    Judging by analogy from the results obtained with drops, we should
conclude the bubble-size to be influenced mainly by
    1.  Rate   of sequence, or value of gt.
    2. Chemical nature of bubble-gas, if homogeneous.               Proportion between
its constituents,     if heterogeneous.
    3. Nature    of solid from which the gas is delivered.
    4. Size   of orifice and geometric distribution of solid about its orifice.
    5. Temperature of gas and medium.
    6. Tension of gas, influenced by natural or artificial causes.
    7. Chemical nature of liquid, if homogeneous ; and proportion between
its constituents, if heterogeneous.
    As in the cases of SLG and SLL, the solid             serves mainly as a support
to the dropping liquid, and influences the size of the drop by the various
ways in which it affects the liquid film which adheres to the solid ; the
actual disruption being between liquid and liquid : so in SGL the bubble
parts in truth from gas.
    The separation of       a gas-bubble    differs  materially from that of a drop
in this respect.         In the case SLG it is the persistent cohesion of the
liquid which gives the drop a spheroidal form, and thereby assists gravita
tion to overcome the stubborn cohesion of the liquid. In the case of
SLL the separation is assisted by the persistent cohesion of the liquid
 medium, which also tends to mould the drop into a spherical form, and is
hindered by the stubborn cohesion and weight of the medium, which, by
 resisting its descent, increases its weight.           In the case of a bubble, the
 ascent of the bubble is due wholly to the descent of the liquid medium ;
 and the spheroidal form of the bubble is due wholly to the persistent cohe
 sion  of the liquid medium       ;  for this cohesion is most completely satisfied
 when the cavity containing the gas is most spherical.
    We may now examine seriatim the influences of the seven conditions
 noticed above.

    Influence of    rate.  — To examine the effect of variation in gt      we may take
 common air as the gas, distilled water as the liquid medium, the tube H
 of glass having an opening h of any convenient unmeasured size ; and as
 we are not concerned        with the absolute, but with the relative       sizes of the
 bubbles, the vessel      M may be of an indefinite size.

   It would at first   seem   as  though there were a well-marked difference
depending upon the value of gt.          But in this method of experimenting
there is a possible maximum error of two bubbles in each case, or an error
of four bubbles in the comparison of two instances. This nearly covers the
observed discrepancy.       To set this point at rest, experiments were made
with a larger number of bubbles as follows.         The vessel taken for M was a
 100 cub. centims. flask.     The water in A was each time filled up to a.
Only those two of the values of gt which gave the most widely differing
results in the preceding Table were reexamined, viz. gt= 0-33 and gt = 1 -00.
A thread was fastened to the end of the siphon D, so as to deliver its con
tents in a series of very rapid and minute drops.

    This result, taken together with Tables a and      shows how small     /},                             is   the
 effect of rate upon bubble-size.   If anything, there is, on the whole,                               a    very
slight tendency to diminution in bubble-size as gt diminishes — that        as the                   is,
rate  increases.   This      just the
                                 is   reverse of  what  was found  to be the case
with SLG.       Most probably, however, this effect        not due specifically to
                                                                            is
the rate, but to the alteration in the diameter of the orifice at different
rates.    When     rapidly succeeding series of bubbles passes through the

orifice    the sides of the delivery-tube are swept more completely dry than
            h,

opening is, in fact,    little larger than in the latter.

   The reason why hubbies       are less   sensitive to variations    in gt than are
drops is sufficiently obvious.     In the case of SLG, variation in gt affects
the size of a drop by varying the thickness of the liquid-film which covers
the solid at the moment of the drop's separation.               We have seen that
when this film is thin, in consequence of slowness in the supply of liquid to
the solid, the size   of the drop is diminished, because the solid reclaims
liquid from the drop-root at the instant of the latter's departure.            But in
the case of a bubble, at least in the arrangement of the above experiments,
there is in all cases an indefinitely great aeriform residue, the separation
of the bubble being determined by the superior density of the liquid medium,
and by its persistent cohesion.
   Rate being thus of no appreciable influence upon bubble-size, we are not
compelled to take the same extreme precaution to ensure uniformity of gt,
as was found necessary with drops.
   Effect of change in the chemical nature          of the bubble-gas. — The gases
examined were hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, carbonic acid, and atmospheric
air.   Boiled water was left for several hours in the bags containing the
gases, so that the gases     might  be perfectly     saturated with water, and the
water with the gases, and so that they might have the same temperature.
This water was then employed to fill the' vessel A. By this means all
disagreement between the volume of the bubbles and the volume of the
water flowing from D, caused by the solution of the gas in the water of A,
is avoided.    In each case the gas was allowed to bubble through G until
the water in it was saturated.

   The chemical nature of the gas, therefore, has also very little influence
 upon bubble-size. The two purely physical influences active in determin
 ing the bubble-size       are the density   of the   gas and its solubility in water.
These  act to produce opposite effects.               Increase of density in the gas
delays the departure of the bubble, and thereby increases its size ; increase
in the solubility of the gas in water impairs the stubborn cohesion of the
water, and thereby diminishes the bubble-size.             If
                                                   p and q be the specific
gravities of two gases P and Q referred to water, the buoyancy of two equal
bubbles of them will be respectively

where     W is the weight of an equal volume of water             ;   that   is,   W (q—p)    is
the difference in buoyancy of the two bubbles.                   The    gases      arranged in
their order of density are

   The properties density and solubility are of course incommensurable,
bo that we cannot predict the extent to which they may counteract one
another in the same gas to determine its bubble-size.    But the order of the
gases in Table    y   quite consistent
                      is               with  our previous knowledge.    Thus
the bubble-size of air    intermediate between the bubble-sizes of nitrogen
                            is
and oxygen.   It would, however, at present be premature to attempt to
make use of bubble-size to furnish an additional equation in gas-analysis.
  Effect of temperature and of tension.

                                        a
perature takes no appreciable effect upon bubble-size.  Also     variation of a
three-quarters of an  inch in the natural barometric   mercurial  column                      is
without sensible influence. These two influences were not made matters of
special study, but were only examined with the view of ensuring absence of
error from other experiments.

— The    change examined in this sense was the alteration in the size                   of the
orifice through which the gas bubbled.    For this purpose the ends                     of six
tubes   of various internal diameter were ground flat, and until they had
exactly the same length.. One end of each tube was stopped by    little                 a
glass disk covered with film of
                             a  wax. The tube was then filled to over
flowing with distilled water, and another little disk was pressed on the
top, the superfluous water being wiped off.   The tube was then weighed,
emptied, and dried and reweighed. The same being done for each tube, the
volumes of the tubes are known to be    the same proportion as the weights
                                              in
of their liquid contents, the diameters or radii of the tubes being in the
ratio   of the square roots of the       same weights.     To calibrate tubes in this
manner, water    isto be preferred to mercury, because the latter leaves    film        a
of   air between itself and the glass, and thereby introduces      considerable

     From this Table we see that the bubble-size is very sensitive to the
 size of the orifice.       The bubble-size is doubled if the radius of the orifice
 is increased fivefold ; and so on.            The same effect can also be well shown        <
 in a manner quite analogous to that adopted * to show the effect of varia
 tion in radius of curvature of the solid (SLG).
     If the  same quantity      of gas be made to bubble      in succession through the
 same liquid, similarly disposed         in  similar vessels, and if the tubes through
 which it is delivered have continually decreasing diameters, then the rates
 of bubbling       are seen   to follow the inverse order of the diameters of the
 tubes.     Fig.   D  shows    such an arrangement, which requires no explana
 tion. In fact the reason why increase in radius of curvature in the case
 SLG produces increase of drop-size is very similar to that which causes
 increase of orifice to increase bubble-size in the case SGL.                       In the
 former case the thickness and general approximation of the residual liquid-
 film to the drop is greatest in large and flat surfaces ; in the latter the
 area of residual gas is larger when the orifice is larger. When, around a
 large orifice, the liquid medium closes upon the bubble, the latter is not so
  straitened for material as when the orifice is narrow.
     The influence of the       size  of the tube upon bubble-size is of considerable
  practical importance.         In washing a gas, in separating two gases from
  one another by a medium which absorbs one of them, in saturating a
 liquid by a gas (a process which so often occurs in manufactures and
  analysis), the completeness of the operation invariably depends upon the
  extent of surface in common between the gas and liquid during a given
  time.    If   a spherical   bubble, having the volume        Y  and the surface S, be
                                                                                     V

So   that  if the surface of the    original bubble be      1,  the surface  of the
two bubbles of half the size taken together is 1*259885.            By making the
gas-delivery-tube  small,  the absorbent surface of the same quantity of gas
which passes through is increased in this manner, and the absorption is
consequently more rapid or more complete.
   Effect of change in the chemical nature          of the liquid medium. — To
examine this (perhaps the most interesting phase of the causes of variation
in bubble-size), the gas-bag L was replaced by a chloride-of- calcium tube.

The cotton-wool of was saturated with the liquid, which was placed for
examination in G    ; so that the bubbling gas was dry air already saturated
with the vapour of the liquid through which it had to bubble.            It is clear
that if the air so charged were to come into contact with the water in A,
the vapour would dissolve in the water, while the air would become moist ;
a difference in volume would be thereby occasioned, according to the dif
ference of tension of the vapour of the liquid in G and              J and that of
water.    To avoid this source of error, the vessel A was filled with mercury.
After each experiment the vessel A was completely refilled with mercury,
so as to expel the vapour of the liquid employed in the previous experi
ment.     The mercury was then run off at D, until it fell in A nearly to the
mark a. The liquid under examination in G had a height above h in
versely as its specific gravity : this the graduation of the tube G made
easy.    By this means the pressure on the gas as it issued from h was the
same in all the experiments.     The vessels A, G, and      J  were all sunk in the
same trough of water, so that the volume of the air should undergo no
alteration from temperature, either during or after its passage through G.
When gt had been brought exactly to 2", and the mercury in A had sunk
to a, a graduated burette was brought under the end of the siphon D,
and kept there while 100 bubbles passed through G.                The numbers     of

   These liquids, which were purposely taken the same as those whose
drop-sizes were examined, are arranged in Table e in the order of the
magnitude of the bubble-size. We see that the order is not the same in
the two cases.    The difference is due to the elimination in Table e of the
influence of gravitation.    In fact the only forces which influence bubble-
size, as shown in Table e, are the retentive and stubborn cohesions of the
liquid* ; for the first of these seeks to diminish, the second to increase the
bubble-size.     If
                  RC be the retentive, and SC the stubborn cohesion, the
liquids are arranged in Table e in the same order of magnitude as are the
            SC
values of T— . The density of a liquid seems therefore to vary with its
            RC
stubborn rather       than with its retentive cohesion          ;   for there is an evident
general tendency in the above Table e for the liquids to arrange themselves
in the order of their specific gravities.   Water once more distinguishes
itself, taking a higher place in the  scale than its density would point to :
this must arise either from its exceptionally great stubborn, or from its ex
ceptionally small retentive cohesion.
   Acetic ether and alcohol are also exceptional — the former taking a lower,
the latter a higher place in the scale than would be the case if the same state
of quantity of matter in                 (which is usually measured by means
                             a given space
of gravity) affected also the cohesion of the liquid so as alone to determine
the bubble-size of a gas passing through it.     Perhaps also the gas having
different degrees of solubility in the different liquids may affect their cohe
sions unequally.    This source of variation, however, is probably very small,
as we have seen to be the case when the gas varies and the                    liquid remains
the same.     A few experiments with a mixture of benzol and turpentol, and
with  alcohol  and water, showed that in all cases the mixed liquid gives rise
to a bubble intermediate in size between those caused by the single liquids.
   By measuring the volume of a greater number of bubbles, the actual dif
ferences of bubble-size due to various liquids would of course become more
apparent.
     Throughout the examination of drops and bubbles       in the present and
previous communications,   I have sought to direct attention  to the main influ
ences which fix the size of a drop or bubble, rather than to pursue any one
branch of the inquiry into its minute ramifications.      Further, the subject
has been treated wholly from a statical point of view ; that   the bubble     is,
and drop have been considered at that period of their being when the con
tending forces which act upon them have brought them into     state of un     a
stable equilibrium or incipient motion.           It   is   in fact only at this point, the
instant of their ripeness, that they have     a   definite size     ;for their size increases
until the contending forces themselves withdraw the drop or bubble from
the sphere of the action which determines their volume.
   Knowing now the direction and approximately the relative amounts of
the effects due to the various conditions under which the drop and bubble

the drop- and bubble-size as a means of proximate chemical diagnosis*. It
does not appear that bubble-volume is at present likely to afford an addi
tional equation for gas-analysis          ; but we have seen that both drop-size
and bubble-size       may   offer very   valuable    criteria as to the constitution of
liquids. And although the former (drop-size), especially in the case
SL,!^, is by far the most sensitive to variation in the chemical constitution
and proportion of mixed constituents, the latter has the advantage of
requiring a much less amount of liquid, and of being applicable to every
liquid without regard to its solubility in other liquids.
 II.   "Note on the Invisible Radiation                 of the Electric Light."           By
           John Tyndall, T.Il.S.             Received January 13, 1865.
     Pending the preparation of my complete memoir, which may occupy me
 for some time to come, I would ask permission of the Royal Society to lay
before the Fellows a brief and partial summary of the results of my experi
 ments on the invisible radiation of the electric light.
     The distribution of heat in the spectrum of the electric light was exa
 mined     by means     of the linear thermo-electric pile, applied to the solar
 spectrum by Melloni, Franz, Miiller, and others.                 The electric spectrum
 was formed by lenses and prisms of pure rock-salt, its width being equal
to the length of the row of elements forming the pile.               The latter, standing
 at right angles to the length of the spectrum, was caused to pass through
its various colours in succession, and to search the spaces beyond the region
 of colour, in both directions.
     As in the case of the solar spectrum, the heat was found to augment
 from the violet to the red, while the maximum heating effect was observed
 beyond the red, and at a distance from the red, in one direction, equal to
 that of the green of the spectrum in the other.
     The augmentation of temperature beyond the red in the case of the
 electric light is sudden and enormous.               Plotting from a datum line the
 thermal intensity of the various portions             of the spectrum, the ordinates
 suddenly increase in length beyond the red, reach a maximum, and then
 fall somewhat more suddenly on the other side. When the ends of the
 ordinates are united, the curve beyond the red rises in a steep and massive
 peak, which quite dwarfs the luminous portion of the spectrum.
     The comparative height and steepness of this peak are much greater than
 those obtained by Professor Miiller for the solar spectrum.                      Aqueous
 vapour acts powerfully upon the invisible rays ; and doubtless the action
 of this substance in our atmosphere has toned down the eminence beyond
 the red in Professor Miiller'    s diagram.       A  solar spectrum, produced beyond

the limits           of the atmosphere, would probably exhibit          as steep    a peak as
that of the electric light.
     In the experiments now to be referred to, the rays from the electric light
were converged by a small concave mirror.    The glass mirror silvered at the
back, which usually accompanies the camera of Duboscq's electric lamp,
was one of the first employed.    It was brought so near the electric light
as to cast an image of the coal-points five or six inches in advance of the
light.          A   of iodine in bisulphide of carbon, contained in a rock-
                    solution
salt cell, was then placed in front of the lamp : the light was thereby cut
off; but the focus of dark rays remained, and various effects of combustion
and incandescence were obtained at the focus.     A mirror 4 inches in dia
meter, and silvered in front, will enable an experimenter to obtain most, if
not all the results now to be mentioned.    I also employ a mirror 8 inches
in diameter, and having a focal length of 8 inches, with excellent effect.
   It is not necessary to enclose the opaque solution in a rock-salt cell.
The vessel intended for a solution of alum, which usually accompanies the
lamp of Duboscq, and the sides of which are of glass, answers admirably.
It is, however, not quite deep enough for the several tests to which have               I
subjected           it,

salt sides.
  With the 8-inch mirror just referred to behind the electric light, the
opaque solution in front, and the focus of invisible rays about   inches            6
distant from the electric light, the following effects have been obtained —                 :

   The assemblage of phenomena here described, and others to be referred
to in my completed memoirs, may, I think, be properly exprtfsied by the
term Calorescence.          This word involves no hypothesis, and it harmonizes
well with the term fluorescence, now universally            employed with reference
to the more refrangible end of the spectrum *.

        magnifying power than any one hitherto made."                   By   Lionel     S.

         General and Morbid Anatomy in King's College, and Physician
         to King's College Hospital.          Received December 30, 1865.
    I  desire to record the completion of a new objective, with a magnifying
power double that of the twenty-fifth.         This glass is a fiftieth, and magnifies
nearly three thousand diameters with the low eyepiece.                  Messrs. Powell
and Lealand, the makers, to whom science is indebted for this the highest
power yet made, produced a sixteenth in the year 1840, and the twenty-
sixth in 1860.
    The fiftieth defines       even  better than the twenty-fifth, which is now
made instead        of the twenty-sixth.     Plenty of light for illuminating the
objects to be examined is obtained by the use of a condenser provided
with    a thin cap, having an opening not more than the
                                                                   -^th of an inch in
diameter.        The preparation may be covered with the thinnest glass made
   * On the 5th of last December I tried the passage of the rays from the electric lamp
through a great number of differently coloured glasses.     Incandescenoe was obtained
through almost all of them ; and in one instance, the radiation passing through a blue
glass, the thermograph of the coal-points was of a pink colour.       A thick black glass,
obtained from Mr. Ladd, when held in front of the lamp, was found to be not perfectly
opaque ; still the platinum could not be raised to incandescence    a tall when placed in
the focus.     Being called away from the Royal Institution early in the afternoon, I gave
directions to my assistant, Mr. Barrett, to continue the experiments.      He informs mo
that on placing in the path of the rays a combination of two thin plates of black glass,
one transmitting a whitish-green, and the other a deep red, the light was entirely inter
cepted, and feeble though distinct incandescenoe  was obtained at the focus. With ra
diation through the solution of iodine, the thermograph on this day rose to a white heat.

by Messrs. Chance, of Birmingham, or mica, and there is plenty of room
for focusing to the lower surface of thin specimens, which can alone be
examined by high powers as transparent objects.              I  beg to draw attention
to these very high powers at       this time  more   particularly, because the facts
recently urged in favour of the doctrine of spontaneous generation lately
revived may be studied with great advantage.             Not only are particles, too
small to be discerned by a sixteenth, well seen by a twenty-fifth or a
fiftieth, but particles too transparent to be observed by the twenty-fifth
are distinctly demonstrated by the fiftieth.           I  feel sure that the further
careful study, by the aid of these high powers, of the development and
increase of some of the lowest organisms, and the movements which have
been seen to occur in connexion with certain forms         of living matter (Amoeba,
white    blood-corpuscle, youpg epithelial cells, &c.), will lead to most va
luable results bearing upon the much debated question of vital actions.
    Another very great advantage resulting from the use of the highest
powers      occurs in minute     investigations upon delicate structures which
occupy different planes, as is the case in many nervous organs.               In study
ing the distribution of the nerves in some of the peripheral organs of
vertebrate animals, very fine fibres can be followed as they lie upon dif
ferent planes.
    The most delicate constituent nerve-fibres        of the plexus in the summit
 of the papillae of the frog's tongue (New Observations upon the Minute
 Anatomy of the Papillae of the Frog's Tongue, Phil. Trans, for 1864),
can be readily traced by the aid of this power.               The finest nerve-fibres
 thus rendered visible are so thin, that in a drawing they would be repre
 sented by fine single lines.        Near the summit of the papilla there is a
very intricate interlacement of nerve-fibres, which, although scarcely brought
 out by the twenty-fifth, is very clearly demonstrated by this power.                 In
 this object the definition of the fibres, as they ramify in various planes one
behind      another, is remarkable ; and the flat appearance of the speci
men as seen by the twenty-fifth, gives place to that of considerable depth
 of tissue and perspective. The finest nerve-fibres ramifying in the cornea
 and in certain forms of connective tissue are beautifully brought out by
 this power, and their relation to the delicate processes from the connective-
 tissue corpuscles can be more satisfactorily demonstrated than with the
 twenty-fifth. The advantage of the fiftieth in such investigations seems
 mainly due to its remarkable power of penetration.              The angular aperture
 of this glass is 150°. Many twelfths have been made with a higher angu
 lar aperture, amounting to 1 70°.
     It should  be stated that the specimens of animal tissues which        I  have sub
jected   to  examination  by very high powers    are  mounted     in strong syrup, or in
 the strongest glycerine, according to the process detailed in ' How to work
 with the Microscope,' 3rd edition, p. 204.          It is perfectly true that no ad
 vantage results from examining by the aid of very high powers the tissues
 of man and the higher animals immersed in water, or in fluids of which water
 is the chief constituent   ; nor is it possible to make the specimen sufficiently

thin for examination with very high powers if immersed in a limpid fluid.
The arrangement of the nerve-fibres        I  have referred to is not to be de
monstrated in tissues immersed in water.             The finer branches of the
nerves are in fact quite invisible until the specimen is well impregnated
with a highly refracting fluid. The imperfect methods of preparation
usually employed for examining the higher tissues have given rise to a
prejudice against the employment of high powers.          I have not referred to
the use of very high powers in studying the characters of the Diatomacea:,
because it is a branch of microscopic investigation which          I  have very
little studied.    Other observers will probably state very shortly if any
thing is gained by the use of these high powers in this department.           It
is probable  that,  by improved means    in illuminating the objects, many new
and important points will be made out by the use of very high magnifying
powers.     Mr. Brooke has already suggested possible improvements in the
condenser, some of which, I believe, he will carry out shortly.

    After giving  a short sketch  of the history of their subject, the authors
proceed to state the nature of the mnterials which had been placed at
their disposal.     In the first place, Mr. Carrington had very kindly put
into their hands all his original drawings of sun-spots, extending from
 November 1853 to March 1861.          In the next place, their materials were
derived from the pictures taken by the Kew heliograph. A few pictures were
taken by this instrument at Kew Observatory in the years 1858 and 1859.
 In July 1860 it was in Spain doing service at the total eclipse. In 1861
a few pictures were taken at Kew, while from February 1862 to February
 1 863 the instrument was in continuous operation at Mr. De la Rue's private
 observatory at Cranford, and from May 1863 until the present date it
 has been in continuous operation at Kew under Mr. De la Rue-s super
intendence.     A Table was then given, from which it was deduced that the
number of groups observed at Kew from June to December 1863 in
 clusive was 64, while that observed by Hofrath Schwabc during the
 same interval was 69.       In like manner, the number at Kew between
January and November 1864 inclusive was 109, while during the same
interval Hofrath Schwabe observed 126. It thus appears that Schwabe's
 numbers are somewhat larger thau those of Kew ; but probably, by means of
 a constant corrective, the one series may be made to dovetail with the other.

   38         De la Rue, Stewart, and Loewy on Solar Physics.             [Jan. 26,
      The authors then attempted to answer the following questions : —
      (1)   Is the umbra of    a spot nearer the sun's centre than the penumbra,
   or, in other words, is it at a lower level ?
      (2) Is the photosphere of our luminary to be viewed as composed of
   heavy solid, or liquid matter, or is it of the nature either of a gas or cloud ?
      (3)   Is a spot  (including both umbra and penumbra) a phenomenon
   which takes place beneath the level of the sun's photosphere or above it ?
      In answering the first of these, it was shown that if the umbra is ap
   preciably at a lower level than the penumbra, we are entitled to look for
   an apparent encroachment of the umbra upon the penumbra on that side
   which is nearest the visual centre of the disk. This, in fact, was the
   phenomenon which Wilson observed, and which led him to the belief that
  .the umbra was nearer the sun's centre than the penumbra.
„     Two Tables are then given, showing the relative disposition of the umbra
   and penumbra for each spot of the Kew pictures available for this purpose.
      In the first of these, this disposition was estimated from left to right,
   this being the direction in which spots advance across the visible disk by
   rotation ; while in the second Table this disposition was estimated in a
   direction parallel to circles of solar longitude, and in this Table only spots
   having a high solar latitude were considered.
      From the first of these Tables it was shown that, taking all those cases
   where an encroaching behaviour of the umbra in a right and left direction
   has been perceptible, 86 per cent. are in favour of the hypothesis that the
   umbra is nearer the centre than the penumbra, while 14 per cent. are
   against it.     It also appeared that, taking all available spots and distri
   buting them into      zones   according to their distance from the centre, this
   encroaching    behaviour    is  greatest when spots are near the border, and
   least when they are near the centre.
      From the second Table, in which only spots of high latitude were con
   sidered, it was shown that, taking all those cases where an encroaching
   behaviour of the umbra in an up-and-down direction has been perceptible,
   80*9 per cent. are in favour of the hypothesis that the umbra is nearer
   the centre than the penumbra, while 19-1 per cent. are against it.
      The result of these Tables is therefore favourable to this hypothesis.
      The authors next endeavoured to answer the following question : — Is
   the photosphere of our luminary to be viewed as composed of heavy
   solid, or liquid matter, or is it of the nature either of n gas or cloud?
      It was observed that the great relative brightness of faculae near the
   limb leads to the belief that these masses exist at a high elevation in the
   solar   atmosphere, thereby escaping a great part of the absorptive in
   fluence, which is particularly strong near the border ; and this conclusion
   was confirmed by certain stereoscopic pictures produced by Mr. De la
   Rue, in which the faculae appear greatly elevated.         It was remarked that
   faculae often retain the same appearance     for several days, as if their matter
   were capable of remaining suspended for some time.
      A Table was then given, showing the relative posit on of sun-spots and

   their accompanying      faculae  for all the     Kew pictures      available   for this
   purpose.
      From this it appeared that out of 1137 cases 584 have their faculae
   entirely or mostly on the left side, 508 have it nearly equal on both sides,
   while only 45 have it mostly to the right. It would thus appear as if
   the luminous matter being thrown up into a region of greater absolute
   velocity of rotation fell behind to the left ; and we have thus reason to sup
   pose that the faculous matter which accompanies a spot is abstracted from
   that very portion of the sun's surface which contains the spot, and which
j-has in this manner been robbed of its luminosity.
      Again, there are a good many cases in which a spot breaks up iu the
   following manner.       A bridge of luminous matter of the same apparent
   luminosity as the surrounding photosphere appears to cross over the
   umbra of a spot unaccompanied by any penumbra.                  There is good reason
   to think that this bridge is above the spot ; for were the umbra an opaque
   cloud and the penumbra a semi-opaque cloud, both beiug above the sun's
   photosphere, it is unlikely that the spot would break up in such a manner
   that the observer should not perceive some penumbra accompanying the
   luminous bridge.     Finally, detached portions of luminous matter sometimes
   appear to move across a spot without producing any permanent alteration.
      From all this it was inferred that the luminous photosphere is not to
   be viewed as composed of heavy solid, or liquid matter, but is rather of
   the nature either    of  a gas or cloud, and also that a spot is a phenomenon
   existing below the level of the sun's photosphere.
      The paper concluded with theoretical considerations             more or less pro
   bable.    Since the central or bottom part of a spot is much less luminous
   than the sun's photosphere, it may perhaps be concluded that the spot
   is of  a lower  temperature than the photosphere ; and if it be supposed
   that all the sun's   mass at this level is of a lower temperature than the
   photosphere,    then we must conclude that the heat of our luminary is
   derived from without.

          Orion."     By William Huggins, F.R.A.S.                  Communicated       by
          the Treasurer.      Received January 11, V865.
      In  a paper recently presented to the       Royal Society*,     I  gave the results
  of the application of prismatic      analysis to some of the objects in the hea
   vens known as nebulae.        Eight of the nebulae examined- gave a spectrum
  indicating gaseity, and, of these, sis belong to the class of small and com
   paratively bright objects which it is convenient to distinguish still by the
   name of planetary.        These nebulae present little indication of probable
  resolvability into discrete points, even with the greatest optical power
   which has yet been brought to bear upon them.

 gaseous form, are 57 M, the annular nebula in Lyra, and 27M, the Dumb
 bell nebula.  The results of the examination of these nebulae with telescopes
 of great power must probably            be regarded as      in favour of their consisting
 of clustering stars.   It was therefore of importance to determine, by the
 observation of other objects, whether any nebulae which have been certainly
 resolved into stars give a spectrum which shows the source of light to be
 glowing gas. With this purpose in view                 I
                                                 submitted the light of the
 following easily resolved clusters to spectrum analysis.
    "4670. 2120 h. 15 M. Very bright cluster ; well resolved " *.
    "4G78, 2125 h. 2 M. Bright cluster, well resolved."
    Both these clusters gave a continuous spectrum.
      I then   examined the Great Nebula in the Sword-handle                   of Orion.   The
 results   of telescopic observation on this nebula               f   seem to show that    it is
 suitable for observation as a crucial test of the correctness of the usually
 received opinion that the resolution of a nebula into bright stellar points is
 a certain and trustworthy indication that the nebula consists of discrete
 stars after the order     of those whichbright to us. Would the brighter
                                             are
portions of the nebula adjacent to the trapezium, which have been resolved
into stars, present the same spectrum as the fainter and outlying portions ?
In the brighter parts, would the existence of closely aggregated stars be
revealed to us by a continuous spectrum, in addition to that of the true
gaseous matter       ?
   The telescope and spectrum apparatus employed were those of which                          a
description was given in my paper already referred to.
   The light from the brightest parts of the nebula near the trapezium was
resolved by the prisms into three bright lines, in all respects similar to those
of the gaseous nebulae, and which are described in my former paper.
   Thesc]three       lines, indicative   of gaseity, appeared (when the slit of the
apparatus was made narrow) very sharply defined and free from nebulosity                      ;
the intervals between the lines were quite dark.

the Dumb-bell nebula, and to which reference was made in my former

whole, or the greater part of the light from this part of the nebula, must
therefore be regarded as the united radiation of these numerous stellar
points.   Now        this light which, when analyzed by the prism, reveals
                        it   is
to us its gaseous source,  and the bright lines indicative of gaseity are free
from any trace of    continuous spectrum, such as that exhibited

   The conclusion     obvious, that the detection in

closely associated points of light, which has hitherto been considered
as   a   certain   indication         of   a   stellar constitution,         can no longer      be accepted
as   trustworthy proof that the object consists of true stars.

shown by the prism to be enormous gaseous systems      and the conjecture           ;
appears probable that their apparent permanence of general form     main                              is
tained by the continual motions  of these denser portions which  the tele
scope reveals as  lucid points.

nebula, since these have been founded upon the supposed extent of remote
ness at which stars of considerable brightness would cease to be separately
visible in our telescope, must now be given up in reference at least to those
of the nebula? the matter of which has been established to be gaseous.
   It is much to be desired that proper motion should be sought for in
those of the nebulae which are suitable for this purpose ; indications of
parallax might possibly be detected in some, if any nebulae could be found
that would admit of this observation.
   If this view of the greater nearness to us of the gaseous nebulae be ac
cepted, the magnitudes of the separate luminous masses which the telescope
reveals as minute points, and the actual intervals existing between them,
would be far less enormous than we should have to suppose them to be on
the ordinary hypothesis.
   It  is worthy of consideration that all the nebulae which present a gaseous
spectrum exhibit the same three bright lines; in one case only, 18 H.IV.,
was a fourth line seen.           If  we suppose the gaseous substance of these
objects   to represent    the  "nebulous    fluid" out of which, according to the
hypothesis of Sir Wm. Herschel, stars are to be elaborated by subsidence
and condensation,        we should expect a gaseous spectrum in which the
groups    of  bright  lines  were as numerous as the dark lines due to absorp
tion which are found in the spectra of the stars. Moreover, if the im
probable supposition be entertained, that the three bright lines indicate
matter in its most elementary forms, still we should expect to find in some
of the nebulae, or in some parts of them, a more advanced state towards
the formation     of   a number      of separate bodies, such as exist in our sun
and in the stars ; and such an- advance in the process of formation into stars
would have been indicated by a more complex spectrum.
    My observations, as far as they extend at present, seem to be in favour
of the opinion that the       nebulae   which give a gaseous spectrum, are systems
possessing a structure, and a purpose          in relation to the universe, altogether
distinct and of another order from the great group of cosmical bodies to
which our sun and the fixed stars belong.
    The nebulous star t Orionis was examined, but no peculiarity could be
detected in its continuous spectrum*.

    The return of Mars to his periodical opposition with the sun has enabled
me to offer a few observations on this planet, in addition to those which
on a former occasion       I had the honour to present to the Society         f.    Among

observation on the nebulae were insufficient to support the opinion that all these objects

 the subjects then suggested for consideration was the permanence of the
 main features of light and shade which had been recognized by many ob
 servers.    Another question requiring attention referred to the fogginess or
 seeming cloudiness of the planet, also noticed by many observers, some of
 whom represented what might be thought effects of currents in the atmo
 sphere round him.         Again, it was a matter for further research whether
 the colours of what we suppose to be land and sea (the reddish hue of the
 land, and the grey aspect of the sea) were capable of explanation by any
 peculiarity of the soil or atmosphere, and whether, from the phenomena of
 snows visible about the poles and elsewhere, the climate of Mars could be
 estimated on trustworthy grounds.
    My observations      are too few to    furnish answers for all these questions ;
 but I have something to say in reply to some of them, though the distance
of Mars from the Earth during the late opposition was too great to allow
 of such close scrutiny as in 1862.
    First, then, in respect of the permanence of the main features of the
 planet.   I submit several drawings* made between the 14th November and
 13th December (both inclusive), the dates being marked on each, for com
 parison with others made in 1862, partly by Mr. Lockyer, partly by my
 self ; from which it will immediately appear that no appreciable change
has occurred in the main outlines of land and sea, in the longitudes observed.
A    certain fogginess has been noticed, especially on the 18th and 20th
November, such as does not commonly occur with Jupiter or Saturn ; but
it seemed to be due to no essential circumstance of the planet, for it grew
less and less as the observation approached the meridian.
    The colour of the larger masses of land is the same as formerly observed,
but fainter from distance ; and the sea is grey and shadowy, but without
the very distinct greenish hue which was noticed in 1862.                      Finally, the
snows round the south pole appeared much less extensive than in 1862,
and were not really observable with distinctness except on a few evenings.
Snowy surfaces, scarcely more denned, but much more extensive, were
observed in parts of the northern regions, not immediately encircling the
pole (which was invisible), but in two principal and separate tracts estimated
to reach 40° or 45° from the pole.           On one occasion (30th November) two
practised observers (Mr. Luff and Mr. Bloxidge) noticed with me one of
these gleaming masses of snow, very distinct— so much so, that, as happened
with the south polar snow in 1862, it seemed to project beyond the circular
outline — an optical effect, no doubt, and due to the bright irradiation.
This white mass reached to about 40° or 45° from the pole, in the meridian
of 30° on my globe of Mars. Another mass was noticed on the 14th and
18th November,       in long. 225°, and extending to lat. 50°. In each case
the masses reached the visible limb.
   The small extent of the snow visible at the further pole may be truly
the effect of the position of the planet.              If we remember that on this
occasion the axis    of Mars was nearly (within about          6° or  8°)  at right angles

 to the line     of sight, while in 1862 it was oblique (about 2G°),            we shall  per-  «
ceive that though the snow about the south pole were really as extensive
in 1864      as it appeared to be in 1862, it could not possibly appear even
nearly so large, and in fact could barely be seen (as it was) under the
very small angle which it would subtend on the limb.                      There may, how
ever, have been really less snow round the south pole, in consequence of
the longer action of the summer heat on Mars in 1864 than in 1862.                              *
    The ruddy tint of the surface of the broad tracts of land is so constantly
observed in these parts as to claim to be regarded as characteristic of some
peculiarity in them — some special kind of terrestrial substance for ex
ample *.        On the other hand, the tint is so much like that of our evening
clouds as to suggest the probability of its being due to the deep atmo
spheric zone which has been often ascribed to this planet, though perhaps,
until of late years, on insufficient grounds t- On this head spectral analysis
will probably enlighten us. If, however, there be such a deep covering of
atmosphere, it might explain some facts regarding the climate which other
wise appear unaccountable.             Some considerable amount of vaporous atmo
sphere     there   must  be, to  give   origin to the beds of snow which alternately
invest and desert the opposite poles,            if  indeed either pole be ever quite free
from snow.
    In different Martial years the extent of the snow appears nearly the
same under         nearly similar conditions.          Compare, for instance, Herschel's
drawing for August         16, 1830 J, with my sketch for September 27, 1862 §,
and that now presented for November 20, 1864.
    Snows appear to have been observed in mass as far from the south pole
as lat. 40°.        This occurred in April 1856, according to a drawing by Mr.
De la Rue       : snow in lat. 50° or perhaps 45° North                is the result of my
observations during this late opposition.                Assuming    this to be the geogra
phical limit of the freezing mean winter temperature, we sec at once that
it differs but little from that of the earth, on which the isothermal line of
32° varies, according to local peculiarities, from the latitude of 40° to that
of 60°.       If  the snows on the land of Mars be compared with those on the
northern tracts of Asia and America, they will be found not to extend
further. And as the snows, if they do not actually disappear, are reduced
to small areas about either pole in its warm season, thus showing the mean
summer temperature there to be not less than 32°, this confirms the
general impression that the variations             of the climate of Mars     are comprised

  or 10° more or less round the pole, the icy circle seems to be perennial.
     The relative mean distances from the Sun of Mars and the earth being
 taken at 100 and 152, the relative solar influence must be on Mars 100
 to 231 on the earth        ;  so that the surface  of the more distant planet might
 rather be expected to have shown signs of being fixed in perpetual frost,
 than to have a genial temperature of 40° to 50°, if not 50° to 60°, as the
 earth has, taken on the whole.             How is this to     be accounted      for ? Of
 two conceivable influences which may be appealed to, viz. very high interior
 heat of the planet, and some peculiarity of atmosphere, we may, while
 allowing some value to each, without hesitation adopt the latter as the
 more immediate and effective.
     To trace the    effects in detail must be impracticable        ; but in the general
 we may remark         that as a diminution of the mass of vaporous atmosphere
 round the earth     would     greatly exaggerate the difference of daily and nightly,
 and of winter and summer temperature, so the contrary effect would follow
 from an augmentation of it.            Applying this to Mars, we shall see that his
 extensive atmosphere would reduce the range of summer and winter, and
 of daily and nightly temperature.            It would, moreover, augment the mean
 temperature      by the peculiar action of such an atmosphere, which, while
 readily giving passage to the solar rays, would resist the return of dark heat-
 rays from the terrestrial surface, and prevent their wasteful emission into
 space   *.    This  effect obtains now on the earth,      which is rendered warmer,
 as well as more equable in temperature, by the atmosphere than it would
 be without it.       It is conceivable that it may obtain upon Mars to a greater
 degree,    even  without     supposing the atmosphere to be materially different
 in its nature from that round the earth, or the surface of Mars to have
 any specially favourable or exceptional characters for the absorption and
radiation of heat.         It  seems, however, requisite    to suppose a greater com
munication of      heat from the interior of the planet ; for otherwise the addi
tional vapour, to which the warming effect is in the main to he ascribed,
could not probably be supported in the atmosphere.                     On the whole we
may, perhaps, be allowed to believe that Mars is habitable.
     Here,   so far as direct observations upon the aspect        of Mars   are available,
we may pause.         The researches of the Radcliffe Observer, lately in Oxford,
and formerly at Greenwich, have, however, brought into view a peculiarity
in the constitution of this planet which deserves special notice.               lis figure
is spheroidal, as might be expected from the general laws of planetary
form ; but it is spheroidal in so high a degree as to be quite exceptional
in this respect.         Computing by the known rotation- velocity, and the
admitted measures and mass of Mars, its ellipticity should be about ^J^.

Mr. Main's      observations with the splendid Oxford Heliometer give as the
most probable result, the large fraction of j—rg for 1862.                This excellent
astronomer has continued his observations during the late opposition.                  My
own attempts      to obtain  the  ellipticity with  the  micrometer eyepiece reading
to 0"-2 of arc failed to give satisfactory measures.           The ellipticity, indeed,
seemed    to be small, and was merely observable, not really measurable or
even to be approximately        estimated by the help of this apparatus.

       lips, M.A., LL.D., F.R.S., F.G.S., Professor of Geology in the
        University of Oxford.          Received January 13, 1865.
                                         Part I.
    Frequently, during many years, the peculiarities of the physical                 aspect
of the sun have arrested my attention, and induced                 me often to sketch
and sometimes to measure ; but until Mr. Cooke furnished me with the
accurate and convenient equatorial which I now employ, there seemed
little hope of my being able to draw correctly or observe systematically.
During some late occasions            I  have endeavoured to obtain trustworthy
representations not only of some of the darker tracts, denominated
                                                                                  " spots,"
and the brighter parts which are near them, called              " faculae," but also of
the general uneven groundwork of the sun's disk.
    In tracing the path of a "spot" across the disk of the sun, employ a      I
Kellner (positive) eyepiece of about 50 linear, on which are engraved
five transit-lines, at intervals of about -ffi- of the sun's diameter, and there
fore, near the centre of the disk, about equal to 10°.              Having, with this-
 eyepiece   applied to the diagonal sun-glass, and the clock movement, de
termined the position of the spots, I replace the Kellner by ordinary
(negative) eyepieces, whose powers range from 75 to 300, the latter
being seldom beneficial except for objects near the limb, and in very fa
vourable weather — which, in my experience, means a partially clouded
 sky, westerly winds, and morning hours by preference.                     Some of the
 clearest views which I have experienced were had in the intervals of
 storms and snow-clouds — the slowly drifting snow-flakes of those clouds
 being visible as dark spots in the field of view, when the eyepiece was
 adjusted to their very moderate distance*.
    I present a diagramf showing the appearance of the sun's disk on the
 29th of March,       1 864, and other sketches       of the bright and shady parts
 of the surface.        From the variations       in the appearance of the spots,
 faculae, and ground surface, many suggestions arise ; but I limit myself on
 this occasion to some inferences which appear justified by the observations
 of the least variable of them. So great is the diversity in the short

 clouds, employing for the purpose a well-known formula.

   Facula. — Near the   edge of the solar disk, and especially about spots
approaching   the edge, it is quite easy, even with a small telescope, to
discern certain very bright streaks of diversified form, quite distinct in
outline, and either entirely separate, or coalescing in various ways into
ridges and network.   When, near the limb, the spots become invisible, the
                                                         I
undulated shining ridges and folds to which refer still indicate their place —
being more remarkable thereabout than elsewhere on the limb, though
everywhere traceable in good observing- weather* (see Plate III.).     Faculae
are the most brilliant parts of the sun ; they appear of all magnitudes, from
barely discernible softly gleaming narrow tracts 1 000- miles long to conti
nuous complicated and heapy ridges 40,000 miles and more in length, and
1000 to 4000 miles broad.    By the frequent meeting of the bright ridges,
spaces of the sun's surface are included of various magnitudes and forms,
somewhat    corresponding to the areas and forms of the irregular spots
with penumbrae. They are never regularly arched, and never formed in
straight bands, but always devious and minutely undulated, like clouds in
the evening sky, or irregular ranges of snowy mountains.     When care
fully studied  with powers of 75, 135, and 180, which  are very effective,
the ridges appear prominent into cusps, and depressed into hollows ; the
cusps having brighter and more shady sides, so as not to be unlike some
forms of branching crystallized native silver.
   Ridges of this kind often surround      which appears the more con
                                                  a spot,
spicuous from the surrounding brightness ; but sometimes there appears
a very broad white platform round the spot, and from this the white
crumpled ridges pass in various directions (see Diagram, October 16,
1862, No. 2).   Toward the limb the ridges appear parallel to it; further
from   it,
        this character  exchanged for indeterminate direction and less
                                    is
ened distinctness            ;   over the remainder of the surface they are much less
conspicuous, but can certainly              be traced as an irregular network, more or
less disguised by the minuter                structure   which has been described    as
porosity.    present selected sketches of the appearances mentioned.
              I                                                       In
considering the faculae with attention,   remark that they preserve their

elevated parts should project beyond the general circular outline. This     I
have never seen to happen ; and if a little attention he given to proportions,
it will appear very unlikely to be often observed.      If
                                                         the breadth of one of
the ridges be taken at 4000 miles, its average slope 30°, and its height at
a quarter of the breadth, viz. 1000 miles, this, if projected beyond the
circular disk, would no doubt be discernible, for it would be equal to -g^oth
of the sun's diameter, or above 2". But the number of the ridges is so
great, and the crowding of them very near and on the limb so close, that
it is hardly possible, on the average, for any ridge to be seen much above
its fellows, whether the faculae be in the atmosphere or in the body of
the sun.
   The continuous circularity of the sun's limb is therefore no sufficient
argument in itself against the faculae being much raised above the general
surface ; and it seems worth while to make special researches as to the
manner in which faculae come on and go off, in the hope of finding some
case which shall be decisive.
   General Ground. — In examining the interspaces between the faculae in
the parts towards the limb, it is not easy to see more on the surface thus
inclined to the visual ray than a certain unevenness of tint ; under a higher
angle of incidence, toward the interior of the disk, this ground acquires
more evident partial shades and lights — a sort of granulation difficult to
analyze, especially    as if, most frequent, the edge of the sun shakes with
                                is
varying  refraction.  If  all be quite steady, however, the eye discerns both
the ramifications of faculae and the granulation of the interspaces, and
by degrees acquires the power of seeing this easily and clearly.        Under
this condition, the perpetual motion and inconstant agitation, so often
described,       by
                 no means appears to be       characteristic phenomenon, but
                                                a
rather as an exceptional trouble to the observer, arising from inconstant
refraction, fatigue of the eye, or shake of the instrument.   These diffi
culties increase rapidly with high powers; but with   power of 100, and
                                                             a
good   weather,  the sun's face does not appear to be much obscured by
this kind of intestine agitation.
   What     seen appears in the diagram for April
            is                                        18G4, as well as

                      a                               The ground of the
whole  is   surface of complicated small lights and shades, the limits of
            a
which appear arched or straight or confused according to the case    and
                                                                       ;
the indeterminate union of these produces sometimes faint luminous
ridges, the intervals filled up      by
                                shaded interstices and insulated patches
of illuminated surface. One eminent observer*, seeing these under           a
high power, has compared them to willow leaves, unarranged except where
they conform in some degree to the great features of the spots.   Using
the same kind of analogy, one might say they seem to resemble any some
what uneven surface composed of separate masses, presenting themselves
in all directions and at different levels. Being of all shapes, they must
generally   have one transverse measure greater than the other, and thus

appear for the most part oblong, but with no systematic concurrence of
direction. The comparison used by another astronomer *, of an irre
gularly heaped surface of rice, here collected into ridges, there sunk into
depressions which seem to be occasionally deepened into pits, has its advan
tages.   But upon the whole I prefer to be content with the less definite
analogy to an irregular granulated and pitted surface, composed of small
prominent      lights complicated   with intermediate      shades of different   in
tensities.
                          Part II. — Details of Spots.
  In the midst of the general ground thus described, spots make their
appearance, grow, change, and decay under the observer's eyes.      Seldom
indeed, as once to Mr. Carrington, does it happen that a spot appears
suddenly ; its growth, change, and decay are all usually slow — too slow to
be positively noted and measured except at intervals of hours and days.
We notice occasionally spots of minute        which have no surrounding
                                                size
penumbra ; these may be either very black or only dark. These often occur
in considerable numbers near a large spot well enclosed by penumbra, as in
spot No. 2, 29th March (Drawing No. 7).       On the 30th of March one
of these had acquired a slight penumbra, several of the others had disap
peared. The several small spots represented (Diagr. No. 6) amidst a mottled
surface   of       and granulations had no penumbra ; one was dark, but
               faculae
not black.    Some of the spots here referred to appear to be less than 500
miles across, and many are less than 1000. They are occasionally in twins,
and not unfrequently disposed in groups which may eventuate in a spot, or
in a long sinuous tract having some relation of origin to greater spots near
them.    The greater spots with large penumbral regions have usually very
irregular boundaries, and equally irregular black nuclei.       In them it is
quite usual to perceive   two,  three, or more  nuclei ; but in such cases the
term nucleus is but little fitted to describe these often narrow winding and
branching spots which appear within the irregular space.       The boundaries
of that space are in a certain degree conformed to the black nuclei. Many
large spots of this kind undergo very considerable changes in the course of
one day.    A complicated spot which measured about 20,000 miles across
on the 29th of March, lost its penumbra and was reduced to separate
nuclei on the 31st ; while a curved collection of small dots near it was
concentrated   to a small group, and two other obscure dots expanded a
little and became three.  In this state, with but slight further change, they
all passed across 60° of arc.
   In complete contrast with these examples is the spot No. 4 [in the
diagram of March 29], which with very little observable change in itself,
and with no additional productions near        it,
                                          has been traced across the sun's
disk through    third of the circumference.

 surrounding tracts of the sun's surface.               It will be observed that the
 nucleus is black, not quite uniformly so, however, but with some inequality
 of tint ; and that it is branched or notched at the edges, in this respect
 exhibiting some differences at different dates, which I do not think are due
 to any error or uncertainty in the sketches.               The ring space round the
 spot, though not quite uniform, presented no inequalities that I could mark ;
 the border was grey, striated, and unevenly extended into the surrounding
 tracts.     These unevennesses appeared to me to be little varied, during
 several days.      The striatums and extensions in a radiating direction corre
                                                                            "
 spond to what Mr. Dawes calls by the picturesque name of thatch" — a
 name    singularly appropriate,     if this border overhangs, as is often supposed, a
 cavity   or  depression.    This  "  thatch," according to Mr. Nasmyth, is formed
                                            " willow leaves " ; but Professor Airy, in
 by the concurrent outlines of his
commenting on Mr. Stone's recent communication to the Royal Astrono
mical Society, is reported to have called attention to the fact that the rice
like aggregations were " quite distinct from the thatching so graphically
described by Mr. Dawes in the penumbrae "*.
    Until the opportunity shall have occurred to me            of observing and drawing
the edges of penumbrae and nuclei under a sufficient variety of circum
stances, I must not offer to reconcile these apparently different opinions ;
at present my impression is that the
                                                 " thatched " edges of the penumbra
are   only broken parts of the general groundwork of the body of the sun ;
which may be, or rather must be supposed to be very unequally luminous
in different parts, the depressed and granulated parts emitting the least
light.
    The spot No. 4 on the Diagram for March 29 was first seen near the
edge of the sun, surrounded by faculae of great brilliancy t.                   This spot
had the elliptical outline due to its position ; the black nucleus was
central ; the border was shaded and striated ; between the border and the
nucleus was a clear bright space, not then appearing grey or dusky.                     As
the spot moved on toward the central part of the              disk,  the oval became less
and less eccentric     ;  the nucleus remained central, and the border retained
its dusky      and striated    aspect ; but the ring round the nucleus lost its
 brightness,    and  took   up more of the grey tint which belongs to the general
 surface of the sun when a very dark glass is employed %.
    If  these circumstances be well considered, they appear sufficient to prove
 that the spot taken as a whole is not sunk very much below, or raised very
 much above, the general level of the region.                For were its interior part
 sunk very much below the border, it would have presented to the eye in
 passing from near the edge toward the centre the appearances sketched                   in

   If we regard the spot as marking an opening in a bright photosphere,
through which the dark body of the sun is seen within a terraced penumbra,
as represented in the diagram of Sir J. Herschel*
                                                          (here copied), it is obvious
that toward the edge of the sun, when the line of sight, E c, forms a very
small angle with the surface of the sun, one side of the supposed terrace b
 will become invisible if the intervals of height between b and a be very con
siderable,  and in the same way a part or the whole of e will be lost.            The
photosphere    of the sun,  then,  if it exist, appears    not to  have  the enormous
depth sometimes ascribed to it ; or if we suppose the spot, with its ring
and border, to be a terraced concavity in the solid globe of the sun as

from   a to a' being 13,500 miles,    it will be obvious that the difference of the
levels of a and 6 cannot have so great a proportion to the sun's diameter
as the crater-walls of the moon bear to the diameter of that satellite, or
else cannot have anything like their steepness.             The moon's crater-walls
are in height t;-jW or even TuVotn of the       diameter,   and often very steep. On
the sun the same proportion would give cliffs 400 or 800 miles high, and
with the spot in a position 60° from the centre of the sun, such cliffs would
on one side conceal half or more of one side of the terrace (6), while the
other side (b1) of the terrace remained entirely visible.
    If we suppose that a is not a steep cliff but a prolonged slope, so that
even toward the edge of the sun the whole of the interior area may be
seen, the limit of the difference of level between the general surface (*) and
the interior terrace (6 V) can be calculated.          For example,

             have several times noticed this persistence of the elliptically
contracted spot with its nucleus, equidistant from the borders, very near to
the edge, both coming on and going off, certainly within 10° of the edge,
from which it may be inferred that in that case the angle of inclination of
the edge of the spot to the general surface could not be greater than 10°.
Taking the case of 10°, and applying it to the spot now under considera
tion, the difference of level in miles between *, the general solar surface, and
b, the   ring terrace, might    =<z   sin 10°= 300 miles, but could not exceed   it.
This result is represented in the preceding diagram.
   Nor can the spot       be sunk in a deep saucer-shaped concavity   like
for the same reasons.
   But, however deeply the spot may    be sunk below the surface of the
sun, no notch  could appear in consequence of that at the limit of the sun ;
for before reaching the limb the angle a E a', under which it is seen from
the earth     (E), would become invisibly small, and thespace a— a' become
invisible.    Even   if
                   the sides a and a' were very unequal in level, the leading
edge a' being depressed, this would make no visible notch on the limb
of the sun, except the spot were enormously large, as well as very deep—
much   greater for instance than 40,000 miles.     Except in very rare cases,
then, the sun's edge must always appear truly  circular,  notwithstanding the
depressions of the spots and the elevations of the  faculae.
   Finally,   I remark
                     that the spots may appear black, dark, grey, &c., not
because they really are so dark as they seem, but that, being less luminous
than other parts of the disk, they acquire this relative darkness under the
operation of the optical apparatus, and the influence of contrast on the
sensation.  An extremely good way of viewing the spots is to project the
sun's image on to a smooth porcelain screen, about a foot or 18 inches in
diameter ; very smooth white paper answers very well.     Thus tried, every
imaginable degree of relative darkness appears in the spots, and the faculae
come out bright and distinct.   In this experiment, the spots seem so dark
in the nuclei as to suggest the  hypothesis that the parts of the sun to
which they correspond really emit specially heat-rays, below the range of
refrangibility which brings to our eyes light and the power of sight. Heat-
rays and light-rays come to the earth together, but that is no reason for
thinking they must spring in mixed pencils from every part of the sun
           In my way of considering        it,
                                          this rather confirms the idea of the
equally.
deep black nuclei being the sun's body, the penumbrae that body partially
seen  through the atmosphere, and the facular region transmitting to us rays
which have acquired      higher refrangibility than that with which they

         Memb. R.S.        Received December 22, 1864.
                                      (Abstract.)
     Infinite  space may be considered either as consisting      of points or trans-
 versed by planes.       The points, in the first conception, are determined by
 their coordinates, by x, y, z for instance, taken in the ordinary significa
 tion ; the planes, in the second conception, are determined in an analogous
 way by their coordinates, introduced by myself into analytical geometry,
 by t, u, v for instance.     The equation
                                   tx+uy + vz=l
 represents, in regarding x, y, z as variable, t, u, v as constant, a plane by
 means of its points.        The three constants t, u, v are the coordinates of
 this plane. The same equation, in regarding t, u, v as variable, *, y, z as
 constant, represents a point by means of planes passing through it.            The
 three constants    x, y, z are the coordinates of this point.
    The geometrical constitution of space, referred hitherto either to points or
to planes, may as well be referred to right lines. According to the double
 definition of such lines, there occurs to us a double construction of space.
In the first construction we imagine infinite space to be traversed by lines,
themselves consisting of points ; an infinite number of such lines in all
directions pass through any given point ; the point may describe each of
the lines. This constitution of space is admitted when, in optics, we
regard luminous points sending out in all directions rays of light, or, in
mechanics, forces acting on points in any direction.           In the second con
struction, infinite space is regarded likewise as traversed by right lines, but
these lines are determined by planes passing through them.              Every plane
contains an infinite number of lines having within it every position and
direction, round each of which the plane may turn. We refer to this
second construction when, in optics, we regard, instead of rays, the corre
sponding fronts of waves and their consecutive intersections, or when, in
mechanics, according to Poinsot's ingenious philosophical views, we intro
duce into its fundamental principles " couples," as well entitled to occupy
their place as ordinary forces. The instantaneous axes of rotation are
right lines of the second description.
    The position of a right line depends upon four constants, which may be
determined in a different way.        I adopted for this purpose the ordinary
system of three axes of coordinates.        A line of the first description, which

we shall distinguish      by the name of ray, may be determined by means of
two projections, for instance by those within XZ and YZ, represented by

 In admitting the first system of equations,         a ray is determined in a linear
way by means of the four constants          r, s, p, <r, which may be called its four
 coordinates, two of them, r and *, indicating its direction, the remaining
two, after its direction being determined, its position in space. In adopting
 the second pair of equations, t, u, v„ vt will be the coordinates of the ray.
    A right line of the second description, which we shall distinguish by the
 name of axis, is determined by any two of its points.             It is the common
intersection of all planes passing through both points. We may select the
intersection of the axis with the two planes,             XZ and YZ,     as two such
 points, and represent them by
                                       xt +z,v= I,

     In making   use  of the first pair of equations, the four constants x, y, z„ z„
 indicating the position of the two points within XZ and YZ, are the coordi
 nates of the axis.     In adopting the second pair, the four coordinates of the
 axis are p, q,  *,  k.
    A   complex of rays or axes is represented by means of a single equation
 between their four coordinates ; a congruency, containing all congruent
 lines of two complexes, by means of two such equations ; a configuration,
 containing the right lines common to three complexes, by three equations.
 In a complex every point is the vertex of a cone, every plane contains an
 enveloped curve.        In a congruency there is a certain number of right
 lines passing as well through a given point as confined within a given
 plane.      A configuration is generated by a moving right line.
     In  a linear complex the right lines passing through a given point con
 stitute a plane ; all right lines within a given plane pass through a fixed
 point.     Two linear complexes intersect each other along a linear con
gruency.       In such a linear congruency there is a single right line passing
 as well through a given point as confined within a given plane.                Three
 linear complexes meet along a linear configuration.
     Instances of linear complexes are obtained by means of linear equations
 between the four coordinates of any one of the four systems.                 A linear
 configuration    of rays represented by three such equations between r, «, p, a
 ia a paraboloid,    immediately obtained      ;  between t, u, vx, vt a hyperboloid.

1865.]           Prof. Pliicker on     a   New Geometry of Space.
A  linear configuration of axes represented by three linear equations between
p, q, 7r, k is a hyperboloid, immediately obtained ; between x, y, z„ zm a
paraboloid.     Instances of linear congruences   are exhibited by means of
two linear equations, as well between t, u, vz,     vs as   between x, y,   z<,   z„ and
their right lines easily constructed.
   The general linear equation, however, between any four coordinates does
not represent a linear complex of the most general description.    Besides,
there is a want of symmetry, the four coordinates depending upon the
choice of both planes, XZ and YZ. This double inconvenience, if not elimi
nated, would render it impossible to adapt in a proper way analysis to the
new geometrical conception of space.     But it may be eliminated in the
most satisfactory way.
  For that purpose I introduced       (in confining myself to the case of the co
ordinates r, t, p, a) a fifth coordinate (sp—ra), which is a function of the four
primitive ones. Then the linear equation between the five coordinates
                     Ar+Bs+C + Va + Ep + F(sp-r<r)=0
is the most general of a linear complex.    After having been rendered
homogeneous by a sixth variable introduced, it becomes of a complete
symmetry with regard to the three axes OX, OY, OZ. The introduction of
the fifth coordinate (sp—ra) is the real basis of the new analytical geo
metry, the exploration of which is indicated in the ordinary way.
   In the paper presented, a complete analytical discussion of a linear
complex is given.   We may for any point of space construct the corre
sponding plane  containing all traversing rays, and vice vend. Right lines
of space associate themselves into couples of conjugated lines ; to each
line a conjugated one corresponds.      Any right line intersecting any two
conjugated, is a ray of the complex.   Each ray of it is to be regarded as
two coincident conjugated lines. It is easily shown that each linear com
plex may be represented by means of any one of the following three
equations, in which k indicates the same constant       :
                                — k, a=kr,
                        sp — ra            p=ks.
Accordingly     a linear  complex depends upon the position of a fixed line
(depending     itself upon four constants) and the constant k. Hence it like
wise follows that such a complex of rays may, without being changed, as
well turn round that fixed line, the a.ris of the complex, as move along             it,
parallel to itself. The same results may be confirmed by means of the
transformation of ray-coordinates, and thus analytically determined by the
primitive constants A, B, C, D, E,    the position of the axis of the com
                                           F,
plex and its constant k. In     peculiar case, where
                                 a                       becomes zero, all

rays   of the complex meet its axis.
  A   linear congruency of rays, along which an infinite number of linear
complexes meet,     represented
                   is             bythe equations of any two of these com
plexes.   Through     given point of space passes only one ray, correspond

     If we
         proceed to complexes of the second degree, the field of inquiry is
immensely increased.   Here any given point of infinite space is the vertex
of a cone of the second order, and likewise within any given plane there
is a curve of the second class enveloped by rays of the complex.       The
whole of the infinite number of cones, as well as of the infinite number of
enveloped conies, is represented by a linear equation, between the five ray-
coordinates r, *, p, a and (sp—ra).  The general analytical theory of con
tact may immediately be applied to complexes of the second order, touched
by linear complexes, &c.

it proper to present, in Section II., an application to optics, leading to a
complex of a simple description.      Rays of light, constituting in air a
complex, will likewise do so after being submitted to any reflexions or
refractions whatever.   Let us, for instance, suppose that the complex in
air is of the first order and its constant equal to zero ; i. e., that its
rays start in every direction from all points of a luminous right line.
Let these rays enter a biaxal crystal by any plane surface.       Let the
luminous line and this surface be perpendicular to each other.     Then,
within the crystal, the double-refracted rays constitute a new  complex,
                      like the                and               of    by                 it,
which is represented,          primitive one,     independently
means of an equation between ray-coordinates.

         promised a discussion of the construction given, but neglected it
till the present time. This discussion immediately leads us to represent
the complex of double-refracted rays by -an equation, and at the same
time we meet with several theorems worthy of notice.
     If
      there is any incident ray, the plane of refraction, containing both
double-refracted rays, is congruent with the diametral plane of the aux
iliary ellipsoid, the conjugated diameter of which is perpendicular to the
plane of incidence.     All rays incident within the same plane are, after
double refraction, confined again within the same plane.      While the plane
of incidence turns  round  the vertical, the corresponding plane of refraction
turns round   that diameter of the auxiliary ellipsoid, the conjugated dia
metral plane of which is the surface of the crystal.   Whatever may be the
plane or curved surface by which a crystal is bounded in a given point,
all corresponding planes of refraction pass through a fixed right line.
     A
     complex of rays starting in air in all directions from every point of a
luminous right line, perpendicular to the surface of the crystal, is repre
sented by the equation
                                         ra=tp,
the luminous   right line being the axis OZ, while the two remaining axes,
OX        and   OY,within the surface of the crystal any two right lines per
                      are
pendicular to each other.     This complex is transformed by double refrac
tion into another, the  equation of which assumes the most simple form,
                                         ra=ksp,
in especially admitting that the two axes, OX and OY, are congruent with
the axes of the ellipse along which the auxiliary ellipsoid is cut by the surface
of the crystal, and that the third axis, OZ,            is,
                                                    within the crystal, the dia
meter of the auxiliary ellipsoid      the conjugated diametral plane
                                         ;                                   that

                                                   is               ;
tion may be easily submitted to analytical discussion.         All its rays pass
 ing through any given point     constitute   conea of  the  second  order.  This
 cone remains the same        the point describes
                               if                    right line, passing through

 plex of double-refracted rays may be described in three different ways by        a
 variable linear congruency.     In the peculiar case in which the surface of
 the crystal      principal section, OZ becomes perpendicular to

II. y   Researches   on Solar Physics. — Second Series. On the Behaviour
      of Sun-spots with regard to Increase and Diminution."                  By
      Warren De la Rue, Ph.D., F.R.S., President of the Royal
      Astronomical      Society,   Balfour Stewart, A.M., F.R.S.,
       Superintendent of the Kew Observatory, and         Benjamin Loewy,
      Esq.    Received January 10, 1865.
                                  (Abstract.)
   One of the authors of this paper having been led, from a preliminary
investigation, to suspect that the behaviour of sun-spots with respect to
increase and diminution refers to some extraneous influence, they resolved
to investigate the behaviour in this respect of the spots observed by Car-
rington, in addition to the Kew photograms up to the present date.
   The authors have thus examined materials embracing a period of ten
years, and in this paper state the result.
   The nature of their examination is thus described    : —
   If we imagine great circles of ecliptical longitude to be drawn from the
sun's centre, every point of the sun's surface as it moves round by rotation
will of course pass successively through each of those great circles, and
every one of the planets will do the same as they move round by their own
proper motions.
   And   if we imagine the plane of the paper to denote the plane of the
ecliptic, and project upon this plane each body of our system, we shall have
a scheme similar to the above, in which ADB, the inner circle, may repre
sent the snn himself, the next circle, let us say the orbit of Venus, the next
that of our earth, while the outer may denote the orbit of Jupiter.      To r.n
observer looking down upon our system from the north, all motions       will  be
in the direction of the arrow-heads,   that is to say, in a direction contrary
to that of the hands of a watch, or left-handed, while ecliptical circles of

60             De la Rue, Stewart, and Loewy on Solar Physics.                 [Feb. 2,
longitude will be represented by the various radii proceeding from the
centre C, the angular difference between the two radii denoting the angular
difference between the two corresponding longitudes.                  If  the observer
 be stationed at the earth, all points        of  the solar  surface  will  advance by-
 rotation from left to right across the visible disk ; while the radii vectores of
 the inferior planets Mercury and Venus, which move faster than the earth,
 will appear to the terrestrial       observer to have a left-handed        rotation, in
 such a manner that          the planet Venus will move from its place in the
 diagram     to opposition, and ultimately come round to conjunction from the
 left. On the other hand, the superior planets, which move more slowly
 than the earth, will appear to the terrestrial observer to have a right-
                                                 J
 handed rotation, in such a manner that upiter will proceed from his place
 in the diagram to opposition, and ultimately come round in conjunction by
 the right.      Also the point B, which occupies the central position of the
 visible solar disk, will have the same heliocentric longitude as the earth.
 Let us make the central longitude, or longitude corresponding to the posi
 tion of the earth at the time of observation, our meridian, and let us
 reckon as negative all longitudes less than 1 80° to the left, and as positive
 all those less than 180° to the right. In this way a spot or point of the
 sun's disk, as it comes round by the left limb, will have the longitude
  —90, while, as it disappears by the right limb, its longitude will be +90.
 Hence also the longitude of Jupiter in the diagram will be — ACB, while
 that of Venus will be + BCD.          If the angle ACB is very large, we may say
that    Jupiter is much to the left, and if BCD is large, we may say that
 Venus is much to the right.         In the examination to which the spots have
been subjected,       it has been endeavoured to ascertain,      as nearly as possible,
at what     longitude any spot breaks out, or at what longitude it reaches its
maximum and begins to wane.              Very often, however, we are not able to
assign the exact longitude of such an occurrence ; but yet, as will be seen
in the sequel, we are able to determine, in a general way, the behaviour               of
 spots.
    The examination        was made  in the following manner.        Mr. Carrington's
original drawings were examined by two observers noting the behaviour of
 each spot, and the results again compared with Carrington's published
maps, which give the behaviour of spots from day to day ; ultimately a list
was obtained, no spot available for comparison being left out.                A similar
process    was   followed   with regard  to the   Kew  pictures.
    It is to be remarked, that in making the examinations of the Carrington
pictures, both observers were ignorant of the planetary configurations ; and
that    although     with regard to the Kew pictures         one observer knew       the
corresponding planetary configurations, yet his judgment, being checked
by his fellow-observer, could not be biassed by any previous speculative
views.
    In  a  Table given, showing the behaviour of sun-spots from the beginning
of 1854 to the end of 1864, it is seen that different spots occurring about the

1865.]            De la Rue, Stewart, and Loewy on Solar Physics.                                   61
same time on the sun's disk behave themselves                      in the same manner ; so
that     if        after making
              one spot,                         its appearance, increases until the centre
line, another will do the same              ;    or if one spot breaks out on the left or on
the right, half the other spots about the same period have a tendency to
break out on the same half. Examples of these are referred to in the
Tables.
   The authors suppose that this peculiarity of behaviour of spots can only
be explained by reference to some influence from without.     Suppose that
such an influence, of a nature unfavourable to spot-production,       exists,
then, as spots are brought round to it by rotation, they will gradually
wane ; and, on the other hand, as the surface departs from         spots will             it,
break out.   But while there   good evidence for believing in the existence
                                       is
of some such influence,        very difficult thing to determine its nature,
                                 it   is   a
and one which can only be done very imperfectly with our present
knowledge.
  The authors     attempt to answer the following questions.  Is this in
fluence stationary    or, moveable, can
                          ?     if        be traced to any of the planets

   In answer to the first question, Is the influence stationary          may be           ?    it
remarked that        if
                      be  so,
                          it  the difference  of behaviour  noticed  at different
periods must be due to the position of the earth, or point of view at these
periodswith reference to the stationary influence, and hence in similar
months of different years we should have       similar behaviour; but
                                                                  a                                 it

                                 ;
will come towards      from their first appearance, and will consequently de

slowly than the earth,   will move from conjunction to opposition, from
                                it
right to left; so that   tendency of spots to form on the disk will be
                                a
followed by     tendency to increase, not decrease, after making their
                    a
appearance.
  The order of the consecutive phenomena will thus be different in the two
cases.

   It is  shown by a Table that a tendency of spots to break out is followed
 by a tendency of spots to decrease after making their appearance, and it is
thereby concluded that the influence moves faster than the earth.            This
would    seem   to point to either Mercury or Venus as the agent in this
matter, but the behaviour varies too slowly to be caused by the former.
Venus, therefore, appears to be the influencing agent ; and whether the
behaviour of spots appears to depend on the position of this planet with
reference to the earth, or point of view, the following Table, in which the
 spot-behaviour   is compared with the corresponding       position of Venus, will
show : —

   It will be seen from this Table that the behaviour of spots appears to be
connected with the position of Venus in such a manner that spots dissolve
when that part of the sun's surface in which they exist approaches the
neighbourhood of this planet ; while, on the other hand, as the sun's disk
recedes from this planet, spots begin to break out and leach their maximum
on the opposite side.
                * Venus and Jupiter are here opposed to one another.

  1865.]         On the Passage     of Substances into the    Animal Tissues.        63
      There    are a few cases in    which Venus and Jupiter are opposed to one
  another    ;  the authors    do not, however, suppose that these instances are
  sufficient to prove the fact of an action due to Jupiter, but think it right, in
  alluding to them, to state at the same time the opposed position of the two
  planets, since this may furnish a possible explanation of the uncertain
  behaviour of spots by which these series are characterized.
r~ The results of this paper may be stated briefly as follows : —
      Observed    fact. — Spots appearing about the     same time on the sun's disk
  behave in the same manner as they pass from left to right.                 ,
      Legitimate deduction. — The behaviour of spots is influenced by some
  thing from without, and from the nature of the spot-behaviour the authors
  conclude that this influence travels faster than the earth ; and finally, they
  find that the behaviour of spots appears to be determined by the position
  of Venus in such a manner that a spot wanes as it approaches this planet
  by rotation, and, on the other hand, breaks out and increases as it recedes
  from the neighbourhood of the planet, reaching its maximum on the oppo
   site side.
      In conclusion, it is not meant in this paper to convey the idea that Venus
  is the cause of the ten-yearly period of sun-spots, but merely that there is
   a varying behaviour of spots which appears to have reference to the posi
  tion of this planet, or, putting aside the influencing agent, appears to have
  reference to certain ecliptical longitudes.

   III. "On       the Rapidity of the Passage of Crystalloid Substances into
          the Vascular and Non-Vascular Textures of the Body."                      By
          Henry Bence Jones, F.R.S.                In  a  Letter to the Secretary.
          Received February 2, 1865.
      Dear Dr. Sharpey, — I          am anxious that you should read to the Royal
   Society a    short   note containing the results of some observations       I lately
   made on the rapidity of the passage of crystalloid substances into the
   vascular and non-vascular textures of the body.
      It occurred to me that it might be possible to trace the passage of sub
   stances from the blood into the textures of the body by means of the
  spectrum-analysis, and with the assistance of Dr. Dupre* some very remark
  able results have been obtained.
      Guinea-pigs have chiefly been used for the experiments.              Usually no
  lithium can be found in. any part of their bodies.           When half a grain of
  chloride     of  lithium was given   to  a guinea-pig   for three  successive days,
  lithium appeared in every tissue of the body.            Even in the non-vascular
  textures, as the cartilages, the cornea, the crystalline       lens, lithium would
  be found.
      Two animals of the same size and age were taken ; one was given 3 grains
  of chloride of lithium, and it was killed in eight hours ; another had no

 64       On the Passage     of Substances into  the Animal Tissues.      [Feb. 9,
 lithium  ;  it was also killed, and when the whole lens was burnt at once, no
 trace of lithium could be found.      In the other, which had taken lithium, a
 piece of the lens, ^th of a pin's head in size, showed the lithium ; it had
 penetrated to the centre of the lens.
    In another pig the same quantity of chloride of lithium was given, and
 in four hours even the centre of the lens contained lithium.
    Another pig    was given the same quantity, and    it was killed in two hours
 and a quarter.     The cartilage of the hip showed lithium faintly, but dis
 tinctly. The outer portions of the lens showed it slightly ; the inner portions
 showed ho trace.
    To   a younger    pig the same quantity was given, and it was killed in
 thirty-two minutes.      Lithium was found in the cartilage of the hip ; in the
 aqueous humour ; distinctly in the outer part of the lens, and very faintly
 in the inner part.
    In an older and larger pig, to which the same quantity was given,
lithium after one hour was found in the hip and knee joints very faintly ;
 in the aqueous humour of the eye very distinctly ; but none was found in
the lens, not even when half was taken for one trial.
    Chloride of rubidium in a three-grain dose was not satisfactorily detected
anywhere.       When 20 grains had been taken, the blood, liver, and kidney
showed this substance ; the lens when burnt all at once showed the smallest
possible trace ; the cartilages and aqueous humour showed none, probably
because     the delicacy of the spectrum-analysis for rubidium is very much
 less than that for lithium.
    A  patient who was suffering from diseased heart tqok some lithia-water
containing 15 grains of citrate of lithia thirty-six hours before her death,
and the same quantity six hours before death.          The crystalline lens, the
blood, and the cartilage of one joint were examined for lithium : in the
cartilage it was found very distinctly ; in the blood exceedingly faintly ;
and wben the entire lens was taken, the faintest possible indications of
lithium were obtained.
    Another patient took lithia-water containing 1 0 grains of carbonate of
lithia five hours and a half before death : the lens showed very faint traces
of lithium when half the substance was taken for one examination ; the
cartilage showed lithium very distinctly.
    I expect to be able to find lithium in the lens after operation for cataract,
and in the umbilical cord after the birth of the foetus.
                                            I am, yours truly,

  The proposal having been seconded, the ballot was taken, and Lord
Dufferin was declared duly elected a Fellow of the Society.
   The following communications              were read   :   —
I. " Monthly        Magnetical Observations taken at the College Observa
          tory, Stonyhurst, in 1864."   By the Rev. Walter Sidgreaves.
          Communicated, with a Note, by the President. Received January
          24, 1865.
   The Horizontal, Vertical, and Total forces are calculated to English mea
sure, one foot, one second of mean solar time, and one grain being assumed
as the units of space, of time, and of mass.
   The Vertical and Total forces are obtained from the absolute measure of
horizontal force and the Dip. The measures of the Dip-angle obtained with
needle 2 have not been used in these calculations, as it appears from the
observations taken with this needle that the position of its axle is less true
than that of needle 1 .
   For the observations of Deflection and Vibration, taken each month for
absolute measure of horizontal force, the same magnet has always been
employed.
  The moment of inertia of the magnet, with its stirrup, for different degrees
of temperature, and the coefficients in the corrections required for the
effects of temperature and of terrestrial magnetic induction on the magnetic
moment of the magnet, were determined at the Kew Observatory by the
late Mr. Welsh.
   The moment of inertia of the magnet, with its stirrup, using the grain
and foot as the units of mass and of linear measure, is 5*27303.        Its rate
of increase  for increase of temperature  is 0-00073  for every  10° of Fahr.
   The weight of the maguet, with its stirrup, is approximately 825 grains,
and the length of the magnet is nearly 3*94 inches. The moment of inertia
was determined independently of the weight and dimensions, by the method
of vibration with and without a known increase of the moment of inertia.
   The temperature corrections have always been obtained from the formula
q(t„— 35°) +      t„— 35)2, where
                 ?'(                   the observed temperature and 35° Fahr.
                                        t„   is
the adopted   standard  temperature.    The values of the coefficients    and    q   q'
are respectively  0001 128 and 0-000000436.

  The correction for error of graduation of the Deflection bar at TO foot
is
+  0-00004 ft., at 13 foot +0 000064 foot.
  The observed times of vibration are entered in the Table without cor
rections.
   The time of one vibration has been obtained each month from the mean
of twelve determinations of the time of           100 vibrations.
  The angles of deflection are each the means of two observations.
  In deducing from these observations the ratio and product of the mag
netic moment m of the magnet, and the earth's horizontal magnetic inten

       rate of the chronometer, or for the arc of vibration, the former having been
       generally less than 1>*0, and the latter less than 50'.
            A twist of the torsion circle through 90° has ordinarily deflected the
       magnet through 10' of arc.

    Observations taken to determine the position of the zero-point on the

    The discrepancies in the Declination observations may possibly be in a
considerable degree occasioned by diurnal variation, as the observations
varied in regard to the hour of the day ; in future this will be avoided by
making the observations always at a fixed hour.                            The discrepancies may
also have been in part occasioned by magnetic disturbance which we have
no present means of eliminating.

                               Note by the President.
   Mr. Sidgreaves's observations, combined with those made at the          same spot
in 1858 in the course of the second magnetic survey of England, supply
the materials for a first approximate deduction of the present amount of the
 secular change of magnetic dip and of the total magnetic Force at Stony-
hurst.
    Commencing with the Dip : — the results in 1858 were as follows (Brit.
Assoc. Reports,       1861, pp. 253 & 254)     :—

 Difference, corresponding to 5.7 years ....              14 53
 whence we have an annual secular decrease of 2'-614 ; mean epoch 1861.9.
    In a memoir presented to the Royal Society in 1861, " On the Secular
 Change of the Dip in London between 1821 and 1860," printed in vol. xi.
of the 'Proceedings,' pp. 144-162, the mean annual secular decrease of
 the dip in the years from 1821.65 to 1859.5 is stated to have been 2'-69,
mean epoch 1840.6 ; and in the 21.2 years between 1838.3 and 1859.5,
 Z-63   ;  mean epoch 1848.9.
    Proceeding to the Total Force      : — its value obtained by myself at Stony-
hurst by experiments of deflection and vibration with the Survey Collimator
 No. 5, in October 1858 was 10-385 in British units (Brit. Assoc. Reports,
 1861, pp. 264, 268) ; and by the experiments of Mr. Sidgreaves with the
apparatus belonging to Stonyhurst College (originally obtained from Kew),
its mean value in 1864, derived from the twelve monthly determinations, was
 10*4031     ; the difference is *0181   in 5.75 years, or    an annual  increase of
0031.      To compare with this,     we have the statement in the    British Survey
(Brit. Assoc.       Reports, 1861, p. 273), that from the absolute measures
made monthly at Kew between April 1857 and March 1862 the total force
had increased at Kew during that interval at an average annual rate of
*0025.       In the  same memoir   it was also inferred, from a general comparison
of the isodynamic lines in the first and second British Surveys, that along a
line drawn in a N.W. and S.E. direction the secular change would be found
contemporaneously somewhat greater at a northern or north-western station
than at a southern or south-eastern station — greater therefore at Stonyhurst
than at Kew.        The general fact that the value of the total force in Britain
is progressively increasing, may be inferred alike by the observations at Kew
and at Stonyhurst ; the precise amount of the annual increase at either
station will require a longer continuance of the same careful and systematic
observations as those at Kew and Stonyhurst.

II. " Chemical      Examination of the Fluid from the Peritoneal Cavity
       of the Nematode Entozoa."            By Dr. W. Marcet, F.R.S. Re
       ceived  January 24, 1865.
    Some time ago Dr. Cobbold sent me a quantity of fluid which he had ex
tracted from about seventy perfectly fresh specimens of the Atcaris mega-
loeephala of the horse, and he requested me to make an analysis of it.          I
most willingly availed myself of this unusual opportunity of ascertaining
the composition of this fluid, the sample procured by Dr. Cobbold being
fortunately large enough for the purpose.
    The analysis of this fluid is interesting as showing that its composition
is similar to that of juice of flesh in the higher animals, and consequently
that the process of assimilation occurs in these worms much in the same
way as in those animals where the organs of digestion and circulation are
perfectly developed.       It also shows that a fluid similar to that existing in
muscular tissue is apparently elaborated by the intestines of the Ascarides,
while in the higher auimals this fluid is formed from the blood.
    The fluid was turbid, of a pale yellow colour, and emitted an offensive
odour, although not of decomposition.
                            Microscopical Examination.
    Principally fine granular matter; a few elongated bodies, some con
voluted, as   if consisting of this granular matter cast by passage through a
membranous tube.         Some, but very few, spiral vegetable fibres and scales.
                               Chemical Examination.
    Specific gravity T029, reaction slightly acid.       5 cubic centimetres were
evaporated to dryness, which yielded, in 1000 parts,
                              Solid residue   82-7

                                            10000
    The fluid, when nearly boiling, coagulated into a solid mass, it therefore
contained a large quantity of albumen.
    1With the object of separating the colloid from the crystalloid consti
tuents, I measured off 1 0 cub. centims. of the liquid and dialyzed it for
twenty-four hours in a 6-inch dialyzer.         By this operation the fluid lost
its acid reaction, becomiug neutral ; it has also parted with its smell.
    The Colloid Fluid. — The solution remaining on the dialyzer consisted
principally of albumen ; it was evaporated to dryness, and the weight of
 the residue determined     ; this amounted to 0*532 grm., being 53 per 1000
 of the fluid analyzed.      The total solid constituents of the fluid being 82-7
 per 1000, it will be seen at once that about frds of the total residue con
 sisted of colloid substances, and |rd of crystalloid.      These numbers should
 be accepted as approximate results, there being no substance possessed of
    VOL. XIV.                                                          G

  absolutely colloid or crystalloid properties, and a small proportion of colloid
  having probably found its way through the membrane.
      The dry colloid residue was incinerated, and found to contain 1 -9 per cent.
  of ashes, which is so small a proportion as to show that very nearly the
  whole of the inorganic constituents of the fluid had passed through th2
  membrane of the dialyzer.
      The Crystalloid Fluid. — This consisted of the solution in distilled water
  of those constituents of the ascaris-fluid which had found their way through
  the diaphragm of the dialyzer.          It contained no albumen but some organic
  matters, and very nearly the whole of the inorganic salts of the original
  fluid. Evaporated nearly to dryness, a mass of crystals appeared after a
  lapse of time in the thick residue. A part of the residue being ignited left
  a large proportion of ash, which was found to consist nearly entirely of
  phosphoric acid and potash.           The aqueous solution of the ash reacted
  strongly alkaline, and emitted no carbonic acid when tested with a mineral
  acid, showing that there existed more phosphoric acid than was necessary
 to combine with the whole of the bases present. The absence of sulphates,
 of more than traces of chlorides, and of lime was very remarkable ; there
 might have been some soda present, but potash greatly predominated.
 There is no record in my note-book as to the presence or absence of mag
 nesia.
     I now   submitted to examination a solution in distilled water of the crys
 talloid residue.     It reacted acid ; the addition of a solution of nitrate of
 silver gave an abundant white precipitate with a slight yellow tinge, the
 fluid being acid before and after precipitation.         There was therefore but a
 small proportion of common tribasic phosphate of potash present, and there
 appeared to be a much larger proportion of the bibasic phosphate ; the for
mer giving a yellow, and the latter a white precipitate with nitrate of silver.
     I finally determined the fatty matters present in a given weight of the
original fluid, and found that 1000 parts of the ascaris-fluid contained 5*1
parts of fat.
                                      Conclusions.
    We may conclude from this inquiry that nutrition in the nematode
worms can be carried on by means of a fluid containing few other substances
besides albumen and phosphate of potash.              If we now consider that the
principal    constituent   of  juice of flesh is phosphate of potash, both tribasic
and bibasic, that the ascaris- and flesh-fluid are both acid, that in both
fluids there is a very small quantity of chlorides with but very little or no
soda and little or no lime, we shall be able to draw a very interesting par
allel between the assimilation in the highest and lowest animals.

 III. " On       the Commissures of the Cerebral Hemispheres of the
         Marsupialia and Monotremata, as compared with those of the
         Placental Mammals." By W. H. Flower, F.R.S.                             Received
         January   24,   1865.
                                          (Abstract.)
    As it is most convenient to          pass from the best to the least known,         and
 especially as the terms used in describing the anatomy of the vertebrated
 animals have in most cases been originally bestowed upon parts of the
 human body, the Paper commences by a short description of the septum
 ventriculorum and commissures of the human brain.                     This is done with
 a view to establish clearly, both by their structure and development, the
 mutual relations of the great transverse commissure or corpus callosum
 and the fornix.      The latter is defined as essentially a longitudinal com
 missure, consisting of two lateral halves closely applied for a short space
 in the middle line, but each half belonging to its own hemisphere, and
 formed out of the longitudinal fibres bordering the superior margin of the
 ventricular aperture.        There are no transverse fibres in the fornix proper,
 the so-called " psalterial fibres" connecting together the two hippocampi
 majores being a portion of the same system of fibres as the corpus
 callosum.
    The relations of these parts are shown in a series of longitudinal and
 vertical sections of the brains of the Sheep, Rabbit, Two-toed Sloth, and
 Hedgehog among Placental Mammals, and in the same way in the Kan
 garoo, Wombat, and Thylacine among Marsupials, and the Echidna among
 Monotremes.
    After reference to the literature of the subject, more especially to the
 writings of Professor Owen, whose statement (Phil. Trans. 1837) of the
 absence in the marsupials of the "corpus callosum," or "great transverse
 commissure which unites the supra-ventricular masses of the hemispheres,"
in all placentally developed mammals * has been almost universally
adopted,     the author proceeds to sum up the result of the present investi
gation as follows.
    At the outset a confirmation is afforded of the important fact, first
observed by Professor Owen, that the brains of animals of the orders
Marsupialia and Monotremata present certain special and peculiar cha
racters, by which they may be at once distinguished from those of other
mammals.        The appearance of either a transverse or longitudinal section
would leave no doubt whatever as to which group the brain belonged.                      In
   * In   the paper by the same author " On the Characters, Principles of Division,
and Primary Groups of the Class Mammalia " (Proc. Linn. Soc. 1858), the Subclass
Li/etu-ephala ("loose" or "disconnected"          brain), equivalent to the Marsupialia and
Monotremata, are characterized as having " the cerebral hemispheres but feebly and
                                       '        '        '
partially connected together by the fornix and anterior commissure,' while in the

the differentiating characters to be enumerated, some members of the
higher section present an approximation to the lower ; but, as far as is
known at present, there is still a wide interval between them without any
connecting link.
  The differences are manifold, but all have a certain relation to, and even
a partial dependence on, each other.        They may   be enumerated   under the
following heads      :   —
      The peculiar arrangement of the folding of the inner wall of the
      1.
cerebral hemisphere. A deep fissure, with corresponding projection within,
is continued             from the hippocampal fissure, almost the whole
                  forwards
length of the inner wall.
   2. The altered relation (consequent upon this disposition of the inner
wall) and the very small development of the upper transverse commissural
fibres (corpus callosum).
   3. The immense increase in amount, and probably in function,           of the
inferior set of transverse commissural fibres (anterior commissure).
      Each of                must now be considered a little more closely.
                these propositions
Arguing from our knowledge of the development of the brain in placental
mammals (for of that of the marsupials we have at present no information),
it may     be supposed that the first-named     is also first in order of time    in
the gradual evolution of the cerebral structures.   Before any trace of          the
budding out of the fibres which shoot across the chasm separating                the
hollow sac-like hemispheres, before the differentiation of a portion of          the
septal area into the anterior commissure, that remarkable folding of             the
inner wall, indicated  by the deep (hippocampal) furrow on the surface
and the corresponding rounded projection in the interior, has already be
come distinctly manifest.
   Now the first rudiment of the upper transverse commissure is found
undoubtedly at the spot, afterwards situated near its middle, to which in
the lowest placental mammals it is almost entirely confined.       This spot is
situated a little way above and in front of the anterior end of the ventricular
aperture, at the upper edge of the region of adherence of the two hemi
spheres (the future septal area). In the placental mammals this part is in
direct relation to the great mass of the internal medullary substance of the
hemispheres, which has to be brought into communication.         In the marsu
     on the other hand, the prolonged internal convolution or hippo
pials,
campus spreading up to and beyond this point, forms the inner wall of the
hemisphere from which the fibres pass across, and it is necessarily through
the medium of this convolution, and following the circuitous course of its
relief in the ventricle, that the upper part of the hemisphere can alone be
brought into connexion with its fellow.
   Can this transverse commissure, of which the relation is so disturbed by
the disposition of the inner wall of the hemisphere, be regarded as homo
logous to the entire " corpus callosum " of the placental mammals ? or is
it,   as bas been    suggested, to be looked    upon as only representing    the

 1865.]                    of the Marsvpialia,     fyc.                      73
psalterial fibres or transverse commissure of the hippocampi 1 Undoubtedly
a large proportion of its fibres do come under the latter category.         But
even if they should nominally     be all so included, it is important to bear in
mind that we have still a disposition in the marsupial brain very different
from that which would remain in the brain of any placental mammal after
the upper and main part of the corpus callosum had been cut away. In
the latter case the commissure of a very small part of the inner wall of the
hemisphere alone is left, that part folded into the hippocampus. In the
former there is a commissure, feeble it may be, but radiating over the
whole of the inner wall, from its most anterior to its posterior limits.
Granted that only the psalterial fibres are represented in the upper com
missure of the marsupial brain, why should the name of " corpus callosum
                                                                         "
be refused to it ? These fibres are part of the great system of transverse
fibres bringing the two hemispheres into connexion with each other ; they
are inseparably mingled at the points of contact with the fibres of the
main body of the corpus callosum, and are only distinguished from it in
consequence of the peculiar form of the special portions of the hemisphere
they unite, vlndeed they are scarcely more distinct than is the part called
" rostrum"   in front.   And although,   like the fibres of the hinder end of
the corpus callosum, they blend at each extremity with the fibres of the
diverging posterior crura of the fornix, they certainly cannot be con
founded with that body, which, as shown before, is essentially a longi
tudinal commissure.
   But is not the main part of the "corpus callosum" of the placental mam
mals also represented by the upper and anterior part of the transverse band
which passes between the hemispheres of the marsupial brain and radiates
out in a delicate lamina above the anterior part of the lateral ventricle?
The most important and indeed crucial test in determining this question, is
its position in regard to the septum ventriculorum, and especially the pre
commissural fibres of the fornix. Without any doubt in all marsupial and
monotreme     animals examined (sufficient to enable us to affirm without
much   hesitation that the character is universal) it lies above them, as dis
tinctly seen in the transverse sections. This is precisely the same relation
ship which obtains in Man and all other mammalia, and this is one of the
chief points in which not only the interpretation of facts but the observation
of them recorded in the present paper differs from that of Professor Owen.
   The defective proportions of the part representing the great transverse
commissure of the placental mammals, which appear to result from or
to be related to the peculiar conformation of the wall of the hemisphere,
must not lead to the inference that the great medullary masses of the two
halves of the cerebrum are by any means " disconnected."          The want of
the upper fibres is compensated for in a remarkable manner by the immense
size of the anterior commissure, the fibres of which are seen radiating into
all parts of the interior of the hemisphere.   There can be little doubt
that the development of this commissure      is,

                     on                          By Professor A. W.
        Williamson, F.R.S., President of the Chemical Society. Re
        ceived February              6,   1865.
   In the " Preliminary Note on some Aluminium Compounds," by Messrs.
Buckton and Odling, published in the last Number of the Society's       Pro                        '
ceedings,' some  questions of considerable theoretical importance are raised
in connexion with the anomalous vapour-densities of aluminium ethyle and
aluminium methyle.      The authors have discovered that the vapour of
aluminium  methide (Al2Me°) occupies rather more than two volumes
(H=l vol.) at 163°, when examined by Gay-Lussac's process, under less
than atmospheric pressure. The boiling-point of the compound under atmo
spheric pressure   given at 130°, and the compound accordingly boiled a
                          is
good deal below  130° at the reduced pressure at which the determination
was made.           The vapour was therefore considerably superheated when found
to occupy       a   little more than two volumes. When still further superheated
up to 220° to         2-10°,    itto possess
                                     was founddensity equivalent to rather
                                                                a
less than four volumes at the normal temperature and pressure.
   The aluminium ethyle was found to have density decidedly in excess of
                                                                a
the formula Al2 Et"             =   4   vols., but far too small for       AP Me" =   2   vols.    From
their analogy to aluminic chloride, Al2 Cl-'               =    2   vols., the methide and ethide
might be expected to have vapour-volumes corresponding to Al2 Me°
=2 vols., Al2 Et° = vols.      The authors seem, however, more inclined to
                                2
doubt the truth of the general principles which lead us to consider these
hexatomic formulae the correct ones, than to doubt their own interpretation
of the observations already made upon the new compounds.
   Even    the vapour-volume of aluminic chloride had been unknown to
           if                                                                                          us,
there were ample grounds for assigning to aluminium methide       molecular               a
formula   Al'Me", and vapour-density corresponding to Al2 Me„ = vols.

supposed that the formula Fe CP and Al Cl3 would be the most probable
molecular formulae    and Dr. Odling, in his useful Tables of Formulae, pub
                            ;
lished in 1864, expressed an opinion in favour of these formulae by classing

  as anomalous Deville's   vapour-densities, which correspond to the higher
  formulae AP CI", Fe2 Cl".     It is well known that Laurent and Gerhardt,
  whose penetrating    minds  raised   so many vital questions of chemical philo
  sophy, laid down a preliminary rule that every molecule must contain an
  even sum of the atoms of chlorine, hydrogen, nitrogen, and metals. Accord
  ing to this rule, the formulas AP Cla and Fe3 Cl" would have no greater pro
  bability than the formulae FeCl3, A1C1'; aud judging by that rule, Dr.
  Odling naturally preferred the simpler formulas.
     Since Gerhardt's time chemists have, however, extended to the greater
 number of metals the arguments which proved oxygen to be biatomic ; and
  we now know that the alkali-metals, the nitrogen series, silver, gold, and
 boron, may count with the atoms of chlorine, hydrogen, &c. to make up an
 even number      in each molecule,     but that   the greater number of metals
 must not be so counted ; for that in each molecule in which they are con
 tained the sum of the atoms of chlorine, hydrogen, nitrogen, potassium, &c.
 must be even, just as much as if the atom of the diatomic or tetratomic
 metal were not in the compound.
                                                      "
                                         In a paper On the Classification of the
 Elements in relation to their Atomicities," I had occasion to point out that
 inasmuch    as iron  and aluminium       belong, partly by their own properties,
 partly by their analogies,    to  the  class of metals which do not join with
 chlorine, &c. in making up an even number of atoms, the number of those
 other atoms in each molecule must be even in itself, just as if iron or alumi
 nium were not there ; and that accordingly the formulae Fe5 CI", Al2 CI3
 are really quite normal.     In like   manner  I showed that the vapour-density
 of calomel, HgCl =     2 vols., is anomalous,      as containing in a molecular
 volume a single atom of chlorine, although, in accordance with Gerhardt's
 rule, Dr. Odiing had classed it as normal.         I certainly understood that my
 able friend accepted my suggestion in this case at least, for he speedily
 brought forward theoretical and experimental facts in confirmation of it.
    These examples serve to show that it was to be expected that the ethyle
 and methyle compounds of aluminium would contain an even number of
 atoms of ethyle and methyle in each molecule, and that their formulae
would accordingly be AlsMe\ Al2 Et".
    It remains for us to consider how the deviation from our theoretical anti
cipations in the case of aluminium ethyle and the partial deviation in the
case of aluminium methyle ought to be treated.
    Fortunately we have the benefit of some experience to guide us in
this matter, for a considerable number of other compounds have beeu
found to occupy in the       state   of vapour nearly double the volume which
corresponds to one molecule ;       but, with very few exceptions, all of them
have already been proved to have undergone decomposition, so as to con
sist of two uncombined molecules.         Thus sal-ammoniac is admitted to have
the molecular formula NH*C1; yet in the state of vapour this quantity
occupies the volume of nearly two molecules, viz. four volumes.            Das the
anomaly led us to doubt the atomic weight of chlorine, nitrogen, or hy

76              Williamson — On       the  Atomicity  of Aluminium.      [Feb. 9,
drogen, or to doubt any other of the results of our comparison of their
compounds? or has it led chemists to diffusion experiments with its vapour,
proving it to contain uncombined HC1 and NH3, each occupying its own
natural volume       ?   Has it not been proved that at the temperature at  which
sal-ammoniac        vapour was measured,      its constituents mis either without
evolving heat (that invariable function of chemical action), or, according to
another experimentalist, with evolution of far less heat than of the whole
quantity of hydrochloric acid and ammonia combined, on coming together
at that    high temperature ?
     Again, SO' H2 is known to represent the formula of one molecule of
hydric sulphate, yet the vapour formed from it occupies nearly the bulk of
two molecules.          Has this fact cast any doubt on the atomic weights of the
 elements S, O, or H ? Or has it led to the discovery of peculiarities in the
constitution of the vapour which would probably have escaped notice had
they not been anticipated by theory, peculiarities which go a long way
towards bringing the apparent anomalies within the law ?
     Nitric peroxide, N2 O4, was considered, from our knowledge of other vo
 latile compounds of nitrogen, to be anomalous in its vapour-volume being
 N204=4 vols. ; and we have been shown by the experiment of Messrs.
 Playfair and Wanklyn, that the anomaly almost disappears when the com
 pound is evaporated by the aid of a permanent gas at a temperature consi
  derably below its boiling-point, as its theoretical molecule N3 O* is then
  found to occupy the two volumes which every undecomposed molecule
  occupies.     This explanation seems to me to be the more entitled to grave
  consideration on the part of the discoverers of the new aluminium com
  pounds, from the fact that the evidence in favour of it has been admitted
  to be conclusive by Dr. Odling, who classes nitric peroxide by the formula
  N; O4 = 2 vols, among compounds with normal vapour-densities, in virtue
  of the fact that at low temperatures it can be obtained with that density,
  though having half that density at higher temperatures.
      The arguments for admitting that the low vapour-densities of the alumi
  nium compounds are anomalous are even stronger than those which are ad
   mitted in the case of nitric peroxide ; for it did require very severe super
   heating to get the aluminium compounds to near four volumes, whereas it
   required very ingenious devices to get nitric peroxide out of the four-volume
   state.
       Such   guiding principles as we have acquired in chemistry are the
   noblest   fruits   of the accumulated labours of numberless patient experi
   mentalists and thinkers ; and when any new or old fact appears to be at
   variance with those principles, we either add to our knowledge by discover
   ing new facts which remove the apparent inconsistency, or we put the case
    by for a while and frankly soy that we do not understand it.
       The decision of the atomic weight of aluminium has involved greater
    difficulty than was encountered in the case of most other metals, owing to
    the fact of our knowing only one oxide of the metal, and salts correspond

ing to it  ;  but the analogies which     connect     aluminium       with other metals
are so close and so numerous, that there are probably few*metals of which
the position in our classification is more satisfactorily settled.              We may
safely trust that the able investigators who are examining these interesting
compounds will bring them more fully than now within the laws which
regulate the combining proportions of their constituent elements ; for, as it
now stands, the anomaly         is far less than many others which have been
satisfactorily  explained by further investigations.
    Meanwhile aluminium        is a metal singular for only appearing in that
pseudo-triatomic      character in which iron and chromium appear in their
sesquisalts.

regarded as a diatomic metal, a circumstance which has led us to study the
action of zincethyl upon ethylic leucate, with a view to the more satisfactory
elucidation of the above changes, which finally result in ethylic leucate.
Assuming the diatomicity of zinc, which can now no longer be doubted, it
is obvious that by the loss of one atom of ethyl, zincethyl will, like many
other organo-metallic bodies, pass from a condition of perfect to one of
partial saturation, in which it will play the part of a monatomic radical.
   That zincethyl, in being acted upon by oxygen, passes through two
distinct stages of change has been already indicated by one of us in de
scribing the reactions of that body* ; for when a current of dry oxygen is
made to pass through an ethereal solution of zincethyl, dense white fumes
continue to fill the atmosphere of the vessel, until about one-half of the
total quantity of oxygen necessary for the complete oxidation of the zinc
ethyl has been taken up.            Then^the white fumes entirely cease, showing
the absence of free zincethyl, and at the same moment the liquid, which up
to that time had remained perfectly transparent, begins to deposit a copious
white precipitate, which continues to increase until the remaining half of
the oxygen is absorbed.          If the process of oxidation be arrested when the
white fumes cease to be formed, the product effervesces violently when
mixed with water, owing to the escape of hydride of ethyl ; but when the
oxidation is completed, the white solid mass produced consists chiefly of
zincethylate, and does not in the slightest degree effervesce in contact with
water.    The two stages of this reaction depend essentially upon the succes
sive linking of the zinc with the two atoms of ethyl by means of diatomic
oxygen.     The first stage of oxidation is expressed by the following equa
tion: —
                            Zincethyl.           Zincethylo-ethylate.
   The zincethylo-ethylate        thus formed is perfectly soluble in ether, and is
instantly decomposed by water according to the following equation : —

       Zincethylo-ethylate.            Zinc hydrate.   Alcohol.    Ethylic hydride.
   Treated with dry oxygen, zincethylo-ethylate, in ethereal solution, absorbs
a second atom     of that element, and it is this further absorption that con
stitutes the second stage above referred to, resulting in the production
                                                                                      of

 viour of 6rgano-zinc compounds, and has succeeded in obtaining zincmethylo-

 in a condition approaching    to purity, by passing a stream of dry air through
 a solution of zincmethyl in methyl iodide.             M. Buttlerow's success in
 obtaining this body and his failure in converting it into zincmethylate, are
 both probably due to the comparative insolubility of zincmethylo-methy-
 late in methyl iodide, owing to which the first product of oxidation was, to
 a great extent, protected from the       further action of oxygen.         When, how
 ever, ether is used as the solvent of zincethyl, the oxidized product remains
 in solution until the first stage is passed, after which zincethylate is gradu
 ally precipitated until the second stage is completed.          Indeed, as has been
 shown in the memoir above referred to (Phil. Trans. 1855, p. 268), the
 oxidation, instead of stopping at the first stage, proceeds even somewhat
 further than the second, and the product formed does not possess a com
position in any degree approaching that which M. Buttlerow asserts it to
 have.    This is evident from the following numbers, and from the circum

    The existence of monatomic organo-zinc radicals receives further support
from the following experimental determinations,              which also show the
functions of such radicals in the formation of        the ethers   of the lactic series
from ethylic oxalate.
    When zincethyl is added to leucic ether previously cooled in a freezing
mixture, each drop of the zinc compound, as it comes into contact with
the ether, hisses like anhydrous phosphoric acid when dropped into water.
Torrents of hydride of ethyl are evolved, and the mixture finally solidifies

 not distil below 100° C., at about which temperature a violent action sets
 in ; a great quantity of gas is evolved, and the residue solidifies to a pitch
 like  mass,     which, on treatment with water and subsequent distillation, yields
 about one-fourth of the leucic ether employed.                         If the above-mentioned
 white mass, instead of being heated, be mixed with water, it effervesces
 strongly, zinc hydrate is formed, and pure leucic ether separates in quan
 tity nearly equal to that originally employed.
    In    a quantitative       experiment 12-93 grms. of zincethyl were treated with
 leucic ether, excess being avoided ; 1 5*67 grms. of leucic ether were required
 to saturate the above             quantity of zincethyl, and the weight of hydride of
 ethyl evolved, which was carefully determined, amounted to 3-08 grms.

     It  was obviously impossible to collect in a state of purity the iodide of
  ethyl thus set at liberty without considerable loss ; but the quantity of the
  pure iodide actually obtained was        12 grins.      The above equation requires
  14-6 grms.
     On the removal of ether and iodide of ethyl, the mixture of zincoleucic
  ether and iodide of zinc forms a transparent gummy mass easily soluble
  in ether, bisulphide of carbon, and caoutchoucin, but totally incapable of
  crystallizing from any of its solutions.        All our attempts to separate these
  bodies have hitherto proved abortive, and it is by no means improbable
  that they are chemically combined.
     The action of zincethyl upon ethylic leucate throws much light upon
 the production of the latter from zincethyl and ethylic oxalate, and scarcely
 leaves a doubt that, when zincethyl is added to ethylic leucate, there is
 reproduced the zinc compound from which the ethylic leucate was first
 formed.      1We   may therefore express the two stages in the original produc
 tion of ethylic leucate by the following equations : —

        Action of Zinc Ipon Oxalic Ether and the Iodides of Methyl and

    The reaction of zinc upon oxalic ether in the presence of iodide of amyl,
the results of which we hope very shortly to have the honour of laying
before the Royal Society, had led us to anticipate, that if an oxalate of one
organic radical were treated with the iodide of another, one atom of di
atomic oxygen in the oxalic ether would be replaced by two different mon-
atomic radicals.         This anticipation was not, however, realized, as we have
already shown*, when the reaction was extended to a mixture of iodide of
ethyl with oxalate of methyl, and iodide of methyl with oxalate of ethyl.
In both these cases the radicals presented in the form of iodides were the

     Certain theoretical considerations, however, rendered it important for us
to be able distinctly to label each radical entering into the composition of
the derived acids, so as to enable us with certainty to trace its source, aud,
if   possible, to determine its position or value in the resulting complex
molecule.       We therefore endeavoured to accomplish the desired end by
acting with zinc upon a mixture consisting of one atom of oxalic ether and
 one atom each of the iodides of methyl and ethyl, by which we hoped to
 obtain an acid of the following composition     : —
                                          C2H5

     Experiment completely proved the practicability of this reaction, and its
 result even exceeded our expectations, since not only was the ether corre
 sponding to the above acid formed with the greatest facility, but it was
 produced almost to the complete exclusion           of the ethers of leucic and
 dimethoxalic acids.
     200 grms. of oxalic ether were mixed with the proper atomic propor
 tions of iodide of methyl and iodide of ethyl, and were digested with granu
 lated zinc for several days at a temperature of from 35° to 40° C., until
 the supernatant liquid became oily, and solidified to a crystalline mass on
 cooling.     Water being now added until effervescence ceased, the whole was
  submitted to distillation in an oil-bath. With the exception of a small quan
 tity of the mixed iodides of ethyl and methyl that had escaped decompo
  sition, the distillate consisted of a homogeneous liquid composed of water,
  ethylic and methylic alcohols, and an ethereal body, which last was sepa
  rated by repeated agitation with large volumes of ether and subsequent
  rectification.    In this manner there was obtained a large quantity of a
  liquid which boiled constantly at 165°-5 C., and yielded on analysis num
  bers very closely corresponding with he formula

     A  not inconsiderable amount of the ether thus formed in this and in the
 analogous reactions described in our previous communications, appears to
 be decomposed by the zinc hydrate ; at all events an appreciable quantity
 of the zinc-salt of the derived acid is always obtained from the residue
  left after distillation of the ethereal product.
     Ethylic ethomethoxalate,        as we propose to *name the new ether, is a
 colourless,   transparent,    and mobile     liquid, possessing a penetrating ethereal
 odour much resembling that of ethylic diethoxalate.                   It is very soluble in
 water, alcohol,     and ether, and has a specific gravity of -9768 at 13° C.
 It  boils at 1650,5 C., and its vapour has a density of 4 98 ; the theoretical
 number     for a two-volume     vapour    (H,     0=2      vols.) of the above formula
 being 5104.
     Ethylic ethomethoxalate is readily decomposed, even by aqueous solu
 tions of the alkalies and of baryta, yielding alcohol and a salt of the base.
 The ethomethoxalate of barium was thus prepared.                      It crystallizes from
 an aqueous solution as a beautiful radiated mass of silky lustre, very easily
 soluble in water.       Its analysis gave numbers closely corresponding with
 the formula

     By exactly decomposing this salt with dilute sulphuric acid and evapo
 rating the filtrate, first in a retort, and afterwards in vacuo, ethomethoxalic
 acid was obtained as a splendid white crystalline mass, fusing at 63° C,
 subliming readily at 100°, and condensing in magnificent star-like groups
 upon a cold surface.        It boils with decomposition at 1 90° C. Ethometh
 oxalic acid is very readily soluble in ether, alcohol, and water ; small frag
 ments of it thrown upon water rotate like camphor whilst dissolving.

   On a small fragment of Killas from Cornwall,          I  discovered, several
months ago, a new mineral in the form of minute but well-formed crystals.
The specimen had come from Mr. Tailing, of Lostwithiel, a mineral-
dealer, to whose activity and intelligence    I am indebted for the materials
that form the subject of this paper.       After a little while he found the
locality of the mineral, and sent me other and finer specimens ; but these
specimens proved to contain other new minerals besides the one already
mentioned.     Two of these minerals are described in this paper, and     a third
will form the subject of a further communication.

   The first of these minerals which I proceed to describe is one to which
I have given the name of Langite, in honour of my friend Dr. Viktor von
Lang, now of Gratz, and lately my colleague in the British Museum. It
occurs in minute crystals, or as a crystalline crust on the Killas, of a fine
blue with a greenish hue in certain lights.        The crystals are prismatic.

   The specific gravity of Langite         is 3-48 to 3-50.       Its hardness   is under 3.
It will  not abrade calcite.
   Before   the blowpipe on charcoal it gives off water, and fumes and
becomes    reduced     to metallic copper.           Insoluble in water, it is readily dis
solved by acids and ammonia.                 Heated, it passes through (1) a bright
green,   and    (2) various tints of olive-green, till (3) it becomes black.
Water is given off the whole time, and finally it has a strongly acid
reaction.
   The first   stage corresponds        to the loss of one equivalent of water ; the
second reduces its composition to that of Brochantite ; at the third it loses
all its water.

double-curved wedge. A narrow plane, 0 0 1, is very brilliant and without
striatum.           It
              appears to be a cleavage-plane.    A second, but scarcely

    M. Pisani has published analyses of the two above-described minerals.
In   the former    (possibly from having driven off part of the water in the
preliminary desiccation of the mineral) he has found less water than I
consider it really to contain, and he has consequently given to Langite
the formula of Waringtonite.
    The green mineral which he has analyzed and described as Brochan
tite seems, from his analysis, to have contained a slight admixture of the
ferruginous matrix, and also differs from mine in the estimate of the water.
    I confined my preliminary desiccation to a careful treatment of the
bruised mineral with dried and warm blotting-paper,                 as many hydrated
 minerals of this class yield up part of their         water when long exposed to a
 perfectly dry   air, or to  a temperature   of 100°  C.

        F.R.S., &c.       Received February 15, 1865.
    The salt which     I have hitherto chiefly employed is the sulphobenzolate
of soda, C„H5Na 2SOs, which           was prepared according to Mitscherlich's*
 directions, by precipitating crude sulphobenzolate of lime by carbonate of
 soda, separating the carbonate of lime produced, and evaporating the clear
 solution to dryness.       The finely powdered salt, which had previously been
 thoroughly dried, was introduced into a small copper retort and subjected
 to destructive distillation, when a considerable quantity of carbonic acid
was evolved, and a brownish-coloured            oily liquid, covered by a layer of
water, collected in the receiver.
    This oil was separated from the water and distilled in a retort furnished
with a thermometer.           The liquid began to boil at 80° C., and then rose
slowly to 110° C., when only a small quantity of water, and an oil consisting
chiefly of benzol, came over. The boiling-point then rapidly rose to 290° C.,
at which temperature the greater portion of the liquid distilled over, leaving
a black residue in the retort.
    The oil boiling at 290° C. is of a pale yellow colour, heavier than water,
and has an aromatic and slightly alliaceous odour.                 It contains a consi
derable amount of sulphur.
    When this oil is brought in contact with nitric acid, a very violent action
ensues with evolution of nitrous fumes, and when the resulting solution is
poured into water, a crystalline mass of a pale yellow colour is obtained.
This, when dried and washed with ether to separate a small quantity of
adhering oil, is dissolved in hot spirit, from which, on cooling, two colour
less crystalline   substances separate.
    The first of these, which constitutes         the bulk of the product, forms
beautiful   rhombic     plates,  which, when    crystallized out of benzol, may be

obtained of considerable           size and great lustre, closely resembling chlorate
of potassa in appearance.             This body also contains sulphur. The second
substance,       the quantity      of which is comparatively small, crystallizes in
long thin plates.
   The oil, when treated with concentrated sulphuric acid, dissolves with          a fine
purple colour, and from this solution water precipitates a crystalline body,
an organic acid remaining in solution, which forms a crystalline lime-salt.
    I have likewise subjected to destructive distillation the sulphobenzolates
of lime, ammonia, and copper.                The two last yield very different products
from the soda-salt.
    I  am at present engaged          in examining these as well as the other bodies
mentioned in this Notice, and hope soon to be able to communicate to the
Society the results of my investigations.
III.    " Preliminary Note on the Radiation from a Revolving Disk."
        By Balfour Stewart, M.A., F.R.S., and P. G. Tait, M.A.
        Received      February 23, 1865.
    The authors having        been led by perfectly distinct trains of reasoning to
identical   views    bearing on the dissipation of energy, have had preliminary
experiments made on the increase of radiation from a wooden disk on
account of its velocity of rotation, both in the open air and in vacuo.
    These experiments were made with a very delicate thermo-electric pile
and galvanometer.           In the experiments in the open air the disk was of
wood ;    its   diameter   was  9 inches, and it was made to rotate with a velocity
somewhat less than 100 revolutions in one second.
    A sensible effect was produced upon the indicating galvanometer when the
disk was made to rotate, and this effect appeared to be due to radiation, and
not to currents of air impinging against the pile.            In amount it was found to
be nearly the       same  as if  the    disk  had increased in  temperature O0- 75 Fahr.
    In the experiments in vacuo the diameter of the wooden disk was over
 12  inches   ;  its velocity of rotation was about 100 revolutions in one second,
and the pile was nearer it than when in air.                Under these circumstances,
with a vacuum of 0 0          in.,  an effect apparently due to radiant heat was ob
tained, amounting to nearly the same as if the disk had increased in tem
perature l°-5 Fahr.
    Bearing in mind the increased diameter of the disk, the effect is pro
bably equivalent to that obtained in air, and these preliminary experi
ments would tend to show that when a wooden diak is made to revolve
rapidly at the surface of the earth, its radiation is increased to an extent
depending        on the velocity ; and it would appear that this effect is not
materially less in a vacuum of 0-6 in. than in the open air.
    The authors intend to work out this and allied questions experimentally,
and hope, if successful, to communicate the result to this Society.

whatever is taken, as a fundamental   curve, and the origin is placed any
where in its plane.    In this manner many descriptive relations which in
the ordinary theory are masked, regain the generality and prominence to
which they are entitled.   Having long ago convinced myself of the utility
of this generalized method of inversion, I deem it desirable to establish, for
the sake of future reference, its chief general principles.    With the view of
securing  the greatest possible   familiarity with  the  effects of inversion,                  I
employ -purely geometrical considerations, and everywhere give preference
to a direct and immediate contemplation of the several geometrical forms
which present themselves.     The examples occasionally introduced, arc
given for the sake of illustration merely; they do not exhibit the full
power of the method.     Moreover, to prevent, as much as possible, the
extension of a paper intended for publication in the Proceedings of the
Royal Society, no attempt has been made to subject such special cases to
exhaustive treatment.  The figures are, for the most part, simple ; the
fundamental one being given, the rest may readily be drawn or imagined ;
when treating of the effects of inversion on the higher singularities of
curves, however, I have thought it desirable to refer by the initials
(91.    to articles and figures in Pliicker's elaborate work on the Theorie

to the still more general one of quadric transformation, as developed in
1832 by Steiner in his Geometrische Gestalten, and by Magnus in the
eighth volume of Crelle's Journal, offers several points of interest to which
I   propose to return on a future occasion*.

   2. Two points, p and p', conjugate to each other with respect to a fixed
fundamental conic (F), and likewise collinear with any fixed origin A in
the plane of the latter, are said to be inverse to each other, relative to that,
conic and origin.   In other words, the inverse of a point is the intersection
of its polar, relative to (F), and the line which connects it with the origin
A. From this the following property is at once deduced :

    I    have recently been interested to find that the method of quadric inversion was
 distinctly suggested, though never developed, by Prof. Bellavitis of Padua no less
than twenty-seven years ago.      Considering the date of its appearance, the memoir, in
the lost paragraph of which this suggestion was made,     in many respects
                                                                 is           remarkable

   Two curves are said to be inverse to each other, of course, when the se
veral points of one are inverse to those of the other.      The latter is some
times referred to as the primitive, and the former as its inverse ; the relation
between the two curves, however, is a mutual                    one, and the distinction is
merely introduced for convenience.    In                  order to obtain clear conceptions
of the various relations which exist between inverse curves, it will be found
convenient to place the origin A outside the fundamental conic (F).       The
modifications to be introduced when the origin is placed elsewhere are quite
obvious, and, except in a few instances, need not be specially alluded to.
   3. Adopting terms introduced by Magnus, the origin A and the two
points of contact B and G of the tangents from A to the fundamental conic
(F) are called ike principal points ; the triangle, of which they form the
corners, is termed    the.   principal triangle, and its          sides   BC, CA, AB, respect
ively polar to A, C, B, are the principal lines. Occasionally it will be con
venient to refer to B and C as distinct from A, which is always real ; the
two former will then be called the fundamental points, and the principal
linesAB, AC, which there touch (F), will in like manner be called the fun-
damental lines polar to B and C.
  4. This premised, it is manifest from Art. 2 that, in general, a point p
has but one inverse point p'.   The only exceptions, in fact, are the three
principal points, each of which is obviously inverse to every point in the
principal line which constitutes its polar. It is further evident that each
point of the fundamental conic (F) coincides with its own inverse, and that
the several points of        (F)   are the   only   ones in the plane        which   possess   this
property.
   Hence may be inferred, without difficulty, the following theorem :
   i.   If
         any two curves have r-pointic contact with each other at a point p,
not on a principal line, their inverse curves will also have r-pointic contact
with    each other   at the inverse point           p'.

may readily be ascertained.    For in the first place, since (P) has n points
on each principal line, its inverse must pass n times through each prin
cipal      (Art. 4) ; and secondly, since a line R drawn through the
          point
origin    A        (P) in n points, none of which are, in general, situated
              intersects
on the principal line BC, polar to A, the same line R will intersect the
inverse curve, not only in the n points coincident with the origin, but also
in n points distinct therefrom.   Hence
   The complete quadric inverse of any curve of the order n is a curve of the
order 2n, which has multiple points, of the order n, at each of the three
principal points.
   6. The term complete is here used because, under certain circumstances,
the inverse curve will break up into one or more of the principal lines,
each taken once or oftener, and aproper inverse curve (P') of lower order, and
which passes less frequently through the principal points. This, by Art. 4,
will be the case whenever the primitive curve (P) passes through a principal
point; and it is obvious that the order of (P') will then be less than 2n
by the total number of such passages.         Further, the multiplicity of any
principal point   on (P') will be less than n by the number of times the two
principal lines, which there intersect, enter into the complete inverse, — in
other words by the number of passages of the primitive curve (P) through
the poles       of those principal lines.
   Hence,   if a,\b, e denote, respectively, the multiplicities of the principal
points  A, B, C ou the curve (P), and if a', V, c1 have the same significations
relative to the inverse curve (P') of the order      we shall have     n',
                                               n'=2n— — — a            c,

   These equations,            by
                      transformation, may readily be made identical with
those which result therefrom by simply interchanging the accented and
like non-accented letters; this shows, of course, that between proper inverse
curves the same mutual relation exists as between inverse points.  It in                          is
virtue of this mutual relation that the theorems to be given hereafter are

 sary and sufficient, first, that its order be equal to the total number of its
passages            through the three principal points               ;   and secondly, that it pass as

   It would be easy, by the second theorem, to determine the number and
 nature of the several curves of a given order which have inverse curves of
the same order and like properties, relative to the principal points. This
determination, however, as well as the solution of the allied question —
    Under what conditions will a curve of given order coincide with its own
          inverse ?
will more appropriately          form the subject of a separate paper.                              It will    be
sufficient          to note here that a right line through the origin,                               and the
fundamental   conic itself, regarded as a primitive curve, are the simplest in
stances of the kind under consideration.     Another example is also alluded

  the origin is the middle point of the segment which (F) intercepts on R,
  and that (Art. 4) the infinitely distant points of (F) are necessarily also on
   (I), it will     be seen that
       i. The     conie  (I),    circumscribed to the principal triangle, which is inverse
   to the line at infinity, is similar and similarly situated to the fundamental conic,
   of which latter, in fact, it bisects all chords that converge to the origin.
        By means of this conic (1) the asymptotes to any inverse curve may be
   readily constructed.              Since the next article, however, will be devoted to
   the construction of the tangent at any point whatever of an inverse curve,
   it will be sufficient here to note the following obvious corollaries of the
   above theorem         :

   to the      right lines     connecting     the origin   with the intersections   of  the other
   curve and the conic           (I),  which circumscribes the principal triangle and is, at
    the same time, similar and similarly situated to the fundamental conic (F).
        iii. The conic inverse to a given right line will be a hyperbola, a parabola,
    or   an ellipse, according as that line cuts, touches, or does not meet the conic          (I),
-   which circumscribes the           primitive triangle and is similar and similarly placed
    to the fundamental conic (F).
        The conic (F) and the circle circumscribed to the principal triangle
    ABC have, of course, conjugate to BC, a second common chord H, inverse to
    that circle     (Art.   8,  i.), and this chord is clearly the only line in the plane
    whose inverse is a circle.              The imaginary intersections of H with (I) are
    inverse to the circular points at infinity, and consequently lie, with the
    latter, on a pair of imaginary lines intersecting in the origin A.
         Again, it is well known that all chords of (I) which subtend a right angle
    at A pass through a fixed point h *.                        The conies inverse to such
    chords are readily seen to be equilateral hyperbolas, and like their primitive
    lines they all pass through a fixed point — in fact, through the point A'
    inverse to h ; thi3 point h\ moreover, is well known to be the intersection
  . of the three perpendiculars              of the triangle ABC, about which all the equi
    lateral hyperbolas are circumscribed f.                   It further follows from a known

 of    d\ must           be the pole       of D or act,      as well as the harmonic   conjugate of A
 relative to pp' (Art. 2, i.). Consequently,                       from the fact that when L touches,
 at p, a primitive curve (P), the conic                             (L'), and hence its tangent L',
 must touch, a.tp', the inverse curve (P')                         (Art. 4, i.), we at once deduce the
 following theorem, by means of which the tangent at any point of a curve
 inverse to a given one may, for all positions of the origin, be readily con
 structed        :
    i. The tangents, at two inverse points, to two inverse curves intersect
 on the polar, relative to the fundamental conic, of the harmonic conjugate
 of the origin with respect to their points of contact.
    Hence we may also deduce the following property :
    ii. To a multiple point on one of two inverse curves, but not on a
 principal line, corresponds, on the other, a multiple point of the same
 order       of multiplicity,     and the tangents to corresponding {inverse) branches
 all intersect            on the polar, relative to the fundamental conic, of the har
 monic conjugate of the origin, relative to the two multiple points.
   The reality, taction, and general distribution of the several branches will
 be the same at two such multiple points ; the latter, in fact, will merely
 differ in certain secondary properties.    For instance, a branch inflected at
 one of these points would not, in general, correspond to an inflected branch
 at the other ; the latter branch, however, would have three-pointic contact, at
 this multiple point, with the conic inverse to the tangent of the inflected
 branch at the first multiple point.
      1 1.   The tangents             at the    principal points to two inverse              curveB    may be
thus investigated.
   Exclusive of the principal points B and C, let the primitive curve (P)
intersect the principal line BC in the points a, a,, a2, &c. . ., and conceive
a right line R to rotate around the origin A.    Exclusive of A this line R
will intersect (P) in n— a points p, respectively inverse to the n'—a' points
p' in which it intersects the inverse curve (P') (Art. 7).          It is clear, how
ever, that whenever, by the rotation of R, p approaches one of the points
a., p' will approach to coincidence with A, so that R will there touch a
branch of (P') ; and more generally, that if R should have (r— 1 )-pointic
contact at a with (P) it would, at the same time, have r-pointic contact at A
with one of the branches of (P').
    Similarly, if (P) intersect the fundamental line AC in the points              /3„                  /3,

      In  similar manner the line R2, which connects C and one of the inter
            a
 sections y of AB and ( P), has for its inverse a line R, touching, at B, a branch
 of (P'). All these cases are included in the following theorems : —
    i. The tangentt at a principal point to one of two inverse curves are
 respectively inverse to the right lines which connect the intersections of
 the other curve and the principal line polar to that point, with the oppo
 site principal point.
    ii.     If
           a non-principal line have r-pointic contact at a principal point
 with any branch of one of two inverse curves, the inverse line will have
 (j—\)-pointic contact with the other curve on the principal line polar to
 that principal point.
    The second of these theorems, as will be shown in the next article, is
 slightly modified when the line of r-pointic contact is a principal one ;
 the first theorem, though still true, becomes susceptible of the following
 simpler enunciation :
    iii.        If
          a branch of one  of two inverse curves touch a principal line at a
principal point, the other curve will have a branch touched by the polar of
this point at the pole of that line.
   The following examples will serve as illustrations of these three theorems :
   Ex. 1. The primitive being a right line intersecting the principal lines in
a,   y, respectively (see figure), Aa will be the tangent at A to its inverse
      (i,
conic and;    B/J, Cy intersect in p, the inverse point
                     if                                      will be the pole of             p'
BC relative to  the inverse conic.   This   pole    always real      may, moreis                    ;   it
over, be easily constructed, even when     and     are imaginary, on observing
                                                            B               C
that    p also the intersection of
                ig                 the polar of *,  relative to the fundamental
conic, with the harmonic conjugate of aA, relative to BC and the primitive
line.

the fundamental   points, the inverse curve will be another conic possessing
the same properties (Art. 6).    The fundamental conic is not the only one
of such        a series      which coincides with its own inverse (Art. 7) ; for there is
obviously a              second one which cuts every line through the origin in a pair of
inverse points.
                                        Singularities of inverse Curves.
   12. If two of the intersections a, a„ a4 &c. . . of the primitive curve (P)
with the principal line BC coincide ; in other words, if (P) touch BC at « ;
then two of the branches of (P') will unite to form a cusp at A, at which
A* will be the tangent. Similarly, if (P) touch a fundamental line, say
AC at      then on one of the branches of (P') there will be
               /3,                                                cusp at C, at                       a
which the line inverse to B/3 will be the tangent.     In short —

         one    two inverse curves touch

                                                                   a
point, the inverse of the connector     the point of contact with the opposite
                                                              of
principal point will touch, at the pole     that line, a cusped branch of the

other curve.
   The more general theorem      obviously this      is                       :
   ii.        If
        one of two inverse curves have r-pointic contact with a principal line
 at non-principal point,
      a                     branches of the other curve will coalesce so as to
                                               r

pole      of    that line     ;     and the sole tangent           to this branch              will   be the    inverse       of
the connector              of     the    point     of   contact    of   the   first   curve with the opposite
principal point.
   It may be added that, in general, the singularity at the principal point on
this branch will be invisible or cusp-like, according as          odd or even.                   r     is

     i.  If a    branch    of   one  of  two inverse curves have r-pointic        contact with a
principal line       at a principal point, the other curve will have, at the pole of that
line, a multiple point of the order r — 1 on a branch the sole tangent to which
is the polar of that principal point.
     Ex. The primitive curve being a cubic which has the fundamental
points B, C for points of inflection, and the fundamental lines for stationary
tangents, and consequently another point of inflection a. on BC, the inverse
curve will be a quartic touching A« at the origin, and passing twice through
each of the fundamental points (Arts. 6 and 10) . From the present theorem
 we conclude, further, that the latter points will be cusps on the quartic, and
 t hat the fundamental lines will be the tangents thereat (SI. (£. p. 192, ix.).
       14.  From preceding articles the following properties may also                      be de
 duced:
      i. If one of two inverse curves have         a multiple point on a      principal line, but
 not at a principal point, the other               unit,    in general, have a corresponding
 number      of  branches      touching each other at the pole        of that line ; and at this
 pole the common tangent to these branches will be inverse to the connector of
 the first multiple point and the principal point opposite to the principal line
  on which it is situated.
       To obtain a clear conception of the modifications which may present
  themselves, it will suffice to consider the case where the primitive curve (P)
  has a double point at a on the polar BC of the origin A.
       (a) The inverse curve will, in general,                  have a tacnode at      A   (91. (5.
  p. 164, figs. 17,           —
                          18) in    other words, two branches which there touch each
  other, the common tangent being Aa ; these branches will, moreover, have
  three-pointic contact, at A, with the conies inverse to the two tangents
  at   a to the primitive curve*.             If one of the tangents at a, coincide with
  «A, one of the branches of the inverse curve will                    be inflected at A (31. 6.
  fig. 21) (Art. 11, iv.).           If  one of the branches at a touch the primitive
  line   BC,    then one of the branches at A will be cusped, Aa being still the
  common tangent to the cusped and to the ordinary branch (91. S. fig. 28).
   If   both these singularities occur on the primitive at the same time, the
  i averse curve      will present at A a triple point, with a single tangent, formed
   by an inflected and a cusped branch (91. S. fig. 30).
       (b)   If  the tangents at as coincide, so that the branches of the primitive
   curve there form an ordinary or ceratoid cusp (91. S. fig. 1 6, Spitze erster
   Art), the conies of three-pointic contact at A with the corresponding
   branches of the inverse curve will also coincide, and the latter will possess
   a ramphoid cusp         f (91. G» . fig. 1 9, Spitze zweiter Art), at which A* will still
   be the sole tangent,          meeting the cusp in four coincident points.                In the
   special case where the tangent at the cusp « passes through the origin, the
       * By Art.    11, i, tho  conies inverse to any right line whatever through      m  will have
   two-pointic    contact, at A, with each branch    of  the tacnode.
       f  Prof. Cayley's term cusp-node is more appropriate (Quart. Journ. vol. vi. p. 74) ; the
   singularity    in question may also be regarded as a stationary point on a stationary
   tangent, for the curve lies entirely on one side of the latter.

     cusp at    A  on the inverse curve will also assume the ccratoid form, but it
    will   be  of higher order than the primitive        one, since the tangent at A will
    meet it in five, instead of in three coincident points (91. E. p. 167,
                                                                                               iv.).
    If   the principal line BC be itself the tangent at the ordinary cusp «, the
    inverse curve will have a triple point at A, the sole tangent A* at which will
    meet the curve in five coincident points.           To the eye, this singularity will
    have the form of a point of inflection (91. d. p. 1 74, fig.
                                                                              29).
        The following examples will illustrate the production, by inversion, of
   cusps of both kinds.
        Ex.   1.  The primitive curve being a cusped cubic, and the origin A
   being placed at its real point of inflection, let the stationary tangent
   be chosen as a fundamental         line, and any line whatever through the cusp x
   as the    polar of the origin.      If the points B, C, in which the latter inter
   sects the cubic and the stationary tangent, be considered as the funda
   mental points, the inverse curve will (Art. 6) be a quartic curve passing
   once through B, and twice through each of the points C and A.                               The
   tangent     to the  quartic  at  B  will be  the inverse   of   the  line  joining C to the
   third intersection y of the cubic with the fundamental line AB                   (Art.  11,  i.).
   The point C will        be a   ceratoid   cusp on the quartic       with CB for its tan
   gent (Art. 13, i.). Lastly, Aa. will be the tangent at A to a ramphoid
  cusp on the inverse curve (4). The latter, therefore, is identical with the very
  remarkable quartic curve to which Prof. Sylvester's recent researches on
  the roots of equations of the fifth degree has imparted so great an interest
  (Phil. Trans. 1865). It is termed by him the Bicorn,' and is the one
                                                                '
  which, in Plucker's classification, is numbered xvi.                                      Since
                                                                    (91. (£. p. 193).
  the primitive cubic from which it has been derived may itself be regarded
 as the inverse of a conic (Art. 12, Ex. 1), it is obvious that many pro
 perties of the Bicorn may be deduced from those of a conic, by double
 inversion, relative to two sets of principal points.
       Ex. 2. The primitive being a conic, its inverse will, in general, be a
 quartic curve passing twice through each principal point (Art. 6).
      All the ten varieties of such quartics which have been described by
 Plucker (91. E. p. 195) correspond, in a very simple manner, to the dif
 ferent positions which the primitive conic may have*. Now itis well known
that, in general, two triangles maybe inscribed in this conic, each of which
                                                                                                  f
shall, at the same time, be circumscribed to the principal triangle ; whence
we infer that two triangles may be inscribed in the quartic, so that a
                                                                                          double
point shall lie on each side of each triangle. A second inversion, therefore,
     * For instance, if the
                             principal triangle bo self-conjugate relative to tho primitive
conic, the inverse quartic will have, at each principal point, both its
                                                                               branches inflected
(Art. 11, ii.). In this caso it is further obvious that two principal points must neces
sarily lie outside the primitive conic ; so that one principal point will
                                                                                necessarilv be a
conjugate point on the quartic (Art. 11, Ex. 2).         Inversion, in fact, renders
                                                                                           visible

ever their doublo points are also points of inflexion (3. 4E. p.
                                                                     199).

relative to either of these triangles will transform the quartic to a quintic
(Art. 6) with three tacnodes, the varieties of which will correspond to
those of the quartic.      If, for instance, the primitive conic were inscribed
in the original principal triangle, then the quartic would have three
ceratoid cusps, and the quintic would be the remarkable one which Plucker
has signalized (St. (£. p. 222, fig. 35) as possessing three ramphoid cusps.
   (c) With respect to singularities of a higher order on the primitive
curve, and on a principal line, little more need be added. To a tacnode
at a. would correspond, on the inverse curve, two branches touching the line
Aa, and having three-pointic contact with each other at A (31. (£. p. 165,
fig. 20). In fact, as a general rule, the contact of the branches at A is
one higher in order than that of the corresponding branches at ».           If a
were a ramphoid cusp on the primitive, A would also be a ramphoid cusp,
of higher order, on the inverse curve (31. (X. p. 170), and so on. It is
worth observing, lastly, that although, by (a), the inverse of a tacnode at
A is an ordinary node at <t, on the polar of A, the latter will itself become
a tacnode when approaches to coincidence with B or C (Art. 1 1, iii.),
and similarly —
    i.   If one                                       cusp at a principal
                  of two inverse curves have a ramphoid
point, to which a principal line is the tangent, the other will also have a
ramphoid cusp at the pole of that line, the tangent to which will be the
polar of that point.
   This is manifest, in fact, from (b), on considering, with Professor
Cayley *, a ramphoid cusp at B, with tangent BC, to arise from the coin
cidence of a ceratoid cusp at a with a node at B.
                         Special cases of quadric inversion.
   15. The special cases of inversion which correspond to particular hypo
theses relative to the position of the origin and to the nature of the
fundamental conic are very numerous.     The choice of these elements will
depend of course upon the nature of the properties which are to be investi
gated by the method of inversion.  A few only of the more useful of such
special cases can be here noticed.
    (1) When the fundamental conic (F) is an hyperbola with its centre at
the origin    A,
              its asymptotes constitute the fundamental lines, and their in
tersections with the line at infinity the fundamental points (Art. 3). Every
right line parallel to    one   of   these asymptotes has,   for its inverse,    a   right line
parallel to the other ; and the two intersect on the fundamental hyperbola
(Art. 8, ii.). The inverse of every other line in the plane is an hyperbola
passing through the origin, and having its asymptotes parallel to those of
the fundamental hyperbola (Art. 8,           moreover the conic (I) inverse to
                                              i.);
the line at infinity resolves itself into these asymptotes (Art.   i.). Every   9,

possessing the same properties (Art. 6) ; and if the primitive have likewise
its centre at the origin, the latter will also be the centre of its inverse
(Art.      1 1,  Ex. 3).      The tangents to two inverse curves at two inverse
points p, p' now intersect on a line D bisecting pp', and parallel to the
diameter of the fundamental conic, which is conjugate to pp' (Art. 10).
     (la) When the fundamental conic is an equilateral hyperbola, the
origin being still at its centre, the method of inversion becomes identical
with the "hyperbolic transformation" investigated by Professor Schiaparelli,
of Milan, in his interesting memoir, " Sulla trasformazione geometrica
                    "
delle figure *. The line D, upon which the tangents to two inverse curves
at inverse points p,p' intersect, not only bisects pp', hut is now inclined at
the same angle as pp' to each of the fixed asymptotes of the fundamental
hyperbola.
     (2) The fundamental conic being an ellipse and the origin at its centre,
 the inverse of every right line in the plane will be an ellipse passing
 through the origin, and at the same time similar, as well as similarly
 placed, to the fundamental ellipse.             The ellipse (I) inverse to the line at
 infinity now resolves itself to a point coincident with the origin. Every
 ellipse not passing through the origin, but similar and similarly placed to
 the fundamental one, has for its inverse an ellipse with the same proper
 ties   ; and should the primitive be likewise concentric with the fundamental
 ellipse, so also will be the inverse. The tangents at two inverse points p,p'
 to inverse curves again intersect on a line D which bisects pp', and is par
 allel to the diameter of the fundamental           ellipse conjugate to pp'.
     (2a) When the fundamental conic is a circle with its centre at the origin,
 we have, as already stated, the case of cyclic inversion, and the imaginary
 circular points at infinity are the fundamental points ; the line D becomes,
 as is well known, the perpendicular           to pp' through its middle point.        From
  the theorems ii. and iii. of        Art. 8 we should now     infer that
     (i)      The    cyclic inverse of a right line through one of the circular
 points       is   a  right line through the other, and the two intersect on the
fundamental circle.
      (ii)    The cyclic inverse of a simple focus of any curve is always a focus
  of   the   inverse   curve —unless the first focus should coincide with the origin,
  in which case the inverse curve would have cusps at the circular points at
  infinity (Art.        12, i.).
      It   is important      to notice that this theorem does not hold for a double
  focus     /   of the primitive curve —that is to say, for the intersection of the
                                                              For in this case the con
  tangents to this curve at the circular points.
  nectors of the inverse point        /'  with the circular points would merely inter
 sect the inverse curve on the fundamental lines (Art. ll,i.); the line
 joining the points of intersection — a common chord of the point-circle
  and the inverse curve — would, however, bisect            Af   perpendicularly.
                                                                                          f

corresponding     directrix  would  bisect Ay'   perpendicularly.     The focal rela
tions of cyclic inverse curves, however, deserve closer examination ; and
 1  propose on another occasion to return to them.
     (3) When the fundamental conic consists of a          pair of real, right lines
F,, F, intersecting at    F,  the fundamental points     B,  C coincide with F, and
the principal line BC with the harmonic conjugate of AF relative to F,, F,.
The conic (I) inverse to the line at infinity is now an hyperbola, of which
 AF is a diameter, and the asymptotes of which are parallel to F, and F,.
 Harmonic conjugates relative to the latter lines now constitute pairs of inverse
 lines, and the conic inverse to every other line, cutting BC say in a, is a
 conic touched at A and F by A« and BC, so that the conies inverse to all
 lines parallel to BC are concentric, and have AF for a common diameter.
The conies inverse to all lines passing through a fixed point a of AF have
 obviously three-pointic contact with each other at F, so that the conies
inverse to lines parallel to AF have, at F, three-pointic contact with the
hyperbola (I). All conies touching BC at F, but not passing through A,
are inverse to conies having the same properties, and all conies passing
 through A and F, but not touching BC at the latter point, give by inversion
conies of a similar description.      The tangents at inverse points p,p' to two
inverse curves now intersect on the harmonic conjugate of            BC, relative to
 Fp, Fp'.
     (3a) The fundamental conic may consist of a pair of right lines, per
pendicular to each other. The results          are then similar to, and somewhat
 simpler than those just noticed.
     (4) When    the fundamental   conic consists   of a pair of imaginary right
 lines intersecting at a real point F, the effects of inversion are analogous
to those considered in (3). To secure real constructions, it is merely ne
 cessary to assume the point -ellipse F to be concentric with, similar, and simi
larly placed to a given ellipse (E). The lines FA and BC will then be con
jugate diameters of (E), and any two inverse points p,p' will also lie on con
jugate diameters. When the imaginary lines F,, Fa pass through the cir
cular points, we have the following species of inversion :
     (4a) The fundamental conic consists of a point-circle F. The principal
line BC is now perpendicular to AF at F, and the connector of every pair
of inverse points p, p' subtends a right angle at F. Inverse right lines
through F, are perpendicular to each other, and the inverse of any right
line in the plane is a conic, through A, to which AF is the normal at F.
 The circle (I) on AF as diameter, is the inverse of the line at infinity,
and all right lines which touch one and the same circle, concentric with (1),
are inverse to conies which are similar to each other — these conies being
 ellipses, parabolas, or hyperbolas, according as the circle in question is

greater than, equal to, or less than (I) (Art. 9, iii.). Lastly, every circle
through F whose centre is on AF is inverse to a circle of the same kind as
itself, as is also every circle passing through the points A and F.
     (5) When                       A
                         is on the fundamental conic (F) the fundamental
                      the origin
points B and C coincide with                 it,
                                 and the three principal lines coincide -with
the tangent at A. The conic (I) inverse to the line at infinity touches (F)
at   A     and bisects all its chords through              A, and the conic inverse to every
other line in the plane has obviously three-pointic contact at with (F).            A
All lines which converge to one and the same point on the tangent at A
are inverse to conies which have, at                 A, four-pointic contact with each other        ;
hence right lines parallel to the tangent at A are inverse to conies having,
at A, four-pointic contact with (I).       Finally, the tangents to any two
inverse curves, at inverse points p, pf, intersect on line    which touches
                                                                     a          D

     A     still more special      case,    into the details of which       we cannot   enter,   is
when       the fundamental         curve    is   a  parabola, and the origin at the infinitely
distant extremity          of  its axis.         Inversion relative to a conic and its focus     is
also   a    special case   which merits attention, but cannot              be here considered.

of any primitive curve, and the inverse of its reciprocal polar, lead at

trace of decidua in such impregnated       uteri ; the smooth chorion was firmer
than that of uterine ova of Rodentia     ;  whence, and for other reasons given
in the Paper ahove cited, it  was inferred   " that the Monotremata were essen
tially ovo-viviparous."
   The impregnated uteri of the Ornithorhynchus there described were of
females killed in the month of October.          In the early part of December
young Ornithorhynchi, obtained from the nest, were transmitted to the
author: they were naked, blind, with short, broad, flexible, and softly
labiate   mandibles, the tongue proportionally large, and reaching to near
the end of the mandibles ; the mouth not round, as in the mammary
foetus of Marsupials, but a wide transverse slit ; a pair of small patulous
nostrils opened upon the upper mandible, and between them was a small
prominence resembling the knob on the beak of the newly-hatched chick,
but softer, and lacking the cuticle, which had been torn off. There was
no trace of navel or umbilical cicatrix.
    The phases of the development of the mammary glands of the Orni
 thorhynchus    were the subject of another communication,              and, with
the peculiar formation of the mouth of the young animal, demonstrated
that it was nourished by milk as other mammals.              The smallest of the
young    of the Ornithorhynchus     so  obtained    did  not exceed  two inches in
length.
    At  the early part of the present year, the author received from Dr.
Mueller, F.R.S., of the Botanical Gardens, Melbourne, Australia, a female
Echidna {Ornithorhynchus Hystrix, Home, Echidna Hystrix, Cuv.), with
a young one, which the captor found adhering to the mother, as he sup
posed, by a nipple. They were transmitted in spirits, and their description
forma the chief subject of the present communication.            In regard to the
parent, the description is limited to the parts concerned in generation.
    The marsupial pouches are first described.          These are two in number,
about 1 1 inch apart, each with the aperture longitudinal and towards the
medial line, on the ventral integument, half an inch in depth and two-thirds
of an inch in length. The young Echidna, about one inch in length in a
straight line, could be received in a bent posture into the pouch, and might
cling to the fine hairs of that part by its claws ; but there was no trace of
nipple. Each mammary gland terminates by numerous ducts upon the fundus
of the corresponding pouch. The structure of the gland, the ducts, the
surrounding muscles, and the pouch is described. The author next proceeds
to give an account of the internal organs of generation of the female Echidna.
   The left ovarium, as in the Ornithorhynchus paradoxus, was of an
oblong flattened form, developed from the posterior division of the ovarian
ligament and corresponding wall of the ovarian capsule ; it consisted of
a rather lax stroma, invested by a smooth, thin, firm
                                                               " tunica propria,"
which glistens where stretched over the enlarged ovisacs. Of these there
were five, of a spherical form, most of them suspended by a contracted
part of their periphery, not stretched into a pedicle, to the rest of the
    VOl. XIV.                                                         K

ovarium ; the largest with a diameter of 1 ^ line, the least of the five with
a diameter of rather less than 1 line. Besides these there was a flattened
ovisac, 2£ lines in length, and 2 lines in opposite diameters, of a flattened
pyriform shape, with a somewhat wrinkled exterior, attached hy the base,
with the apex slightly tumid, and showing a trace of a fine cicatrix.    This
was an ovisac from which an ovarian ovum had been discharged.
  The oviducal           of the ovarian ligament passes, as in the Orni-
                         branch
thorhynchus, to the outer angle of the wide oviducal slit or aperture,
which occupies or forms the margin of the ovarian pouch opposite to that
to which the ovary is attached.   The ligament spreads upon the inner
wall of the infundibular part of the oviduct, and rejoins the ovarian
division of the ligament to be continued along the oviduct, puckering up
its short convolutions into a small compass. The " fallopian" aperture of
the infundibulum is a longitudinal slit of 9 lines in length, with a delicate
membranous border extending about a line beyond where the muscular
and mucous tunics of the oviduct make the thin wall of the infundibulum
opaque,      transparency against a dark ground contrasting with the
               its
opaque beginning of the proper tunics of the oviduct, which nevertheless
are here very thin.  No part of this delicate free margin is produced into
fimbriae   ;       in this respect Echidna accords with Ornithorhynchus,       and
equally manifests the character by which the Monotremes differ from the
Marsupials. The infundibular dilatation suddenly contracts about an
inch from the opening into a " fallopian" tube, about a line in diameter,
which is puckered up into four or five short close coils. The oviduct,
after a slight contraction, suddenly expands into the uterus.  This is
about 2 inches long, and 6 lines in diameter.   It commences by a short
well-marked  bend, convex outwards, and then proceeds nearly straight, the
pair converging to the urogenital compartment, slightly contracting at its
termination, which projects, as an " os tincae," into the side of the fundus
of that division of the cloaca.
   The tunics of the uterus    are, externally, the peritoneum, which is
attached  by a lax  cellulosity to the
                                        " tunica propria ; " this, with its
fibrous or muscular layer, is thin, not exceeding -J-th of a line in the pre
sent specimen. The inner layer of the uterine wall is the thickest, and
chiefly  composes          it,
                       consisting of fine lamellae stretched transversely
between the fibrous layer and the fine smooth lining membrane, the whole
being of    pulpy consistence, and doubtless in the recent animal highly
               a
vascular, especially in the impregnated state. The lining membrane was
devoid of any trace of vascular connexion with the membranes of an o^um
or foetus, and wn thrown into delicate irregular rugae, which assumed the
longitudinal direction at the " cervix" or contracted terminal part of the
uterus.   The orifice on the "os tincae" was puckered slit, about
                                                   a                   linea
in extent   below

                                  a

   The right ovarium was proportionally more developed and larger than

 in the Omithorhynchus paradoxus : three ovisacs were developed and
 attached, as in the left ovarium ; and there was also a compressed ovisac,
 similar in size and shape to that in the left side, and exhibiting an apical
 cicatrix, whence it is to be inferred that, in this instance, the right as
 well as the left ovarium had furnished     an impregnated ovum ; and the near
 equality of size and close similarity of structure and condition of the right
 oviduct and uterus equally indicated that they had participated in the
 functions of the last   season of generation.
    The urinary bladder opened into the middle of the fundus of the uro
genital compartment, the uterine orifices intervening between the vesical
 one and the ureters, as in the Omithorhynchus paradoxus. The uro
 genital canal is 1 inch 4 lines in length, and about 9 lines in diameter ; its
 inner surface    shows-  by some coarse wavy longitudinal rugae its capacity
 for dilatation.     The rectum was here of great width ; it terminated by a
 contracted puckered aperture in the back part of the beginning of the
 vestibule, behind the aperture of communication of the urogenital with the
 vestibular canal.     The distal half of the vestibule is lined by a denser and
 less vascular epithelium than the proximal one. The author concludes,
 from these appearances, that the present Echidna had produced two young,
 of which only one was secured, and that probably she had a mammary
 foetus in each pouch prior to her capture.
    The one which was secured resembled the young of the Omithorhynchus
 in the general shape and curvature of the body, and also resembled the
 new-bom young of the Kangaroo in the proportions of the limbs to the
 body, in the inferior size of the hind pair, in the degree of development of
 the digits, especially of the fore pair, and in the feeble indication of eyes
 or eyelids.     But the mouth is proportionally wider, and has the form of a
 transverse slit ; it is not circular.   Upon the upper lip, in the mid line
 between the two nostrils, is a small protuberance corresponding to that in
 the young of the Omithorhynchus paradoxus, which had been covered by
some epidermal production.        The traces of ears are less conspicuous than
in the young Kangaroo, the conch being little, if at all, developed in the
mature Echidna.
    The tail is much shorter than in the young Kangaroo, and shows -as
much proportional size as in the full-grown Echidna, in which it is a mere
stump concealed by the quills and hair.
    The head is proportionally longer and more slender in the marsupial
foetus of the Echidna than in that of the Omithorhynchus or of the Kan
garoo,   and already at this early period foreshows the characteristic elon
gation   and attenuation of that part in the mature animal.         The form of
the mouth, as a transverse slit, is a good monotrematous character of the
young at that period, since, in all true or teated marsupials, the mouth of
the mammary foetus has a peculiar circular and tubular shape.          A scarcely
visible linear cicatrix at the middle of the lower part of the abdomen is the
sole trace  of umbilicus.

innermost of the five being the shortest ; the others of nearly equal length,
but graduating shorter from the third to the fifth.                The characteristic dis
position    of  the   digits   was   better   marked    in  the   hind  limb, the second
already being the strongest and longest, the rest more rapidly shortening
to the fifth than in the fore leg.            The innermost, agreeably with the law
of closer retention of type in the embryo, though the shortest of the five,
was less disproportionately so than in the adult.
   After entering into other particulars, and quoting from correspondence
on this subject of animal physiology, the author summarizes the chief
points in the generative economy of the Monotremes, which still remain to
be determined by actual observation as being —
    1. The manner of copulation.
   2. The season of copulation.
   3. The period of gestation.
   4. The nature          and succession of the temporary structures for the
nourishment       and respiration of the foetus prior to birth or exclusion.
   5. The size, condition, and powers of the young at the time of birth or
exclusion.
   6. The period during which the young requires the lacteal nourishment.
   7. The age at which the animal attains its full size.
   In respect to the second point : as the female Echidna with the young,
described in the present paper, was captured on the 12th of August, she
might be impregnated at the latter end of June or in July.                          Females
therefore, killed in the last week of July and the first week in August, in
the province of Victoria, would             be most   likely to afford the capital facts
noted under        the   "fourth"      head, viz. the impregnated          ovum in utero,
  * In   observations   and illustrations of the development    of the brain in Marsupialia
(Phil. Trans.  1834), it is shown that, in the Kangaroo, some time after birth the chief
and largest part of the brain is the mesencephalon,      that the cerebellum is not more ad
vanced than it is in Batrachian Reptiles, and that the cerebral hemispheres are even less
developed : amongst the figures illustrative of this stage of formation of the marsupia1
brain is one of a dissection of the rudimental hemisphere, showing the
                                                                             large and simple

showing    some  stage  of embryonal development in the spring terrestrial
Monotreme. As to the hairy and aquatic Ornithorhynehus, the impreg
nated females in which ova were found in the uterus, of small size, and
prior to the formation of the embryo, were caught on the 6th and 7th of
October.     Young Ornithorhynchi, measuring in length in a straight line
1 inch and -|ths, were found in the nest on the 8th of December.        The
period of impregnation, therefore, in this species, in the locality of the
Murrumbidgee River, is probably the latter end of September or beginning
of October. Females captured in the latter half of October and in the
month of November, would be most likely to have ova in utero, exhibiting
stages of embryonal development.
   The author concludes by quoting a letter informing him that an Orni
thorhynehus in captivity had laid two eggs, with a soft unvascular cover
ing, each about the size of a Crow's egg.        They were destroyed without
examination.     Had they been preserved in spirits or opened on the spot,
the inference of the ovo-viviparous character of the animal might have
been confirmed or otherwise.     According to the Report, these alleged eggs
must    have resembled those of the Viper.       Now the young Viper is pro
vided with a specially and temporarily developed premaxilkry tooth, for
lacerating the soft, but tough, shell of its egg, and so liberating itself.
From this analogy, the author conceives that the young Monotremes may
be provided with a horny or epidermal process or spine upon the inter-
narial tubercle for the same purpose. This temporary tubercle is obviously
homologous with the hard knob on the upper mandible of chelonians and
birds, by which they break their way through the harder calcareous covering
of their externally hatched embryo.
   The paper was illustrated by drawings of the female Echidna, of her mar
supial pouches and young, of the mammary glands, and of the female organs
of generation.

much as possible avoided in both cases, and the observations being confined

paring   the  differences of insolation  in different parts of India and in different
seasons, he is led to regard insolation as dependent greatly on relative
humidity. Thus, generally speaking, it is greater on the seaboard than in
the interior of India.       At individual stations, the maxima of insolation
occur on days of great relative moisture, i. e. on days in the rainy season
when the clouds are temporarily broken, or in the months immediately
following the rainy season, when the atmosphere is still very humid. Cal
cutta and Columbo are taken as types of a sea-climate, Konagheri and
Bellori as types of an interior or very dry climate.           In the one type the
relative humidity is from 88 to 93, the insolation 50° ; whilst in the other
type the relative humidity is from 60 to 65, and the insolation from 8°
to 11°.     Still more striking results are obtained by comparing the moun
tain climates of Sikkim and Ladak, nearly at similar absolute altitudes.           At
Ladak the relative humidity is about 30, and the insolation about 1 8° ;
whilst in Sikkim the relative humidity is estimated at from 81 to 84,
and the insolation from 60° to 75°.          The contrasts in these comparisons
are very great, and, with other examples, which are cited, appear to sub
stantiate a connexion between the presence of aqueous vapour in its
transparent state, and insolation as measured by the differences of ther
mometers in the sun and shade.          The connexion is shown to be in perfect
harmony with the results obtained by Professor Tyndall, and is explained
by considering simultaneously the gain of heat which the thermometer
experiences by direct radiation from the sun, and its loss of heat by ra
diation to the surrounding air. The opacity of the air for the invisible
heat radiating from the thermometer rapidly increases with the amount of
vapour of water which the air contains, while its transparency for the heat
directly radiated from the sun is comparatively little affected.         Thus when
the air is highly charged with moisture, free radiation from the thermo
meter is much impeded; or rather, what the thermometer loses by radiation
into the air is in some measure restored bv radiation back again from
the air.

   Next to these, in point of growth, is a young Freckled Emu (Drommus
irroratus, Scl.) ; this wanted one week of the full period.
   The young of the Nandu (Rhea) were all ready for hatching, but died
in the process : these chicks had the long-billed kind (R. macrorhyncha, Scl.)
for their sire, but their dam was of the ordinary kind, viz. 72. americana.
Dr. Bennett's beautiful Cassowaries, the "Mooruks," have yielded two
ripe pulli ; these were both hatched alive at the Society's Gardens.     The
author has been able to give the condition of the Emu's .skull at six weeks
oh\ also at two months, at half a year, and likewise in the adult state.
   The skull of the adult Dinornis is also described ; and the so-called
Dinornis casuarinus is shown to be a gigantic Porphyrine Rail.

  The Tinamous (Tinamus robustus and T. variegatns) were both old birds ;
but their skulls are rich in persistent sutures, and in bones which, although
common amongst the cold-blooded classes, are rare enough amongst birds.
Moreover naturalists have misplaced the Tinamous, by putting them with
the   "   Gallinaceae."
   In thispaper the bones formed in membrane merely, and those formed
by the metamorphosis of true or hyaline cartilage are carefully distin
guished ; moreover the relation of the parts is displayed by sections
made in various directions.
   The figures are nearly all magnified, and they are coloured in a map
like manner, so as to display, by an exaggeration of the natural tints, the
histological condition of the various parts of the skull and face at each stage.

    This paper contains a reduction and discussion of all the observations of
deviation and of horizontal and vertical force made in the armour-plated
ships of the Royal Navy, and also in certain iron-built ships of the Royal
Navy and of the mercantile marine.          It may be considered as a continua
tion of a paper on the Deviation of the Compass in iron-built ships of the
Royal Navy, by Staff Commander Evans, published in the Phil. Trans,
for 1860, p. 337.
    The reduction gives the numerical        values of the several parts of the

 deviation, viz. the "constant,"     the "semicircular,"      and the "quadrantal"
of X, or the proportion of the mean force to north on board to the force to
north on shore —of ft, the proportion of the vertical force on board to that
on shore, of   \ the heeling    coefficient to windward     ; also of the several con
stituent parts of these coefficients.
   The following are the principal conclusions derived from these values
   The introduction of armour plating, and the great increase in the amount
and thickness of iron used in the construction of modern ships of war,
have greatly increased the amount of the deviations previously considered,
and have given importance to two sources of error not previously consi
dered, viz. the diminution of the directive force, and the heeling error. To
determine these, observations of horizontal and vertical force are necessary,
and they are now part of the regular series of observations made by the
Superintendent of the Compass Department in the iron-built ships of the
 Royal Navy.
    For the formulae by which the reductions              are  made, and which are
derived from Poisson's General Equations,          reference is made to the ' Ad
miralty Manual for ascertaining and applying the deviations of the com
pass caused by the iron in a ship,' 2nd edition, London, 1863, edited by
the authors.      This work has been translated into French by M. Daron-
deau, into Russian by Captain Belavenetz, of the Russian Navy, and into
 German by Dr. Schaub, the Director of the Hydrographical Department
of the Austrian Navy.
   The observations confirm the conclusion formerly obtained, that the
semicircular deviation in an iron-built ship is chiefly due to the attraction
of the north point of the compass to the part of the ship which was south
in building, modified in armour-plated ships by the direction of the ship
while being plated.
   The observations also show the rapid changes which take place in the
semicircular   deviation soon after launching, and the considerable changes
which take place for about       a year afterwards, and the great permanence of
the semicircular    deviation after that time.
   Observations    are yet wanting from     which the separation of the principal
part of the semicircular deviation B into its two constituents can be derived
with much certainty.       The following can only be looked on as approximate.

   In  the iron-built armour-plated ships the quadrantal deviation becomes
very large, very much exceeding what has been found in other ships. This,
however, is not to be attributed in all cases to the armour-plating, as is
shown by the small values of the quadrantal deviation in the wood-built
armour-plated ships ; and theory as well as observation shows that, in the
case   of   a compass   in   a central position, the armour-plating                             rather tends to
diminish the quadrantal deviation.  The different amount in the different
ships  is completely accounted for by the position of the bulkheads and
armour-plating, rifle-towers, &c.

ing relatively to the  compass is such as to increase the quadrantal devia

the diminution of the directive  force, is the constant and regular diminu
tion of both effects with the lapse of time, showing apparently a change
in the molecular structure of the iron, by which it becomes less susceptible
of induced magnetism.     This change has not yet been connected with any
observations on the strength of the iron.
   The amount of heeling error in these ships is very considerable, averag
ing about 1° for every degree of heel. In those which have been built
head north it is greater.   Thus in the ' Warrior,' which was built head
north, it is at the standard compass aft 1° 49' for every degree of heel.
This error maybe corrected by           means   of       a vertical magnet.          In the wood-
built armour-plated  ships, from the armour-plating causing the vertical
force to act upwards, the heeling error is very small, and generally to
leeward. Thus it    for each degree of heel for the standard compass, in the

  The separation of the constituent parts of the various coefficients    not                 is
only of great  scientific interest, as giving  the causes of  the  different
amounts of these parts in different ships, but some of these quantities are
so nearly the same in ships of the same class, that when   sufficient num        a
ber have been observed, we are able,            by
                                        means of observations of deviation
and horizontal      and vertical force, made without swinging     ship, and even a
when she     is   on the stocks  or in dock, to construct by anticipation   table          a
of deviations and of the heeling error. This method was applied in certain
of the cases given in the Tables when there was not an opportunity of
swinging the ship.    This method may be expected to be of much use
when the selection of   place for the standard compass comes to be consi
                             a
dered part of the duty of the naval constructor.
  The second part of the paper treats of the effect on the compass of
masses of iron of various shapes, bearing some analogy to shapes for

118               Messrs. Evans and Smith on          the Magnetic          [Mar. 16,
which the problem           of the distribution    of induced    magnetism can be
exactly solved.        It is known that when a uniform mass of iron is magnet
ized by    induction     in a uniform field of force, the effect of the whole mag
netism induced throughout the mass is precisely the same as that of a
certain distribution of free magnetism on the surface (including, in the case
of a hollow shell, a distribution on the inner surface), the amount and law
of this distribution depending on a coefficient «;, which is zero for non
magnetic bodies, and infinite for a body infinitely susceptible of induction.
Very few observations of the value of this coefficient have been made.
The only observations of which the authors are aware, made for this spe
cial purpose, are those by Weber (Getting. Trans, vol. vi. p. 20), Thalen
(Nov. Act. Soc. Reg. Upsal. 1861), and by the authors.                Weber finds for
hard steel k=4-934, for soft steel ».-= 5 *6I, for soft iron k=36.             Thalen
finds for soft iron k varying from 27*24 to 44*23, the mean being 36*75.
The authors find, for a rod of iron probably not very different from the
iron used in the construction of iron ships, ». = 12 when the iron is not
 struck between reversals, but when hammered sharply it rose to up
wards of 80.         The effect of rods or plates magnetized longitudinally is
 nearly proportional to k ; but when a mass is magnetized at right angles to
its surface the case is very different, and the free magnetism is almost in
 dependent of k. Thus in the case of a plate magnetized at right angles to
 its surface, in the case of a sphere, and in the case of a cylinder magnetized
 at  right angles to its axis, the free magnetism is proportional        to
                                 »     -
                .  ,  .   »    .   .      and   -.  ,  o   respectively,
 which    are so nearly      independent of the value of k, that the effect of a
 sphere of the hardest steel magnetized by induction is within 4 per cent,
 of the effect of a similar sphere of the softest iron, and the effect of the
 latter within 1 per cent. of what it would be if the iron were infinitely
 susceptible   of induction.        Ilence the magnetism of thin masses of iron
 depends very much on the quality, and also on whether the iron is ham
 mered or not.       The magnetism of thick masses of iron is almost wholly
 independent of these circumstances.
     One of the most interesting applications of the formulae is the compa
 rative effects of solid and hollow spheres, and bodies of analogous shapes.
     The proportion of the effect of a solid sphere to that of a spherical
                                                                                3
  shell of thickness t (in terms of the radius of the sphere) is as t-\             : t.
                                                                               8lTK
     In the case of soft iron this is about
  so  that when the thickness of the iron considerably exceeds                  of the
 radius of the sphere, the effect of the spherical shell is sensibly the same
  as that of a solid sphere of the same external diameter. Mr. Barlow found

1865.]                  Character of Armour- Plated Ships.                      119
that when     t=jhs'    *ne above *proportion was as    3:2, which     gives for k a
value   =35, agreeing closely with the values found by Weber and Thalen.
In the   case  of iron of the quality experimented on by the authors, this ratio
would    be
    Hence in the case of a tank -l-'^th of an inch thick and 4 feet in diameter,
t would be about -g-jhr. and the effect about          that of a solid mass of iron
of the same size. These results, which, however, are not new, as they are
involved in Poisson's paper of 1824, explain the mistakes into which various
magneticians have fallen as to the magnetism residing entirely on the sur
face, and as to the effect of a body such as a tank depending on its sur
 face, not on its mass.
    The   same formulae show that to correct a quadrantal        deviation of 6° 10'
by two cannon-balls placed one on each side of the compass, the distance
 of the centre of each ball from the centre of the compass should be three
 radii of the balls.      If the distance is greater or less, the quadrantal devi
 ation corrected will vary inversely as the cube of the distance.
    The investigation also shows that the effect of a sphere of iron, if its
 centre be within the cone of 54° 45', will be prejudicial both by diminishing
 the   directive   force, and by increasing the heeling error to windward.
 1When without that cone it will be beneficial in both respects.           Hence, as
 far as possible, no iron should be within this cone.
    Masses of iron which may be compared to a sphere, and near the level
 of the compass, but in the fore or aft quadrant, are beneficial in increasing
 the directive force, but prejudicial in increasing the quadrantal deviation.
 If they are on the port or starboard quadrant, they are doubly beneficial,
 by increasing the directive force and diminishing the deviation.
    Bodies    which may      be compared    to infinite vertical cylinders,  such as
 iron masts placed before or abaft the compass,        are prejudicial by increasing
 the quadrantal      deviation, and they do not increase the directive force.

                                        (Abstract.)
      This paper commences with the " Theory of the Sun," embracing the
  subjects of the source of its energies, and the synthesis of ponderable
 matter.      The position, powers, and functions of the Sun, as the physical
  centre of the solar system, are peculiar, and in fact unique.              The " Pri
                      " from them, indicating, in the author's opinion, "the
 mary Induction
  principle of philosophical investigation" which should be applied to the
 Sun, is conceived to be
                               " That they imply a corresponding uniqueness and
 peculiarity in its constitution, characterizing also the nature as well as the
 disposition of the substances of which it essentially consists.                 But the
 particular density of the Sun indicates that it actually consists both of
 ponderable and imponderable matter.             The nature of the former as con
 stituting apparently its relatively exterior regions [is] believed to be made
 known in part by Professor Kirchhoff's researches in Prismatic Chemistry
 applied to the Sun, as showing that some of the elementary substances of
 the Earth exist also in the Sun" *.
     The first obvious verification of this primary induction is presented by
 the " form of the Sun, which according to the observation of the equality
 of its diameters, is that of a perfect sphere, a form which is unique in the
 solar system, and is probably unknown in Terrestrial Nature"*.
     The cardinal peculiarity of the Sun, that in which it is unique in the
 highest sense, is that its radiation exclusively possesses the property of
 imparting to (inorganic) matter a fit condition for the manifestation of
 (organic) life ; that it is, humanly speaking, infinite in amount, and also the
 source of all the heat and light, and consequently of all their derivative or
 correlate forces which are active in the solar system.              The illustration of
the temperature and expenditure of heat of the Sun founded by Sir John
 F. W. Herschel upon his own experiments and those of M. Pouillet, with
Mr. 1Waterston's experimental result that the potential temperature of an
infinitesimal     area of the Sun's radiating surface is nearly thirteen millions
of    degrees  of   Fahrenheit's thermometer, are cited as being in fact nothing
more than philosophical confessions that no proportion whatever can be
established between any expression for the solar energies and the obvious
reality of their incalculable amount.
     The author proceeds to inquire what we may reasonably conceive to                be

the intimate nature of matter in its highest and most elementary character,
such as that essential to the Sun is in this paper inferred to be, agreeably
to the principle of philosophical investigation he has suggested as being
alone applicable to the Sun, and according to known facts and recognized
principles of science. The answer to this question is afforded, he conceives,
by modern views of the constitution of gaseous substances as forms of
ponderable matter, and of that of the luminiferous ether as an imponder
able body.    It is deduced from the former, combined with the investiga
tions of philosophers during the last half century, including those of the
late Dr. Thomas Young and M. Cauchy, and of M. Neumann and Profes
sor Stokes, that the ether is characterized by enormous molecular activity,
rendering it immensely rarer but at the same time more truly solid and
clastic than any kind of ordinary or ponderable matter, all forms of which
it pervades, even the most dense, coexisting with them in the same space.
   The author infers that the substances peculiar to the Sun transcend the
ether in these qualities in even a greater degree than that excels ponder
able matter with respect to them — that            is,
                                                  succinctly, that pure solar mat
teris   still more transcendently and intensely solid and elastic because its
particles are in still more transcendent activity. This inference             con  is
sidered to harmonize with the obvious peculiarity of the Sun, that in                    it
alone, of all the bodies and localities of the solar system, enormous force
of gravity and an immeasurable intensity of heat are united.
   In the recorded facts of telescopic observation, the author finds an
" entire absence of evidence or indication that anything exists in the sen
sible universe which       of greater antiquity than the stars, or prior to them
                           is
in its origin;" which, "considered together with the primary induction
from the uniqueness and peculiarity of their position and functions as
suns,"   is  regarded as tending strongly
                                             " to prove that, as class, the stars
                                                                       a
are the most ancient objects in the Creation, and also (each in its own
sphere of action) the origins of the series of physical agencies and pro
cesses by which the planets and other classes of heavenly bodies were
finally produced and are maintained"*.
   This being admitted,         follows that the original production of ponder
                                it
able matter takes place       in  the stars, and in our Sun as one of them, —            a
conception to which the author had been led by the preceding and other
considerations long before the application of prismatic chemistry to the
Sun.

origin of ponderable or ordinary matter, the absolute synthesis of which
from its imponderable elements is thus believed to take place in the Sun.
    It will follow that the distribution of heat in the Sun, as already in
ferred by the author*, is from within to without, in the order of decreas
ing intensity — an inference which he conceives to be not contradicted, but
supported, by the apparently inferior calorific and luminous condition of
the Sun's nucleus, as disclosed in the true nuclei or inner umbrae of the
spots, compared to that of every other visible part of the Sun, and espe
cially of the photosphere, because the exterior regions of the Sun are com
posed entirely of that order of matter
                                        — ponderable matter, such as that of
which the planets consist — which is alone capable of communicating to the
ether of space those vibrations which we know as heat and light.
    The "Cause and Nature of the Phenomena termed the Solar Spots"
are next considered.    The energy arising from the transition of imponder
able into ponderable   matter, will in part become the centrifugal or projec
tile force by which the torrents of matter (finally assuming the gaseous
form) so produced are impelled through the denser envelopes of the Sun,
causing the spots and the other phenomena of ebullition of which the pho
tosphere is the scene.
   The rotation of the Sun acting upon these torrents issuing radially from
its interior regions — and probably from the surface of the solar globe dis
closed in the true nuclei of the spots, or somewhat within that — by in
flecting them towards the Sun's equator as they rise, occasions the actual
distribution of the spots which are their outhursts on the surface of the
photosphere, in lines and belts parallel to the equator, their restriction in
latitude to within a certain distance of             it,
                                                   and their absence, together
with   that of  the facula,  both   in the  equatorial and the polar regions
of the Sun.        would seem that the originally uniform evolution of aeri

form matter from the entire surface of the interior globe, ou being swept
towards the equator from each pole,        broken up into torrents by the same

general cause, and         by
                        the resulting inequalities of temperature, density, and
consequent   resistance in the surrounding and incumbent mediums.           The
region of equatorial calm, or freedom from spots and faculte,        the result
                                                                            is
of the meeting and mutual opposition of the systems of currents which
the Sun's rotation causes to proceed from either pole, the torrents being
carried back in each hemisphere by movements of the nature of circular
waves  of translation seemingly affecting all the envelopes of the Sun, and
setting from the plane of junction at the equator towards the tropics.
   The entire assemblage of actions now under consideration appears to be
closely analogous to that exhibited by    liquid boiling violently and inces

the Sun, torrents more or less permanent, consisting either of bubbles or of
an unbroken stream of aeriform matter, are also formed by the operation of
the controlling mechanical cause to which, acting in the second place, the
entire system of phenomena presented by the spots is here attributed.
These torrents are continuously maintained from near the surface of origin
on the glowing sphere within to that of the photosphere without, whether
in single or in groups of separate but probably often confluent streams,
elevating the photosphere into faculae by the force of expansion with which
they burst upon       it,
                     and, being transparent, permitting the interior envelopes
and the incandescent nucleus to be seen through them.

                                                        the heat-action    the           in
inferior liquid mediums and photosphere, combined with those due to the
 sun's rotation, carry along with them the torrents and their bursting sum
 mits in the drifting motion observed by Mr. Carrington to affect the spots.
 The phenomena of the spots generally, especially as described      that astro      by

 charged in the ebullition of the photosphere above considered, partly remain
 upon the Sun, constituting its atmospheres*, but are principally aggregated
 into masses of immense magnitude (terrestrially speaking) of the nature of
 bubbles, which, having undergone      certain amount of condensation, first

 to us the existence of the zodiacal light, being, in fact, the matter separated
 from the Sun's equator as explained above.      These particles, termed by the

  are finally precipitated upon the Earth (and doubtless upon the other
  planets) in the form of Meteorites.

   The sudden outhurst of light over a solar spot witnessed on September 1,
1859, by Mr. Carrington and Mr. Hodgson, the author regards as a fact
confirmatory of these views, and as having been the consequence or accom
paniment of the production, and the transfer with immense rapidity from
within to without some exterior region of the Sun, of a meteoritic mass, or
more probably of an immense congeries of such masses, enabled, by its
consisting of ponderable        matter, to manifest the higher temperature and
consequent greater        effulgence of the interior regions of the luminary,
whence it was originally derived.         Certain phenomena before recorded by
astronomers but not yet understood are probably of the same nature.
   The structural characters of meteorites are those of bodies which have
been    originally condensed from heterogeneous vapours — the mingled
vapours of uncombined elementary substances variable in their nature and
requiring different temperatures for their maintenance in the gaseous form,
but all existing originally at a very high temperature ; and their adequate
investigation may afford, as an experimenlum cruris, an independent confir
mation of Kirchhoff's discovery, and of the truth of the spectrum-analysis
of the composition of bodies distant from us in space. They consist, mine-
ralogically, of two groups, meteoric iron and meteoric stones, forming,
however, by graduation into each other, as first pointed out by the author,
many years since, one series of bodies*.          The intermediate examples, and
indeed most of the stones, are aggregates of earthy matter partly in the
crystalline and partly (as Mr. H. C. Sorby has shownf) in the vitreous
state, and distinct portions of metallic iron alloyed with other metals.
They are, in fact, always heterogeneous aggregates, in conformity with the
origin here assigned to them.          While as a class meteorites are perfectly-
distinct from all terrestrial rocks — the presence of metallic iron as a mine
ral constituent imparting to them indeed a character which is perfectly
unique — some of their constituent minerals, and all the elementary sub
stances of which they are composed are such as are found, but differently
associated, in the Earth's crust, although there are many other terrestrial
elements which have not yet been discovered in them.
    " Ten, or perhaps more, of the elements of the solar atmosphere,"
according to Kirchhoff and Angstrom, " are also those of meteorites — iron,
nickel, cobalt, chromium, and magnesium being characteristically                    such.
But the non-metallic base silicon, which, in union with oxygen as silica, is
an abundant    and equally characteristic element of meteorites, is absent in
the Sun, according to our present knowledge, in which also other elements
of meteorites, including oxygen itself, are not known to be present "%. It
cannot be doubted, however, that by the further prosecution of spectrum-
analysis other elements will be discovered in the Sun.            It must be remem
bered also that our knowledge of meteorites is confined to a few only of

 those which have fallen upon the Earth, and that during a very small space
 of time, physically speaking, not exceeding a few thousand years, or
 perhaps even not many centuries ; while the synthesis of ponderable matter
 in the Sun may reasonably be supposed to vary from time to time as to the
 particular chemical elements produced.        A remarkable and instructive fact,
 in the actual condition of science on this subject, is that the metal iron is
 now known to be an abundant and characteristic element of the Sun, of
 Meteorites, and of the Earth.
    In harmony with these views on the origin of Meteorites is a recorded
 but perhaps hitherto unpublished opinion of Sir H. Davy, that they origi
 nally consist of the metallic and other combustible bases of the earths and
 alkalies of which Meteoric Stones are principally composed.        But whether
 the oxidation of these bases is effected in the Earth's atmosphere, as he also
 suggested, or whether in some cases, though not in all, oxygen is present in
 the original assemblage of elementary vapours, and combines with certain
 bases and with portions of others, as the condensation proceeds, is a diffi
 cult question.    The latter theory may be thought to agree better with the
 entire series of phenomena presented by Meteors, and with the constitution
 of Meteorites as a peculiar class of mineral aggregates ; but some facts rela
 ting to either branch of the subject tend to support the former.          Both
 may be true to a certain extent.      The facts, however, that scarcely any
 oxidation of the iron Meteorites has taken place, and that there are
 no meteorites which consist principally of oxide of iron, while there are
 some in which metallic iron and earthy matter (oxides) are present in nearly
 equal proportions, but that even in these no excess of oxide of iron occurs,
 are opposed to the supposition    that meteorites have derived any conside
 rable part of their oxygen from the atmosphere ; with which also the exist
 ence of sulphide of calcium in certain meteorites is inconsistent.
    In what part of Space between the Zodiacal Light and the Earth the final
condensation    takes place is not at present determinable.      It would seem
that these masses must retain much of their original heat and therefore to
a great   extent an aeriform   or vaporous condition (though one of greater
density than that in which they left the Sun or even the Zodiacal Light, and
mingled with liquid or solid matter as just suggested) in the interplanetary
spaces where     the ether alone exists, and that their entire conversion info
a liquid and finally a solid form may not occur until their arrival in a region
of positive cold in the vicinity of the Earth or other planets.      Mr. Sorby
has lately inferred from the equable manner in which mineral ingredients
greatly differing in specific gravity as well as fusibility are mingled in
meteorites, that their formation must have taken place in some physical
                                                     "
locality where the force of gravitation is small ; that they come either from
the outside of a very small planet, much less than the moon, or else from
the interior of a larger planet, since broken up" *. The first inference is in
perfect accordance with the theory of Meteorites announced in this paper ;
for it is evident that the force of gravity in the original meteoritic masses

must be very small, quite inadequate to interfere with the disposition
within them, and among one another, of their proximate elements, however
discordant in fusibility or specific gravity. It will follow, also, that the
final condensation of these vaporous masses                  cannot take place either very
near the Sun or very near the Earth.
   According to observations of the author already published*, the iron
meteorites, if not certain single Meteoric Stones (and most probably also
the entire nucleus, which in some cases is broken up and falls as a shower
of Meteorites), have the form (resembling that of the Meteors themselves,
which is nearly that of a flame) of the solid of least resistance, or of one
derived from     and received in fact from the resistance of medium they
                       it,                                                    a

other also, truncated to variable extent.
                                      a     This would seem to prove that
they must once have been — as individual masses, and not merely as portions
of body of which they originally formed part, nor as to their pre-existing
  a
materials only — in  fluid or mobile condition.
                                 a               These and other significant
circumstances are adduced in the paper as tending to the discrimination of
the physical changes                 by
                        which meteoritic masses are affected prior to their
entering the Earth's atmosphere, from those which they afterwards undergo
within    and from its action, — the conclusion arrived at being that the solid

these views, though, with respect to the former, in a very different manner
from that hitherto accepted.
     The long-continued   study of Meteorites and of the phenomena which
attend their fall, affected  by the consideration of the probable synthesis of
ponderable matter in the Sun, and — since the conclusions of Kirchhoff have
been announced — the special study of Solar Physics and Chemistry in con
nexion with both subjects, appear to the author to justify him in entertain
ing the hope that he may thus have succeeded — by means, partly, of a
new deductive         cosmical hypothesis       for verification, and partly
                                            submitted
by uniting, and in some cases newly interpreting, preceding inductions on
particular points of their physical history — in effecting at least the ap
proximate   solution of the problem of the Origin and Formation of
Meteorites, which has been sought by philosophers from the time of the
communication          to  Royal Society, now sixty-three years since, of
                            the
Edward Howard's paper, demonstrating their peculiar nature and establish
ing the reality of their fall *.
   The succeeding section of the paper is headed " Original Formation of
the Planets : Origin of the Primitive Heat of the Earth, causes of its
Permanence       and Invariability ; the Earth not a cooling body."    In this
it   is represented that the results of modern science conspire to prove that
we must look to causes now in operation as those which have produced the
planets.         If
             — as first evinced by Mr. G. Poulett Scrope, with respect chiefly
to volcanic and plutonic action, and secondly, but from a wider induction
by Sir C. Lyell — they are sufficient to account for the phenomena of its
surface and crust, as made known by Geology, it follows, by parity of rea
soning, that they will be sufficient to account also for its original production.
The only known phenomenon in which the process of the formation of the
Earth as a planet is actually observed, is that of the fall of Meteorites upon
it, by which its magnitude     augmented, and that by the addition of mate
                                      is
rials homogeneous with those of its existing elementary constitution, being
chiefly those chemical elements which are present in the greatest quantity
in  the Earth's crust, and seem to be most essential to its constitution. The
characteristic presence of iron in both has been already adverted to.      Ac
cording to the principle of the adequacy of Existing Causes, therefore, we
must conclude that the fall of Meteorites         continuation or
                                                    is   a           residue of

the process of formation of our planet, and that the Earth was originally
produced by the aggregation and coalescence of Meteorites, or of greater
masses into which they had previously coalesced.
   Agreeably to the law of the Conservation of Energy and to the dynamical
theory of heat, the enormous original velocity of the Meteorites being dimi
 nished by their collision and coalescence, great part of the mechanical force
of their motion would be reconverted into heat, and become eventually
the " primitive
                 " internal heat of the Earth, for which     would appear that

   It is next shown in the paper in what manner a nucleus of hypogene
rocks or plutonic granite supplying the materials for the subsequent depo
sition of sedimentary strata, and also the chemical elements of organic
beings, would be one of the final results of the Earth's formation by the
coalescence of meteoritic masses.  The chemical action of its primitive and
central heat, governed by the solar radiation upon the exterior of the new
planet, would initiate the cycle of correlate activities by which its perma
nence would be secured.      In addition to thus assigning a natural and
adequate cause for the secular invariability of the Earth's internal heat,
sometimes assumed as an axiom in geological speculations without being
accounted for, these suggestions may evince that, on the other hand, it is
unnecessary to regard the Earth as a cooling body.
  Admitting the Earth to have been formed as here suggested, such also
must have been the process of formation of the other Planets.

According to the physicists              of the Mayerian school, the activities                  of

phenomena they present are regarded as supporting the conclusion that
their peculiar relations and community of character are not, as hitherto
supposed, effects of their having formerly constituted one heavenly body
which has been reduced to fragments, but of their being bodies intrin
sically of the same nature, meteoritic masses in fact, in an advanced in
termediate     state    between the       condition      of meteorites and that of true
planets, in process of gradual convergence towards each                     other, prepara
tory to their coalescence into one greater planet.

to be transferred with great velocity to the interplanetary spaces.

Part of the Proceedings of the Royal Society (No. 72), the author quotes
the definitions of those structures given as zoological characters by me in
a brief summary of the primary divisions of the class Mammalia, commu
nicated to the Linnean Society in 1857.
   The remarks on the signification and homology of those structures in my
anatomical  publications are not given,              I
                                        am consequently misrepresented.
Errors are imputed to me which the author deems it important to rectify
before the Royal Society ; and as the Proceedings of the Society will carry
this imputation far and wide through the world of science,      venture to           I
hope that the present defence will not be deemed uncalled for, but may be
permitted to have place in the Serial which has diffused the attack.
    In this I
           am moved, less on personal grounds, than in the interest of
science and of scientific ethics ; for of late a practice has arisen of repre
senting a zoological definition of a part which an anatomist may have given
in a classificatory work, as the exponent of his homological knowledge and
descriptions of such part, in its various modifications and grades of deve
lopment. Cuvier, for example, in his characters of the order Bimana, affirms
that Man is the only animal possessing ' hands and • feet : — " L'homme

  other homological writings of the author criticised, where such philosophical

  Cuvicr.           Those which I have cited might be met by as flat contradictions :
                    that, '' The ' hind hands

  much show of original research, the homology of the ' astragalus,' ' calca-

  covery that a hand and foot are all one.
       It    is true that      if  the homological descriptions in the ' Lecons d' Ana

         '

 to have had previous possession of the homological knowledge. Nay more,
 in the "Cinquieme Le^on, Articles VII.-IX. ' Des os du pied'" *, the
 frame of the hind feet of Man, Ape, Lion, Seal, Elephant, &c. is shown to
 consist of homologous bones.                    Nevertheless the great Zootomist, in his

in representing the homological knowledge and opinions of the author by

 Part No. 72 of the Proceedings of the Royal Society.           In  this ' Abstract  '
 I  find that, to previous knowledge, and especially my own as represented
 by the citation of a cerebral character from my Zoological Essay, given at
 p. 71, Mr. Flower proposes to add, as discoveries of his own, and by way
 of correction of alleged errors of mine, that the corpus callosum does
 exist in the Marsupialia and Monotremata ; that the transverse fibres con
 necting the hippocampi are not parts of the fornix,
                                                           " which is

                            (p. 73).
     After these pretensions, put forward by a Fellow of the Royal Society
 in opposition and assumed superiority to a previous labourer in the field, it
 would naturally be taken for granted that the statements and opinions of
 the author assailed had been fairly and fully quoted.       It might be long be
 fore any   one  would   deem  it necessary to test the grounds of dispute by re
 ference to Prof. Owen's anatomical writings on the subject.             I therefore
 beg to leave to quote from those writings the following passages.
     With regard to the Marsupialia, 1 state, " This commissure             [viz. the
 commissure      of the hippocampi] may nevertheless be regarded as repre
 senting,   besides  the fornix, the rudimental commencement of the corpus
 callosum." (Phil. Trans. 1837, p. 91.)
     In a subsequent anatomical Monograph I wrote, in 18-10, "The es
 sential function of the fornix, as a longitudinal commissure, uniting the
 hippocampus major with the olfactory lobe of the same hemisphere, is more
 exclusively maintained in the Ornithorhynchus, in consequence of the
 smaller size of the transverse band of fibres uniting the opposite hippo
campi, and representing the first rudiment of the corpus callosum, as it ap
pears in the development of the placental embryo." Art. Monotremata,
Cycl. of Anat. and Physiol., vol. hi. p. 383, 1841.)
    In reference to other connexions of the opposite hemispheres I state,
 " The anterior commissure is very large in the Monotremes, as in the Mar
supials" (ib. p. 383); and that "it is the principal commissure of the
hemispheres, is subcylindrical, and measured, in the brain of a Platypus,
two lines thick vertically, and one and ahalf lines horizontally" (i6.p. 385).
    With regard to the inner wall of the cerebral hemisphere, I describe
" the fissure upon which the hippocampus is folded " in the
                                                                         Marsupial
brain. (Phil. Trans. 1837, p. 90.)
    I  regret to be compelled to show by the foregoing quotations the sources
whence Mr. Flower has derived, or might have derived, the ideas that
the essential nature of the fornix, as contradistinguished        from its anthro-
potomical definition, is that
                                    " of a longitudinal commissure," that the
transverse fibres which connect together the two hippocampi, and form
part of the wall of the lateral ventricle, may be regarded as the homologue
of part, at least, of the corpus callosum, and that the absence of the main

  132                       Prof. Owen on Zoological Names                    [Mar. 23,
 part of the great commissure of Placentalia is compensated in the Impla-
 centalia by the presence of a large " anterior commissure."
      Having no one's shortcomings to exaggerate, I did not, indeed, in the
 above cited works        attribute to this commissure an "immense"           size *, but
 preferred, finding it measurable, to give its dimensions, in the Ornitho-
 rhynchus, e.g., and to show, as in fig. 1, g, Plate VII. Phil. Trans. 1857,
 its large proportional size in the Opossum's brain.
      I nowhere assert that the mesial wall of the lateral ventricle ('septum
                      of Mr. Flower) is disconnected with what I affirm to be the
                    '
 ventriculorum
 beginning of the corpus callosum ; on the contrary, both in my original
 paper in Phil. Trans. 1837, and in the art. Marsupialia, I describe that
                       '
 wall or ' septum to be in part composed by or continued from the superior
 and internal border of the hippocampal fibres, " forming, in the Wombat,
 a thin lamina analogous         f to the septum lucidum," and, " in the Kangaroo,
 a stronger and thicker one."
      So far as I can comprehend Mr. Flower's account of "the upper and
 anterior part of the transverse band which passes between the hemispheres
 of the marsupial brain and radiates out in a delicate lamina above the an
 terior part of the lateral ventricle," he and I are recording observations of
 similar facts.       Only, inasmuch as the fibres which radiate from the hippo
 campal      commissure    to form a delicate lamina above the anterior part of the
lateral ventricle, contribute, according to my observations, to constitute part
of the wall of such ventricle, and, indeed, a greater proportion thereof than
its mere anterior part,        I should not describe them as being, or as passing,
 " between      the hemispheres."
     The question that remains is the        one  of interpretation,  whether, viz., in
reference to the placental condition of the great transverse commissure, and
to its relation to the " septum ventriculorum," any portion of the fibres from
the hippocampal commissure cross from hemisphere to hemisphere above
                                                                 '
that septum, after the manner of a • corpus callosum ?
     It  is of course open to any anatomist to limit the definition of the fornix,
as suggested in my description of the brain of the Ornithorhynchus, to the
longitudinal commissural fibres of the hemispheres, and to expand the de
                                         '
finition of the ' corpus callosum to the transverse commissural fibres of the
same hemispheres.
     Accordingly, when Mr. Flower asks,           " granted   that only the psalterial
fibres are represented in the upper commissure of the Marsupial brain, why
                            '

                                                                     "
                                                                        (p. 73), having
shown that no such refusal can be imputed to me,                   I reply by another
question —
                " Granted that the chief inter-hemispheral         connecting fibres in
    *  "  The two halves of the cerebrum are by no means ' disconnected,' the want of the
upper fibres is compensated for in a remarkable manner by the immense size of the an
terior commissure." (Flower, loc. cit. p. 73.)

  should the name of corpus callosum               be refused to them ?
      " These fibres [as Mr. Flower repeats after me] are part of the great
  system of transverse fibres bringing the two hemispheres into connexion
  with each other," &c. *
      But however germane such speculations may                  be to Philosophical Ana
  tomy, they are altogether out of place in plain zoological definitions.                   In
  these, to be of use or to be       understood,    we must adopt Linnaean sharply-
  defined terms, such as 'bract,' 'spath,' 'sepal,' 'petal,' 'paw,' 'foot,'
  ' fin,' ' hand.'    If  the zoologist believes that he has found characters in the
  brain leading to an improved classification of a group, he must enunciate
  those characters in terms by which they will be understood, agreeably with
  the current and accepted anatomical definitions of the part. It may be long
  ere   either my homological notices or my successors' lead Anthropotomists
                                                 '
  to dissociate the ' psalterial fibres' or transverse commissure of .the hippo

  campi from the rest of their complex idea of a fornix,' or compel them to
  change the definition of that part of the brain.
      No amount of subtle suggestions of signification of delicate radiations of
                                                                          '
  fibres or laminae will make the ' hippocainpal commissure                 of the Wombat
                       '                      '
 equivalent to the corpus callosum              of the Beaver, in the eye of the natu
 ralist : if the essential element of his idea of a ' corpus callosum be a mass
                                                                                  '
 of transverse fibres crossing the hemispheric fissure, and he                  does not find
 them there on divaricating        the hemispheres, he will not see them elsewhere
 at anybody's      bidding.
      If a group of mammals want such commissural fibres, and another group
 possess them, the classifier will avail himself of a well-defined term expressing
 such difference, without prejudice to his reception of any homological de
 termination of the parts, or their rudiments, in anatomical works of the ap-
 plier of the term.
     Finally, I submit the following contrast. Mr. Flower represents the sum

and Monotremata, as compared with those of the Placental Mammals "
 (Proceedings of Royal Society, vol. xiv. p. 71), I trust that I may be
allowed a few words in reply.        My first impression on hearing the paper
read was a feeling of extreme surprise.             When it had become neces
sary  to give publicity   to the results of  observations which in some respects
differed from those recorded by Prof. Owen, I was most anxious, in
consequence of the natural respect which I felt for one who has
laboured so long and assiduously in the field of anatomical research, that
this should be done with the greatest possible deference to his opinions and
feelings, and with the smallest semblance of anything which could be con
strued into an
                  " attack." In this I believed that had I      succeeded.   That
Prof. Owen should have read my " Abstract " from a point of view so
different from what     I had intended, is to me a source of great regret.
    In the brief space allowed for the abstracts of papers communicated to
the Royal Society, copious and detailed references to the writings of pre
vious authors are necessarily out of place.         Where it is usual only to give
an outline of the scientific facts advanced in the paper, it would be obviously
improper to follow out the labyrinths of bygone discussions on intricate
questions of priority, of definitions, interpretations, and such like matters.
Hence most of the citations to be found in my paper, not only from the
writings of Trof. Owen, but also from numerous other authors, are omitted
in the abstract.     To Prof. Owen's complaints that I have not assigned to
him the merit of this or that particular discovery, my reply is that I did
this generally once for all in my statement that "at the outset a confirma
tion is afforded of the important fact, first observed by Prof. Owen, that
the brains of animals of the orders Marsupialia and Monotremata present
certain special and peculiar characters, by which they may be at once dis

 tinguished     from those   of other mammals,"      &c.    I  never  thought    it
 would be attributed to me that I wished it to be believed that every par
 ticular statement to which I did not attach the name of some other author
 was my own original discovery.
    Little scope as there is in an abstract for entering into the literature of
 the subject, a reference to the writings of an anatomist who has contributed
 so much to advance our knowledge in the special department treated of in
 my paper could not be altogether omitted.        I therefore found it necessary
 to give in a few words an epitome of the results of those writings. It is in
 the outline I thus gave that I am acused of serious misrepresentation.
    Prof. Owen's first direct charge is contained in the following   sentence  : —
    " It  is time that the procedure be exposed and stigmatized which con
 sists in representing the homological knowledge and opinions of an author
 by his definitions in a purely zoological work, and in suppressing all re
ference to the descriptions and statements in the anatomical writings of the
 same author, where his actual knowledge and opinions on the nature and
 homology of parts are given, and where alone they can be expected to be
 found. My present remarks refer to the published- ' Abstract ' of Mr.
 Flower's paper."
    To this I reply that my first and indeed only reference in the body of
      '            '
 my Abstract is not to any purely zoological work, but to Prof. Owen's
 original detailed anatomical paper (Phil. Trans. 1837), to which he has
 himself always referred as containing the amplest exposition of his views
 upon the subject.
    It  is next objected that, in quoting what seemed to me the pith and mar
 row of that memoir, I omitted following passage : —
    " This   commissure [viz. the commissure of the hippocampi in the Mar-
 supialia]   may   nevertheless be regarded as representing, besides the fornix,
 the rudimental commencement of the corpus callosum."
    There certainly appeared to me little necessity for the formal citation of
 a single passage like this, which, if it can be construed into a statement that
 the corpus callosum is present in the marsupial animals, is perfectly incon
 sistent with the whole of the remainder of Prof. Owen's memoir, nay
 further, is immediately contradicted by the context, the whole paragraph
 standing thus in the original.
     " Tins commissure may nevertheless be regarded as representing, besides
 the fornix, the rudimental commencement of the corpus callosum ; but this
 determination does not invalidate the fact that the great commissure which
 unites the supraventricular masses of the hemispheres in the Beaver, and
 all other placentally developed Mammalia, and which exists in addition to
 the hippocampal commissure, is wanting in the brain of the Wombat ; and as
 the same deficiency exists in the brain of the Great and Bush Kangaroos,
 the Vulpine Phalanger, the Ursine and Manges Dasyure, and the Virginian
 Opossum, it is most probably characteristic of the marsupial division of
 Mammalia."          In the same page of the memoir the following occurs : —

136                 Mr. Flower — Reply to Professor Owen's                              [Mar. 30,
" Meanwhile their agreement in             so important       a modification      of the cerebral
organ as the absence      of    a corpus callosum and septum lucidum,                   affords ad
ditional and stroug grounds for regarding the Marsupialia as a distinct and
peculiar group of mammals."        Notwithstanding this clear and definite
statement, which occurs again and again in some form or other throughout
the memoir, we are told that it is misrepresentation to quote Prof. Owen as
alleging "the absence in the marsupials of the corpus callosum." But Prof.
Owen has failed to notice that the discussion  of the homological relations
advanced in   the above cited short passage, and in similar terms in his ar
ticles in the 'Cyclopredia of Anatomy,' is by no means passed over even in
my abstract, as the paragraph commencing with the following words will
show.
     " Can    this transverse commissure, of which the relation is so disturbed
by the disposition of the inner wall of the hemisphere, be regarded as ho
mologous to the entire corpus callosum of the placental mammals ? or is it,
as has been suggested, to be looked upon as only representing the psalterial
fibres or transverse commissure                of the hippocampi?"             (Proc. Roy. Soc.
vol. xiv. p. 72.)     If, after the words          " as   has been suggested,"      I   had added
"by Prof. Owen," there would, I believe, have been nothing wanting to
complete as fair and full an exposition of that author's views as was com
patible with the limits of an abstract.
  I now regret the omission. I thought that as Prof. Owen's name oc
curred, both before and after, in connexion with the subject, and as no other
author was mentioned, it would easily be surmised that the suggestion was
his.     I   was moreover, as    I
                            stated before, especially anxious to avoid giving
a polemical appearance   to my paper by too frequent citations by name,
where it was necessary to show a divergence of opinion.
     I
    now come to the alleged misrepresentation of Prof. Owen's opinions
contained in a foot-note to my abstract, which runs as follows : —
   "In the paper by the same author [Prof. Owen] 'on the Characters,
Principles of Division, and Primary Groups of the Class Mammalia' (Proc.
Linn. Soc. 1858), the Subclass Lyencephala ('loose' or 'disconnected'
brain), equivalent to the Marsupialia and Monotremata, are characterized as
having the cerebral hemispheres but feebly and partially connected together
        '       '     '
by the fornix and anterior commissure,' while in the rest of the class a
             '                '
part called corpus callosum is added, which completes the connecting or
commissural       apparatus."        It   is now objected that      this was only intended
as   a "zoological definition" or "character."
     Not being aware that a zoological character, valid                 as such, can misrepre
sent an anatomical truth, when             I
                                   wished to find a brief epitome of Prof.
Owen's   latest views upon the nature  of the commissures of the marsupial
brain, in corroboration of the one             I
                                      had given in the text from his earliest
memoir,      I adopted   the above statement.               I adopted    it,   moreover, because
he had himself referred to    the following emphatic terms.     quote from

bourers in Zoology, at the Linnean Society in 1857, the generalized results
of such dissections, comprising a fourfold primary division of the Mam
malia based upon the four leading modifications of cerebral structure in
that class.

the connecting or ' commissure ' apparatus.

This first and lowest primary group, or subclass of Mammalia, is termed,
from its cerebral character,                    Lyencephala,             signifying the comparatively
loose or disconnected state of the cerebral hemispheres."
     I
     think that I should scarcely be blamed for putting my trust in an au
thor's own description of the " generalized results
                                                    " of his researches, deli

     I may add, moreover,
                        that the works, both English and foreign, upon
Comparative Anatomy   and  Physiology, in which the simple fact that the
marsupials and monotremes differ from the other mammalia by the absence
of  a corpus callosum or great transverse commissure to their brain is
stated upon the authority of Prof. Owen, may be said to comprehend
most of those of any importance published since the year 1837. One or
two examples will suffice.  MM. Eydoux and Laurent (Voyage de la Fa

hemispheres        are only  partially connected by the fornix and the anterior
commissure      ;   in the rest of the class the corpus callosum is added."
    I  will only cite    one other instance to show that  I  am far from being sin
gular   in  the   outline  I have  given  of the most important part of Professor
Owen's researches upon this subject.
    In the year 1851 the Copley Medal of this Society was awarded to Pro
fessor Owen.          In the epitomized account of his labours, the observations
upon the structure of the Marsupial Brain are referred to in the following
terms.       I quote from the President's Address (Proceedings of the Royal
Society, Dec. 1st, 1851): — "In the Philosophical Transactions for 1837
appeared a memoir from Professor Owen's pen, describing certain peculia
rities in the brain of the Marsupialia, especially the absence of the corpus
callosum.       The same condition he subsequently discovered in the Orni-
thorhynchus and Echidna.            This, and other peculiarities of structure in the
sanguiferous, osseous, and dental systems, led Professor Owen to suggest
a modification of the classification of the mammalia which Cuvier had
                                          '
adopted in his last edition of the Itegne Animal.' Deeming modifications
of brain of more importance than those of ungual phalanges, and connect
ing the higher development of the commissural system of the brain with
the longer sojourn of the foetus in the womb, and its more intimate union
therewith, Professor Owen, in his paper 'On the Classification of the
Marsupials' in the Trans. Zool. Soc. 1839, groups together all the
mammalia which have a placenta under any form, and which have a
 corpus callosum, in a primary subclass, under the name of Placeutalia ; the
Test form the Subclass Implacentalia, and this includes the orders Marsu
pialia and Monotremata."
    This outline of the most important results of a series of anatomical re
 searches could not have been intended as a " zoological definition."            If  I
 have misrepresented Professor Owen in stating broadly that he alleged
 that the implacental mammalia were distinguished from the remainder of
 the class by the absence of the corpus callosum, so also did the compiler
 of the above paragraph ; and at least one of the reasons assigned for the
 award of the highest honour the Society can bestow is grounded on a
 misconception.         The main difference as to questions of fact between Pro
 fessor Owen and myself may be stated briefly as follows.                He has seen
 and described, in the brains of the implacental mammals, a transverse
 commissure between the hemispheres of the cerebrum, which he calls
 ' fornix,' ' commissure of the                        or sometimes ' rudimental
                                         hippocampi,'
 commencement of the corpus callosum.'              This commissure he appears to
 have seen (or at all events to have described) only in a portion of its extent.
 He has found in placental mammals a great transverse commissure super
 added to this, to which he generally restricts the term 'corpus callosum.'
      I have seen and described in the brain of several implacental mam
 mals the same transverse commissure, but have traced out its relations
  and connexions        more fully,   especially by means of transverse and Ion

 1865.]             Sir C. Fox   on the  Pins of Chain Bridges.               139
 gitudinal sections.      If  my determination is correct, it represents (not
 merely according      to  transcendental   homological signification,  but as a
simple question of plain anatomical observation) the whole of the great
transverse commissure, or corpus callosum of the lower placental mam
 mals, only in somewhat reduced proportions, and with relations somewhat
modified by the peculiar form of the inner cerebral wall.
    There is consequently no superadded structure in the brain of the latter
group.
    To the imputation, twice repeated, of having "obtained" or "derived"
the notions and ideas contained in my paper from Professor Owen's
writings, no direct reply is necessary. The communication which I pre
sented to the Society is the result of repeated original observations and
dissections,    made    at various  periods,  extending  over  more than    three
years.     The descriptions are all verified by drawings and preparations.
    That their publication (if they should be so honoured) may advance in
some slight degree our knowledge of a difficult and obscure, yet important
branch of anatomy, is all that I venture to hope.        That they are entirely
free from errors, or that they may not, at some future time, be superseded
by the researches of abler investigators, I do not presume to believe.
II. "On      the Size of    Pins for connecting Flat Links in the Chains ol
       Suspension Bridges."         By Sir Charles Fox.          Communicated
       by the President.        Received March 2, 1865.
    In the construction of chains of this kind, it is of the highest importance
that the pins, which pass through and connect together the links of which
the chains are composed, should be of the right size, inasmuch as their
being    too small, as compared with the links through which they pass,
renders ineffective a portion of the iron contained in the latter, which then
exists only as a useless load to be carried by such links ; while at the
same    time,  if the pins and heads of the links be too large, they become
uselessly cumbersome and expensive.
    Careful examination and experiments made upon a large scale (which
will be explained hereafter) have brought out facts by which a simple
rule has been arrived at — a rule that may safely be adopted as a guide in
deciding upon the relative sizes of these two parts.
    On this rule mainly depends the economical use of iron in the con
struction of such chains.
    In this paper the term chains for suspension bridges implies such as are

throughout, placed side by side, but having their ends swelled edgeways so
as to form what are technically      termed heads, and which are coupled toge
ther by pins passing through holes in such heads, as shown in figs. 5 & 6
in the accompanying drawing.
    In deciding upon the size of the pins, it has often been assumed, as

a close approximation, that, as about the same force is required for shearing
as for breaking wrought iron by extension, it would be necessary to give the
piu a cross section equal to the sectional area of the smallest portion of the
link only. The fact of the possibility of links being torn and destroyed by
the pin being too small to present the necessary bearing surface, although
                                                                     to bear
quite large enough to resist the calculated shearing force brought
upon it by the links, seems hitherto not to have attracted notice ; but
                                                                          as
the strength of a chain depends upon the proper extent of surface being
offered by the pins of the links to pull against, such a mode as the one de
scribed has been proved by experiment to be altogether fallacious.     For by
this mode of estimating, the size of a pin passing through links 10 inches
wide and of uniform thickness (that      not having the head thicker than the
                                                    is,
body of the link) would be something less than            inches in diameter,
                                                                            3£
whereas (as will presently be shown), in order to get the whole benefit from
such  a link, the pin must be somewhat more in diameter than       inches, and            6
for the following reasons.
   In wrought iron the initial forces necessary to extend, or diminish by
compression, the length of    bar are practically the same
                                       a                     and hence                ;
                                                                                                     it
arises that unless the surface of the pin on which the semicylindrical sur
face of the hole in the link bears      as great as the smallest cross section of
                                               is
the  link itself, the head will be torn  by the pin and since to provide this
                                                                   ;

                         it   is               pin of much larger size, the

question of its ability to resist the operation of shearing never arises, and
the whole Subject resolves itself into one of bearing surface.
  If the      pin                                                of heavy pull
                    be too small, the first result on the application                     a
on the chain will be to alter the position of the hole through which                                 it
passes, and also to change    from    circular into

  has been thrown away upon what is worse than wasted material, inasmuch
  as that material, remaining as load only, has to be carried by the chains,
  and correspondingly weakens the structure.
     I am also acquainted with a very recently constructed suspension bridge
  in which some of the links, which are 10 inches wide, have the holes in
  their heads but 2 inches, instead of 6£ inches, in which case more than two-
  thirds of the iron in the links is useless.
     The first time my attention was seriously called to this important sub
 ject was when Mr. Vignoles entrusted my late firm of Fox, Henderson,
 and Co., with the manufacture of the chains of the great suspension bridge
 for carrying a military road over the Dnieper, at Kieff, which was con
 structed by him for the Russian Government.
     As the chains for this bridge weighed upwards of 1600 tons, upon
 which the expense of transport was very heavy, they having to be shipped
 to Odessa, and thence carted over very bad roads for upwards of 300
 miles to Kieff, it was considered of the first importance to ascertain
 whether or not they were well proportioned ; and accordingly a proving-
 machine was specially prepared, of power sufficient to pull into two any
 link intended to   be used on this bridge.
    These links,   as shown in the drawing attached to the contract (see
 fig. 1), were, for  convenience of transit, but 12 feet long from centre to
 centre of pin-holes, 10^" wide by 1" thick in their body or smallest part,
 with a head at each end also 1" thick, swelled out to 16 \" in width, so
 as to allow of holes for receiving pins 4j£" in diameter.      The cross-sectional
 area of these pins was 15*9 inches, or rather more than 50 per cent. in
 excess of the cross-sectional area of the link at its smallest part.
    According to the usual mode of ascertaining the size of these pins, by
making them of such dimensions as to resist the force required to shear
them, they possessed upwards of a third more section than was thus
shown to     be necessary.    Still, in practice, a pin of this size proved alto
gether disproportionate to the size of the links, and required to be increased
from 4 1" to 6£" diameter before it was possible to break a link in its body
or narrowest part — fracture in every previous case taking place at the hole,
and through the widest part of the head, as shown in fig. 2.
    The iron in the links for this bridge was of a very high quality, and was
manufactured by Messrs. Thorneycroft aud Co., from a mixture of Indian
and other approved pig-iron, and required a tensile strain of about 27 tons
per sectional inch to break it ; 60 that taking the narrowest part at, say
1 0 inches, a strain of 270 tons ought
                                               (had the size of the pin been in
proper proportion) to have been required to pull it into two ; instead of
which, so long as the pins were but 4| inches in diameter, the head tore
across (as shown at fig. 2) at its widest part with about 180 tons, or two-
thirds only of the strain desired and provided for as far as the size of the
body of the links was concerned.
    This unexpected result led to the belief that the      size  of the heads  was
                                                                     m 2

insufficient  ; and accordingly    a few experimental links were prepared with
 their heads 2 inches wider than before (as shown in fig. 4) ; but these never
 theless were found to require no additional force to tear asunder ; hence it
 became obvious that fracture arose from some cause not yet ascertained.
    As has already been stated, the rupture took place across the widest
 part of the head (C C, fig. 2) ; but on attempting to adjust the piece broken
 off to the position it originally occupied in the link, it was observed that,
 while the fractured surfaces came in contact at the outside of the head,
 they were a considerable distance apart at the edge of the pin-hole (see
 fig. 2).
    This at once proved that during the application of the tension, which
 at last ended    in producing fracture, the various portions of the head had
been    subject to very unequal strains ; and upon careful examination, the
 rationale of this fracture became apparent from the consideration that the
 hole, which originally was round, had become pear-shaped (see fig. 2),
 having altered its position, and that the iron of the link which, during the
application of the load, bore upon the pin, and was consequently in a state
of compression, had become considerably thickened in consequence, as was
 now evident, of an effort to obtain a greater bearing surface (see A, figs.
 2 & 3), while the other portion of the iron arouud the pinhole, being sub
ject to tension, had    been so weakened and thinned         by being stretched, as
to cause a tearing action to take place, which, having once commenced,
would obviously, by the continuance of the same strain, rend through the
entire head, no matter what its width might be.
    From this it was clear that any increase of size in the head (unless by
                         I
thickening, which, as have before stated, is inadmissible) was of no avail ;
and it was now that the principle which forms the subject of this paper
became     manifest — viz., that   there was a certain area of the semicylin-
drical surface of the hole having a bearing on the pin proportionate to
the transverse section of the body or narrowest part of a link, and quite
essential to its having equal strength in all its parts ; and that any de
parture from this proportion could not fail to bring about either waste of
iron in the body of the links, if the pin were of insufficient size to offer
proper bearing surface, or waste of metal in the heads of the links and in
the pins, if the latter were larger than necessary for obtaining this fixed
proportion    of areas.
    Having arrived at this point,      a link, similar in all respects to the pre
vious one, with holes      4| inches   in diameter, and which broke across the
head with 180 tons, was taken, and its holes enlarged to 6 inches, but with
out increasing the width of the head, which still remained 1 6£ inches ; so
                                                                    |
that the only difference was the removal of an annular piece inch in width
from the hole, and so making it 6 inches instead of 4£ inches in diameter,
thereby actually diminishing the quantity of iron in the head to this extent
— when it was most interesting to discover that by this slight alteration,
                                                                                 by
which the semicylindrical surface bearing on the pin had been increased

  from 7-0 to 9-4 sectional inches, the power of the link to resist tension had
  increased in about the like proportion, having rendered a force of nearly
  240 tons necessary to produce fracture.

    From subsequent experience, it has become evident that had the pins                     of
these chains been increased to 6J-" diameters, giving a bearing surface                     of
 10-2 square inches, the proper proportion between them and the body                        of
the links would have been very nearly arrived at, while with those                          of
only 6" diameter about an inch of the body of the links was wasted.
    The practical result arrived at by the many experiments made on this
very interesting subject is simply that, with a view to obtaining the full
efficiency of a link, the area of its semicylindrical surface bearing on the
pin must be a little more than equal to the smallest transverse sectional
area   of its body ; and as this cannot, for the reasons stated, be obtained by
increased thickness of the head, it can only be secured by giving a suffi
cient diameter to the pins.
    That    as the rule for     arriving    at the proper size   of pin proportionate to

  144                         Mr. Rainey on the formation of               [Mar. 30,
 the body of a link may be as simple and easy to remember as possible, and
  bearing in mind that from circumstances connected with its manufacture
  the iron in the head of a link is perhaps never quite so well able to bear
 strain as that in the body, I think it desirable to have the size of the hole
 a  little in  excess,  and accordingly for a 10" link I would make the pin 6|"
 in diameter instead of 6|", that dimension being exactly two-thirds of the
 width of the body, which proportion may be taken to apply to every case.
     As the strain upon the iron in the heads of        a link is less direct than in
 its body,    I think   it  right to  have the sum of the widths of the iron on the
 two'sides of the hole 10 per cent. greater than that of the body itself (see
 fig. 5).
     As the pins, if solid, would be of a much larger section than is necessary
 to resist the effect of shearing, there would accrue some convenience, and a
 considerable     saving in weight would be effected, by having them made
 hollow and of steel.
     In conclusion,     I  would remark that my object \n writing this paper has
 been, first, to call attention to the fact that a link is far more likely to be
 torn by the pin being too small, than a pin to be sheared by a link                 ;
 and secondly, to try to establish a simple rule by which their proper com
                                                      I
 parative sizes may always be arrived at ; and have been induced to inves
 tigate* this very important subject from having generally found in existing
 suspension-bridge chains a wide departure from what is right in this
 respect, in having the pins far too small.
 III. " On      the Influence of Quantity of Matter over Chemical Affi
         nity, as shown in the formation of certain Double Chlorides and
         Oxalates."       By George Rainey, M.R.C.S., Lecturer on Micro
         scopical Anatomy, and Demonstrator of Surgical Anatomy at
         St. Thomas's         Hospital.     Communicated     by Dr.    Gladstone.
         Received March 2, 1865.
    The simple fact that quantity of matter has the effect of influencing
 chemical affinity is so well known and so generally admitted, that any
 special remark upon it would be superfluous ; I shall therefore in this
 communication        chiefly   confine my observations to the compounds above
 named, by which this effect will          be shown to be strikingly exemplified,
offering such explanations and remarks thereon as the nature of the facts
may seem to demand.
    The results of nearly all the experiments mentioned in this paper were
first arrived at     by operating upon very minute quantities of material, and
by   observing    under    the microscope the changes that take place ; but after
wards the same products were obtained on the large scale by appropriate
processes,     and in quantities sufficiently large to admit of being analyzed
quantitatively, and of having their formulae accurately determined.            I shall
therefore     commence by giving an account of the processes by which the

 1865.]                 Double Chlorides and Oxalates.                     145
various compounds I am about to treat of can be most easily prepared in
minute quantities, and afterwards those by which they can be formed in any
quantity that may     be required.
   All  the apparatus necessary for the preparation of these compounds in
quantities sufficient for microscopical examination, are a few cells made by
cementing a ring of thin glass, such as is ordinarily used by microscopists,
and some circular disks of thin glass to be employed as covers.       The cell
must be sufficiently shallow to allow of the examination of its contents with
a lens of a half or quarter of an inch focus.
   To prepare the compound of oxalate and chloride of strontium, introduce
into  a cell a few crystals of oxalate of strontia, and add to them as much
saturated solution of chloride of strontium as will completely fill the cell ;
then cement upon the cell a thin glass cover in such a way that the cell
shall be completely air-tight. A cell thus charged must be kept in a
horizontal position, and examined from time to time. In a few hours the
angles and edges of the oxalate of strontia crystals will be observed to have
lost their sharpness of outline, being in a state of disintegration, and very
minute crystals, altogether of a different form from those of the oxalate, to
have made their appearance ; and on successive examinations all the octa
hedral crystals will be seen to have disappeared, and to have become re
placed by exceedingly well formed rhomboidal crystals of different sizes,
composed of the two salts introduced into the cell. (Fig. 1 .) In this ex-
                                      Fig. 1.
periment the solution of the chloride of strontium must be fully saturated ;
and if it even contain a few undissolvod crystals, the processes of disinte
gration of the oxalate, and formation of the compound, will be prolonged,
and more time allowed for their microscopical examination.
   If, in the place of oxalate of strontia and chloride of strontium, crystals
of oxalate of lime, and a strong solution of chloride of calcium be intro
duced into a microscope-cell, and the cell be closed up, the crystals of this
oxalate (like those of the oxalate of strontia) will be seen by the microscope

 146                   Mr. Raincy   on the formation   of           [Mar. 30,
 to become gradually disintegrated, and replaced by an entirely different set
of crystals, consisting of oxalate of lime and chloride of calcium.     In this
experiment, either the oxalate made artificially, or that obtained from any
natural source, may be employed ; but the strength of the solution of the
chloride of calcium must not be less than that of a mixture consisting of
equal parts by measure of a solution of this chloride saturated at a tem
perature of 60° Fahr. and water.         The time required for the disintegra
tion of all the oxalate of lime and its combination with the chloride of
calcium to form crystals of the double compound of these salts, depends
upon the size of the crystals of oxalate of lime employed in the experi
ment : if they are very small, or if the oxalate is to all appearance amor
phous, evidence of these changes will be visible in a few hours, and the
crystals completely formed in a few days ; whilst if the oxalate crystals are
large and well formed, some weeks will elapse before they have entirely
disappeared and become replaced by the new crystals.
    These changes are also influenced by the strength of the solution of the
chloride of calcium : if it be fully saturated, they take place more quickly,
but the crystals will be small ; if diluted, they will, on the contrary, be
produced more slowly,     and the crystals will be larger and better defined,

solution of chloride   of magnesium undergo similar changes, a double salt,
consisting of oxalate of magnesia and chloride of magnesium, being formed.
In this case the changes take place very slowly, several months being re
quired for the formation of perfect crystals.      These crystals have their
sides aud angles exceedingly sharp and well defined (fig.
                                                             3). Lastly, the
oxalate of baryta, and a saturated solution of the chloride of barium placed
under the conditions above mentioned, yield the same results, and crystals
of oxalate of baryta and chloride of barium    are formed (fig. 4.)

 double salts, as shown in the foregoing experiments, are, first, the disinte
 gration, and at length complete dissolution of a class of salts of very

sparing solubility, in strong solutions of chlorides of the same base, whilst
weaker solutions do not in the least affect them ; secondly, the combina
 tion under these circumstances of the oxalate and chloride of these bases to
 form double salts almost as little soluble as the simple oxalates ; and lastly,
the continued    and simultaneous solution and deposition of these salts in a
crystalline form in a quantity of fluid but little, if at all, exceeding the
weight of the crystals deposited, until either all the oxalate crystals
employed at the commencement are used up, or the solution of the chloride
has become too feeble to effect the further disintegration of those which are
in excess. The most remarkable part of this process is the continued de
position of crystals after the saturation of the fluid in which they were
formed, rendering a small portion of fluid sufficient for the production of a
comparatively large quantity of crystals.     This fact seems to indicate that
in this case the newly-formed particles, immediately on their coming into
existence in this fluid medium, are attracted more forcibly by the fluid
than by one another, but that afterwards, when they have become aug
mented to a point above that which is said to be the point of saturation,
their attraction for one another becomes greater than that for the fluid with
which they are in contact ; and being thus brought within the sphere of
action of the forces necessary to produce crystals, these particles combine
into the crystalline form.
    Whether under conditions like the above a deposition of crystals is a
necessary attendant on the formation of sparingly soluble substances in a
fluid medium, it is not possible to say ; but in course of these investigations
I shall be able to adduce several other examples of a similar kind.
    The experiments which have been related so far have gone only to
exemplify the influence of quantity of matter on chemical affinity as con
nected with simple chemical combination, but by a slight modification of

148                    Mr. Rainey     on the formation     of               [Mar. 30,
these experiments the effect of the same principle on elective affinity can be
demonstrated.       For this purpose let a small quantity of oxalate of lime,
either amorphous or crystalline, be introduced into a microscope-cell filled
with a completely saturated solution of chloride of strontium, and securely
closed up.     On examining such     a preparation,   the oxalate of lime is seen in
a few days to be undergoing         disintegration,  and new crystals are seen to
make their appearance, generally first at the            sides   of the cell. These
crystals being formed slowly have a very sharp outline, and are remarkably
transparent.       In their form they resemble those obtained by putting
oxalate of strontia into a saturated solution of the chloride of strontium ;
and notwithstanding that many of them have some of their angles cut off,
and are thus made to present additional sides, their composition is precisely
the same as if oxalate of strontia had in this instance been acted upon by
a saturated solution of chloride of strontium.               As in this experiment
a chloride of calcium is formed at the expense of some of the chloride of
strontium,    the solution soon becomes too feeble to decompose the oxalate
of lime, when of course the further formation of crystals will cease. Hence,
to secure the best results, some crystals of chloride of strontium must be
undissolved in the solution when put into the cell.                By this means the
 processes of disintegration and the production of new crystals can be pro
 longed for many months, and an opportunity is thereby afforded of mea
 suring them, and of determining their rates of increase, or of making such
 other observations on the subject as the experiment may suggest.
     The methods of forming the double compounds of the oxalates and
 chlorides of the alkaline earths in microscopical quantities having thus
 been described, it now remains to show how, on the same principle, these
 compounds can be formed on the large scale.
      To prepare the double salt consisting of oxalate of strontia and chloride
 of strontium, it is necessary merely to mix oxalate of strontia (made by de
  composing the oxalate of ammonia by chloride of strontium, and washing
  the precipitate by decantation, and not on a filter) with a solution of chlo
  ride of strontium kept at the point of complete saturation.            In order that
  no lumps of oxalate may be mixed with the solution of the chloride, which
  would be unavoidable if any portion of the oxalate had been allowed to get
  dry, it is necessary, after finally washing the oxalate, to draw off as much
  of the water    as possible with a siphon, and to add to the mixture of the
  oxalate of  strontia and remaining water the saturated solution of chloride of
   strontium containing some undissolved chloride.             If  the solution of the
   chloride of strontium in which the oxalate is contained is
                                                                       fully saturated,

   weeks before all the oxalate has combined with the
                                                              chloride. This can be
   determined only by the microscope.

to give any special directions as to the easiest method of preparing them in

part of the rhomboidal forms are seen to have disappeared, and to have
become changed into crystals of various sizes, and generally of a prismatic
shape ; after which the mixture is to be set aside for two or three days.       If,
after the expiration of this time, all the rhomboidal forms      have  not  disap
peared and become replaced by prisms, fresh solution must be added until
such is the result.     The size of the new crystals and their degree of com
pleteness will be in proportion to the time employed in their formation.
(Fig.   5 is a representation  of  these crystals.)
                                        Fig. 5.
    This compound of the double oxalate and chloride can nlso be prepared
 by keeping the rhomboidal form for three or four weeks in an atmosphere
 saturated with aqueous vapour, and completely excluded from the external
 air. By this mode of treatment these crystals in a few hours absorb
 water, and begin to undergo a process of disintegration, and in two or three
 days distinct well-defined prismatic crystals make their appearance. These
 processes of disintegration and formation of new crystals continue until all
 the rhombs are converted into prisms, which are contained in the water
 absorbed from the humid air, in which they may be preserved if kept in a
 well-stopped bottle, so as to prevent evaporation and the consequent re
 conversion of the prisms into rhombs.          This form of double salt, like the
 one from which it was prepared, is instantly decomposed, by the sudden
 addition of a sufficiently large quantity of water, into oxalate of strontia
 and chloride of strontium.       It is not affected by exposure to the air, and it
 is insoluble in absolute alcohol.

With respect to the mode in which the change of the first compound into
the second takes place under the circumstances above detailed, there is one
fact which it is necessary to mention, namely, that the solution of chloride
of strontium   of the strength in which the prismatic crystals are formed
from the rhomboidal, and in which they can be kept unchanged, does not
affect the crystals of the simple oxalate.        Hence it is evident that the
oxalate set free by the decomposition of the rhomboidal crystals by the
addition of only a small quantity of water,                             is,
                                                   from the circumstance of its
being brought   into contact with   the dissolved  chloride of strontium on the
instant of its formation, more easily acted upon by          than      had before         it           ifit

152                  Mr. Raincy on the formation of                        [Mar. 30,
  Before concluding this part of my subject, I have a few observations to
make on the oxalates of the alkaline earths produced by the sudden action
of water in sufficiently large quantity upon their double salts, especially
those of the double salts of strontia and baryta.
   For this purpose it is necessary only to drop a few well-formed crystals of
the double salt of oxalate of strontia and chloride of strontium into a test-
tube filled with distilled water, when they will be seen instantly to become
opaque.    The general form of these crystals remains more or less complete,
but their interior is filled up with entirely amorphous oxalate, especially in
the very thin crystals.  If some of the crystals thus acted upon be put into
distilled water in a microscope-cell perfectly closed to prevent the escape of
the fluid by evaporation, and examined from time to time with a i-inch lens,
they will be seen gradually to go into well-defined octahedral crystals,
some months being required before the whole of the amorphous oxalate is
converted into crystals ; but all specimens thus prepared are not acted upon
by water to the same degree.    Among several slides showing this fact,            I
have one in my possession dated May 20th, 1863, in which the whole of
the amorphous oxalate introduced has become transformed into remark
ably beautiful and well-formed octahedral crystals, many of them of large
size, consideringthat they had been formed in so small a quantity of water
— the mere fraction of a drop.     Some portions of this oxalate remained
unchanged for more than a year after it was put into the cells, but the
whole of it has since been converted into perfect crystals.  As the effects
of water upon    these forms of oxalate are not uniform, it was considered
necessary first to determine whether it was only on the oxalate as above
prepared that water caused these changes, or whether it was not a ge
neral consequence of the action of water upon sparingly soluble salts,
rendered amorphous in consequence either of a complete absence of water,
or of an insufficiency for perfect crystallization (the sudden action of the
water upon the double salt separating the chloride from the oxalate more
rapidly than the water of crystallization could combine with        and with
                                                                     it) ;
this view the following experiments     were performed.   The oxalates of lime,
strontia,  and baryta, all made    by precipitation in the usual way, were ex
posed,  for the purpose    of expelling  the  water of  crystallization, in small
test-tubes to the temperature of boiling oil for three or four hours, and
afterwards put into closed microscope-cells with distilled water.  On ex
amination with the microscope,     was found that the oxalate of baryta
                                   it
had begun in   few hours to pass into
               a                        more minute state of division, and
                                          a
that on the same day octahedral crystals could be seen          by
                                                             ^-inch lens

and in the space of six weeks nearly all this oxalate had become trans
formed into regular octahedral crystals. The oxalate of strontia had un
dergone a similar change, but rather more slowly          ;   distinct octahedral
crystals, however, were visible in twelve hours.
  As the oxalate of strontia obtained by precipitation in- the usual way
generally contains   some octahedral crystals, some of the amorphous            oxa

  late employed in this experiment had been prepared by exposing to the
  action of boiling oil an amorphous oxalate of strontia, precipitated from
  its combination with chloride by means of water.          This precipitate not
  containing any octahedral crystals, and being acted upon more speedily
  by water than the other forms of anhydrous oxalate of strontia, is best
  suited for the demonstration of the effect above described.        The oxalate of
 lime which had been subjected to the action of boiling oil and kept in distilled
 water had not undergone any visible change.        I may notice, in reference to
 some oxalate of strontia which had been heated in boiling oil and exposed to
 the air for five or six weeks, that the action of water upon it was diminished,
 but was entirely restored after a second exposure to the heated oil.
      In reference to the cause of these changes from the amorphous to the
 crystalline form by the mere action of water, it is evident that, as they
 take place in perfectly closed cells, and commence in so short a time after
 the introduction of the amorphous oxalate and water, they are inde
 pendent of evaporation or of alteration of temperature.         Hence they seem
 to be simply the effect of the chemical union of the water with the anhy
 drous oxalate to form a hydrous oxalate, which, being presented to the
 action of the water in the cell on the instant of its formation,      is dissolved
 in a larger quantity than can be retained in solution,            and thus whilst
 one portion of hydrous oxalate is being formed and dissolved, that which
 was formed previously is in the act of being deposited, and thus these
 processes go on simultaneously until all the amorphous oxalate which
 was introduced into the cell is changed into well-defined crystals, as was
before explained in treating of the compound salt of the oxalate aud
chloride of strontium.
     In  conclusion I  may add that the oxalates are not the only compounds
of    the alkaline earths which form double salts when brought into contact
 with strong solutions of chlorides of the same base. Crystals of tartrate
of lime put into a saturated solution of chloride of calcium, form a double
salt of tartrate and chloride of calcium, which is decomposed by water into
tartrate of lime and chloride of calcium.          Also the carbonate of lime,
under favourable circumstances, will combine with the chloride of calcium
to form a double salt which is acted upon by water, in the same manner
as those above treated of.        To obtain this last-named compound, it is
necessary to put crystals of carbonate of soda or potash into a relatively
large quantity of a saturated solution of chloride of calcium, so that the
carbonate of lime, immediately on its coming into existence, may be acted
upon by a solution of the requisite strength.        Solid particles of carbonate
of lime, whether crystalline or globular, are not affected by a saturated
solution of chloride of calcium.       1Without doubt these experiments might
be so modified and extended as to embrace other substances which are of
very different degrees of solubility, and which still do not decompose one
another; but as there is no apparent limit to such a course of experiments, I
must now conclude my communication,          hoping that the (in   some respects)

novel method of chemical         research which     I have here exemplified may be
considered    of sufficient interest    to be followed out by other investigators,
and believing that the experiments and suggestions which                   I  have here
given, and the principles they involve, are calculated to throw some light
on the nature of those chemical processes which take place in nature,
whether in organized bodies or in the crust of the earth, neither of which
branches of natural chemistry is at present sufficiently understood, and
both of which it is of very high interest further to elucidate.

 I. " Report on       the  New Unit of Electrical Resistance proposed and
       issued by the Committee on Electrical Standards appointed in
        1861 by the British Association."               By Fleeming Jenkin, Esq.
        Communicated by Professor A. W. Williamson.                            Received
        March 20, 1865.
    Sir Humphry        Davy, in 1821*, published           his researches proving a
 difference in the conducting-power            of metals and the decrease of that
 power as their temperature rose.           This quality of metals was examined by
 Snow Harris, Cumming, and E. Becquerel, whose table of conducting-
 powers, compiled by the aid of his differential galvanometer, and published
 in 1826f, is still frequently quoted, and is indeed remarkable as the result
 of experiments made before the publication by Ohm, in 1827 J, of the
 true mathematical theory of the galvanic circuit.
    The idea of resistance as the property of a conductor was introduced by
 Ohm, who conceived the force of the battery overcoming the resistance of
 the conductors      and producing the current as a result.              Sir Humphry
 Davy, on the contrary, and other writers of his time, conceived the voltaic
 battery rather as continually reproducing a charge, somewhat analogous to
 that of a Leyden jar, which was discharged so soon as a conductor allowed
 the fluid to pass.      The idea of resistance is the necessary corollary of the
 conception    of a force doing     some   kind of work §, whereas the idea of con
 ducting-power is the result of an obvious analogy when electricity is con
 ceived as a fluid, or two fluids, allowed to pass in different quantities through
 different wires from pole to pole.           When submitted to measurement, the

qualities of conducting-power    and resistance are naturally expressed by
reciprocal numbers, and the terms are used in this sense in the early
writings of Lenz (1833) *, who, with Fechnerf, and PouilletJ, established
the truth of Ohm's theory shortly after the year 1830.
   The conception of a unit of resistance is implicitly contained in the very
expression of Ohm's law; but the earlier writers seem to have contented
themselves with reducing by calculation the resistance of all parts of a
heterogeneous circuit into a given length of some given part of that circuit,
so as to form an imaginary homogeneous conductor, the idea of which lies
at the basis of Ohm's reasoning. These writers, therefore, generally speak of
the resistance as the "reduced length" of the conductor, a term still much
used in France (vide Daguin, Jamin, Becquerel, De la Rive, and others).
The next step would naturally be, when comparing different circuits,
to reduce all resistances into a length of some one standard wire, though
this wire might not form part of all or of any of the circuits, and then
to treat the unit length of that standard wire as a unit of resistance.
Accordingly we find Lenz (in 1 838§) stating that 1 foot of No. 11 copper
wire is his unit of resistance, and that it is 1 919 times as great as the
unit he used in 1833*, which was a certain constant part of the old circuit.
In      the earlier paper the resistances are treated as lengths, in the later                       as
so many
                '' units."
   Lenz appears to have chosen his unit at random, and apparently with
out the wish to impose that unit upon others.  A further advance is seen
when Professor Wheatstone,                   in his well-known    paper    of 1843       1|,   proposes
1   foot     of copper wire, weighing            100 grains, not only as     a   unit,         but asa
standard   of resistance, chosen with reference to the standard weight and
length used in this country.      To Professor Wheatstone also appears due*
the credit of constructing (in 1840) the first instruments                     by
                                                                  which definite
multiples of the resistance-unit chosen might be added or subtracted at will
from the circuit      He was closely followed

in the     same year reduce the resistanceof their experiments to lengths of a
given German-silver wire, and as a further definition they give its value as
compared with pure silver.      To avoid the growing inconvenience of this
multiplicity of standards, Jacobi* (in 1848) sent to PoggendorfT and others
a certain copper wire, since well known as Jacobi's standard, desiring that
they would take copies of      so that all their results might be expressed in
                                       it,
one measure.     He pointed out, with great justice, that mere definition of
the standard used, as     given length and weight of wire, was insufficient,
                             a
and that good copies of       standard, even
                                     a            chosen at random, would be

preferable to the reproduction   in one laboratory of standard prepared and

kept in another.    The present Committee fully indorse this view, although
the definition of standards based on weights and dimensions of given
materials has since then gained greatly in precision.
   Until about the year 1850 measurements of resistance were confined,
with few exceptions, to the laboratory     but about that time underground
                                                        ;
telegraphic wires were introduced, and were shortly followed    submarine          by
cables, in the examination and manufacture of which the practical engineer
soon found the benefit of         a    knowledge        of electrical laws.   Thus in 1847 the
officersof the Electric and International Telegraph Company used resist
ance-coils made by Mr. W. F. Cooke, apparently multiples of Wheatstone's
original standard, which was nearly equal to the No. 16 wire of commerce                       ;
and Mr. C. F. Varleyf states that, even at that date, he used       rough               a
mode      of "distance testing."             In   1850, Lieut. Werner Siemens
                                                               published           %

position of

addition of resistances    also suggested
                             is            and Sir Charles Bright, in Patent

testing for faults and of examining the quality of materials employed, and
the condition of the line, have been continually invented, almost all turning,

of 4 millimetres              diameter.         Several    other units were from time to time
proposed by Langsdorf *, Jacobif, Marie-Davy X, Weber §,                         W. Thomson        ||,
and others, with    gradually increasing perception of the

importance in    standard a  but none of these were generally
                                           ;                                     accepted as the
one recognized measure in any country.        To remedy the                      continually in
creasing evils arising from the discrepancies invariably found between dif
ferent sets of coils, Dr. Werner Siemens (in 18601T) constructed standards,
taking as unit the resistance of        column of chemically pure mercury
                                                     a
1 metre long, having     section equal
                                  a    to   millimetre square, and maintained
                                                               1
at the temperature of 0° Centigrade**.  Dr. Siemens supposed that this
standard could be reproduced without much difficulty where copies could
not be directly obtained. Mercury had been proposed before as fitting                     a
material        standard by Mari&Davy and De la Rive
                    for   a                                 but Dr. Siemens  ;
merits especial recognition, as the coils and apparatus he issued have been
made with great care, and have materially helped in introducing strict
accuracy        ff.
     The question had reached this point when (in 1861) the British Asso
ciation, at the suggestion of Professor W. Thomson, appointed      Committee         a
to determine the best standard     of electrical resistance. This Committee,
aided by    grant from the Royal Society, has now issued
                a                                          new standard,         a
the subject of the present paper.
   The writer has hitherto described those units only which are founded
on   amore or less arbitrary size and weight of some more or less suitable
material   but measurements of resistance can be conceived and carried out
                ;
entirely without reference to the special qualities of any material whatever.

it    to W. Weber§§ that we
     is                          owe the  first distinct proposal (in 1851)  of                    a
definite system  of  electrical  measurements,    according  to which resistance
would be measured in terms of an absolute velocity.         This system of mea
sures he called absolute electromagnetic measure, in analogy with Gauss's
nomenclature of absolute magnetic measure. The Committee have decided
that Weber's proposal     far preferable to the use of any unit of the kind

 158               Mr. F. Jenkin — Report         on the New Unit                 [April 6,
reproduction, which are by no means contemptible, arbitrary material
standards, whether of mercury, gold, silver, platinum, or any other mate
rial, would be heterogeneous isolated units without any natural connexion
with any other physical units.         The unit proposed by Weber, on the other
hand, forms part of a symmetrical natural system, including both the fun
damental units of length, time, and mass, and the derived electrical units
of current quantity and electromotive force. Moreover it has been shown
by Professor W. Thomson*, who accepted and extended Weber's proposal
immediately on its appearance, that the unit of absolute work, the con
necting link between all physical forces, forms part of the same system,
and may be used as the basis of the definition of the absolute electromag
netic units.
    The full grounds of the choice of the Committee could only be explained
by a needless repetition of the arguments given in the reports already made
to the British Association.        It will be sufficient here to state that, in the
absolute electromagnetic system, the following equations exist between the
mechanical and electrical units : —
                          W=CaRf,                                                       (I)
where    W    is the work done in the time t by the current C conveyed
through a conductor of the resistance R. This equation expresses Joule
and Thomson's law.
where   E  is the electromotive force.        This equation expresses Ohm's law.
                             Q=Cr,                                                       (3)
expressing a relation first proved by Faraday, where Q is the quantity of
electricity conveyed or neutralized by the current in the time t.                   Finally,
the whole system is rendered determinate by the condition that the unit
length of the unit current must produce the unit force on the unit pole
 (Gauss) at the unit distance.        If  it is preferred to omit the conception of
magnetism, this last statement is exactly equivalent to saying that the unit
current conducted round two circles of unit area in vertical planes at right
angles to each other, one circuit being at a great distance D above the
other, will cause a couple to act between the circuits of a magnitude equal
to the reciprocal of the cube of the distance D. This last relation expresses
the proposal made by Weber for connecting the electric and magnetic
measure.      These four relations serve to define the four magnitudes R, C,
 Q, and   E, without reference to any but the fundamental                   units  of time,
 space, and mass    ;  and when reduced to these fundamental units, it will be
found    that the measurement         of R involves simply           a velocity, i. e. the
quotient of a length      by a time.      It  is for this reason that the absolute

mon non-absolute       unit of work involving the product of a weight into a

chosen as fundamental units the second of time, the metre, and the mass
of the Paris gramme.          The metrical rather than the British system of
units was selected, in the hope that the new unit might so find better
acceptance abroad, and with the feeling that while there is a possibility
that we may accept foreign measures, there is no chance that the Continent
will adopt ours.       The unit of force is taken as the force capable of pro
ducing in one second a velocity of one metre per second in the mass of a
Paris gramme, and the unit of work as that which would be done by the
above force acting through one metre of space.           These points are very fully
explained in the British Association Report for 1 8G3, and in the Appendix C
to that Report by Professor J. Clerk Maxwell and the writer.

is not very different from Siemens-s mercury unit, which has been found
convenient in practice.        It is about the twenty-fifth part of the mile of
No. 1 6 impure copper wire used as a standard by the Electric and Inter
national Company, and about once and a half Jacobi's unit*.
    It was found necessary to undertake entirely fresh experiments in order
to determine the actual value of the abstract standard, and to express the
same in a material standard which might form the basis            of sets of resistance-
coils to be used in the usual manner.             These experiments, made during
two years with two distinct sets of apparatus by Professor J. C. Maxwell
and the writer, according to a plan devised by Professor W. Thomson, are
fully described in the Reports to the British Association for 1863 and 1864.
    The results of the two series of experiments made in the two years agree
within 0-2 per cent., and they show that the new standard does not pro
bably differ from true absolute measure by 01 1 per centf . It is not far from
the mean of a somewhat widely differing series of determinations by Weber.
    In order to avoid the inconvenience of a fluctuating standard, it is pro
posed that the new standard shall not be called "absolute measure," or
described as so many                 , but that it shall receive a distinctive name,
                            seconds

session of an authenticated Jacobi standard, and has only arrived at a rough idea of its

that,  if hereafter improved methods of determination in absolute measure
are discovered or better experiments made, the standard need not be
changed, but a small coefficient of correction applied in those cases in which
it is necessary to convert the B. A. measure into absolute measure. Every
unit in popular use has a distinctive name ; we say feet or grains, not units
of length or units of weight ; and it is in this way only that ambiguity can
be avoided.     There are many absolute measures, according as the foot and
grain, the millimetre and milligramme, the metre and gramme, &c. are
used as the basis of the system.      Another chance of error arises from the
possibility  of a  mistake  in  the decimal multiple used as standard.      For
all  these  reasons, as well as for convenience     of expression, the writer
would be glad    if Mr. Clark's  proposal were adopted and the unit called an
Ohmad.
    Experiments have been made for the Committee by Dr. Matthiessen, to
determine how far the permanency of material standards may be relied
on, and under what conditions wires unaltered in dimension, in chemical
composition, or in temperature change their resistance.       Dr. Matthiessen
has established that in some metals a partial annealing, diminishing their
resistance, does    take place, apparently due to age only. Other metals
exhibit no alteration of this kind ; and no permanent change due to the
passage of voltaic currents has been detected in any wires of any metal —
a conclusion contrary to a belief which has very generally prevailed.
   The standard obtained has been expressed in platinum, in a gold-silver
alloy, in a platinum-silver alloy, in a platinum-iridium alloy, and in mer
cury. Two equal standards have been prepared in each metal ; so that
should time or accident cause a change in one or more, this change will be
detected by reference to the others.      The experiments and considerations
which have led to the choice of the above materials are fully given in the
Report to the British Association for 1864. The standards of solid metals
are wires of from 0*5 millim. to 0-8 millim. diameter, and varying from
one to two metres in length, insulated with white silk wound round a long
hollow bobbin, and then saturated with solid paraffin.       The long hollow
form chosen allows the coils rapidly to assume the temperature of any
surrounding medium, and they can be plunged, without injury, into a bath
of water at the temperature at which they correctly express the standard.
The mercury standards consist of two glass tubes about three-quarters of
a metre in length.      All these standards are equal to one another at some
temperature stated on each coil, and lying between 140,5 and 16°*5 C.
None of them, when correct, differ more than 0*03 per cent. from their value
at 15°-5 C.
    Serious errors have occasionally been introduced into observations by re
sistance at connexions between different parts of a voltaic circuit, as perfect
metallic contact at these points is often prevented by oxide or dirt of some
kind. Professor Thomson's method of inserting resistances in the Wheat-
stone balance (differential measurer) has been adopted for the standards, but

in the use of the copies which have been issued it has been thought that
sufficient accuracy would be attained by the use             of amalgamated mercury
connexions.
     In the standards themselves permanence is the one paramount quality
to be aimed at       ; but in copies for practical use a material which changes
little in resistance with change of temperature is very desirable, as other
wise much time is lost in waiting till coils have cooled after the passage of
a current ; moreover large corrections         have otherwise to be employed when
the coils are used at various temperatures ; and these temperatures are fre
quently not known with perfect accuracy.               German silver, a suitable mate
rial in this respect, and much used hitherto, has been found to alter in
resistance, in some cases, without any known cause but the lapse of time,
since the change has been observed where the wires were carefully protected
against mechanical or chemical injury.              A platinum-silver alloy has been
preferred by     the   Committee     to German     silver  for the copies which have
been made     of the standard.       These have been adjusted by Dr. Matthiessen
so as to be correct at some         temperature not differing more than 1° from
 1 5°-5 C.    The resistance of platinum-silver changes about 0*031 per cent.
for each degree Centigrade within the limits of 5° above and below this
temperature ; this change is even less than that of German silver.                   The
new material seems also likely to be very permanent, as it is little affected
by annealing. The form of the copies is the same as that of the standard,
with the exception of the terminals, which are simple copper rods ending
in an amalgamated surface.            Twenty copies have been distributed gratis,
and notices issued that others can be procured from the Committee for
£2 10*. The Committee also propose to verify, at a small charge, any coils
made by opticians, as is done for thermometers and barometers at Kew.
     Dr. Matthiessen reports, with reference to the question of reproduction,
that given weights and dimensions of several pure metals might be em
ployed for this purpose if absolute care were taken.                The reproduction,
in this manner, of the mercury unit, as defined by Dr. Siemens, differs from
the standards issued by him in 1864 about 8*2 per thousand if the same
specific gravity of mercury be used for both observations*.             Each observer
uses for his final value the mean of several extremely accordant results. It
is therefore to be hoped that the standard will never have to be reproduced
by this or any similar method. On the other hand, four distinct observers,
with four different apparatus, using four different pairs of standards issued
respectively by Dr. Siemens and the Committee, give the B. A. unit as
respectively equal to 1-0456, 1-0455, 1-0456, and 1 -0457 of Siemens's 1864
unit. It is certain that two resistances can be compared with an accuracy
of one part in one hundred thousand — an accuracy wholly unattainable in
any reproduction       by weights and measures of           a given  body, or by fresh
reference to experiments on the absolute resistance.              The above four com-
   *  If Dr. Matthiessen uses the sp. gr. of 13-596, as given by Regnault, the difference
from Dr. Siemens-s    standard is 5 per thousand.

162               Mr. F, Jenkin — Report on the New Unit                   [April 6,
parisons, two of which were made by practical engineers, show how far the
present practice and requirements differ from those of twenty and even ten
years ago, when, although the change of resistance due to change of tem
perature was known, it was not thought necessary to specify the tempe
rature at which the copper or silver standard used was correct.                  The
difficulty  of  reproducing  a standard     by simple   reference  to a pure   metal,
further shows the unsatisfactory       nature    of that system in which the con-
ducting-power of substances is measured by comparison with that of some
other body, such as silver or mercury.             Dr. Matthiessen has frequently
pointed out the discrepancies thns produced, although he has himself
followed the same system pending the final selection of a unit of resistance.
It is hoped that for the future this quality of materials will always be
expressed as a specific resistance or specific conducting-power referred to
the unit of mass or the unit of volume, and measured in terms of the
standard unit resistance, that the words conducting-power will invariably
be used to signify the reciprocal of resistance, and that the vague terms
good and bad conductor or insulator will be replaced, in all writings aiming
at scientific accuracy, by those exact measurements which can now be made
with far greater ease than equally accurate measurements of length.
    There is every reason to believe that the new standard will be gladly
accepted throughout Great Britain and the colonies.                Indeed the only
obstacle   to  its  introduction   arises  from    the  difficulty of  explaining to
inquirers what the unit is.       The writer has been so much perplexed by
this simple question, finding     himself   unable to answer it without entering
at large on the subject of electrical measurement, that he has been led to
devise the following definitions, in which none but already established
measures are referred to.
                                       metre    -
    The resistance of the absolute            , is such that the current generated
                                       second
in a circuit of that resistance by the electromotive force due to a straight
bar 1 metre long moving across a magnetic field of unit intensity* per
pendicularly to the lines of force and to its own direction with a velocity of
 1 metre per second, would, if doing no other work or equivalent of work,
develope in that circuit in one second of time a total amount of heat equi
valent to one absolute unit of work — or sufficient heat, according to Dr.
Joule's experiments, to heat 010002-I05 gramme of water at its maximum
density 1° Centigrade.
    The new standard issued is as close an approximation as could be
obtained by the Committee to a resistance ten million times as great as
                 me
the absolute         re,.  The straight     bar moving     as described   above  in a
                 second
magnetic field of unit intensity, would require to move with a velocity of
ten millions of metres per second to produce an electromotive force which
would generate in a circuit of the resistance of the new standard the same

electromotive     force due to the motion of the bar at a velocity of one metre

being in each case proportional to the resistance of the circuit, may be used
to measure that resistance, and the resistance of the B. A. unit may there-

    It is feared that these statements are still too complex to fulfil the pur
pose of popular definitions, but they may serve at least to show how a real
velocity may be used to measure a resistance by using the velocity with
which, under certain circumstances, part of a circuit must be made to move
in order to induce a given current in a circuit of the resistance to be mea
sured.      That current in the absolute system is the unit current, and the
work done by that unit current in the unit of time is equal to the resistance
of the circuit, as results from the first equation stated above.
   Those who from this slight sketch may desire to know more of the
subject will find full information in the Reports of the Committee to the
British Association in 1862, 1863, and 1864. The Committee continue to
act with the view of establishing and issuing the correlative units of
current, electromotive force, quantity, and capacity, the standard apparatus
for which will, it is proposed, be deposited at Kew along with the ten
standards of resistance already constructed with the funds voted by the
Royal Society.

   The following Table shows the degree of concordance obtained in the
separate experiments used to determine the unit.               The determinations were
made by observing the deflections of a certain magnet when a coil revolved
at a given speed, first in one direction, and then in the opposite direction.
The first columu shows the speed in each experiment                  ; the second shows

single experiments.         A difference constantly in one direction may be
observed in the values obtained when the coil revolved different ways.
This difference depended on a slight bias of the suspending thread in
one direction.       The third column shows the value of the B. A. unit
calculated     from    the pair of experiments.         The fourth shows the error
of the pair from the mean value finally adopted.                     In the final mean
adopted, the 1864 determination                was allowed      five times the weight
allowed to that of 1863.

would develope, in a circuit of the resistance of the B. A unit, heat equivalent to ten
millions of units of work, or enough to raise the temperature of 240o grammes of
water at its maximum denritv l5 Centigrade.

        C. Schorlemmer,          Esq., Assistant in the Laboratory of Owens Col
        lege, Manchester.         Communicated by Prof. H. E. Roscoe, F.R.S.
        Received March 21, 1865.
    Previously to the year      1 848  none of the members       of the numerous family
of hydrocarbons of the general formula Cn H2n+2, with the single exception
of marsh-gas, were known to the chemist ; but since that year the re
searches of Kolbe on the electrolysis of the fatty acids, and those of Frank-
land on the action of zinc upon the alcohol iodides, have opened up a new
field of discovery, from which in rapid succession rich harvests have been
reaped.        The hydrocarbons thus isolated were considered by their dis
coverers to be the true radicals of the alcohols ; and in consequence the
molecular weights which were then given to these bodies amounted only to
half those which are now generally accepted.

   In their Report to the Paris Academy upon these hydrocarbons, Laurent
and Gerhardt proposed that their formulae should be doubled, because
these bodies, if represented by the smaller formula, would in the gaseous
state occupy two volumes instead of the four volumes in which the mole
cule of all other organic compounds was found to occur ; and they con
sidered these bodies as homologues of marsh-gas.        Hofmann afterwards
expressed himself in favour of the larger formulae on the same grounds, and
also because, if Frankland's and Kolbe's formulae are accepted, the increase
in the boiling-point produced by an increase of CHa in the hydrocarbon
would      be double     that which has          been    observed as the difference in the
boiling-points of other homologous series.
   Besides these radicals, Frankland discovered another series of hydro
carbons, which, according to the mode of their formation, he regarded as
the hydrides of the radicals, and as the true homologues of marsh-gas, and
which, according to a view first propounded by Brodie, are considered to
stand in a similar relation to the radical hydrocarbons as alcohol stands to
ether, viz. —

Wurtz have fully realized this anticipation.    Wurtz discovered a new
method of preparing the alcohol radicals by the action of sodium upon the
iodides   and according to this method he not only obtained the hydro
          ;
carbons discovered by Kolbe and Frankland, but,      employing two dif     by
ferent iodides, he prepared    number of mixed
                                        a       radicals, which he also
obtained by the electrolysis of mixture of two fatty acids.

   The results of Wurtz's investigation have always been regarded as                                        a
convincing proof of the correctness of Brodie's view, and    now generally       it     is
believed that two series of hydrocarbons of the formula C„ H2n+2 exist, the
hydrides and the radicals, the molecule of the latter containing two atoms
of the real radicals which are supposed to exist in the alcohols.
   A very remarkable resemblance observed in the general physical pro
                                                 is
perties of the two series, the members of which arc gases or liquids so in
different as to resist even the action of concentrated sulphuric or nitric
acids.   This resemblance     so great that Greville Williams was led to the
                                 is
opinion that the indifferent hydrocarbons which he discovered in the oils
obtained      in the destructive        distillation of Boghead                coal belonged to the

 1G6                 Mr. Schorlemmer           on the Hydrocarbons               [April 6,
series   of the radicals,     although he observed            some   differences  in  their
physical properties.
   The chemical behaviour of the radicals has been very imperfectly studied,
all experiments having failed which were carried out with the view of ob
taining from    a radical either the alcohol from which            it was derived,   or the
corresponding acid ; whilst, by the action of chlorine, only substitution-pro
ducts had been formed, in which 2 or 4 atoms of hydrogen are replaced by
chlorine.
   The action of chlorine upon the hydrides had also been studied. Dumas
showed that by acting upon marsh-gas, as first substitution-product the
compound CH5 Cl was formed.                   Berthelot proved that this body was
chloride of methyl, by converting          it into methyl-alcohol       and other methyl-
compounds.
    From hydride of ethyl         Frankland and Kolbe obtained the compound
Ca H3 Cl, which,
                     however,    appeared to them not to be identical, but only
isomeric   with   chloride   of  ethyl. During the last few years, however, our
knowledge of the hydrides         has become much more complete.              Pelouze and
Cahours discovered      the  whole    series,  from  hydride    of butyl upwards, in the
American petroleum       ;  Greville   Williams    proved    the  existence  of hydride of
amyl in the oils from Boghead               coal,  from     which   he inferred that the
hydrocarbons formerly described as radicals wete really hydrides ; and I
found the same hydrocarbons in the products of the destructive distillation
of Cannel-coal.       From these researches it appears that the reaction by
which Berthelot had obtained methyl-compounds                      from marsh-gas is a
general one, and that from each hydride the corresponding chloride, the
alcohol, and all their derivatives can be prepared.
    Whilst pursuing the investigation of the hydrides, I was struck by their
close resemblance to the isomeric terms of the radical series, and I
thought it might be possible that the opinion held by Laurent and Ger-
hardt was, after all, the correct one, and that the so-called radicals belonged
really to the marsh-gas hydrocarbons.
    Moreover Wurtz, by acting on zinc-ethyl with iodide of allyl, had
                                                 C H    I
obtained the mixed radical ethyl-ftllyl,           h'      =C„ II1„, which has not only
                                                        J-
the    composition, but all the characteristic             properties of amylene, and
Beilstein and Rieth had effected the synthesis of propylene and amylene
by the action of zinc-ethyl upon
                                          chloroform.
    Mi"ht not the synthesis of the alcohol radicals be a synthesis of the
same kind ?       Or, if hydrides and radicals are really different, what is this
difference?      In order to solve this question I endeavoured to try if I
could replace in a radical hydrocarbon 1 atom of hydrogen by chlorine, in
order to compare these products and their derivatives with the chlorides
and other derivatives obtained from the hydrides.
    As  a starting-point   I  selected   the mixed radical ethyl-amyl, because this
hydrocarbon      may easily be obtained         in sufficient quantity, and because I

 1865.]                      of the  Series C„ H2n+2-                         167
had previously carefully studied the hydride of heptyl and its derivatives.
 In the preparation of ethyl-amyl a considerable quantity of the radical
amyl is always formed, the behaviour of which with chlorine I also investi
gated.     The first results of these researches have been published in the
 'Journal of    the Chemical   Society,'  vol. i. (new ser.) p. 425.   I obtained
the chlorides C7H„ Cl and C,„ H21 CI, which appeared to be identical with
the chlorides of heptyl and of decatyl. The next step was to ascertain how
 the lower terms of the two series are acted upon by chlorine, and to study
 closely  the differences which     were stated to exist between methyl and
hydride of ethyl.      The results which I obtained were, however, quite dif
ferent from those of former observers.         I  found that when equal volumes
 of chlorine and of methyl, and equal volumes of chlorine and hydride of
ethyl, are exposed to the diffused daylight, the principal product of the
reaction consists in both cases of the compound Ca H3 CI, a body having the
composition and characteristic properties of chloride of ethyl, and as neither
in the physical nor in the chemical properties of the two hydrocarbons a
difference is known to exist,    I concluded that methyl and hydride of ethyl
are identical.     It appeared very probable that the same relation might
exist in the case of the higher terms of the two series, which, however,
showed some differences in their physical properties, and I left it an open
question whether there is only one series of hydrocarbons, CnlI2n+2, or
whether two series exist which exhibit the characters of physical isomerism.
    The following communication contains the results of researches carried
ont for the purpose of deciding the above question in the case of the hydro
carbons ethyl-amyl and hydride of heptyl, and of amyl and hydride of
decatyl.    The results of this investigation are in some respect not so com
plete as I could desire.     The chief difficulty in working upon this subject
is the very small yield   of  the alcohol of the series which is obtained from
a proportionally large quantity of the hydrocarbon, the alcohol being cer
tainly that compound by the study of which and of its derivatives much
light would    be thrown   on many still obscure points.       Only, in the most
favourable cases, one-third of the theoretical yield of the chloride is
obtained ; and in preparing the acetate from the chloride a large quantity
of the latter is decomposed into define          and  hydrochloric acid, and this
decomposition increases as the compounds become richer in carbon. Thus
a small fraction of the hydrocarbon is converted into the acetate ; and in
order to prepare from this ether the pure anhydrous alcohol, losses are
unavoidable, which diminish considerably the yield of a pure product.           I
have tried in different ways to obtain other compound ethers from the
chloride, or to convert it into the iodide, without finding a better method
than that originally employed, to which therefore I finally returned.
    The specific gravities given in the following account are compared with
water at 4° C, or they give the weight of one cubic centimetre in grammes ;
the boiling-points are provided with the necessary correction for the
mercurial column above the vapour.

 1G8                 Mr. Schorlemmer on              the  Hydrocarbons               [April G,
                                   I. Heptyl      Compounds.
     The ethyl-amyl which is obtained by acting upon a mixture of the
iodides of ethyl and amyl with sodium contains generally traces of ethyl-
 ether and ethyl-amyl-ether, the formation of which is easily explained by
 the presence of traces of moisture and amyl-alcohol, both of which can be
 completely excluded only with difficulty.               In order to remove these ethers,
 I treated the crude ethyl-amyl, from which, by fractional distillation, the
amyl was as much as possible separated, and which boiled between 70°—
 120° C, with a mixture of concentrated nitric and sulphuric acids, by which
 not only the ethers, but also traces of iodides, which obstinately adhere,
are removed.        By washing with water, drying over caustic potash, and
rectification   over sodium, pure ethyl-amyl was obtained as a light mobile
liquid possessing a faint ethereal odour which cannot be distinguished
 from that of hydride of heptyl. It boils at 90°-91° C., and has the spe
 cific gravity 0-G819 at 17°*5 C.
     The boiling-point of the hydride of heptyl                 I  have formerly stated as
 98° C., whilst Pelouze and Cahours give it as 92°-94° C.                       I  have lately
convinced myself that the latter observation is the more correct one.                      The
boiling-point of this hydrocarbon becomes lowered after being repeatedly
treated with a mixture of nitric and sulphuric acids, by 5which traces of
 nitro-compounds of the benzol series of hydrocarbons are removed, which
 obstinately adhere*.
     Mr. Ch. R. Wright continued the fractional distillation of the hydride,
which was very well purified in the above manner for a long time. In the
 beginning of these rectifications, the largest quantity of the liquid distilled
between 95°- 100°, whilst always a small quantity with a boiling-point above
    * Pelouze and Cahours state       that the American petroleum which they used did not
contain hydrocarbons     of the   benzol  series, whilst I found a not inconsiderable quantity
of these compounds    in  the  rectified  petroleum from which I isolated the hydrides.      As
it was not impossible  that   this was  an  accidental or intentional admixture, I endeavoured
to procure some genuine crude American petroleum ; hut I did not succeed in obtaining
crude genuine Pennsylvanian, as none of it had reached the Liverpool market for months.
I however got some real Canadian rock-oil, as a thick black liquid of a very unpleasant
odour. I distilled it, and treated the portion boiling below 150° C. with concentrated
nitric acid, which acted violently.       The acid liquid was then diluted with water, and
heavy liquid nitro-compounds separated, possessing the odour of bitter almonds.           These
were treated with tin and hydrochloric acid, and the solution thus obtained was distilled
with caustic potash.   The aqueous distillate, in which some drops of an oily liquid were
suspended, had the odour of aniline, and gave with a solution of bleacbing-powder the
most distinct aniline-reaction.       The beautiful rosaniline-reaction could also easily be
obtained by heating one of the oily drops with bichloride of mercury. Canadian petro
leum contains therefore the series of benzol hydrocarbons.        In the preparation of hydride
of decatyl from rectified petroleum, the portion boiling between 150°-170° was purified
by nitric and sulphuric acids, and thus liquid and solid nitro-compounds obtained.
The solid portion was several times rccrystallized from alcohol, and the whole of the
needle-shaped crystals thus obtained gave on analysis           numbers very nearly agreeing
with the formula of trinitro-cumol, Cs H, (N02)3.

 100° was left behind.         As soon   as such a residue ceased to be observed, the
 distillates were collected at intervals      of 3°, and thus at last by far the largest
 quantity    was   found   to  boil constantly   between 90°-92°.        Whilst, however,
 the boiling-point was lowered, no change in the specific gravity was observed.
 The hydride of heptyl boiling at 90°-92° has the specific gravity 07148 at
 15°,   whilst that boiling at 98°         gave the specific gravity     0*7149 at 15°-5.
 In the   analysis and determination of the vapour-density of the hydrocarbon
 boiling at 90°-92°,       Mr. Wright obtained the following data :—

    If   a current    of chlorine is passed into these hydrocarbons in diffused
daylight,     the   gas is completely absorbed for some time, and the liquid
assumes a yellow colour ; however, suddenly it becomes heated, torrents of
hydrochloric acid are evolved, and the colour of the chlorine disappears,
and from this point the chlorine acts quietly, and hydrochloric acid is con
tinuously evolved. If a little iodine has been added, the action continues
in the dark, but higher chlorinated products are more easily formed.                   If
 100-200 grammes of the hydrocarbon have been employed, the current of
chlorine must be interrupted after some hours, and the liquid treated with
solid caustic potash to remove the absorbed hydrochloric acid. The non-
attacked hydrocarbon is then separated by distillation from the chlori
nated product, and the former treated repeatedly with chlorine, until all

 170                Mr. Schorlemmer       on the Hydrocarbons                [April 6,
the hydrocarbon has been acted upon.              The product is then subjected to
 fractional distillation, in order to isolate the pure chloride C. H15 CI.
    The chloride of heptyl derived from ethyl-amyl boils at 146°-148°, and
 has the specific gravity 0-881 4 at 160,5. The chloride from the hydride has
 the boiling-point 148°-150°, and the specific gravity 0 9030 at 15°; the
 chloride from another preparation boiled at 147°-149°, and its specific
 gravity was found to be 0-8965 at 19°.
    By heating     these  chlorides  in  sealed   glass tubes with acetate of potas
 sium and glacial acetic acid to 160o-180°, chloride of potassium separates
 out, and heptylene and acetate of heptyl are formed.              The point at which
all the chloride has been decomposed can easily be recognized as follows : —
Two layers of liquid       are observed in the heated tube, the lower one con
sisting of a concentrated solution of acetate of potassium in acetic acid, and
 the upper one of chloride of heptyl with some acetic acid.                Where these
 two layers meet,     a separation  of  chloride   of  potassium  takes place, and the
 crystals thus formed fall gradually through the lower part of the tube.
 As soon as this separation of the salt at the junction of the two layers
 ceases, the operation is finished.       The contents of the tube are now diluted
with water, the light liquid which separates is well washed, dried over
chloride of calcium, and from this liquid heptylene and acetate of heptyl
are separated by fractional distillation.
    The heptylene derived from ethyl-amyl, after repeated rectifications over
sodium, was obtained as a colourless mobile liquid of a faint garlic-like
odour, boiling nt 93°-95°, and having the specific gravity 0*7060 at 120-5.
The analysis gave the following numbers : —
    0*1799 substance gave 0*5640 carbonic acid and, 0*2380 water.

    The heptylene from hydride of heptyl, which I have previously de
scribed, boils at 95°-97°; but even after repeated distillations the boiling-
point always rises to about 100° towards the end of the operation.                 Its
specific gravity    was  found to be 0-7383      at  17° 5.    I may here remark that
all the compounds derived from the hydride which are mentioned in this
paper are those formerly described (Journ. Chem. Soc. vol. i. new series,
p. 216), being prepared from the hydrocarbon boiling at 98°.
    The boiling-point of the liquid from which the heptylene has been sepa
rated rises quickly above 170°, and at 180° it becomes constant, when
pure acetate of heptyl distils over, giving on analysis the following results : —

    This ether   possesses exactly the same pleasant smell of pears as that of
the acetate    from  hydride of heptyl. The former boils at 178°-180°, and
has the specific gravity 0-8707 at 16°-5, whilst the boiling-point of the
 latter was found    as 179°-181°,   and the specific gravity 0-8868 at 19°.
    This ether is easily decomposed when heated with a concentrated solu
tion of caustic potash; heptyl- alcohol is formed, which, when dried over
chloride of calcium, and treated with        a small piece    of sodium, in order to
remove the last traces of moisture, was found to boil at 163°- 165°. Its
odour much resembles that of the hexyl-alcohol, but also reminds one of
octyl-alcohol from castor-oil.        The specific gravity is 0-8291 at 160,5,
whilst that of the hydride alcohol is 0-8479 at 16°, and its boiling-point
 1 64°-l 65°.    The odour of the latter is very similar to the alcohol from
ethyl-amyl, but less pure, as if the true odour was interfered with by that
of some other substance. The alcohol from ethyl-amyl was analyzed with
the following results    : —

    Both alcohols dissolve easily in concentrated sulphuric acid : the mixture
 becomes hot and assumes a dark colour.             After standing for some hours,
a small quantity of tarry matter separates out on dilution with water, the
 clear liquid containing a sulpho-acid in solution, together with the excess
 of sulphuric acid. This mixture was neutralized with carbonate of barium,
the liquid filtered, and evaporated to dryness in a watcr-bath.             The dry
 residue was   treated  with water, and   a barium    salt dissolved, which however
 I did not succeed in obtaining crystallized from either of the alcohols, as the
 solutions, evaporated both in the water-bath and over sulphuric acid, yielded
a   thick syrupy liquid, drying slowly to a gum-like mass, in which no
crystals   could   be detected, and which readily formed with the smallest
 quantity   of water  and alcohol clear solutions, which again, by spontaneous
evaporation, dried into a gum.        The smallness of the qunntity of alcohol
from ethyl-amyl at my disposal has for the present prevented me from
repeating the experiment on a larger scale, which doubtless would have
given a better result.
    In order to obtain the oxidation products of the two alcohols, they were
distilled in a small retort with a mixture of bichromate of potassium and
diluted sulphuric acid.        A violent reaction occurs at first, which soon
diminishes.      The distillate was shaken with a solution of carbonate of
sodium, and the liquid which did not dissolve treated again several times
-with the oxidizing mixture, and the distillate        after each treatment shaken
with the solution of carbonate of sodium.

   The solution of the sodium salt was evaporated to dryness in the water-
hath, the residue distilled with diluted sulphuric acid, and the acid distillate,
consisting of an aqueous liquid on which an oily layer swam, was rectified,
in order to separate traces of sulphuric acid which had spirted over.                 The
oily acid thus obtained possesses      the  odour   of  oenanthylic   acid,  and  consists
entirely of this compound, as the following analyses of the silver-salt prove.
   (a) The acid derived from the hydride alcohol was neutralized with
ammonia, and precipitated with a solution of nitrate of silver.                The white

   In the oxidation of both of the alcohols a strong smell of oenanthol is
observed.      After treating the last distillate with sodium, a small quantity
of an oily liquid remained undissolved, possessing the odour of oenanthol,
and boiling between 150°- 160°.         These liquids gave a crystalline magma
by shaking with a concentrated solution of bisulphite of sodium, a few drops
of a liquid having a pleasant smell remaining undissolved.

   The amyl used in these researches was purified, in order to remove
traces of amyl- ether and iodide of amyl, exactly in the same manner as
ethyl-amyl. It boiled constantly at 158°-159°, and had the specific gravity
0-7275 at 14°.      The hydride of decatyl was isolated from rectified American
petroleum, afterpurifying the portion boiling between 150°-170° by a mixture
of concentrated nitric and sulphuric acids. It boiled at 157°-159°, and had
the specific gravity 0-7461 at 14°.        Pelouze and Cahours found the boiling-
point   of this hydrocarbon    to  be 160°,  and its specific gravity 0-735 at 15°.
The    same hydrocarbon       was found by Greville Williams in the oils from
 Boghead     coal, and described as amyl.         He gives the boiling-point 159°,
 and the specific gravity 0-7365 at 18°.
    Amyl and the decatyl-hydride cannot be distinguished by their odour,
which is exactly the same in the case of all the hydrides and the radical
 hydrocarbons, with the only difference that it is stronger the more volatile
 the substances are.

manner as described in the preparation of chloride of heptyl.
    The chloride of decatyl from amyl is a colourless mobile liquid of a

0-8739 at 14°.       The chloride prepared from hydride of decatyl boils at the
same temperature, 203°-205° ; its specific gravity is 0 898 at 16°-5.               The
odour of this chloride is fainter, not quite so pleasant, a3 if the true smell
was hidden by that of some impurity.                  At first it possesses a yellowish
colour, as Pelouze and Cahours have already observed ; but it can be
obtained quite colourless by repeated distillations, when a small quantity of
a brown residue is always left behind.
   The analysis of the chloride from amyl I have already given in the pre

      The alcohols C1„ HM O were obtained from the acetates by heating them
    with a concentrated solution of caustic potash, and drying the liquids over
    chloride of calcium and a little sodium.    The alcohol derived from amyl
    boils between 2 10°-2 15°;            its specific gravity is 0 8257 at 12°. Itpossesses
    a pleasant penetrating             odour, resembling that of the flowers of Daphne

possible to isolate pure compounds from a mixture of many homologous

myself, whilst engaged for some time upon this subject, that it is much
easier to obtain one of the hydrocarbons free from homologues having lower
boiling-points, than to remove the last traces of higher boiling compounds
which adhere obstinately.  This is the case even,                if,

hydrides have generally first    yellowish colour, and leave dark residues

rectifications,they generally darken again after some time, and brown
flakes separate out.  These observations, as well as the unpleasant odour
which all the compounds derived from the hydrocarbons from petroleum
possess, prove that they contain impurities which will certainly tend to raise
the specific gravities.  Moreover, Dale has shown that the hydrocarbons
obtained from the acids of the series C„ H2n-2 Ot also have   much lower         a
specific gravity than the corresponding petroleum hydrocarbons.
   Hence     appears highly probable that only one series of hydrocarbons of
             it
the formula CnB.2n+2 exists.
   Hydride of ethyl and ethyl are compounds possessing quite an analogous
constitution, and they cannot be fairly compared with alcohol and ether, in
which two groups         H5 and H, and
                                C2          H5,     H5 are separated by an

oxygen   atom,  whilst in the  hydrocarbons all the carbon atoms are united
together in exactly the same manner, and thus only one graphical represen
tation of these bodies           is
                          possible*.
   If, however, as the identity of the two series has not yet been strictly
proved, the view should be preferred that isomeric hydrocarbons exist, we
are compelled to admit also that isomeric chlorides, compound ethers,
alcohols, and olefines exist, as these derivatives of the hydrocarbons show
exactly the same differences as are found in the hydrocarbons themselves,
and all these bodies must then have to be considered as absolutely isomeric.
   The cause of the isomerism so often observed in compounds belonging
to the aromatic series, as well as the cause of homology in these bodies, has
been much elucidated                  by   the beautiful researches    of Fittig on the benzol
hydrocarbons.          He believes that similar relations to those which he has

 III.   "Introductory Memoir on Plane Stigmatics."                      By Alexander
                 J. Ellis,   E.R.S.        Received March 23, 1865.
                                        (Abstract.)
     If from every point in a plane curve parallel straight lines be drawn
cutting a given straight line in another scries of points, the first set of
points, which for convenience may be termed stigmata, will be coordinated
with the second set of points, which may be termed indices, in the same
manner as by the system of ordinates and abscissae in ordinary Cartesian
coordinate plane geometry.
    Now, the writer remarked that the essence of this coordination consisted
in the relation of the two sets of points to each other forming two related
figures, and that the circumstances of the ordinates being parallel, and the
indices    all lying upon one straight line, were accidents.               Moreover, he
observed that these accidents were not regarded in the ordinary Cartesian
equations, where there was nothing to point out that the ordinates were
parallel or the abscissae coincident lines, nor any mention made of the
direction of the ordinates and abscissae.             It seemed    to him that all the
anomalies      which occurred       in   analytical geometry under the name of
" imaginaries,"     were traceable on the one hand to these restrictions in the
 figure, and on the other to the absence of any indication of their existence
in the equations.       He therefore thought that it would be possible to gene
ralize plane coordinate geometry as the expression of the law which connects
two or more plane figures, point for point, indices with stigmata.                  These
relations   would   certainly include all those of ordinary geometry, and would,
apparently,     explain all anomalies hitherto encountered.
    It was necessary, in the first place, to form a conception of such a gene
ralized relation between indices and stigmata.                 Now, in the Cartesian
straight line, the lines connecting any three stigmata are proportional to
the lines connecting the three corresponding indices, and any pair of the
first lines are in the same or opposite directions, according to the relative
directions    of the corresponding pair of the second lines.               If the stigma
figure   and  index  figure  were   no   longer straight    lines,  this  could  be gene
ralized by saying that the triangle formed by three stigmata was directly

similar to the triangle formed by the three corresponding indices.   Again,
in the circle referred to rectangular coordinates, the ordinate is a mean
proportional between the segments of the diameter to which it is perpen
dicular, that        is,
                 the angle between which segments     bisects.itIt was easy
to generalize this by supposing two lines to be drawn from the index,
wherever     might lie on
               it            plane, to the extremities of the same diameter,
                                    a
and the ordinate to bisect the angle between these lines, and to be    mean    a
proportional between   their lengths.    Other curves were generalized in             a
similar manner.
     It
      was then necessary to have     notation which should express the rela

tions of both magnitude  and  direction  in one symbol.   The ordinary nota
tion was found ill adapted for the purpose.      The following was therefore
chosen.    Capital letters were used to represent geometrical points, and two
capital letters to represent   geometrical line in length nnd direction.
                                     a                                    The
operation of changing one such directed line into another, on the same
plane, which the writer had already introduced under the name of clinant*,
was represented in the fractional form, the changed line being written below
and the other above, but instead of capital letters the corresponding small
letters were employed, to show that we were dealing with operations and
not with quantities     and when the changed line was the axis of reference
                            ;
itself,   was not expressed. The notation thus introduced closely simulates
          it
that employed in M. Chasles's       Geome-trie Superieure,' but      totally
                                            '                         it   is
different in principle.   It has the advantage  of clearly showing the geo
metrical operation indicated             by
                                  each algebraical change, and of perfectly
obeying the laws  of ordinary algebra, while    not only generalizes but fre
                                                       it
quently abridges the operations of analysis.   By means of these clinants             it
became easy to express the relations between the stigma figure and index
figure by equations which are of exactly the same character as the Cartesian
equations, and from which the latter, with all their results, can be strictly
deduced.
  In the present introductory memoir the writer has confined himself to
the investigations connected with the stigmatic straight line, explaining its
equation and direction, the intersections of two such lines, the angles be
tween them, and their distances from stigmatic points.     These preliminary
propositions being given  with   the  requisite detail and illustrated   de     by
ducing from them the ordinary Cartesian formulae, the rest of the memoir
is occupied with the generalization of the fundamental theories necessary
for the successful application of the stigmatic theory to plane geometry              ;
such as those relating to the stigmatic triangle, an harmonic ratio of geo
metrical points anywhere situate on plane and of stigmatic rays, pencils
                                                  a

new index figure is coordinated with the same stigma figure, is explained,
and bilinear and directional coordination introduced and illustrated by
applying them to deduce the usual formulae for the transformation of
Cartesian coordinates from oblique to oblique, and from oblique to polar.
This is followed by the most general theory of transversals cutting or inter
secting upon any stigmatic curve, and by trilinear coordination.          The
equation to a stigmatic point is then discussed, giving rise to classes of
stigmatic curves with bipunctual and tripunctual coordination.            The
investigations on trilinear and tripunctual coordination contain generaliza
tions of Professor Pliicker's ' Point and Line Coordinates,' by which their

   Although details have been avoided as much as possible in the latter part
of the memoir, the writer hopes that sufficient has been given to enable
any mathematician to apply the theory with ease and safety to the gene
ralization and linear realization of every theory on plane geometry which
has hitherto    been propounded.     The conception is equally applicable to
solid geometry, but will there require the algebra of quaternions, which,
being non-commutative, establishes a well-marked line of separation between
plane and solid stigmatics.     The writer has not found a trace of this gene
ralization in the works of any previous author, but the relations, when
pointed out, appear too obvious to have escaped all notice hitherto.      The
writer believes that in any case no complete theory, such as that presented
in this memoir, has been previously founded upon any similar conception.

I   had the honour of communicating                 to the Royal Society in May last, and
of which an abstract appeared in the 'Proceedings' for June 16, 1864.
The former series of experiments did not pretend to be, in any respect, com
plete. Those which 1 am now about to describe will, I hope, be con
sidered to be more so in regard to one main subject of the inquiry1; but
they also suggest further researches upon some collateral branches of                             it,
which hope to find time and opportunity to prosecute.
        I
   In the former series experimented with animal substances mixed with
                                 I
water and enclosed in glass bulbs in atmospheres either of common air
passed through red-hot tubes or of various gases, and the result at which
I                                was present organisms of
     arrived was that where oxygen                          low type were           a
produced, but not so where that gas was not present.  Thus,  whatever the
gas employed, where the substance was not boiled, the organisms ap
peared  but in the instances in which the substance was boiled, they appeared
           ;
where oxygen or common air was used, but not where nitrogen, hydrogen,
or carbonic acid was employed.       One experiment only appeared to have
produced  result which could not be reconciled with the rest, viz. in which
                    a
some meat and water had been boiled and sealed up in an atmosphere of
nitrogen. Iu this, some organisms were found but so completely was this
                                                                ;
result unlike that found in the whole of the rest of the series, that   felt                 1
convinced that some   error must have been made  in the experiment itself.
  The experiments now to be described have a narrower range than the
others. With the exception of  few, which were mere repetitions of the
                                               a
experiments   with nitrogen just referred to, and which were undertaken
solely with the view of seeing whether the experiment just mentioned were
correct or not, they are confined to the single object of observing whether
or not organisms are found in close vessels containing vegetable matter and
water sealed up in an atmosphere of common air previously passed through
    an efficient heating apparatus.
      In  these experiments  have adopted some slight modifications of the
                                      I
    apparatus used in the former ones.  That now employed consists of                              a
    porcelain tube, the central part of which      filled with roughly pounded
                                                           is

    bulb   joined
           is     which  contains the substance to be experimented upon. The
    bulb has two narrow necks or tubes, each of which      drawn out before the

     being made thoroughly  hot immediately before the cork   inserted, the cork

    itself being taken out of boiling water, and the neck of the bulb being also
    heated with     spirit-lamp immediately before

 holder,   and bubbles through the* sulphuric acid at the other end.               The
 substance in the bulb is then boiled for ten or fifteen minutes, the lamp
 withdrawn, and the bulb allowed to cool while the stream of air is still
 passing through the porcelain tube, maintained during the whole time at
 a vivid red heat.      When the bulb is quite cool, the necks are sealed by
 means of a lamp.        The advantage gained by means of this apparatus is
 that there is only    one joint the perfection of which in any degree affects
 the success of the experiment, and of that joint it is easy to make sure.
 The porcelain tube also being, for a considerable part of its length, filled with
 small fragments of porcelain, all heated up to redness, easily ensures that
 every particle of air admitted to the bulb shall be thoroughly heated.              A
precisely similar arrangement was       used     for the nitrogen experiments, sub
stituting glass
            a        combustion-tube   filled  with   copper-turnings   for the porce
lain tube, and a piece of india-rubber tubing for the india-rubber cork.
The copper oxide was reduced by means of a stream of hydrogen when
necessary between one experiment and the next.
   A single experiment was tried on May 1 8, 1 864, using apparatus similar
to that employed in the experiments of the previous year.
   Some pea-meal infused in water was boiled in a stream of heated air,
allowed to cool, and then sealed and put by.             I was then prevented from
resuming my experiments for several weeks.
   Then several experiments were made with nitrogen, for the purpose of
confirming or correcting the nitrogen experiment of the previous year.
Into the particulars of these I need not now enter, further than to say
that seven experiments were tried with various infusions.               Five of them
were afterwards      examined, and in no case were any organisms found, thus
confirming     me   in the opinion already       expressed upon that experiment.
The series with which I am now concerned began on July 1 8.
VII. July     18. — Hay infused in water three hours, then filtered and boiled
         12 minutes in a stream of heated air, and sealed up as above de
         scribed.
VIII. July      18. — A similar experiment     :  boiled  10^- minutes.
IX. July 22. — Toppings, i.      e. coarse   flour infused in cold water      3 hours,
         filtered and boiled 10   minutes in a similar stream of air.
X. July 22. — A similar experiment:          boiled also 10 minutes.
XI. July 25. — A similar experiment: boiled 12 minutes.
XII. July 25. — A similar experiment : boiled 10 minutes.
XIII. July 28. — Some sage-leaves bruised and infused in lukewarm                water
         previously boiled.     Allowed to stand 15 hours, filtered, and the
         clear fluid boiled 10 minutes in a stream of heated air, as in the
         other cases, and sealed up.
XIV. July      28. — A similar experiment : boiled 7 minutes.
XV.    July 29.— A similar infusion of celery, allowed to stand            12-^ hours,
         and treated as the last : boiled 1 2 minutes.
   The bulb used in this last experiment           was  of a different form,  which  I

have found much more convenient, and have always employed in my sub
sequent experiments, which are presently to be described (as represented in
the figure).
   The examination of the above series of experiments took place partly on
Sept. 1 9, when Dr. Beale kindly visited me at Oxford, in order to give me
his valuable assistance, and partly at Dr. Beale's home in London, on Nov.
16, 1864.
Exp. of May      18. — Viz. pea-meal   and water.    -In this were found
        small organisms moving, as given by Dr. Beale in the
         accompanying drawing marked Z. Their size was extremely                   „

Exp. IX. — Coarse flour+water+heated air. The result of this experiment
        was unsatisfactory, and serves well to show the difficulty of the
        decision upon these questions.
   Even with the high powers above named, we were unable to be certain
of our result in this and several following cases. There were no organisms
distinctly recognizable as such, but many minute round spore-like bodies
moving about the field.
Exp. X. — The fellow experiment to the last, and similarly unsatisfactory.
Exp. XIII. — Sage + water -f heated air.        A few crystals were seen, but
        no organisms.
Exp. XV. — Celery + water + heated        air.    Some   prismatic     crystals; no
        organisms.
   It was resolved to leave the rest of these experiments till a longer time
should have elapsed since the vessels were closed.      The examination was ac
cordingly resumed Nov. 16.
Exp.  XII. — Coarse    flour + water+heated    air, contained some indeterminate
        granular matter and some few bodies which might be dead bacte
        riums, but nothing that could safely be considered as such.
Exp.   XI. — The fellow experiment to XII., and equally without result.
Exp. XIV. — Sage + water + heated air, gave also no definite result.
   Now, omitting altogether the nitrogen experiments,        seven in number, we

182                            Dr. G. Child on the Production of                          [Apr. 27,
have here a series  of ten experiments instituted with a view of showing
whether organisms can be produced in vegetable infusions within closed
vessels supplied with heated air.  In my desire to try a variety of sub
stances I took almost anything which my garden afforded, and in this way
probably my selection of sage and celery may have been a bad one, as the
aromatic  ingredients of these plants may be supposed to influence the
result of the experiment, especially as in a close vessel any volatile oil
would be retained.    If, therefore, the three experiments with these sub
stances be eliminated, there remain seven experiments, one with pea-meal,
two with hay, and four with coarse flour.  Of these, five were examined on
Sept. 19, and in three (viz. the pea-meal and the two hay experiments)the
vessels were found to contain moving organisms.    In two (those performed
with coarse flour) none were found, and in the remaining two, examined on
Nov. 16, also none were found.
  In  the meantime, when, from several of the above experiments having
produced negative results, I looked upon the series as inconclusive,                                  I
instituted a fresh series of twelve experiments in the end                     of September,       as
follows.
  The apparatus employed                was     the same as that used in the last series,
except that       I
              had some large double bulbs made for the present series.                             In
other respects the process was the same as before.

            1 0 minutes in a stream of heated air — sealed up when cool.

                      1    minutes, as before, and sealed.

Nob.   II., IV., VI., VIII., X., XII.,                were placed on     high shelf in my
                                                                           a

  The object of the latter arrangement was to ensure the vessels                                 being
kept warm enough during the winter months    but the heat was, ;                             1    have
no doubt,         too great.      I   saw      the thermometer     on more than one occa.

sion over 140° Fahr., and have reason to believe that I did not see it
at its highest. Moreover, the bulbs here were almost wholly deprived of
light.     Thus, before opening the vessels, I had made up my mind that the
results of the other half of the series were most to be depended upon. The
temperature of the room in which they were probably never fell below 40°
Fahr.,    and was generally between 50° and 60°.
    The   examination of the B division of this series took place at Dr. Beale's
house, Feb. 7, 1865. The results were as follows: —                               IV.
Exp. IV. — Hay         -f- water + heated air.       A few bacteriums were       t    %
          found in active motion (see drawing by Dr. Beale).                         «

          large numbers         of similar    organisms           ^
          were found.                                       —~                  UTS

          pared  with     the last, but still several  in active motion.
Exp. XII. — Flour + water + oxygen.               No organisms found.
Exp. VIII. — Flour + water-)- heated           air (unfiltered).   A  good many bac
          teriums, similar to the others.
Exp. X. — Flour + water + oxygen (unfiltered).               Some bacteriums, but not
          moving.
    The other   set   of experiments was examined by me at Oxford on various
evenings between Feb. 16 and March 8 ; but during some part of that time
 I possessed no object-glass of sufficient magnifying power to avoid all un
 certainty in the results.
    In both of them, viz. Nos. V. and XI., I could find nothing like bacte
riums. In the three others, viz. III., VII. and IX., there werewhat appeared
 to me dead ones (but a dead bacterium is an object of which few persons
who have seen many would think it very safe to be very positive), and in
one only, viz. No. I., an infusion of hay, were they numerous and moving.
This   I  mention particularly, because the objects were very well seen, and
moving actively in the first slide which             I  examined, and could be the
better seen on account of the clearness of the fluid and the absence of
granular matter     ;   but upon examining several portions after the      vessel had
been open for a few minutes, though they continued to be seen in equally
large numbers, all movement had ceased.                 They were examined with a
-fa object-glass of Messrs. Powell and Lealand.                Now, if we omit from
these two series of experiments those which I have already shown reason to
distrust, we have, in all, seven in the first, and six in the second series,
which seem fairly to test the question ; and these having been examined by
Dr. Beale, as well as myself, bacteriums were found and seen by both of us
in three out of the first seven, and five out of the remaining six —in all, in
eight.

   Now, it may be asked, why the same or similar organisms were not
found in the other cases, if the experiments were fairly tried ? The answer
is this, viz. that we do not know all the conditions under which they exist.
It is pretty clear that they appear more easily in some substances than in
others.    Thus, in the first series above described, it will be noticed that the
four instances in which none were found were all those in which coarse
flour was the substance used. In the remaining three, where pea-meal or
hay were employed, there the bacteriums were seen.           So also in the other
series, the one case in which nothing was found was a case in which flour
was used, and in the remaining five the most numerous and distinct
bacteriums were seen in the hay infusion.      This may arise possibly from the
fact that the infusion of flour is not so clear as the others, and always con
tains more granular matter ; thus bacteriums are less easily distinguished
in it : and, where doubtful, it is my practice to decide in the negative ; that
is to say, unless the bacteriums are clearly seen, I enumerate the experi
ment amongst those in which they are not found.     Further, it is possible
that in some infusions they may live and die sooner than in others, and in
most   of       experiments with flour there was a mass of indeterminate
            these
granular matter which might have contained the bodies of whole popula
tions of bacteriums.   Finally, it is quite possible that they might, if exist
ing in small numbers, escape observation.     Their minuteness is extreme,
and observation of them far from easy. At any rate, positive evidence in
a matter of this kind is of more value than negative ; and the fact that in
eight cases out of thirteen they have been seen, not by myself only, but also
by so accurate and practised a microscopist as Dr. Beale, is of more weight
than our having been unable to discover them in the remaining five cases.
   The question which now remains to be discussed      how is,   that the
                                                                     it   is
results above given so entirely disagree with those arrived at by M. Pasteur,
and now, to certain extent, vouched for by the Commission of the Academy
               a
of Sciences.    Ihave observed all the precautions which M. Pasteur him
self speaks of as " exaggerated," yet    have shown bacteriums to be pro
                                         I
duced exactly under the circumstances in which he asserts that they do not
exist. I believe this discrepancy   very easily accounted for. M. Pasteur,
                                    is
in his memoir, speaks of examining his substances with           power of 350
                                                                 a
diameters.    Now my experience throughout has been that         it   is
                                                                     impossible
to recognize these minute objects, with any degree of certainty, even with
double that magnifying power.       When once their existence on         slide
                                                                           a      is

wards to recognize the same object with      a  power of 750, but     Ihave re
peatedly failed to satisfy myself in the first instance with the latter power;
and on the one occasion on which enjoyed the use of an object-glass giving
                                  I
a power of 3000 diameters,   I found the recognition of these very minute
objects rendered very much more easy.       On one occasion     tried thje effect
                                                                 1

person has only to examine the drawings which accompany this communi
cation (in one particularly, that marked Z) in order to satisfy himself that
to come to any conclusion as to the presence or absence of such objects as
are there represented, with a magnifying power of little more than    linear                    \
measurement of that from which they are drawn, would be quite impossible.
The Commission of the Academy of Sciences, which has not yet concluded
its labours, has not, so far as its present report goes, concerned itself with
the microscopy of the question ; it has, in fact, confined itself to the dispute
(which has almost become a personal one) between MM. Pasteur and
Pouchet. It is worth noticing, that the fact so often referred to by writers
on this subject, of the fluid in the closed vessels becoming cloudy or not as
a test of the presence or absence of bacteriums, is not satisfactory ;      have                 I
constantly predicted, from the   cloudiness or clearness of an infusion, the pre
sence or absence         of bacteriums, and very frequently               been       mistaken   — quite
as often too      in the former           case as in the latter.
     As to the conclusions which can                   be drawn      from these
                                                                         experiments,                     I
need      say very   few words.              I   can now have no doubt of the fact that
"  bacteriums" can be produced in hermetically-sealed vessels containing an
infusion of organic matter, whether animal or vegetable, though supplied
only with air passed through a red-hot tube with all necessary precautions
for ensuring the thorough heating of every portion of       and though the     it,
infusion itself be thoroughly boiled.  But how far this fact affects the
              of what           called       "                                 "
question                  is                     spontaneous      generation       is   quite another
matter.
     It       clear that either (1) the germs of bacterium are capable of
          seems
resisting the  boiling temperature in fluid, or (2) they are spontaneously
                                                      a
generated, or (3) they are not "organisms" at all.       was myself some  I
what inclined to the latter belief concerning them at one time but 9ome                  ;
researches on which     am now engaged have gone far to convince me that
                          I
they      are really minute vegetable forms.
  The choice therefore seems to remain between the other two conclusions.
Upon these will not venture positive opinion, but remark only, that

be true that "germs" can resist the boiling temperature in fluid, then both

because his experiments were not most admirably performed, but simply
because the magnifying power of his microscope was insufficient for the
work to which he applied it.     desire to append two remarks to this

so well expressed in his memoir, to heterogeny in all forms, viz. that                          it   is

in exact proportion as our observation of them has become more exact,
until at last it has been compelled to take refuge in those lowest forms
 which we are almost or altogether unable to observe, is really of little or
 no force.      Its cogency depends on analogy, and the analogy has no
 existence.     It is quite equally to be expected h priori that if any forms of
 life are generated spontaneously, they will be the very lowest and simplest
 forms, and since these happen to be also the most minute, the objection
loses its whole force.      And it is also a thing to be expected that we should
 find only the lowest forms, the earliest, i. e. in the scale of existence, produced
under the disadvantageous circumstances in which they must be placed in
 such experiments as those above detailed.
     The other remark is this, that, so far as my present researches have led
 me,    I cannot but look upon improvement in the construction of micro
scopes,    and increase   of their power,  as the only way   in which our means of
investigation of such questions as the production of Bacterium is likely to
be largely increased.       The ^ object-glass recently constructed by Messrs.
 Powell and Lealand, of which a notice has appeared in the Proceedings of
the Royal Society, has already shown something like an appearance of
structure in these minute objects, and leaves, I think, no doubt about
their organic character.

         Smith, M.A., Corresponding Member of the Scientific Com
         mittee of the Imperial Russian Navy. Received March 23, 1865.
     1.  The 'Pervenetz'      is an iron- built armour-plated ship of war, con
structed     for the Russian Government by the Thames Iron and Ship-
Building Company at their works at Blackwall.
    2. The following are her dimensions : —

    3.   The upper and main decks were plated with sheet iron.
    4 . The greater pnrt of the side plating was fixed in England and while
the observations recorded in the paper were made, but no part of the end
plating was fixed, the plates being taken on board and carried as cargo.
    The direction of her head in building was S. 22° 1 7' W. magnetic.
    5. The author was commissioned by the Russian Government to super
intend the compass equipment           and compass correction     of the ship.   He

arrived in England a few days before the launch, and immediately under
took the observation of the deviation and the horizontal and vertical force
at various selected positions in the ship.             These were the following, viz.
five positions on the upper deck, about 4 ft. 6 in. above the deck, distin
guished     as 6, c, d, e,   f, going from stern to bow ; b abaft the mizen-mast,
e  immediately       before the mizen-mast, d before the main-mast, e about the
                                   f
middle of the length, and before the fore-mast : three on the main deck,
g, k, I; g halfway between the mizen and mainmasts, k below d, and I
below   f:   two in the hold, near the centre of the ship, m and n : b being
near the place where the neutral plane or rather the surface separating the
part of the ship which displayed north magnetism from that which displayed
south magnetism intersected the deck, was selected as a place for the
standard compass, and a place was prepared for it by making there a false
hatchway or compass platform, by replacing an iron beam by a wooden beam,
and substituting wood planks for iron plates at that part of the deck.

    (1) The small deviations on the stocks of the compasses in every
position, except near the north end of the ship, where, probably from the
armour-plating not being fixed, irregular deviations were to be expected. -
                                                                              2 p

    (2) The great diminution of horizontul force, especially near the south
end.
    (3) The very great increase of vertical force near the south end on the
upper      deck, and the great diminution        of the vertical force in descending.
From these we infer that there would be a very large heeling error to
windward at /, and a large heeling error to leeward on the main deck.
    (4) The very large amount of semicircular deviation, both as regards
93   and (£, the last having a large negative value in consequence                      of the
port-side of the vessel having been to the south in building.
    8. The best place for the compass is point b, near which                   the standard
compass was afterwards fixed.
    9. We also see that at the point / the deviations exceed 180°.                    It is to
be observed, however, that from the armour-plating                     not being fixed, we
must not accept this as. an instance of what the deviation would be in a
completed vessel.
    10. The ' Pervenetz' was launched             on the 21st       of May, and on the
same     day moved to the Victoria Decks*              On the way and in the dock
the deviations were observed at the point b, and the following values of
93,   S, 2) were obtained : —

    14. Comparing these values with those in Table             I.,    we see the great
changes which the magnetism of the ship had undergone in the Victoria
Docks.
    15. The ship having her head to the east instead of to the west, all the
d's had changed from — to -f, and having had her head to north instead of
south, all the SB's had diminished.
    16. From the same cause we see that Z at the stern increases, at the
bow diminishes ; at d there is an increase of Z, owing to the machinery
tinder that part of the deck.
     1 7. At one point in the main deck Z is negative, showing that the up
ward vertical force of the ship was greater than the vertical force of the
earth.       The great apparent change in H arises from the part of the ship
which was south in building, and which consequently attracted the north
end of the ship, having been directed to the north, and increasing instead
of diminishing the directive force.
    18. The force of the ship was greatest when the ship was first placed
with her head in the new position, and greatly diminished                afterwards, as
will be seen from the following Table.

 to be attributed partly to the want of the transverse armour-plating at the
 extremities, and to the comparatively small number of bulkheads giving a
 smaller — e than in the iron-plated ships of the Royal Navy, and partly to
 the armour-plating of the sides being continued on each side of the com

    24. The only change in her magnetism on the voyage was an increase
in the +(£, which was no doubt owing to the starboard side being south.
    25. The principal practical conclusions to be derived from the observa
tions in the ' Pervenetz seem to be, —
                           '
    (1) That iron ships should be built head south.
    (2) That in whatever direction an iron armour-plated ship is built,
she ought to be placed in the opposite direction while plating, so as to
reduce the semicircular deviation as much as possible.          This results also
from the observations made in the ships of the Royal Navy ; but the plan
of plating a ship in the opposite direction to that of building was first
practised intentionally, and with the design of reducing the semicircular
deviation, in the 'Pervenetz,' and, as will have been seen, with complete
success.
    (3) That great and rapid changes take place in the semicircular de
viation some time after launching.
    (4) The great amount of information both as to the semicircular de
viation and the heeling error, which can be obtained by appropriate
observations made while the vessel is building.
   (5) The importance for this and other purposes,              of reducing and
recording   the deviations   of all iron ships, so as to obtain the values of the
coefficients, and particularly X and 3), and to be able to estimate them in
any new ship of the same class.
   (6) The great importance of preparing         a proper place for the reception
of the Standard Compass in the construction of an iron ship.

       Action of Zinc upon a mixture of Ethyl Oxalate and Amyl Io

       Esq. Received March 30.
   When    a mixture   of equivalent proportions of ethyl oxalate and amyl
iodide is digested with granulated zinc at 70° C., the zinc is gradually
dissolved, while much hydride of amyl and amylene are given off.             The
mixture finally assumes a viscous or semisolid condition, and, when treated
with water, produces a further quantity of hydride of amyl, which distils

  192           Messrs. Frankland and Duppa— On                the Acids       [April 27'
  off at  a gentle heat.     On the subsequent application         of a   higher tempera
 ture, water, accompanied by amylic alcohol, amyl iodide, and an ethereal
 liquid, distils over, the three latter forming a mixture, the separation of
 which into its component parts presents rather formidable difficulties.
  After drying with chloride of calcium, this oily mixture begins to boil at
 about 132° C.; the product first passing over consists principally of amylic
 alcohol, mixed with amyl iodide.              Afterwards the thermometer rapidly
 rises to 200°    C,   between    which    temperature and 205° C. a considerable
 section of the remaining liquid, which we will call A, passes over.                There
 then occurs a further rapid rise of temperature until the thermometer
 remains stationary between 222° and 226°.               The section collected between
 these points we will call B.         Finally, the temperature rises to 260°-264°,
 between which points        the remaining liquid (C) passes over.           By repeated
 fractional distillation, the larger portion of the section A was obtained at
 the nearly fixed boiling-point of 203° C.              This liquid was submitted to
 analysis,   and  yielded  numbers     closely corresponding with the formula
                                         C„H13O,.
 Interpreted by further results detailed below, this formula resolves itself into

The ethereal body with the lowest boiling-point produced in this reaction
is therefore ethylic amylohydroxalate, or oxalic ether in which one atom
of oxygen is replaced by one atom of amyl and one of hydrogen.                       This
body also stands in very close relation to lactic ether ; for if the atom of
methyl in lactic ether be replaced by amyl, ethylic amylohydroxalate is
produced.

   We have not attempted to give a name to the body from which ethylic
amylohydroxalate is directly produced by the action of water, as shown in
the last of the foregoing equations.        The resources of chemical nomencla
ture, already too severely taxed, would scarcely be able to elaborate a
rational name for this body, which consists of oxalic ether wherein an atom
of oxygen is replaced, half by amyl and half by zincmonamyl, whilst a
second atom of zincmonamyl is substituted for one of ethyl.
   Ethylic amylohydroxalate is a somewhat oily, transparent, and slightly
straw-coloured liquid of specific gravity -9449 at 13° C., possessing a plea
sant aromatic odour and a burning taste.             It boils at 203° C., and has a
vapour-density of 5-47. The above        formula    requires 6-0, which is removed
to an unusual extent from the experimental number.               To this discrepancy
we shall again refer presently.
   Section B of the oily liquid, after careful rectification,         gave a product
boiling at 224-225°, and yielded         on analysis      results agreeing with the
formula

   We were at first inclined to regard this as the actual constitution of the
new ether, believing it to be possible that ethylic oxalate and amylic iodide
mutally decomposed each other, producing a mixture of amylic and ethylic
oxalates with the iodides of amyl and ethyl.            An analogous decomposition
of mixed ethereal salts of oxygen acids has been recently noticed, but the
test of experiment obliged us to abandon this view of the reaction.               We
found, it is true, a remarkable depression of temperature, amounting to
9-3° C., on mixing one atom of ethyl oxalate with one of amylic iodide,
but on submitting the mixture to distillation, the thermometer rose to the
boiling-point of amylic iodide (147°) before ebullition commenced; thus
showing    that none     of the much more volatile ethylic iodide had been
formed.     No transfer of radicals therefore takes place when ethylic oxalate
is heated with amylic iodide, and consequently no zincethyl can be formed
when this mixture is acted upon by zinc.          We therefore prefer to view the
ether now under consideration as ethylic ethyl-amylhydroxalate,             analogous
in constitution to Wurtz's ethylic"    ethyl lactate.

an aromatic but somewhat amylic odour and a burning taste.         Its specific
gravity was found to be -9399 at 1 3° C.   It boils between 224°  and  225° C.

 evaporates,  and   diamyloxalic     acid crystallizes in the hot solution as a
 beautiful network of brilliant silky fibres, which, after being well washed in
 cold water and dried at 100°, yielded on analysis numbers closely corre

    Diamyloxalic acid presents the appearance of colourless satiny fibres,
which are insoluble in water, but soluble in alcohol and ether. This acid
is remarkable for its high melting-point,               122° C., in which respect it
 surpasses any of the acids of this series. Its melting-point is very sharply
 defined, and it solidifies immediately on a very slight reduction of tempera
ture. Heated more strongly, it sublimes and condenses on a cold surface
in white crystalline flakes like snow.
      No. VI. Action of Zinc upon Amylic Oxalate and Ethylic Iodide.
    Equivalent proportions of amylic oxalate and ethylic iodide were digested
at 50° to 6O0 C, with excess of granulated zinc, for several days.                 The
reaction proceeded with extreme sluggishness, and was not completed before
the expiration of a week. Being then mixed with water and submitted to
distillation, an oily liquid passed over, which, on rectification, was ultimately
resolved into amylic alcohol and an ethereal liquid, which analysis proved
to be amylic leucate.

    Amylic     leucate is a colourless,    transparent, and slightly oily liquid,
possessing a fragrant odour      of a somewhat amylic character.       It is insoluble
in wafer1,- but miscible in all proportions with alcohol and ether.                Its
specific gravity   is -93227  at  13°  C.   It boils  constantly at 225°   C,  and  its
vapour has a density of 6*74 (theoretical 6-97).
    The boiling-point and specific gravity, in the liquid form, of amylic leu
cate and its isomer, ethylic amylethoxalate, are almost absolutely identical.
Leucate of amyl is readily decomposed by either aqueous or alcoholic
solutions   of the alkalies, or by baryta-water, yielding amylic alcohol and a
leucate of the base.
No.    VII.  Action    of Zinc   upon a mixture      of Amyl Oxalate and Amyl
                                       Iodide.
    When equivalent proportions of the amyl iodide and amyl oxalate are
heated gently in contact with zinc, a brisk reaction soon sets in.               After
 evolving much hydride of amyl and amylene, the whole solidifies to a
 gum-like mass, which, on distillation with water, yields an oily liquid
 resembling that obtained when ethyl oxalate is employed.            We have every
 reason to believe that the same series of ethers as those described in note
 No. V. are here produced, with the difference that they are amylic,
 instead of ethylic ethers.       This difference of base, however, renders it
 impossible successfully     to  separate these ethers from each other, their
 boiling-points being so high as to determine decomposition when their
 distillation is attempted.      We might, it is true, have decomposed the
 mixed ethers with solution of baryta, and thus have obtained the mixed
 acids, but the task of disentangling the latter appeared also so hopeless,
 that we have not attempted it.

        Frankland, F.R.S., and B. F. Duppa, Esq. Received April 5,
        1865.
     For  some time past we have been engaged        in the study of the consecutive
  action of sodium and the iodides of methyl and ethyl upon acetic ether.
  When iodide of methyl is used, the chief products of the reaction are two
  ethereal bodies possessing respectively formulae, which we will provisionally
  write as follows  : —

     These bodies are decomposed, even in the cold, by baryta-water, yielding
  barium carbonate, alcohol, and two new ethereal liquids having formulae
  which, without expressing any opinion        as to   their nature or constitution,
  may be thus written : —

     We have also obtained corresponding results by the employment of
 iodide   of ethyl in place of iodide of methyl, and are now occupied in
 the preparation of a paper containing the details of this investigation,
 which we hope very soon to have the honour of laying before the Royal
 Society*.     In the meantime, however, some of our results are so remark
 able that we hasten to communicate them at once in this preliminary note.
     It has been proved by Kolbe and Frankland, nearly twenty years ago,
 that methyl is a constituent of acetic acidf, and in the year 1857 these
 chemists were the first to propose the derivation of this and a large number
 of other organic compounds from the carbonic acid or tetratomic carbon
 type J.    According to this view, which is now gradually receiving               the
 assent of chemists, the rational formula of acetic ether is
                                         fcn3

    Thus the radical methyl, in acetic ether, contains three single atoms of
hydrogen, combined with a tetratomic atom of carbon.                 If one of these
atoms    of hydrogen  be replaced by methyl, an ether, having the composition
of  propionic  ether, will  obviously be produced :

   * Whilst engaged in these experiments we became aware, through the ' Jahresberieht
der Chemie,' that the reaction had already been studied by Geuther, who, however,
owing to his having conducted the process in a somewhat different manner, obtained
only two of the compounds above mentioned, viz. the body C7 Hla O, by the aotion of
¦odium and iodide of methyl upon acetic ether, and the compound C, H,, O, in tho
corresponding reaction with iodido of ethyl.

of calcium, this liquid begins to boil at about 40° C., when a considerable
amount of ethylic ether comes over.      Afterwards the temperature rises to
70°, between which point and 80° some acetic ether, which had escaped
the action of the sodium, distils.                   The remainder of the distillate, which

   was collected apart, came over between 80° and 250°.               By repeated
   rectification, in addition to other products, which belong to another part
   of the investigation, two liquids were obtained in considerable quantity,
   one of which boiled at 1 1 8°-l 22°, and the other at about 1 50°-l 57° C. On
  treating these liquids with boiling baryta- water for several hours, the point
  of ebullition of the first was rendered quite constant at 1 1 9°, and that of
  the second at 151°. Submitted to analysis, the first of these liquids yielded
  results closely coinciding with those calculated from the formula of butyric
  ether,

     The boiling-point of the new ether also coincides exactly with that of
  butyric ether, as does also its vapour-density, which was found to be 3*96,
  the vapour-density of butyric ether being 4-04.        Its density in the liquid
 state is -8942 at 0°C., that of butyric ether being -9019 at 0° C. The
 synthesized butyric ether is readily decomposed by alcoholic potash, yielding
 alcohol and a salt which, when distilled with excess of sulphuric acid,
 gives a powerfully acid oily liquid, tolerably soluble in water, possessing in
 a high degree the characteristic odour of butyric acid, and boiling fixedly
 at 161°C.       The boiling-point of butyric acid has been variously stated by
 different observers:     Pelouze  and Gelis give it as 164°, whilst H. Kopp
 makes it 157°, at 760 millims. pressure.          This acid gave numbers, on
 analysis, exactly corresponding with the formula

    We reserve for     a future  communication   the decision  of the question as
to whether the butyric acid thus obtained is identical with that produced
by the process of fermentation ; but we may now state that the synthesized
butyric ether possesses, in a very dilute form, a fruity smell, but differing
in this respect somewhat from that of the butyric ether ordinarily sold as
essence of pine-apples.      We have also reproduced the ether from the baryta-
salt with the same result as regards odour.

sodium and iodide of ethyl, is expressed by the following equations : —

    Diethacetic     ether    boils constantly at 151° C.             The boiling-point of
 ordinary caproic      ether  is  stated  by  Lerch   to   be  120°, and by Fehling 162°.
 These numbers differ so widely that it is impossible to use them for com
 parison. Its specific gravity at 0° C. is *8822 (according to Fehling the
density of caproic ether is -882 at 18° C.), and its vapour-density 5*00,
the theoretical number being 4-98.                   On analysis it yielded numbers
corresponding       with    the    above   formula.       Diethacetic ether possesses a
peculiar and somewhat pleasant odour, somewhat resembling oil of pepper
mint ; it is insoluble in water, but miscible in all proportions with alcohol
and ether.         Treated with alcoholic potash it is readily decomposed,
yielding alcohol and potassium diethacetate, and by distilling the latter
with dilute sulphuric acid, diethacetic acid distils over and floats on the
surface of the water which accompanies it.                     This acid reddens litmus-
paper powerfully, is very sparingly soluble in water, and emits a peculiar
odour, quite different from that of ordinary caproic acid.                      Boiled with
water and carbonate of silver it yields, on filtration and evaporation in
vacuo, splendid fern-like crystals, which, after pressing between folds of
blotting-paper and drying in vacuo, with the exclusion of light, are perfectly
white, with a satiny lustre ; they possess great elasticity, and are remark
ably like asbestos.       In a strong light they rapidly become brown.                  Sub-

       George Gore, Esq.           CommInicated by Professor Stokes, Sec.
       R.S. Received March 30, 1865.
    In a former communication       to the Royal Society " On the Properties of
Liquefied Carbonic Acid,"        printed in the Philosophical Transactions for
 1861 (also in the Journal of the Chemical         Society, vol. xv., page 163)*,
   * The reader is referred to the above communication for details of information
respecting the apparatus employed and manipulation adopted.

1865.]                  Liquefied Hydrochloric Acid Gas.
I   described a mode of manipulation whereby various solid substances were
introduced into that liquefied gas whilst under very great pressures (vary
ing from 500 to 1100 pounds per square inch), and the action of the
liquid upon them observed.
    The experiments described in the present paper were made in a similar
manner, but with some improvements in safety of manipulation, and in
the mode of discharging the tubes, so as to recover the immersed solids in
a satisfactory   state.
    The glass tubes in which the gas was condensed were about -^ths of an
inch internal diameter, and fully £ ths of an inch external diameter.        Each
tube was, before bending, 11^ inches long; it was bent, at 1^ inch and
6\ inches respectively from one end, to the form already described in the
paper referred to, thus giving 5 inches in length for the salt, 5 inches for
the acid, and         inch for the liquefied gas.     These distances are essen
tial ; for if the quantities of acid and salt are not properly proportioned to
each other, and to the remaining        space in the tube, the liquefied product
will   be very small.    The   curve in  the tube between the acid and the salt
should be very gradual, and the other bend much less so. The end of the.
tube containing the salt should be constructed open, with a flange, and be
 closed securely by a plug of gutta percha in the same manner as the
 upper end.
     The materials used were strong sulphuric acid and fragments of sal-
 ammoniac.       Each tube was placed in a deal frame or box 10 inches high,
 8 inches wide, and 4 inches from front to back, open at the back, and
 with a front or door of wire gauze. The tube was supported by a cork
 fitting into a hole in the side of the frame, and was secured within a notch
 in the cork by a ligature of wire.       By means of this arrangement the acid
 and salt were brought into mutual contact by turning the box itself, with
 out incurring the danger of putting one's hand inside the box and turning
 the tube alone, as in the former experiments.
     The annexed figures (1 & 2) represent the position of the box, 1st, when
 charged and ready for the decomposition of the sal-ammoniac ; and 2nd,
 after the decomposition is completed.         The arrows indicate the direction
 in which the box is turned.
     The action at first should be very slow ; otherwise the bubbles of gas
 will convey the sulphuric acid into the short end of the tube, and endanger
  the purity of the liquefied hydrochloric acid. The action of the acid was
  less violent  than when generating carbonic acid, and the process was less
  frequently stopped by clogging of the tube. The liquefied gas was condensed
  in contact with the various solid bodies by application (from behind) of
  cotton   wool, wetted with ether, to the short end      of the tube,   as in the
  former experiments.
     Each tube was discharged of its contents by taking hold of it with an
   ordinary wooden screw clamp support, and immersing its lower end in a
  vessel of nearly boiling water behind a protecting screen. The explosion
                                                                    r  2

 quickly occurred,     generally without fracture of the tube, and the sub
 stances operated upon could in nearly all cases be readily extracted for
 examination without suffering injury by coming into contact with the saline
 contents of the tube.       Powdered substances, however, were frequently lost
 during   the  discharge, owing to the sudden expansion of the gas in their
 pores expelling them from the small glass cup. The great degree of pressure
 (probably about 700 pounds per square inch and upwards) to which the
 various substances were subjected, frequently made them very hard.
                          Rg  1.                              Fig. 2.
    The chief inconvenience       met  with in these experiments arose from
 the action    of the liquefied acid upon the upper gutta-percha        stopper,
 causing the acid     to  become  dark red-brown and opaque, and preventing
 accurate observation of the substances — also, on discharge of the tube,
 causing the glass cup and its contents to become coated with a tenacious
film of gutta percha.       To obviate this inconvenience   as much as possible,
 the inner    end   of the upper stopper    was  carefully  coated with melted
paraffin.
    During    the   early part of each experiment, the liquefied acid was
repeatedly poured back, and redistilled by the application of ether, in order
to free it from colour imparted to it by the stopper, and also to make its
solvent or other action upon the immersed body more rapid. The action
of the liquid acid upon the bodies was only continued a few days ; and in
many cases the acid was not in a liquid state the whole of the time, but
only at intervals ; in all cases, however, the period of immersion was
abundantly sufficient for the liquefied acid to produce its full effect.
   The   effects  in nearly all cases were of so distinct a character, and the
conditions under which they were produced so definite, as not to require
repetitions of the experiments ; but those which were in any respect
uncertain were repeated, and those also which were of an important or
striking character were likewise repeated, in order to remove the          least
shadow of a doubt that might be raised respecting them.

    The liquid acid is      a very feeble conductor         of electricity.    Two fine
platinum wires, immersed in it fths of an inch in length and -rVth of an inch
 asunder, and connected with a series of 10 Smee's elements, evolved no
perceptible     bubbles of gas, and produced only a moderate deflection
 (amounting to 23 degrees) of the needles of a sensitive galvanometer ; and
this amount of conduction might possibly have been due to a minute trace
of oil of vitriol mixed with the liquid acid. In a second similar experi
 ment, with the wires -^th of an inch apart, not the slightest. conduction
occurred on using the same battery-power, but by employing the secondary
 current of a strong induction-coil with condenser attached, conduction and
 a steady deflection    of the needles of the galvanometer (26 degrees) took
 place, gas being freely evolved from the negative wire only. On separating
the brass points of the secondary terminals beyond the distance of the
thickness of a thin address card, sparks ceased to pass between those
points, and gas was evolved copiously in the liquid acid, apparently in the
 mass   of the acid between the two platinum wires              as well as at the wires
themselves ; two similar platinum wires in dilute hydrochloric acid in the
same circuit evolved very little gas.         It is probable that much of the gas
evolved in the liquefied acid was not a product of electrolysis, but simply
the acid itself volatilized by the thermic or other action of the current.
No sparks occurred at any time in the liquid acid.                It  is evident  there
fore    that liquefied hydrochloric acid gas is a very bad conductor of elec
tricity, but it is not nearly so powerful an insulator as liquefied carbonic
acid gas.
    The following experiments        illustrate   its  chemical,     solvent, or other
action upon various substances immersed in it.             The quantity of the solid
substances employed was in nearly all cases             very small in proportion to
 that of the liquid acid in contact with them, and in many cases did not
amount to one-twentieth of its volume.
    A  piece   of charcoal remained unchanged at the end of ten days, the
 acid being in a liquid state in contact with it at intervals.           A fragment of
fused boracic acid did not lessen in bulk or alter in appearance in seven
days.     White phosphorus was undissolved and unchanged in nine days,
and     remained    equally inflammable.        A fragment of ordinary sulphur
did not dissolve or alter in several days.            Fragments of vitreous black
selenium did not dissolve or change in six days.              Iodine dissolved rather
freely,   and  quickly   formed  a  purple-red    solution.     A piece of pentachlo-
ride of phosphorus softened in the gaseous acid, and dissolved quickly and
completely in the liquid acid, forming a colourless solution.               A fragment
of sesquicarbonate of ammonia swelled and became full of fissures in the
gaseous acid, but neither evolved gas nor dissolved when the liquid acid
came into contact with it ; after three days' intermittent immersion in the
liquid acid, the saline residue evolved no gas on immersion in dilute hydro
chloric acid.     A  piece   of sal-ammoniac,     immersed almost constantly du
ring nine days, remained undissolved and unchanged.

       Potassium evolved no gas when the liquid acid came into contact with it ;
    after eight days it was sometimes enlarged in bulk, and from the outset it was
    of a white colour    ; it did not at all dissolve.      In a second experiment the
    results  were  precisely  similar ; after  three  days' intermittent immersion the
    saline residue showed no signs of containing free potassium on immersing
   it in dilute hydrochloric acid. Anhydrous carbonate of potash in powder
   evolved no gas on first coming into contact with the liquid acid ; after
   three days' occasional immersion it remained undissolved, and the residue
   evolved no carbonic acid on immersion in dilute hydrochloric acid.                        A
   crystal of chloride of potassium did not dissolve or change in appearance
   by four hours' immersion in the liquefied acid.                 Powdered chlorate of
   potash imparted a yellow colour to the liquid acid, and did not lessen in
   bulk during three days' constant immersion ; the upper gutta-percha
   stopper became quite white at its inner end.             A crystal of nitrate of pot
   ash became of a brownish colour before the gas liquefied, and remained
   undissolved after six days' intermittent immersion ; the upper gutta-percha
   stopper was unusully acted upon, and of a nankeen colour.
       Sodium became white and swelled largely before the gas liquefied.                   No
   visible gas was evolved by it in the liquid acid.             After three days' inter
   mittent immersion the residue contained no sodium in the metallic state,
   and no portionof it imparted a blue colour to damp litmus paper. Anhydrous
   carbonate of soda in powder immersed one hour and a quarter in the liquid
   acid evolved no visible bubbles      of  gas, and    lost its alkaline reaction      (with
  litmus paper) to about three-fourths of its depth.                       A fragment of
  fused sulpliide    of  sodium   produced    a slight sublimate of a yellowish-white

  evolved no visible gas in the liquefied acid*.             After three days' variable
  immersion it was of a yellowish-white colour, and somewhat enlarged in
  bulk ; the residue evolved no sulphuretted hydrogen by immersion in
  dilute hydrochloric acid, and its solution gave a perfectly white precipitate
  with acetate of lead, and imparted no dark colour to sulphate of copper.
      Precipitated carbonate of baryta in powder evolved no visible gas by
 immersion      in the liquid acid ; it remained undissolved and unchanged in
 appearance during three days' immersion ; the residue evolved a minute
 quantity of gas by contact with dilute hydrochloric acid.                    Precipitated
 carbonate     of strontia in powder behaved like carbonate of baryta                  ;  the
 residue, after three days' immersion, was lost during the discharge.                       A
 minute fragment of anhydrous Bristol lime exhibited no solution or altera
 tion by nearly constant immersion during eight days in the liquid acid.
 On removal from the tube, it imparted a strong blue colour to neutral
litmus paper by slight friction. On fracture it was found similarly alka-

babbles of gas appeared.     I found by experiment that hydrochloric acid and hydrosul-
phuric acid, generated together and condensed      into a liquid state, did not form two
separate strata of liquid.

                                  the gas or liquid had been forced into its
pores.   In a second experiment of three days' intermittent immersion,
precisely similar effects were obtained.    Several minute fragments of very
soft marble    were immersed in the liquid acid at intervals
                                                           during seven
days.  No gas was evolved when the liquid touched them.      On removal
from the acid, their physical characters appeared unaltered ; they were
insoluble in water, but quickly dissolved in dilute hydrochloric acid, with
copious evolution of gas.     A fragment of bone-earth did not dissolve or
alter in appearance during seven days.
   Bright magnesium ribbon slowly became dull in the liquid acid, without
visible evolution of gas ; after seven days' intermittent immersion it was
still (with the exception of a thin film) in the metallic state.   In a second
experiment of   three  days' constant  immersion, similar   effects occurred ;
the residue dissolved and floated in dilute sulphuric acid, with copious
evolution of gas. A wire of magnesium and one of platinum immersed in
the liquid acid, and connected with a sensitive galvanometer, evolved no
perceptible electric current, and only a barely perceptible current after two
days of constant immersion.      Calcined magnesia in powder did not dis
solve or alter in appearance during four days' nearly constant immersion.
Oxide of cerium (containing some oxide of didymium and lanthanum)
remained     undissolved and unchanged in colour during nine days ; the
residue was insoluble in water.   Metallic aluminium became dull in the
gas, and quickly   dissolved, with evolution of gas, when the liquid acid
came into contact with          it,   and formed                a   colourless solution.   A   wire of
aluminium and    one of platinum, immersed ^th of an inch apart in the
liquefied acid, and  connected with    sensitive galvanometer, produced
                                                       a                                            a
steady deflection of       1degrees, the aluminium being positive

of liquid formed, the lower one brown                       in
                                          colour, and the upper                            one nearly
colourless.   The conductivity of the liquid acid was probably                              increased
by the metallic aluminium dissolved in it. Precipitated alumina did not
visibly alter or dissolve during six days the residue deliquesced in damp

   A fragment of fused tungstate of soda did not alter in bulk during ten
days;   ithad then acquired  superficial green colour.

powder turned dark green, but remained undissolved at the end of nine
days.  Native sulphide of molybdenum remained undissolved and appa
rently unchanged during two days. Molybdate of ammonia in powder
became yellowish green in the gas      became grass-green in colour in the

mium in powder did not dissolve in six days, but became of dull blackish-           a
brown colour.    Afragment of anhydrous yellow chromate of potash became

   red before the gas liquefied, but did not dissolve or otherwise alter in the
  liquid acid. Sesquioxide of uranium became of a paler yellow colour in the
   gas, but did not dissolve in the liquid acid in six days ; the residue was
  entirely soluble in water. Precipitated black oxide of manganese in powder,
  and free from water, became quite white in the gas ; it remained white in
  the liquid acid without evolving visible bubbles of gas, and did not lessen in
  bulk in seven days. A crystal of permanganate of potash softened and
  swelled in the liquid acid, but did not dissolve in five days ; it remained of a
  dark colour ; the residue placed in distilled water produced no coloration.
      A crystal of metallic arsenic remained perfectly bright and unchanged
  in bulk during three days' immersion.              Arsenious acid in powder quickly
  liquefied   in  the  gas,  and  dissolved    to  a colourless solution in the liquid
  acid.    A   crystal  of arsenic acid softened before the gas liquefied, and
  dissolved quickly     and   freely in the liquid acid to a colourless solution.
  Bisulphide of arsenic in powder did not dissolve in six days, but became
  slightly less red and more yellow       ;  a  slight yellowish-white sublimate oc
  curred in the tube during the generation of the gas.               Teriodide of arsenic
 in powder slightly dissolved to a purple-red liquid ; apparently only a trace
 of its iodine was extracted, as its bulk was not visibly less in three days. A
 crystal of bright antimony remained perfectly bright and unchanged after
 nine days' intermittent immersion.               Precipitated teroxide of antimony
 became partly liquid before the gas liquefied ; it dissolved in the liquid
 acid quickly and rather freely, and made a colourless solution.                 A frag
 ment    of  precipitated   antimonic   acid   did  not dissolve  in  six days.  A frag
 ment    of black tersulphide of antimony evolved           a film   of yellowish-white
 sublimate, and lessened in bulk before the gas liquefied ; it decomposed and
 dissolved in the liquid acid in about a quarter of an hour, and formed a
 colourless    solution which exhibited no further change during seven days.
 A    fragment of bright metallic bismuth remained undissolved and un
 changed in the liquid during three days.
     Bright zinc evolved no visible gas in the liquid acid, and was not per
ceptibly corroded in three days.            Oxide of zinc slowly dissolved in seven
 days.      Metallic cadmium evolved no gas in the liquid, and was not
sensibly corroded in three days.               Precipitated carbonate of cadmium
evolved no visible gas in the liquid acid, and remained undissolved and
unchanged in appearance during seven days. Yellow sulphide of cadmium
evolved a trace of white sublimate before the gas liquefied ; in the liquid
acid it became quite white, and remained undissolved in seven days ; on
removal it was hard in texture and quite white throughout, and evolved no
odour of sulphuretted hydrogen or separation of sulphur on treatment with
strong nitric acid.       Bright tin evolved no visible gas in the liquid acid ;
after ten days' intermittent immersion it was converted, to some depth of
its substance, into a bulky white solid with deep fissures. In a second expe
riment of three days' immersion, similar results occurred ; all the tin was
corroded except a minute         fibre in the centre, the white solid was imper

 fectly soluble in water, but instantly soluble in dilute hydrochloric acid.
 Binoxide of tin in powder did not dissolve in seven days ; the residue was
 white and insoluble in water.        A crystal of protochloride of tin softened
 before the gas liquefied, and partly dissolved in the liquid acid in four days.
 Bright metallic thallium evolved no gas in the liquid acid, and was only
 superficially blackened without further corrosion after three days' immer
 sion.    Metallic lead did not evolve visible gas in the liquefied acid ; it
 became blackened at first, and in ten days was corroded deeply to a white
 substance.      Red oxide of lead quickly became white in the liquid acid,
 but did not dissolve in seven days ; it was then quite hard, white through
 out, and not readily soluble in water.          Precipitated carbonate of lead
 evolved no visible gas in the liquid acid, and remained undissolved after three
 days' immersion ; the residue evolved no gas by contact with dilute hydro
 chloric acid.     Precipitated sulphide of lead in powder produced a faint
 film  of  white sublimate in the gas, and by a few hours' immersion in the
 liquid acid   became wholly white ; it did not not dissolve during seven days,
 and was then quite white throughout, and not readily spluble in water.
 Yellow iodide of lead did not dissolve in seven days, but became of a pur
 plish brick-brown colour and evolved a strong odour of free iodine ; it
 produced yellowish-brown stains upon paper.            Yellow chromate of lead
 evolved at first (in the gaseous acid) a small quantity of deep-red vapour,
 which condensed as a red moisture near it on the tube ; the chromate
 became white- in the gas, and did not dissolve in the liquid acid in three
 days ; it was then a soft white solid, not freely soluble in water, and im
 parted a faint greenish tint to water.
    A minute fragment of iron remained bright, and evolved no gas when
 the liquid acid came into contact with it ; after nine days of intermittent
 immersion it was only slightly tarnished, and on removal from the acid
 was found otherwise unaltered.       A fragment of fused sulphide of iron pro
 duced a faint film of whitish sublimate at first, but evolved no bubbles of
 gas on contact with the liquid acid ; it did not dissolve or alter in appear
 ance.    A second fragment constantly immersed during three days behaved
 similarly; it was as hard as before immersion, and evolved sulphuretted
 hydrogen freely in hot dilute sulphuric acid.         A crystal of green vitriol
 became yellowish white and opaque in the liquid acid, but did not diminish
 in volume in six days; the residue was a soft opaque yellowish- white solid.
Oxide of cobalt in powder exhibited no change or solution during three
days   ;  on removal it was found to be very hard, of a light-brown colour,
and dissolved in water, producing a pink solution with separation of black
oxide.     Peach-coloured    carbonate  of cobalt evolved no visible gas in the
liquid acid   ; it became    greenish  blue, but did not lessen in bulk in three
days ; the residue became pink in the air, and dissolved almost completely
in water, forming a pink liquid ; it also dissolved in dilute hydroclhoric acid
without evolving bubbles of gas. Anhydrous chloride of nickel did not dis
solve in the liquid acid in six days. Metallic copper soon lost its brightness

in the gas ; it evolved no gas in the liquid acid, and was only slightly cor
roded after seven days.           Black oxide of copper became of a lighter colour
in the liquid    acid,    but did not lessen in bulk in seven days ; the residue
was   a greenish and yellowish          white powder, which instantly turned black
 in water, forming a pale-blue         solution, and left black oxide of copper.     A
crystal of blue vitriol became of a light brown colour in the liquid acid,
 but did not dissolve in six days ; on removal it was found to be a brown
soft solid.     Protoxide of mercury became white in the gas, and did not
 dissolve by constant immersion in the liquid acid in four days ; the residue
was a white solid, soluble in water.            Vermilion in powder slowly changed
in the liquid acid in three days to a pinkish-white solid, but did not dis
solve.     Scarlet iodide of mercury in powder imparted a red colour
to the liquid acid, but did not lessen in bulk or change in colour
during three days       ;   the residue lost its red colour       on the application of
heat.     A fragment of protochloride of mercury did not visibly alter in the
liquid   acid  in four days. Metallic silver did not dissolve or become much
 corroded during seven days.             Oxide of silver became white in the liquid
 acid in one day, but did not dissolve.              Precipitated chloride of silver in
 powder    did not  visibly    alter  or dissolve  during  sixteen days. Metallic pla
 tinum was unaffected in the liquid acid.
    Oxalic acid   was     slightly dissolved in the liquid acid in three days with
 out change of colour.            Uric acid remained undissolved and unchanged
 during three days. Paraffin did not appear to be dissolved or affected in
 nine days. Gutta percha was quickly acted upon ; it imparted to the liquid
 acid, first a red, and ultimately a dark-brown colour ; it appeared also to
 dissolve in the acid to some extent, and on discharging the tubes was left
 behind as a tenacious coating upon the adjacent parts.                 Gun-cotton was
 unaffected in the liquid acid.          Cotton was not visibly altered in two days.
 Solid  extract  of  litmus     dissolved   slightly, forming a faintly purple blue or
 inky solution ; it became of a dark red colour and enlarged in bulk ; the
 residue formed a perfect solution in water ; the solution was red in colour.
    Remarks. — The foregoing experiments show that liquid hydrochloric acid
has but a feeble solvent power for solid bodies in general. Out of 86 solids
it dissolved only 12, and some of those only in a minute degree; of 5
metalloids it dissolved 1, viz. iodine; of 15 metals it dissolved only 1,
viz. aluminium ; of 22 oxides it dissolved 5, viz. titanic acid, arsenious
acid, arsenic acid, teroxide of antimony, and oxide of zinc ; of 9 carbonates
it dissolved none; of 8 sulphides it dissolved 1, viz. tersulphide of anti
mony; of 7 chlorides it dissolved 2, viz. pentachloride of phosphorus
and protochloride of tin ; and of 7 organic bodies it dissolved 2.
    The results show also that liquid hydrochloric acid in the anhydrous
state manifests much less chemical action upon solid bodies than the same
acid when mixed with water as under ordinary circumstances ; for instance,
the difference of its action upon magnesium, zinc, cadmium, and even
aluminium,      under      the   two conditions,     is very conspicuous.    This may

arise in a great measure from its feeble solvent capacity — insoluble films
forming upon the surface of the bodies immersed in it preventing its con
tinued contact and further action.    This want of contact could hardly
have been the case in the remarkable instance of caustic lime : here was a
powerful and true acid     e.  hydrogen acid) and a powerful base; each in

quantity necessary for its saturation    and the action extended over

remained totally uncombined.
     It
     must not be overlooked that the results are partly due to anhydrous
hydrochloric acid in the liquid state, and partly to the same acid in the
gaseous state,        under great pressure, the one class                 of effects not being
eliminated        from the other in the present experiments               ;   itprobable that
                                                                                   is
if   the substances could have been submitted                     to the action of the liquid
acid alone, the chemical effects would have been much smaller even than
they were.         For instance, the action upon potassium, sodium, and tin ap
peared to be       due to the influence of the acid in the gaseous state, as no
gas was perceptibly  evolved by these metals in the liquid acid. In the
cases of potassium and sodium (the latter in particular)   perhaps pos        it   is
sible, though highly improbable, that the whole of the metal had been
corroded before the liquid acid touched    but with tin this was certainly
                                                        it  ;
not the case, some metallic tin being left uncorroded at the end of the
experiment.
   Oxides in general, with the exception of lime and certain others which do
not readily combine with aqueous hydrochloric acid, were slowly converted
in greater or less degree into chlorides.
    a                                        Carbonates also, except that of
lime, were in general converted in    greater or less degree into chlorides.

   Such carbonates  as were decomposed evolved no visible bubbles of gas in
the liquid acid     :                   on the supposition that they were
                         this may be explained
previously completely decomposed by the gaseous acid during the process
of generation (this, however, was not the case with carbonate of soda), or
that the liberated carbonic acid             was in the liquid state and was dissolved
by the liquid hydrochloric acid.               In my former paper      was shown that
                                                                              it
liquid carbonic and hydrochloric acids generated and condensed together
did not form two separate strata of liquid.
   Sulphides were in some cases converted into chlorides       in other cases  ;

          ;                          a

 I   may  here take the opportunity of stating that tubes charged with liquid
carbonic acid    October 1860 suffered no leakage by February 1865.

       Pathology in the Royal Veterinary College, and T. Spencer
       Cobbold, M.D., F.R.S., F.L.S.               Received   April   13, 1865.
    Neither of   us having exhausted certain funds placed at          our disposal for
scientific purposes (in the one case by the Royal Agricultural Society
 through the Governors of the Royal Veterinary College, and in the other
 by the British Association for the Advancement of Science), we have united
 the resources which severally remained to us, and have instituted a series
of experiments in helminthology. These experiments, we are happy to
state, have proved, for the most part, eminently successful ; moreover,
several of them not having been previously performed in this country, we
have ventured to think that at least the firstfruits of our combined research
in this particular relation might not unfitly be submitted to the notice of
the Royal Society.
    The subject selected for the experiment which we now proceed to relate,
was a fine healthy female calf about a month old, living at the time on the
milk of its dam. As we were unable to obtain possession of the dam,
another cow was procured as a foster-mother, and the calf was placed with
her in order that it might receive a proper supply of milk in the natural
way.     This plan was preferred to that of obtaining a weaned calf, as being
better calculated to preserve the health and strength          of the young animal.
In the course of a few days the two animals became              perfectly accustomed
to each other, the calf taking nourishment as often as was requisite.
    On the 2 1st of December, 1864, we administered to the calf eighty mature
proglottides of the Teenia mediocanellata, mingled with a little warm milk
in the form of a draught.         The potion was taken readily, and the worm-
joints probably    entered   the  stomach    in a perfect and unbroken condition.
No alteration    was made in the subsequent management            of the animals, but
a careful daily watch was kept upon the calf.
-
    For some time no indications were perceived of disturbed health ; but on
the 6th of January, 1865 (the sixteenth day after the experiment), a careful
observation showed that the animal, although lively (and taking its milk and
likewise some hay with undiminished           appetite), was nevertheless suffering
from some persistent cause       of irritation.   It would often be nibbling at its
legs and other parts of its body, and trying with its mouth and tongue to
get at places which were beyond its ordinary reach.                It would also fre
quently   rub  itself  against  the  manger    and  sides of the  loose  box in which
it was confined.      Desisting from this, it would arch its spine and stretch

 ing in the countenance, no disturbance of the breathing or of the circula
 tion, no injection of the visible mucous membranes, no alteration of the
 temperature of the body, no
                                        " staring " of the coat, nor rigors ; in short,
 no indication       of anything seriously wrong.           These symptoms continued
 throughout the next day with little variation ;             on the third day they had
 nearly passed away, and by the fourth had entirely disappeared.
     On the 25th of January, 1865, just five weeks after the first worm-
 feeding, two hundred more of the mature proglottides of Teenia medio-
 canellata were administered ; but one hundred of these worm-segments had
 been previously immersed in a weak alcoholic solution, strong enough, it
was feared, to destroy the vitality of their contained eggs.                   The other
 hundred proglottides were in beautiful condition, and for the most part ap
peared to be thoroughly mature.                Again the calf took the feeding readily,
and   little or no force had to       be employed in      holding it during the adminis
tration. However, directly on being loosed, it was observed to show
some symptoms of distress in the breathing, accompanied with trembling.
The feeding took place at 3 p.m., and, as the night promised to be cold, it
was placed with the cow in a closed and warm stable.                   On the following
morning      it   was  noticed   that   the   tremors   had   somewhat   abated, but the
animal     was evidently      dispirited,   and would every now and then grind its
teeth as if in pain.        Its appetite was much diminished.          By the next day,
however, all these diseased symptoms passed away, and the animal recovered
its ordinary healthy aspect.
    On the 1st of February, the seventh day succeeding the second worm-
feeding, there was a decided return of the nervous irritability ; but in a day
or two these       symptoms again declined.           Nevertheless the animal was not
quite right     ;  the  coat  began   to  lose  its natural  and glossy appearance, and
there was an evident loss of flesh.
    Feb. 8th. — A marked change for the worse has taken place. The
animal is dull and dispirited ; refuses all food excepting milk, and of this
takes but little ; it arches the back frequently, and stretches the limbs in
a peculiar manner ; the breathing and the pulse have increased, and at in
tervals slight tremors are observable, more particularly of the muscles of
the neck and shoulders.
    Feb. 9th. — All the unhealthy symptoms               are more marked.      The pulse
numbers 120, and the breathing 35 in the minute.                  The tremors are more
continuous, and the condition of the animal is fast declining.
    Feb. 10th. — Still worse. The calf is so ill that we fear a fatal result. It
takes little or no notice of the cow, and cannot be induced to suck.                 The
eyes have a peculiar staring expression.
    Feb. 11th. — The severity of the symptoms has somewhat abated this
morning.        The animal is rather more lively, and will now and then take a
little milk.       The breathing and pulse, however, remain rapid. The tre
mors, though still frequent, have diminished in intensity.                 Towards the
after part    of the day the improvement became more marked                  ; therefore,

instead of destroying the auiinal (as we had purposed in the event of its
becoming much worse), we resolved to satisfy ourselves, by other means, as
to whether the above symptoms were really due to parasite-invasion.
Accordingly       a small    portion of the right sterno-maxillaris muscle was
removed by operation, and this fragment of the flesh, although weighing
only 22 grains, revealed the presence of three imperfectly developed
cysticercus-vesicles.      Each was about the size of a pin's head, but they
 displayed no trace of calcareous corpuscles, or of cephalic formation in
 their interior. On the assumption (afterwards,            however, found to be
 erroneous) that all the muscles of the body might be similarly affected,
 and to the same extent, it was at the time calculated that the animal
 "entertained" some 30,000 of these artificially introduced "guests."
    Feb. 12th. — A further improvement has taken place, but the animal is
 still dispirited, the pulse and breathing continuing abnormally rapid.          The
 eyes are less staring.
     Feb. 13th. — Improvement       continues ; breathing less rapid  ;  the tremors
 have disappeared.
     Feb. 15th. — Pulse diminishing ; breathing nearly normal       ; appetite good.
     Feb. 22nd. — Convalescence perfectly re-established.
     Throughout the remainder of the month of February, and during the
 whole of March, the calf continued to maintain complete vigour, and,
 indeed, gained flesh so rapidly that at the beginning of April it might readily
 have been sold to a farmer, to a butcher, or to a cattle-dealer, as a thoroughly
  sound and thriving young beast.          The time having, however, arrived for
  determining     the result  of the experiment, the calf was slaughtered on the
  3rd of April, by division of the right carotid artery.        The operation was
  performed by Mr.      Pritchard,   who also during the subsequent post-mortem
  examination rendered us essential service.         As before, so after its death,
  all present remarked the particularly healthy aspect of the animal, there
  being no external indications by which the most practised professional eye
  could have discovered the existence of internal disease.          But for our pre
  vious trial we should ourselves have been doubtful of finding any entozoa
  within the flesh.
      Immediately after the first incision along the median line of the thorax,
  a solitary cysticercus came into view, many others successively displaying
  themselves as the integument was being raised and dissected from off the
  left side of the carcass.      No person in this country having hitherto wit
  nessed   such a demonstration       as now followed,   we may perhaps       be per
  mitted   to express the feeling of astonishment which all shared on thus
  beholding hundreds of larval cestode parasites in the flesh of an animal
  not usually considered capable        of harbouring "measles" after the fashion
  of swine.
      Examined individually, the      larvae were enclosed in oval sacs, whose trans
   parency permitted us to see, at or near the centre of each vesicle, inter
   nally, a minute white spot representing the so-called receptaculum capitis.

 On subsequent rupture of the cyst,      a microscopic   examination of the con
 tained larva revealed the ordinary characters of the Cysticercus    which pro
 duces the Tania mediocanellata.
    Speaking   generally,  it may    be  said  that  the  connective tissue  and
 cellular aponeuroses     were very feebly invaded ; but in certain situa
 tions, such as those occupied by the linea semicircularis and fascia lum-
 baris, several vesicles were closely associated ; moreover, as regards the
 muscles themselves, extensive parasitic invasion was prevalent only in the
 more superficial layers.    It was likewise noticed, as obtains in the parallel
 case of Trichina, that the larvae were disposed in the longitudinal direction
 of the muscular fibres, being at the same time more numerously grouped
 towards the points of osseous insertion or of aponeurotic attachment.       Not
 a few large vesicles had inflamed and suppurated, the cysts being occupied
internally by a thick green-coloured deposit.
    Referring to the left side only, we noted that all the breast-muscles
 (pectoralis major, p. transversus, and p. anticus) were much infested, but
scarcely so fully as the more superficial panniculus carnosus.            In the
latissimus  dorsi and trapezius the cysts were very numerous, rather less so
in the combined levator humeri and sterno- occipitalis, somewhat fewer in
the rhomboideus brevis and rhomboideus longus, and exceedingly scanty in
the superior part of the scalenus, the remainder of this last-named muscle
being entirely free.    The lateralis sterni contained none ; neither were any
observed in the abdominal region of the serratus magnus, but several vesicles
were lodged in the superficial cervical portion of this muscle.       Not a few
existed in the upper part of the complexus major and in the complexus
minor, some also occurring in the longissimus dorsi ; yet none were
observed in the spinalis dorsi, in the superficialis costalis, or in the
diaphragm.
    Turning towards the neck-region, we found them abundant in the
sterno-maxillaris, considerably less so in the splenius, only one in the
hyoideus, several in the sterno-hyo-thyroideus,         but none in the longus
colli.   All the other deep-seated muscles of this region, including the
obliquus capitis superior and inferior, as well as the rectus capitis posticus
major and minor, appeared free from any trace of the vesicles. On the
other hand, all the superficial muscles of the face, such as the retractor
anguli oris, orbicularis oris, and levator palpebrarum, gave abundant evi
dence of their presence, the vesicles being particularly numerous at the
outer part of the masseter externus.         In like manner their presence was
only less strongly indicated in the muscles of the eyeball, such as the
obliquus inferior, adductor and retractor oculi, also in the depressor oculi,
one
      " measle " being placed between the tendon of this last-named muscle
and the sclerotic coat. The ball of the eye itself contained no vesicles. A
few were remarked in the substance of the genio-hyoideus and other
muscles supplying the tongue       ;  but the lingual organ properly    so called
appeared to be entirely free.

  218         Messrs. Simonds and Cobbold on the Production                      [May 4,
     As regards the anterior extremity,        we found the  Cysticerci very numerous
 in the teres externus and abductor humeralis,           being scarcely less abundant
  in the spinatus anticus and posticus.           They were likewise prevalent in the
  front part of the triceps extensor brachii, but altogether wanting behind
  and in the deeper portions of this muscle.            A very few were remarked in
  the flexor brachii, whilst the subscapularis, teres internus, and coraco-
 humeralis     failed to reveal any.        They were very abundant in the flexor
  metacarpi   externus,   less so   in  the  flexor metacarpi medius, and compara
  tively scanty in the flexor metacarpi interims.              The lower part of the
  combined    flexor  perforatus   and   perforans   showed  a  few, several being like
 wise present in the accessorius ulnaris. They were rather more abundant
 in the extensor metacarpi magnus, also in the extensor et adductor digi-
  torum, likewise in the extensor digiti externus, and scarcely less so in the
  extensor metacarpi obliquus        ;  yet none could be discovered either in the
  anconeus or in the humeralis         externus.
     Over the haunch,       and throughout the surface-flesh of the left hinder
 limb, the Cysticerci      were particularly abundant, being numerous in the
 gluteus maximus, in the tensor          vaginae femoris, and most especially      in the
 large triceps abductor femoris.             They were little less abundant in the
 vastus externus, and in those limited portions of the gastrocnemius ex
 ternus and internus which come near the surface.                  A  few vesicles were
 observed at the subcutaneous posterior section of the ischio-tibialis, also in
 the outer part of the biceps rotator tibialis and rectus femoris ; yet none
were noticed either in the gluteus internus and gracilis, or in the vastus
internus and sartorius.        In the flexor metatarsi and extensor pedis they
were rather numerous, but, at the same time, comparatively scarce in the
peroneus and flexor pedis perforans.             Lastly, none were detected in either
the psoas magnus or psoas parvus.
     With the exception of the heart, none of the viscera showed Cysticerci, the
lungs, liver, kidneys, spleen, and thymus gland being absolutely free ; neither
were any discovered in the brain.            In short, it may be stated that the in
ternal organs of the body generally were perfectly healthy ; and even as
regards the heart itself, the rather numerous vesicles found there displayed
only   a very incomplete development.           At first they looked   as  if they might
belong to a separate swarm-brood ; but a careful microscopic examination
disproved this notion, and at the same time revealed some curious facts. In
the heart none of the vesicles had attained one-third of the size of those pre
valent in the muscles, yet their age was doubtless the same ; for although
none    of those examined displayed a well-formed head with the charac
teristic and normal number of suckers, yet one vesicle was found to possess
three suckers, another having two suckers, and a third only a single sucker.
Most of the vesicles were entirely suckerless, whilst those which had them
showed other indications of abnormality.            The suckers themselves were not
perfectly   formed,   in   most cases, and there were commencing signs of cal
careous degeneration.        In  some instances, the entire contents      of the vesicles

   appeared to have been absorbed, leaving only faint white spots to indicate
   the situations where the cysts once were.      Such, at least, is our interpre
  tation of the phenomena observed ; and, in this relation, we have only
  further to remark that the heart-cysts were not merely found at the surface
  of the organ, but were dispersed throughout its substance, one or two of
  the better-formed vesicles being lodged within the septum ventriculorum.
      On the present occasion we do not propose to offer any lengthened
  comment on the results of this experiment, but rather to let the facts
  speak for themselves ; nevertheless, to impart an aspect    of completeness to
 our paper,    we will offer one or two concluding remarks.
      So far as we are aware, only three experiments of this kind have been
 previously performed on the calf — namely, two by Leuckart, and one by
 Mosler.      In two of these instances the experimental animal perished,
 whilst in the other case, as in our own, the creature barely escaped with
 its life. To our animal we administered a larger number of proglottides
 than had been given even in Mosler's case ; but, probably in consequence
 of the embryonic immaturity of the contents of many of the eggs, we did
 not get that fatal result which otherwise would inevitably have followed
 from a larger migration of the cestode-progeny.         We believe that by far
 the greater proportion     of the " measles"  resulted  from the second worm-
 feeding, in which case they would have come from the hundred proglottides
 not subjected to the action of alcohol. Although the characters presented
 by the earlier-developed morbid symptoms, as well as the time of their
 accession, induce us to attribute the diseased phenomena to the larvae set
 free by the first " feeding," yet it is clear, from the feebleness of the
 symptoms manifested, that only a very inconsiderable number of embryos
 cau have entered on their wanderings.         In the second " feeding," how
 ever, the case is very different ; for here all the circumstances connected
 with the subsequent and marked disturbance of the animal's health point
 unequivocally to the development of that peculiar form of parasite-disease
which Leuckart has designated as the " acute cestode tuberculosis."
     From the number of young vesicles present in the minute portion of
muscle removed by operation from the living animal, we had (in the pages
of the ' Lancet ') publicly announced our belief that we might ultimately
find 30,000 Cysticerci developed in this calf ; but as the larvae were subse
quently found to be almost entirely confined to the superficial muscular
layers, it turned out that our calculation was considerably beyond the
mark. Nevertheless from post-mortem data we estimate that there were
between seven and eight thousand "measles" present, and one of us
counted 1 30 vesicles at the surface of a single muscle.
     Lastly, it only remains for us to express our thanks to those gentlemen
who supplied us with the necessary experimental material, namely, to Dr.
Greenhow for the first tapeworm employed, and to Dr. Anderson and Mr.
Brookhouse (Nottingham) for the second and third tapeworms, which were
given together     at the second administration.      Dr. Greenhow-s specimen

 of lithium in urine.
        2. On    Rate of Passage into the Textures throvgh the Stomach.
    Even in a quarter of an hour three grains of chloride of lithium, given
 on an empty stomach, may diffuse into all the vascular textures, and into the
 cartilage of the hip-joint and the aqueous humour of the eye. In very young
 and very small guinea-pigs which have received the same quantity of lithium,
 in thirty or thirty-two minutes it may be found even in the lens ; but in an
 old pig in this time it will have got no further than the aqueous humour.
 If  the stomach be empty, in an hour the lithium may be very evident in the
 outer part of the lens, and very faintly traceable in the inner part ; but if the
 stomach be full of food, the lithium does not in an hour reach the lens.
 Even in two hours and a half lithium may be more marked in the outer than
 in the inner part of the lens.      In four hours the lithium may be in every part
 of the lens  ;  but less evidence of its presence will be obtained there than from
 the aqueous humour. In eight hours, even, the centre of the lens may show
 less than the outer part. In twenty-six hours the diffusion had taken place
 equally throughout every part of the lens.          If the lithium is injected under
 the skin, in ten minutes it may be found in the crystalline lens, and even
 in four minutes, after the injection of three grains of chloride, the lithium
 may be in the bile, urine, and aqueous humour of the eye.

     After two grains of chloride of lithium, in six hours the lithium wns
more distinct in the outer thnn in the inner part of the lens.            In twenty-
four hours no difference in the different parts of the lens was detectable.
In forty-eight     hours no difference was observed.         In ninety-six hours no
lithium      was detectable  in the lens or cartilage of the hip-joint. The urine
showed lithium very distinctly even in one drop.
     After one grain of chloride of lithium, in five hours and a half the lithium
was more distinct in the outer than in the inner part of the lens.                 In
twenty-four      hours  nnd   a half there  was no  difference  throughout  the lens.
In forty-eight hours the watery extract of the lens showed faint traces of
lithium.       In seventy-two hours and a half (three days) the alcoholic
extract of the lens showed no lithium.             The urine still showed lithium
 distinctly in one drop, and it continued to be found in the watery or
alcoholic extract for twenty-one days.
     After half n grain of chloride of lithium, in three hours and fifty minutes
 traces of lithium could be found in the lens, and for thirty-seven or thirty-
 eight days traces of lithium could be found in the urine.
     After a quarter of a grain of chloride of lithium, in five hours and a
 quarter the aqueous humour showed lithium, and all the organs showed
 lithium, but none was in the lens. In another pig, in twenty-four hours
 all the organs showed less lithium, and none was found in the aqueous
 humour.
     After a quarter of a grain, in five hours and thirty-five minutes lithium
 was distinct in the aqueous humour, and very faintly traceable in the lens ;
  and after sixteen days the minutest traces of lithium could be detected in
  the lens, the liver, the kidney ; but no trace could be found in the blood.
      After three grains of chloride of lithium, in four hours lithium was in the
  hair of the belly, and for thirty-two days the urine showed lithium very
  distinctly.     The thirty-third day after the lithium the lens was found to
  contain minute traces of lithium, and even after thirty-nine days the
  lithium was in the alcoholic extract of the urine.
      With three grains of chloride of lithium, a young pig in half an hour
  had lithium in the watery extract of the lens. In the same time an old pig
  had r.o lithium in the lens.
      With two grains, a young pig in six hours had lithium distinctly through
  out the whole lens. An old pig in the same time had lithium in the outer
  part of the lens, but scarcely the minutest trace in the inner part of the
  lens.

      Ten grains of carbonate of lithia, taken three or four hours after food by

    Two grains of chloride or carbonate oflithia, taken shortly after food by
a boy, gives no appearance in the urine until from ten to twenty minutes ;
and this quantity continues to pass out for five, seven, or eight days.
    Experiments made by the ordinary mode of analysis showed that four
grains of sulphate of protoxide of iron, taken by a man almost fasting,
gave   a trace   in the urine in seven minutes.        Seven grains gave distinct
appearance    in ten minutes ;  and  in ten minutes  and  a half one grain of iodide
of potassium, taken by the same man fasting, appeared in the urine in
twelve minutes.
    When no lithia had      been   taken, seven cataracts were examined         most
carefully,   and only one showed an exceedingly feeble trace of lithium.
    When twenty grains of carbonate oflithia were taken twenty-five minutes
before the operation, the lens showed no lithium.
    When twenty grains of carbonate of lithia were taken two hours
and a half before the operation, the lens showed lithium in the watery
cataract.
    When twenty grains of carbonate of lithia were taken between four
and five hours before the operation, the lens showed lithium in each
particle.
    When twenty grains of carbonate of lithia were taken seven hours before
the operation, the lens showed lithium in each particle.
    When twenty grains of carbonate of lithia were taken seven days before
the operation, the lens showed not the slightest trace of lithium.
    Twenty grains of carbonate of lithia, taken between six and thirty-six
hours before death, showed the faintest indications of lithium in the lens.
The cartilage showed lithium very distinctly.
    Ten grains of carbonate of lithia, taken five hours and a half before

      Chloride of lithium taken into the stomach in quantities varying from
  one quarter of a grain to three grains, will pass into all the vascular parts of
  the body, and even into the non-vascular textures, in from one quarter of
  an hour to five hours and a half.
            2.  On the Rate    of Passage out of   the Textures   of Animals.
      Chloride of lithium    passes out by the skin as well as by the urine; and thus
  the animals      can redose themselves with chloride of lithium from the hair
 and feet, and prevent accurate observations.          Hence probably chloride of
lithium, in quantities varying from half a grain to three grains, will continue
 to pass out of the body for thirty-seven, thirty-eight, or thirty-nine days ;
 and even after thirty-three days, traces may be found in the lens ; but
 in three or four days no lithium may be detectable in the non-vascular
 textures.
      3.  In man, carbonate of lithia, when taken in five- or ten-grain doses, may
appear      in  the urine in five to ten minutes if the stomach is empty, or
 twenty minutes if the stomach is full, and may continue to pass out for six,
seven, or eight days.
      In two hours and a half,       traces may be in the crystalline lens, and in
 five or seven hours it        may be present in every particle of the lens and
in the cartilages.         In  thirty-six hours it may be very evident in the
cartilages.       And in seven days not the slightest trace may be detectable in
 the crystalline lens.
      4. Though in the solid and liquid food infinitesimal quantities of lithium
may enter the body, usually no proof of their presence in the organs or
secretions can be obtained.

         M.A.      Communicated by the Rev. R.          Main, F.R.S.         Received
         April 27, 1865.
     The tabulation of an unbroken series of thermometric observations for the
several days of the lunation during fifty years having been completed up
to November 1 864, and an amount of lunar action detected which appears
sufficient     to set at rest the long vexed question of the moon's influence
over our atmosphere,         I venture to think that the time has arrived when
it becomes a duty to lay the results of the investigation           before the Royal
Society,

224       Mr. J. P. Harrison — Lunar Influence         on Temperature.        [May 4,
    In    1856   the frequent recurrence of higher temperatures about the
eighth or ninth day of the moon's age, led to an examination and compa
rison of the mean temperatures of the third day before, and the second
day after first quarter of the moon, for a series of seven years at Chiswick,
and sixteen years at Dublin.            The results showed conclusively that the
temperature of the second day after first quarter was higher than the
temperature of the third day before that phase during the years in
question.
     On extending the investigation        to the remaining days of the lunation,
the maximum was found to             occur,   at both stations, at the period wheu
heat was first observed, and the minimum after full moon and last
quarter.
     The long series of mean temperatures which had been determined by
Mr. Glaisher for the British Meteorological Society from observations
taken at Greenwich between 1814 and 1856, were next arranged in tables
constructed for the purpose.          These observations, though corrected by an
arbitrary rule totally irrespective of the moon, and in a measure therefore
eliminating influences that may have been exerted on the observed tempe
ratures, appeared on the whole the best, as they were also the most exten
sive printed series existing.
     The method pursued. —The Tables were constructed in the following
 manner : — The mean temperatures of the days on which the moon entered
 her four principal phases having been first inserted in columns arranged
 at equal distances, the mean temperatures of the first, second, and third
 days before and after each of the quarters were entered in the columns
 adjoining on either side ; and any remaining observations in octant columns
 midway between the quarters*.             The deficiency occasionally occurring in
 an equal number of six observations between the quarters, was supplied by
 repeating the observation of mean temperature of the third day after, or
 third day before the quarters, the same observation in such cases being
 used for both those days.           Thus an equal number of observations was
 secured for twenty-eight days out of 29*5, at all the seasons of the year,
 a point of no little importance as regards the next process, viz., obtaining
 true means of the temperatures of the several days.                This was done in
 the usual way, by adding together the observations of mean temperature
 in each column, and dividing the sums by the number of lunations the
 temperatures of which had been tabulated.
     The last operation consisted in laying down the mean line on scale-paper,
 and marking above or below it the mean temperatures belonging to the
 several columns on vertical lines, representing the several days of the luna
 tion preceding or following the four quarters.            The points thus marked
      * On  an average, the number of observations in each of the octant columns
                                                                                 equals
  half the number of observations in the other columns. Their means were not made use
  of in forming the curves of temperature.

are usually termed " curves

                                          temperature.
    The     results  of the tabulation of the Greenwich observations. — The
tabulation of the mean temperatnres of the 520 lunations between 1814
and 1856, resulted in the complete confirmation of the phenomenon origi
nally observed ; that is to say, the maximum mean temperature showed
itself, as before, in the first half of the lunation, and the minimum mean
temperature in the second half of the lunation.                    The difference between
the maximum and minimum temperatures for the 520 lunations was 1°
Fahr.     (see  PI. V. fig. 1).
    In   the autumn      of 1860    M. Faye       communicated       the above     results to
the French Academy*.
    Additional      Results in 1856-G5. — The author has now the honour                      of
laying before the Royal Society additional confirmatory evidence derived
from a tabulation of mean temperatures at Greenwich for. the eight years,
or 99 lunations, which have elapsed since the year 1856f.
     Upon examining the lunar curve of temperature derived from these
 means (see PI. IV. fig. 2), the maximum mean temperature will be again
found in the first half of the lunation, at the moon's first quarter, and the
minimum mean temperature in the second half of the lunation.                              The
 difference is 3°-5 ; the maximum is 5 1°-7 ; and the minimum 480-2. The
 mean    of the period is 49°*56.
     And on adding the sums of mean temperature of this period to the
 sums of the mean temperatures in the Table of 520 lunations, and divid
 ing the sums of the several columns by G19 (the number of lunations
 which occur in fifty years), the maximum is still found to occur at the first
 quarter, and the minimum shortly after last quarter.                  The difference be-
 ween the maximum and minimum mean temperatures is l°-33. A curve
 of the mean temperatures for the 619 lunations will be found in PI. IV.
 fig. It.
     Explanation of the Phenomenon. — Although the recurrence of higher
 temperatures in the first half of the lunation, and more particularly at the
 moon's first quarter — as a meteorological fact — is not affected by the
 correctness or incorrectness of any explanation which may be given of the
 phenomenon, yet it will be well to state that a probable cause for the
    * Comptes Rendus, December     1800.
    f  The Tables were laid before the Society, and are available for reference.
    J  As regards the annual sums of temperature of the two days of maximum and minimum,
 the sums on the former day are higher than the sums on the latter day in 34 years out of 50.
 And the sum of the differences, in the years in which the mean temperature of the day
 before first quarter is higher than the mean temperature of the second day after last
 quarter is 783° 6, whilst the sum of the differences, in the years in which the mean
 temperature of the former day is lower, is 220°-0. For several years together, however,
 the day    of maximum temperature presents itself, not on the day before        fir.-t quarter,
  but a day or two later (see PI. V. figs. 2, 3, and note ml Jin.).

   226     Mr.   J. P. Harrison — Lunar Influence on Temperature.                   [May 4,
  apparent paradox of heat occurring             at the moon's first quarter suggested
  itself in 1857*.
      It  was   evident that the effects noticed could not be due to any heat
  derived directly from the moon.            Even if the experiments of Melloni and
  Bouvard — and, it may be added, the results obtained by Professor Piazzi
  Smythe on TenerhTe — had not established it as a fact that no serviceable
  heat, dark or luminous, reaches the lower strata of the earth's atmosphere
  at the period of full moon, the results of the tabulation of mean temperatures
  at various stations and for different periods of time show that, with some
  remarkable exceptions to be hereafter accounted for, cold displays itself on
  the average in the second half of the lunation, and a higher temperature
  at first quarter — at the very time when it may be supposed that the moon
  has parted with the whole of the heat she has received from the sun, and
  her crust opposite the earth has not been subjected to the solar rays for a
  sufficiently long period for lunar radiant heat to exercise any thermal
 action, either direct or indirect, on our atmosphere.
     This being so, the concurrent results of investigations undertaken by
 eminent physicists in this and other countries point to a maximum of cloud,
 rain, and vapour-bearing winds in the first half of the lunation, when the
 curves indicate     heatt ; and a minimum of cloud and rain, with drier winds,
 in the second half of the lunation. It was not difficult then to connect the
 two phenomena — all gardeners being practically aware of the fact that heat
 is retained in the soil by the agency of cloud J.                 Professor Tyndall has
 shown by his elaborate experiments, that this is the case also with respect
 to the aqueous vapour of the atmosphere.
      Whether the dispersion of Cloud is due to the Radiant heat of the
 Moon. — As regards the degree of heat which is attained by the moon, Sir
 John Herschel estimates it as equal to the boiling-point of water ; and the
 same eminent person considers that the radiation of this heat would be
 sufficient to disperse cloud in the upper regions of the air.
     The estimate of the moon's heat appears to be that of our satellite at
 the period of opposition.         But the maximum heat would not be attained
 until several days later ; for, the moon always turning the same face to the
 earth, her crust directly opposite to us does not attain its greatest heat
 until last quarter, at which time not only will it have received the sun's
 rays for twice the number of days during which that surface had been
 heated at the time       of opposition, but the adjoining region also (eastward
 of it), itself recently illuminated and heated for fourteen, thirteen, and
 twelve times the length of our day of twenty-four hours, although the sun's
    *  See Brit. Assoc. Reports, 1857, p. 218.
    t  The number of clear and cloudy days   at Greenwich, during the seven years (1841-47)
that bihourly observations were    made   at that station, also corresponds with the hot and
cold periods at the station.

rays have passed from      still radiates the heat that has been absorbed, and
                               it,
which      may be presumed has penetrated to
          it                                         depth (according to the
                                                          a
speed  with  which  the moon       travelling)
                                          is   commensurate   with the time of
its exposure to the sun.
   Again, as regards the date of the minimum temperature of the moon,
doubtless the absence of all atmosphere must greatly augment the action
of lunar radiation yet    ;     impossible to believe that the flood of heat
                               it    is
poured upon    the moon  day   and  night for so many days together, without
intermission, can be speedily dissipated. It would be more consistent with the
analogy of terrestrial meteorology that the state of cold in the moon should
be prolonged beyond the renewal of the sun's radiation, and consequently
no heat from her crust reach the limits of our atmosphere at first
quarter.
     It
     would be strictly according to analogy, also,     the length of time
                                                               if
which the moon's surface-crust takes to attain its maximum heat were
found to be greater than that which     takes in falling to its minimum.
                                                 it
Now there appears some reason to believe that this    the case and as the
                                                              is       ;
mean temperature of the year attains its maximum at Greenwich about the
end of July   considerable time after the summer solstice), and the day
                    (a
of minimum mean temperature occurs in the latter half of January (the
intervals      between the maximum             and minimum,   and the minimum   and
maximum,   being as 5-5 to 6-5), so in the tables and curves of lunar tem
perature for forty-three and fifty years,    longer interval will be found
                                                      a
between the day of maximum heat at the moon's first quarter and the day
of minimum heat of the last quarter, than between the days of minimum
and maximum.      Assuming, then, that the earth and the moon absorb heat
equally (due allowance being made for the alternate diurnal action of solar
and terrestrial radiation in the case of the earth, and the prolonged bi
monthly alternation of solar and lunar radiation in the case of the moon),
if we consider the portion of the curve between the days of maximum
and minimum as representing the period during which the temperature of
the moon  increasing, and the portion of the curve between the days of
               is
minimum and maximum as the period during which the temperature of
the moon    decreasing, the same causes operating in the case of both
               is
planets, there would appear to be actual evidence of similar effects.
   Exceptions accounted for. — Whether, however, the moon clears the
atmosphere by the agency of her radiant heat, or by thermo-electric
currents, or by changing the direction of the winds     phenomenon not un-
                                                              (a
frequently, perhaps, itself due to ascending currents caused         by
                                                               lunar radia
tion), the immediate causa of the phenomenon signalized by the curves would
still seem to be the presence or absence of cloud and vapour in the higher
regions of the air, and the exceptions to the rule of period of cloud being
                                                              a
on the average   period of heat would be owing to the varying positions
                     a
of the sun, the moon, and the earth, or to the fact that the formation of

228      Mr. J. P. Harrison — Lunar Influence           on Temperature.      [May  4^
cloud and vapour is due to the sun and the winds, and not in any wise,
as it would appear, to the moon, or, lastly, to that system of compensation
and alternation which seems to obtain so frequently in atmospheric pheno
mena,    and is so suggestive of mechanical force.
    The exceptions to the rule of a higher temperature               occurring at the
moon's first quarter, and lower temperatures after full moon, in any single
year or group of lunations, are not more frequent than occur during the
annual march of the seasons, and affect the position of the mean hottest

  be   delivered annually to the Fellows of the Royal Society.            It appears
  that the subject    of  muscular  motion  was   selected  by many   of  the earlier
  Croonian lecturers, and it has been generally considered that the Croonian
  Lecture should be confined to this department of local motion.           Although
  this view was founded upon a misconception, it would indeed have been
  difficult to have selected a subject better adapted for frequent and repeated
  investigation and illustration than muscular motion.             Notwithstanding
 more than a century has elapsed since the first Croonian Lecture was de
 livered, the nature of muscular motion, and the mechanism taking part in
 its production, still remain to be discovered.       In this as in every other de
 partment of natural knowledge, it is to be noticed that the gradual pro
 gress made by the unremitting labour of successive observers, so far from
 exhausting the fields of scientific inquiry, seems but to prepare the way for
 ever-increasing advance.
     By the excellent custom of appointing lecturers to deliver at certain
 intervals of time lectures upon the same department of natural knowledge,
 the actual progress achieved from time to time may be distinctly defined
 and duly registered, and new lines of inquiry suggested for future investi
 gators in the same department.         Although I have been led to choose for
 the subject of my lecture an anatomical question which seems extremely
 simple and of limited extent,      I  am compelled to leave many points but
 imperfectly    studied ; and  notwithstanding I have worked at this question
 earnestly for several years, my conclusions are in many respects still
 incomplete.
     It is remarkable how the positive determination of a simple question of
 fact may, as it were, recede as the investigation advances. However minute
 the detail, more and ever more detail seems required          before all doubt can
 be removed from the      mind of the student.
     I  should not have ventured     to ask the attention    of the Fellows of the
 Royal Society      to minute   and, necessarily, in many respects incomplete
 anatomical detail, were it not that some broad questions of very general
interest are involved in the inquiry     I have undertaken ; and I think that       I
 shall render what    I have to say far less tedious and irksome than it would
                    I
otherwise be, if state, in the first instance, the questions proposed for dis
cussion, and the general nature of the inferences I have arrived at.
    It   seems  to me that we can scarcely hope to determine the manner in
which the nervous system influences the muscular and other tissues, until
we have ascertained how the ultimate branches         of nerve-fibres are arranged,
and have demonstrated by actual observation, or proved by other means,
whether the nerves are disposed so as to form loops or plexuses, or whether
they exhibit distinct ends, or terminate in special organs or by becoming
continuous with other tissues.        And it is impossible to separate from this
inquiry the further and wider question, concerning the necessary structure
and typical arrangement      of a nervous apparatus.

    Our view regarding        the nature of the force which produces such mar
vellous    phenomena       as those known to result from nervous action, will be
materially influenced by the conclusion which we are led to accept regarding
the fundamental arrangement of the nerve-cells and fibres, central and
peripheral.
    If it could   be shown that a nerve passes from its centre and ends by free
terminations,     or by becoming continuous with the muscular tissue, we should
scarcely adopt the same general conclusion regarding the manner in which
the nerve-centre influences the contractile tissue as we should if it were
shown that the nerve merely passed amongst the muscular fibres without
being necessarily even in actual contact with them, and returned towards,
and eventually became connected with, the nerve-centre, without there being
any solution of continuity in any part of the circuit.           The investigations re
corded     in this and other memoirs          have led me to conclude that nerves
invariably form circuits,        and that there are in truth no ends at all.           I
believe that the nerve niachinery is a complete circuit, and that the active
phenomena are due rather to an alteration in the intensity of the current
passing along the nerves, than to its sudden interruption and completion.
    In  this Lecture      I  hope to be able to adduce facts which indicate the
existence     of  fibres passing from and towards all central and peripheral
nerve-cells.

               proceed to the special subject of my Lecture, must offer a few
remarks upon contractility.            Of late this term has been applied to move
ments occurring in living organisms which seem to me to be quite distinct
in their essential nature from contractility. I cannot hold that the move
ments occurring in an amoeba or white blood-corpuscle are of the same
nature as those which occur in muscle, and I cannot, therefore, regard both
classes  of movements       as manifestations   of one property, contractility.

    Vital   movements.    — The peculiar movements occurring in a mass of ger
minal matter       are illustrated by the drawing now exhibited.           Protrusions
may    occur   at  one  or   many  points  of  the  mass   at  the same  time, and the
whole mass may move in one direction like an amoeba.               Now it will scarcely
be   maintained     by any   one  that the changes    of form occurring in a mass of
living matter     are due to external agency.        As far   as can be ascertained by
observation, the movement is primary, and depends upon the active forces
inherent in the matter itself.        This form of motion has never been explained
or accounted for ; but as it ceases with the death of living matter, it is
only reasonable to infer that it is intimately associated with those other
phenomena which are peculiar to matter in the living state.                     It may
therefore be termed vital motion, to distinguish it from every other kind of
movement known.            The rotation and other movements affecting the " pro

1865.]                 Movements        of Granules within     Cells.                 233
     In  the immediate vicinity of ciliated cells are sometimes observed cells
with    opeu mouths, out of which mucus and various substances, formed or
secreted in the interior of the cell, pass.             In the formation of these pro
ducts, nutrient matter from the blood, after passing through the attached
extremity of the cell, is probably absorbed by the living matter. At the
same time the outermost portion of the latter becomes converted into the
peculiar contents of the cell, and thus the formed matter which has been
already produced becomes pushed towards the orifice.                This is explained by
the drawing; and I think that the movements of cilia are brought about by
 a somewhat similar series of changes, in which the germinal or living matter,
usually termed
                   " nucleus,"      plays the active and most important part.
     Movements    of granules     within cells. — The movement of insoluble           par
 ticles from one part    of a  cell  to  anot her, as occurs in  the  radiating pigment-
 cells of Batrachia, is probably due to alteration in the direction of the flow
 of fluid in the cells, from the cavity of the cell towards the tissues, or
from the surrounding tissue into the cell.             If the capillaries were fully dis
 tended, fluid would permeate their walls and would pass into the cavity of the
 cells, in which case the insoluble particles would gradually become diffused
 and would pass into all parts of the cell ; while, on the other hand, if the
 capillaries were reduced in diameter, and the lateral pressure upon their
 walls reduced, there would he, as is well known, a tendency for the fluid in
 the surrounding tissue to flow towards the vessels and pass into their
 interior.    In this  case the quantity      of fluid in the cells would    he gradually
 reduced, and the insoluble particles would become aggregated together and
 would collect in those situations where there was most space, as in the
 central    part of the cell, around the nucleus.               Moreover, in the last
 case, the flow of fluid, which constantly sets towards the nucleus, would
 be instrumental in drawing the particles in this same direction, while if
 the cell contained a considerable proportion of fluid, the currents would
 pass between the particles without moving them. Evaporation, as it occurs
 after death, causes concentration of the insoluble particles towards the
 centre   of the cells.
      On the other hand, the changes in the pigment-cells of the frog have
 been considered by Professor Lister to be due to vital actions, and he
 agrees with Wittich and others that they are under the immediate control
 of the nervous system. Indirectly of course they are, but I do not think that
  anv experiments have proved satisfactorily that the nerves exert any direct
  influence upon the movements of the particles in these cells.                  It is well
  known that the nerves govern the calibre of the vessels, and thus influence
  the amount of fluid in the surrounding tissue, and in this indirect manner
  they doubtless affect the movements of the particles in the cells.                   The
  reader will find a full account of Prof. Lister's experiments, and the argu

  and which are intended to show the alterations           in form supposed to take
  place in the ultimate particles of any contractile tissue — movements occurring
  in definite directions, which may be represented by lines at right angles to
  one another.     These movements are quite distinct from those varied move
  ments in all directions which affect matter in the germinal or living state.
  Contractile   tissue is formed material, and contractility occurs in tissue
  which does not exhibit any of those properties or powers which distinguish
  living matter.      It seems to me, therefore, that contractility is not a vital
 property;    and   I  think that the term contractility should be restricted to
  movements which are remarkable for their constant repetition, and for the
  simplicity of their character.      The changes which occur in the particles of
  a muscle during action might be spoken of as alternate shortening and
  lengthening.
                                      Experiment.
     The phenomena of contractility can         be studied more satisfactorily  in the
  muscles   of the common maggot or larva of the blow-fly than in those of
  any ether animal      I am acquainted     with.    The movements, which are very
  beautiful, continue for ten minutes or a quarter of an hour after the muscles
  have been removed from the body of the recently killed animal ; and I hope
  to be able to prepare a specimen which can be passed round in one of the
  portable microscopes and examined by the Fellows.                 [Preparation sent
 round.] In the winter I have seen the contractions continue for upwards
 of half an hour. But the most beautiful and instructive method of exa
  mination is under the influence of polarized light, with a plate of selenite.
 In    the microscope upon the table, the arrangement has been made; and
 when the ground is green, the waves of contraction which pass along each
 muscular fibre in various directions, are of a bright purple. In other parts
 of the field the complementary colours         are reversed.    There are few micro
 scopic objects, that I am acquainted with, so beautiful as this. With the aid
 of very high powers, the actual change occurring in the contractile tissue as
 it passes from a state of relaxation to contraction, and from this to relaxa
 tion again, may be studied, and for many minutes at a time*.

   The demonstration                of the ultimate    arrangement     of the most minute
nerve-fibres     matter of such great difficulty that the anatomist
                  is   a                                                com              is

muscular fibres of this organ are extremely fine, and                       are   slightly    sepa

between the fibres.

of the nerve-fibres          in involuntary muscle      but

cases in which we may still fail to demonstrate them, than to infer they
are absent simply because we have failed to render them distinct*.

    The bundles of dark-bordered           fibres which    may be traced to the pos
terior part of the frog's bladder divide and subdivide freely, spreading out
in the form of a lax network, the fibres constituting which may be followed
 for some distance, and many may be traced to their ultimate distribution
in the thin tissue of the bladder.           Over a great part of the frog's bladder,
however, no dark-bordered fibres or bundles of moderately coarse fibres
can be detected     ; yet the organ is in every part very freely supplied          with
nerves.
    Bundles of excessively fine fibres, first described by me*, may be traced
running parallel with many of the small arteries, and may be seen to divide
and subdivide into finer bundles, which at length form a plexiform net
work. Here and there is seen a plexus of very fine fibres, from which
bundles     of fine fibres diverge in different directions.         That very many of
these fine fibres come from the numerous ganglion-cells found in connexion
with the nerve-trunks there is no doubt ; and it is equally certain that many
also result from the division and subdivision           of dark-bordered fibres.    But
whether the large dark-bordered fibres seen in the nerve- trunks pass directly
to their distribution in the bladder, or in the first place become connected
with ganglion-cells, it is difficult to decide with absolute certainty ; I have,
however, traced several of the large fibres directly from the trunks to their
distribution, but even in these instances         I  am not prepared to assert that no
branches pass to the ganglion-cells.           My impression is that sometimes this
is the case, but that some of the fibres pass to their distribution without
there being any such connexion with ganglion-cells ; and I think it probable
that, of the fibres resulting from the division of a dark-bordered fibre derived
from the cord, some may become connected with ganglion-cells, while others
may pass to their distribution in the bladder without being connected with
these cells.
    In the very thin membrane of which the walls of the frog's bladder are
composed we may follow out the distribution of nerves — a to the muscular
tissue,   h to the surface of the mucous membrane,           c to the vessels, and d to
the connective tissue.
    In  this drawing the general arrangement of the nerve network is repre
sented, from which fibres pass to supply all the tissues of the bladder.
    Upon the external surface of the lung of the frog muscular fibre-cells
exist in small number, and to these a network of delicate nerve-fibres is dis
tributed.     These    muscular     and    nerve-fibres   are,  however,   much   more
highly developed upon the newt's lung than upon that of the frog.                   But
in this Lecture I restrict myself to the consideration of the distribution of
nerves to the muscular         fibre-cells, which is described in very few words
and will be at once understood by reference to the diagram to which I now
direct attention.

 are crossed sometimes in two or three places by very fine nerve-fibres ; and
 not unfrequently the nerve-fibre runs parallel with the muscular fibre-cell
 for some distance.
    These nerve-fibres are extremely fine, and require very high powers for
 their demonstration.           They are certainly not connected in any way either
 with the nucleus or with the contractile tissue of the muscular fibre. They
 cross the fibre either obliquely or at right angles ; and oftentimes a nerve-fibre
 runs for some distance parallel with the muscular fibre. The influence,
 therefore, exerted by the nerve-fibre cannot depend upon any continuity of
 texture   between it and the contractile tissue, but is doubtless due to the
 passage of a current through the nerve, which determines a temporary alter
 ation in the relations to one another of the particles of which the contrac
tile tissue consists.
    Although       I speak of the ultimate nerve-fibres as being arranged so as
 to form   a network, it must not be supposed that this network is arranged
 on the principle of a capillary network.             Every fibre of this network is com

pound ; so that perhaps the term                  plexus             truly describes the ar
rangement.
                    "  Plexiform    network,"     I think,  expresses the character of the
arrangement still more exactly*.
    Some have said that my view accords with the old idea of looplike ter
 minations of nerves ; and this is in the main true, but the course of one single
fibre forming the loop is far more extensive than was supposed by the older
observers, and the "looped fibres" divide and subdivide into finer fibres.
This diagram is intended to represent a plan of the arrangement which is
shown to exist in many tissues according to my observation.
    Although it       be admitted that networks          are formed,     it might  be said that
from them fine fibres may branch off here and there, and terminate in ends
within the     space or area.         The results of actual observation and a careful
consideration       of the various facts bearing upon the question               are, however,
strongly opposed to such            a doctrine.

    So far as   I   can ascertain, all     involuntary muscular fibre is freely supplied
with nerve-fibres,         and   in all cases the nerves are arranged so as to form
networks.       In many instances ganglia are seen in connexion with the
nerves ramifying amongst the muscular fibre-cells encircling the vessels.

the appearance      of  a network   of fibres is produced ;  but every apparent   thread  is com

of the frog   :  they are to be detected upon the iliac arteries in considerable
number.      The results of Mr. Lister's experiments render it probable that
ganglia    exist in connexion     with the arteries of the limbs      (Phil. Trans,
pt.   2 for 1858, p. 620).
    In this figure a small ganglion in course of development upon one of the
iliac arteries of the frog is represented ; and several fine branches of nerve-
fibres can be followed amongst the muscular fibre-cells.           I have seen very
fine nerve-fibres     beneath   the   circular muscular    fibre-cells,  apparently
lying just external to the lining membrane of the artery, and composed of
longitudinal fibres with elongated nuclei — an observation which confirms a
statement of Luschka's.         I have not succeeded in satisfying myself that
nerve-fibres are ever distributed to the lining membrane of an artery, al
though, from the appearances I have observed, I cannot assert that this is
not the case.      In the auricle of the heart and at the commencement of the
venae cavae, very fine nerve-fibres are certainly distributed very near indeed
to the internal surface, being separated from the blood only by a very thin
layer of transparent tissue (connective tissue).
    The distribution of nerve-fibres to the coats of a small artery about the
-j^-;jth of an inch in diameter is represented in this drawing.         In all cases
 (and I have examined vessels in almost all the tissues of the frog), not only
are nerve-fibres distributed in considerable number upon the external surface
of the artery, ramifying in the connective tissue, but I have also followed
the fibres amongst the circular fibres of the arterial coat.         The nerves can
be as readily followed in the external coat as in the fibrous tissues generally     ;
and the appearance of the finest nucleated nerve-fibres, already alluded to,
enables one to distinguish them most positively from the fibres of the con
nective tissue in which they ramify.
    These nerves invariably form networks with wide meshes.               I have de
monstrated      such an arrangement over and over again.           A similar dispo
sition may be seen in the auricle of the frog, in the coats of the venae cave?
near their origin from the auricle, among the striped muscular fibres of the
lymphatic hearts of the posterior extremities of the frog, and in other
 situations.     Kolliker confesses  that he has not succeeded in observing dis
tinct terminations to the nerves distributed to the       vessels of muscles.    He
 states that some arteries are completely destitute of nerves, and, apparently
 without having given much attention to the subject, says "hence it is
 evident that the walls of the arteries are not in such essential need of nerves
 as is usually supposed."       It is easy to demonstrate nerves in considerable
 number on all the arteries of the frog, and in the case of certain vessels of
man and the higher animals in which we have failed to demonstrate nerves,
 it is more reasonable to assume that they are there, although they have not
 been seen, than to infer their absence simply because we have failed to
render them distinct.        In the case of the umbilical arteries of the foetus
 and their subdivisions     in the placenta, it is quite certain there are no true
 dark-bordered     nerve-fibres, but we now know that the active part of a nerve

  may consist of an exceedingly delicate, pale, and scarcely visible fibre, con
  nected with a nucleus.       Such delicate fibres and nuclei are to be demon
  strated   amongst the muscular fibres of these arteries, but in consequence
  of not having been able to trace them continuously for any great distance,
  I  cannot assert that these are true nerves ; but no one has yet proved they
 are not nerves, or has demonstrated their real nature.
      The nerves which supply the small arterial branches in the voluntary
  muscles of the frog, come from the very same fibres which are distributed
 to the muscles. I have seen a dark-bordered fibre divide into two branches,
 one of which ramified upon an adjacent vessel, while the other was distri
 buted to the elementary fibres of the muscle.           In my paper " On the Struc
 ture of the PapillaB of the Frog's Tongue" these statements have been con
 firmed ; and in the figure to which I now point, nerves distributed to arteries
 and to elementary muscular fibres of striped muscle are seen to be derived
 from the same trunk of dark-bordered nerve-fibres.

      0/ the  arrangement     of dark-bordered fibres distributed to voluntary
                               muscle and other tissues.
     The plexiform arrangement of nerve-trunks and nerve-fibres is one which
is very general, and was known even to the older anatomists.                   It can be
 demonstrated in many cases even by rough dissection.                 It exists not only
in the case of nerves distributed to muscle, but,          as far as is known, to every
 other tissue which receives a supply of nerves.             Many of     these networks
are very beautiful ; and the arrangement is illustrated by these figures,
which represent the bundles of dark-bordered nerve-fibres distributed re
spectively to the diaphragm of the white mouse, the mylohyoid of the green
tree-frog, and the eyelid of the same animal.             The fibres constituting the
bundles     never run perfectly parallel with one another, nor can a separate
fibre usually be followed for any great distance. This arises from the fact
that the fibres frequently cross one another, and many seem to pursue a spiral
course.      The spiral arrangement of nerve-fibres has been already described
in former communications.          At an early period of development            one fibre
may be seen coiled spirally round the other, as is well shown in this
drawing*.       The rule seems to be universal that fibres on one side of a
trunk cross over and pursue their course on the opposite side. Those on
the lower part of a trunk soon pass to the upper part, and vice versd.
Instead of a nerve passing to its distribution by the shortest route, it
invariably seems to pursue a very circuitous course.                The course of the
nerve-fibres    in the   optic commissure is not peculiar          to this part of the
nervous system, but a similar arrangement is to be met with in all nerves.
When two trunks meet, as represented in this figure, fibres are found to
pursue the several courses represented by the lines.

  Division of the dark-bordered nerve-fibres as they approach their distri
                                          bution.
     It is to be specially noted that the dark-bordered fibres very frequently
divide, and, in consequence of the fibres being exceedingly thin at the points
of division, which occur, for the most part, just where a bundle of fibres
divides into two branches, they are seen only in very carefully prepared speci
mens.         Although Wagner long ago showed that dark-bordered fibres un
derwent subdivision,         the numerous subdivisions which     I have  demonstrated
in all dark-bordered        fibres near their peripheral distribution and also as they
pass      towards the nerve-centre, have not been generally observed.               The
number of fibres into which a single dark-bordered fibre divides is very great
in a comparatively short course.            The resulting subdivisions pursue very
different directions, and can often be followed for a considerable distance as
they run with other dark-bordered fibres.             From this it follows that many
different parts of a muscle at a distance from one another may be supplied
with nerves which result from the subdivision of a single dark-bordered
fibre.
     The fibres resulting from the subdivision of the dark-bordered fibres are
of    less diameter than the parent trunks ; but the area of the section of two
fibres would invariably be much greater than that of the parent trunk. For
the most part the fibres divide dichotomously ; but sometimes a fibre is
seen to divide into as many as three or four divisions, and in muscle five, six,
 or even more dark-bordered fibres have been seen to result from the division
of one.        The finer dark-bordered fibres often run in the same bundle with
coarse dark-bordered fibres, the former beiug in fact much nearer to their
 ultimate destination than the latter.         The dark-bordered fibres distributed
to the muscles of the frog often divide into two very fine fibres, as repre
sented in several of these figures.         These fibres may be traced onwards for
some       distance.    They do not exhibit the dark-bordered character.           They
appear pale and granular, and connected with them at varying intervals are
 nuclei.       These pale nucleated fibres in the frog are often less than the
  .
    o *0 0
             of an inch in diameter.        They   are nevertheless compound, and
 consist of bundles of still finer fibres.           These in fact, although much
 narrower,       correspond to the pale, granular, but nucleated intermuscular
 nerves first described by me in the muscles of the mouse (Phil. Trans. 1860).
 The very fine compound fibres still continue to divide and subdivide, and
 assist to form plexuses and networks in precisely the same manner as the
 dark-bordered       fibres, of which they are the continuation.        It is quite cer
 tain that these pale fibres are true nerve-fibres, for they are directly conti
 nuous with the dark-bordered fibres.           Instead of breaking up into one or
 more bundles of fine fibres, a dark-bordered fibre not unfrequently divides
 into a finer dark -bordered, and a bundle of fine fibres, as represented in this
 drawing from the frog's mesentery.

            0f the fine fibres  running with the dark-bordered fibres.
    1We find  in the  same    nerve-trunk    fine and coarse dark-bordered     fibres,
and we often observe exceedingly            fine pale fibres running with dark-
bordered fibres, the essential      difference  between these two classes of fibres
in   the same trunk being that the former fibre is nearer to its ultimate
distribution than the latter ; but in some instances it is probable that the
fine fibre is a branch of the sympathetic.           The fine fibre runs in the same
transparent matrix (sheath) with the dark-bordered fibre. In fact the idea
of tubular membrane or sheath being an essential and separate anatomical
constituent of every individual dark-bordered fibre must be given up. For,
as I showed in 1860, several dark-bordered fibres and fine fibres might run
together in the same sheath or matrix.             The opinion that the fine fibres
which I hold to be nerve-fibres running in the same sheath with the dark-
bordered fibres, are not nerve-fibres at all, but modified connective tissue, is,
however, still entertained by many observers.              As I have before stated,
 their continuity with true dark-bordered fibres may often be seen, and the
 same fibre may in some instances be followed to its ultimate distribution.
   The different and incompatible views existing between continental observers
 and myself are in some measure due to this sheath question. The so-called
 sheath is not a "tube" or "membrane," or "tubular membrane," which con
 tains   the other constituents     of the nerve-fibre   ;  nor is it a sheath which
 invests them, but it is simply a transparent matrix, in which nerve-fibres,
 coarse and fine, are imbedded.          The so-called sheath is not formed as a
 special structure to invest the nerve-fibres, but it results from changes oc
 curring in the nerve-fibres themselves. This
                                                      " sheath " or " tubular mem
 brane
         " of  the so-called dark-bordered       fibre precisely corresponds to the
 transparent   connective tissue, in which the fine nerve-fibres are imbedded.
 It is a form of connective       tissue, and in many situations where nerves
 existed at an earlier period, nothing but this so-called sheath remains. All
 the soluble fatty matters have disappeared, and this material, which is not
 readily absorbed, is left behind.       Vessels may waste, and ducts and glands
 may waste, and leave behind them the same sort of transparent connective
 tissue.    Moreover, as I have before stated, it is altogether a fallacy to
 suppose that near the peripheral distribution, every single branch of nerve-
 fibre is surrounded by its own separate sheath.           The drawings of the so-
 called axis-cylinder near the terminal distribution of the nerves also seem to
  me to be diagrammatic,     founded rather upon a theoretical idea     of the consti
 tution of the nerve-fibre than upon the results of actual observation.
     Many of the pale fibres accompanying the dark-bordered fibres are
 doubtless sympathetic fibres, for it has been shown that there are, fine fibres
 springing from ganglion-cells which retain the same character from their
  origin to their distribution (see p. 236). Not only has the nervous nature
 of the fine fibres above described been proved by tracing them from
 their connexion with ganglion-cells, but a dark-bordered fibre has often
  been observed to be drawn out so as to form a line as fine as these              fine

  fibres.   Indeed the observer often fails to trace an individual dark-bordered
 fibre for any great distance in consequence of its becoming exceedingly fine
 at the point where it crosses, or is crossed by other dark-bordered fibres.
  Not only so, but where a bundle of comparatively wide dark-bordered fibres
 passes through a small aperture, as for example in a bone, the fibres appear,
 as it were, drawn out to exceedingly thin threads, as represented in this
 figure.
      And it may    be  fairly argued that since a wide dark-bordered fibre may
 be reduced in certain parts of its course to a fine cord not more than the
  ypfa^th of an inch in diameter, without its integrity or conducting-powcr
 being interfered with, there is nothing unreasonable in concluding that fine
 fibres   of the  same diameter are efficient    conductors   of the nerve-current,
 although     their length may     be considerable.    And  I  have shown   that in
 many of the tissues of the frog (bladder, connective tissue, auricle, &c.), the
 finest branches of the nerves at their distribution are invariably less than
 the gujiUuth of an inch in diameter.         Is it then probable that the nerves
 distributed to the elementary fibres of the voluntary muscles of the limbs
 should form the single exception to this very general arrangement, and that
the peripheral nerves of muscle should exhibit the dark-bordered character
up to, or to within, a very short distance of their ultimate distribution cr
termination,     as is maintained by many German anatomists.
   0/ the   distribution of the pale nucleated nerve-fibres to the elementary
                                    muscular fibres.
     Few anatomical questions have received of late years a larger share of at
tention than the ultimate arrangement of nerve-fibres in voluntary muscle.
It is a matter of regret to me that although I have studied the question in
many ways during the last five years, my conclusions do not accord with
those of any other observer.        And I must admit that although the German
writers differ from one another on not unimportant points, they, nevertheless,
agree in this, that the nerves form ends, pass into end-organs, or exhibit
terminal extremities of some kind ; while on the other hand my observations
have led me to conclude not only that nerves never terminate in ends in vo
tary muscle, but that there are no terminal extremities or ends in any nervous
organ whatever.
    With regard to the ultimate arrangement of nerves in muscle, the con
clusions of Kolliker accord more nearly with my own than those of any
other observer.       (Compare Kolliker' s statements in his Croonian Lecture
delivered in 1862, with the results stated in my paper, published in the
Phil. Trans, for 1860.)         Kolliker agrees with me in the opinion that the
nerves lie upon the external surface of the sarcolemma ; but what he
                                                                           regards
as ends or natural terminations, I believe to be mere breaks or
                                                                     interruptions
in fibres which in their natural state were prolonged
                                                             continuously.
    And there is this further broad difference between foreign observers
                                                                                and
myself, that while they consider that each elementary muscular fibre is
                                                                               very

 sparingly supplied with nerves — a very long fibre receiving nervous supply
 at one single point only — I have been led to conclude that every muscular
 fibre is crossed by very delicate nerve-fibres, frequently, and at short intervals,
 the intervals varying much in different eases, but, I believe, never being of
greater extent than the intervals between the capillary vessels.
    My friend Kiihne, of Berlin, has probably published more papers upon
 this vexed question than any other observer. He maintains that the nerve
always passes through the sarcolemma and comes into direct contact with
 the contractile tissue*, or ends in protoplasmic matter which is in continuity
with the muscle.       He has, however, from time to time been led to modify
his view very materially, as these figures, copied from his various memoirs
published between the years 1662 and 1864, will testify.                In his memoir
published in 1 862, he described minutely the structure of some very peculiar
organs, which he stated had been demonstrated by him in connexion with
the pale terminal intramuscular branches of the nerve-fibres.                 In more
recent memoirs he seems to have abandoned the idea of the existence of
those very peculiar bodies which he termed
                                                       " Nerven-Endkuospen," and
with reason, since no other observer professes to have seen objects at nil
resembling those figured by Kiihne.             I should, however, state that the
observations of Kiihne have       in  the  main  been supported by Engelmnnn and
some other observers.
    In this Lecture I am unable to give even a brief account of the different
views now entertained by the numerous observers who have studied this
question ; but in these drawings some of the most important are represented.

    As the observations of Kolliker,       Kiihne, and other observers in Ger
many, who followed me, were made upon the breast-muscle of the frog,
while my first inquiries were instituted upon the muscles of the white
mouse, I subjected this particular muscle of the frog to the same process of
investigation which I had previously adopted in my researches in 1858-59,
which were published in I860.         The results of these investigations will be
understood by reference to these drawings, most of which were printed in
my paper published in the Philosophical Transactions for 1862; and as
explanations are appended to these figures, it is unnecessary to describe them
more minutely here.
   Although the results of this further inquiry (published          in 1862) were
favourable    to the view    I  had advanced, they were deficient in this most

important point, viz. that the supposed network (as seen in this scheme)
had not heen conclusively demonstrated over the frog's muscular fibres gene
rally.       Near the point where the dark-bordered fibre divided to form pale
fibres, a network was demonstated as is here shown, but it could not in many
instances be traced for any great distance from this point.               The following
points,      however,  seem     tome   to have  been  established in this memoir:- — -
      1.   That the nerve-fibres, as I had already stated and as was confirmed
by     Kolliker,   were outside the sarcolemma.
      2. That the fibres might be followed for a greater distance from the
dark-bordered fibre than they had been traced before, if the specimens were
prepared according to the new method of investigation which I described.
      3. The fine pale fibres were proved to be composed of several finer fibres,
which resulted from the division of the dark-bordered fibre, and the pale
fibres in the sheath of the nerve, which were also demonstrated for the first
time.
      4. Contrary to the statements of Continental observers, it was proved
 that the elementary muscular fibres of the frog were crossed at numerous
 points by nerve-fibres, and that the nervous supply to each elementary mus
 cular fibre was much more free and uniform than was supposed.                This fact
 may be demonstrated more especially in the thin muscles of the eye and in
 the mylohyoid of the frog.
      Not satisfied with       these results, I examined numerous other muscles of
 the     frog and other animals, in the hope of being able to demonstrate the
 finest nerve-fibres        in every part of their course over the sarcolemma, but
 was not able to obtain any muscle in the common frog sufficiently thin to
  trace the finest branches over a very considerable extent of surface.                In
  the mylohyoid of the Hyla, however, I found a muscle eminently adapted
  for this investigation ; and on June 5th, 1863, I presented a pnper (pub
  lished in the ' Proceedings ') to the Royal Society upon the arrangement of
  the     nerves in this beautiful muscle.        I  have prepared many specimens in
  which the nerve can be followed from one undoubted nerve-trunk to another,
  dividing and subdividing in its course, so as to form with other nerves a
  lax network of compound nucleated fibres, which compound fibres are often
  less than the           - of an inch in diameter.
                    m „„
       The arrangement will be understood by reference to this drawing, which
   explains itself.      I believe that no other explanation of the appearances
   observed in these specimens, .than the one I have adopted, can be offered.
   In some of the muscles at the root of the tongue, the same arrangement
   lias been demonstrated most          distinctly.
       More recently     I   have again studied the elementary muscular fibres from
   the breast-muscle of the frog, and have succeeded, in many cases, in tracing
   the fine granular nucleated fibres for a considerable distance.             Near the
   margin     of the muscle,      I have recently succeeded in following a very fine
   fibre, resulting from the subdivision of a dark-bordered fibre, into fibres
   prolonged from what appear to be connective-tissue-corpuscles.            The nuclei

of the network of fine nerve-fibres have often heen mistaken for the con
nective-tissue-corpuscles beneath and, in some cases, amongst which they
lie ; and as old nerve-fibres, as well as other structures, degenerate and
leave behind them what is called "connective tissue," a mistake is easily
made unless the preparation be very clear*. In this drawing some very
fine nerve-fibres, distributed to a portion of muscle at some distance from a
dark-bordered          fibre, are represented.

              The distribution
     The highly elaborate and rapid movements of insects would lead to the
inference that in them the distribution of nerves to the muscles must be
very free. The textures are, however, so very elaborate, and their structure
so   minute,      the difficulty of demonstration must needs be greatly
                  that
increased.   Kiihne's memoir, published in the year 1860, related to the dis
tribution of nerves to the muscles of Hydrophilus piceus.     He represented
the nerve as perforating  the sarcolemma,  and being distributed almost in a
brush-like manner to the contractile tissue. Subsequently he thought the
nerve was connected with the line of muscular nuclei ; but it was obvious
that these were muscular,                not nervous    nuclei   at all,   and this view was
abandoned.         Some other observers have fallen into the same error.                 Al
though I      have examined the muscles           of many insects, and especially those
of the Hydrophilus,           I   have been unable to confirm the observations made
by some Continental observers.

as   respects the nature of the Nervenhugel, we are at variance upon the
further course and mode of termination of the nerve-fibre, M. Rouget
maintaining that it penetrates beneath the sarcolemma and there terminates
in a very fine fibre, in contact with a very limited portion of the contractile
tissue, while I have been able to trace the nerve for a long distance beyond
the point at which he makes it end, and               I have seen it dividing into very
fine fibres, which form an extended network upon the sarcolemma, as repre
sented in this drawing, to which I beg to direct special attention.                    M.
Rouget's researches lead him to conclude that the arrangement of the nerves
in the muscles of Articulata is totally distinct from that met with in Verte-
brata.     " II result  de ces  fails qu'il n'y  a pas d'identite entre les divers modes
de terminaison        des  fibres    nerveuses motrices      chez les vertebres     et les
articules." On the other hand, my observations lead me to the conclusion
that the arrangement is in its essential points the same in all classes of
animals.       In no case are there nerve-ends, but always plexuses or networks,
which     are never in structural continuity with the contractile tissue of the
muscle.
    I  have    particularly studied the arrangement and distribution of the
nerves in the leech.         The same facts noticed in p. 258 on the branching of
nerve-fibres, are observed in the nerves of this animal ; and I have been able
to obtain many specimens of nerves which could hardly be distinguished
from some of the finest dark-bordered fibres of the higher animals.                  Some
of the muscular fibres of this animal are very thin, and are separated from
one another by considerable intervals, in which the ramification of exceed
ingly delicate nerve-fibres can be readily detected, and the nerve-fibres can
be followed to their connexion with ganglion-cells.                 I have made many
specimens of the muscles of the leech, and taken several drawings to illus
trate these points, but        I  regret that   I am unable to have these      copied for
this memoir.
   Of the structure of the bodies termed nerve-tufts, nerve-eminences, and
          Nervenhugel,     seen   in connexion with certain muscular nerves.
    I propose now to consider the structure of the peculiar bodies in con
nexion with the nerves distributed to the muscles of certain animals, described
by    Kiihne, Rouget, Krause, and others.             These differ from the bodies first
studied     by  Kblliker    in  the  breast-muscle     of the frog, which are referred
 to in p. 261.      I  have never been able to demonstrate such bodies as            I am
about to describe in the muscles of animals generally, although they are ex
 ceedingly distinct in the muscles of lizards, as shown by Rouget.                 I have
 demonstrated      many in the cutaneous           muscles of the neck, and        in the
 muscles    of the tongue of the chameleon, and shall carefully consider the
 structure of these.
    In the first place, I would remark that these bodies are external to the
 sarcolemma, as may be proved by examination of the specimens.                        The
 course of the nerves to and from these bodies almost renders it impossible

218                      Dr. Beale — Croonian Lecture.                  [May 11,
that they could he heneath the sarcolemma, while in many cases the outline
of the sarcolemma can be followed underneath them. Secondly, it appears
probable that they are a reduplication and expansion of continuous fibres,
rather than terminal organs formed upon the extremities of the nerve-fibres ;
nor would it seem that these organs are essential to the action of nerves
upon muscle, since they are only to be demonstrated in the muscles of cer
tain animals.      Moreover,  as many different forms  of these nerve-organs nre
to be seen in a small piece of     muscle,  exhibiting different degrees of com
plexity,   we  may perhaps by     studying   them attentively be able to draw a
true inference as to their real structure and the mode of their formation.
     Kiihne's idea of the structure of these bodies is represented in this
diagram, which has been copied from his last paper.           The interpretation
of the appearances here given is totally different from that which I have been
led to offer.    In my specimens the nerve-fibres entering into the formation
of these tufts are seen to divide and subdivide into several branches, which
are folded, as it were, upon one another.       The fibre in many instances does
not consist of the axis-cylinder only, but the white substance may also be
detected in connexion with some of the fibres.       The nuclei seem to be con
nected with the finer branches of the nerve-fibres.       In fact the organ seems
 to consist partly of broad fibres, partly of fine fibres formed by the branch
ing, spreading out, and coiling of the fibres resulting from the subdivision
 of the original nerve-fibres which enter into the formation of the tuft.
Moreover I have succeeded in demonstrating that, from various points of the
oval coil, branches pass off and run on the surface of the sarcolemma, pro
bably passing on to other nerve-bundles.           These fine fibres, which are
represented in my drawings, have not been delineated, as far as I am aware,
by any previous observer who has examined these bodies.              In connexion
with    every nerve-tuft there seem to be entering and emerging fibres ; and in
the majority of instances, fine fibres may be traced from the tuft in several
different directions.
     When the nerve-tuft is formed,   as it were, upon the trunk of the fibre, the
 entering fibres are more     numerous   and larger than the emerging fibres.
 This is probably to be explained by the circumstance that some fibres pass
 away from each tuft upon the surface of the muscle, and thus establish
 communications      with nerve-fibres which approach the elementary mus
 cular fibre at other points.     This drawing explains how, as the muscular
 fibre grows, the bundles      marked  a and b become separated further and
 further from one another, and the fine communicating fibres connecting
 them necessarily become so very much drawn out that they are too delicate
 to be seen upon the surface of the sarcolemma.
     And now it must    be obvious that these bodies precisely correspond to the
  bendiugs and division of the fine dark-bordered fibres at the point where
  they come into contact with the surface of the sarcolemma, in the breast-
  and other muscles of the frog.      At this point there is always a twisting of
  fibres with free branching,   and the formation   of a number     of exceedingly

1865.]              Distribution of Nerves     to Striped Muscle.              249
delicate nerve-fibres, the nuclei or masses     of germinal matter being very close
together, so that a considerable number are to be observed within a com
paratively small space.        Here a complex network of fibres, the meshes of
which are very small, is found.        But this plexus or network is not terminal,
nor does it result from the branching of a single fibre, as has been repre
sented.     Many fibre* enter into its formation ; and from various parts of it
long fine fibres pass off to be distributed upon the surface of the sarcolemma.
This is explained in these figures from the frog, from the white mouse, and
in this one from the maggot.
    It seems most probable that at the situation of these coils the contraction
of the muscular fibre would commence, and that, from the nerve-current tra
versing several fibres collected over a comparatively small portion of muscle,
the contraction at these points would be most intense, while it is probable
that the contractions commencing at these points would extend, as it were,
from them along the fibre in opposite directions.
    I consider these nerve-tufts therefore simply as collections of nerve-fibres,
differing only from the ordinary arrangement before described, somewhat in
the    same manner as the compressed nerve-network in a highly sensitive
papilla differs from the lax expanded nerve-network in the almost insensitive
connective tissue.
Of the arrangement of the nerve-fibres in other forms of striped muscle, as
    the branching fibres      of the tongue,    the muscular fibres  of the heart,
    and lymphatic hearts      of the frog.
    To certain forms of striped muscle in which no distinct membranous
tube    of sarcolemma   can be demonstrated, nerves are freely distributed ; but
all attempts to demonstrate end-organs or terminal extremities in such tex
tures have hitherto failed.         In the heart the existence of delicate nerve-
fibres arranged     to form networks is distinct    ; and perhaps the most favour
able    locality for demonstrating     these fibres is the auricle of the frog's
heart.      Bundles of exceedingly fine nerve-fibres,      much resembling those
in the     bladder, can be seen running in different directions and branching
 amongst the delicate networks of exceedingly fine muscular fibres.           Very
fine fibres may be observed       in thin specimens with the aid of high powers,
 crossing the fine muscular fibres at different angles, then dipping down
 in the intervals between them, and being soon lost in consequence of their
 ramification in the deeper layers.
     In this drawing the relation of the nerve-fibre to the finest part of some
 of the branching muscles of the tongue is represented ; and I have observed
 an arrangement precisely similar in the case of the muscular walls of the
 lymphatic hearts of the same animal.             The very thin and narrow mus
 cular fibres of the heart and tongue would appear to offer very many ad
 vantages for the demonstration of ends and end-organs, supposing them to
  exist ; but the most careful observation under the most favourable circum
  stances   and with the aid    of the highest powers, reveals only delicate nu

cleated nerve-fibres, forming lax networks, branches of which may often be
followed for a very long distance, and then traced into neighbouring nerve-
trunks.
                  Of the finest   nerve-fibres which influence the muscle.
    It  is probable that the active part of the nerve-fibre, as regards the ele
mentary muscular fibre, commences only at the point where the dark-
bordered character of the nerve-fibre ceases, and therefore that the most
important and most active portion of the peripheral nerve-fibres distributed
to muscle, has escaped the observation of many observers.                  The fibres are
extremely delicate, and, like other very fine nerve-fibres, can only be rendered
visible by special methods of preparation.                Probably every fibre, however
fine, is compound, being composed of several finer fibres.                Nuclei are in
variably found in relation           with  these  fibres,  and  they vary in number in
different cases.          The structure and general appearance of the finest nerve-
fibres will be understood by reference to the figures.
    From the foregoing observations            I conclude that the nerve-fibres which
are to be resarded o         as the fibres of distribution are far more delicate and
much finer than has been hitherto supposed.                  The remarks which I make
on this head with reference to the ultimate nerve-fibres distributed to volun
tary muscle, will apply to the ultimate nerve-fibres distributed to other
 organs.
    In mammalia the ultimate fibres appear as narrow, long, slightly granular,
 and scarcely visible bands with oval masses of germinal matter, situated at
short but varying intervals, as described in my paper published in the Phil.
Trans, for 1860.            In many reptiles (frog, newt, lizard, snake, chameleon),
however, these ultimate nerve-fibres are narrower but much firmer than in
mammalia;          and they are more readily demonstrated, as they do not give
way under        the  influence of considerable pressure and stretching.         Although
fine nerve-fibres have been described in certain situations before                  I  drew
attention to these fine pale nucleated fibres in muscle, it was not generally
 supposed that the active peripheral portion of nerves exhibited these cha
 racters; nor indeed has this fact yet received the assent of many distin
 guished anatomists.            The arrangement of the fine nerve-fibres in the
 summit of the papilla) of the frog's tongue, described in my last

 presented to the Royal Society (Phil. Trans. June 1864), and in the mucous
 membrane of the human epiglottis, will, I venture to think, tend to con

                             considered.
Of the      supposed terminations      of the dark-bordered nerve-fibres, and of the
                             probable existence of nerve-circuits.
     It   will have been remarked that Continental                  observers are unanimous in
representing           the dark-bordered     nerve-fibre       as passing to its destination
unaccompanied              by any other fibre whatever.     In some drawings it is re
presented         as    terminating  in a short fine fibre, which is regarded as the
prolongation           of the axis-cylinder ; in others, this fine fibre is represented
as   bifurcating        so as to form two very fine fibres.             Some observers consider
that the      "axis-cylinder" spreads out to form                   a band    which is more or
less convoluted,          but terminal, forming an          " end-organ,"      while others hold
that the fibre gradually ceases or loses itself in the surrounding tissue.
   But while there are these minor differences, all agree in the opinion that
the nerve-fibre passes alone to its ultimate "end."      On the other hand,                      I
have endeavoured to show that at least one fine nerve-fibre accompanies the
dark-bordered fibre to its ultimate destination (page 241) as represented in
these figures, and that this fine nerve-fibre is a constant structure of great
importance.    It was first fully described by me in papers in the ' Archives
of Medicine' on the frog's bladder; but its existence was referred to in
my paper in the Philosophical Transactions for 1860, and its arrangement
investigated in that published in the Philosophical Transactions for 1862.
   Some surprise may be felt that Continental observers have not specially
noticed the fine fibre accompanying the dark-bordered fibre, or referred
to my statements concerning it ; but as neither the fine fibre, nor indeed the
finest part of the dark-bordered fibre, can be seen in specimens examined
in aqueous fluids, it was scarcely to be expected that the facts I have
described should have been verified in Germany.    I therefore beg to direct
the attention          of anatomists and physiologists              to the drawings to which     I
now       point, and     to my specimens.
   The fine fibre accompanies the dark-bordered fibres distributed to the
tissues of the frog generally, but it is more easily demonstrated in relation
with the nerves distributed to the bladder, to the mucous membrane of the
palate, the skin, and the connective tissue about the heart and lungs, than
with those of striped muscle ; it however, so frequently seen in the case of
                                            is,

                                      a

fibres could be explained upon such an hypothesis, we should surely be
justified in inferring the continuity of the fibres, although we could not

  ment   of  the nerves in muscle, and as the question is now much involved,
  it seems to me       of the utmost importance to consider it from      a general point
  of view.     Every careful examination        that  I have made with the view of
  ascertaining the arrangement of the nerve-fibres in various tissues has
  tended   to confirm me in the opinion that networks and continuous circuits
  exist, and that there are no " ends
                                            " or " terminal extremities."
                                                                              Although
  I am of course ready to admit that no amount of argument from general
 considerations can upset the conclusions resulting from direct observation
  in special cases, I submit that the conclusions of my opponents, in the
 particular instances advanced by them, have never been supported by posi
 tive demonstration.          Indications of the appearances they have described un
 doubtedly exist ; but it seems very difficult to prepare specimens which shall
 admit   of but      one interpretation,   and so distinct that several independent
 observers would, upon examination, arrive at one and the same conclusion.
 It is ton often urged that the specimens demonstrating " ends " and " end-
          "  do not " keep," and must be examined when quite fresh, while
 organs
 I find no difficulty in preserving those which demonstrate " networks " and
 "plexuses."          I desire, however, to weigh carefully every kind of evidence
 that can be brought to bear upon the determination of this point, which is
 undoubtedly one of very great difficulty.           As the question, too, is a funda
 mental one of the utmost importance, it is worthy of the most patient
consideration.
 Of terminal       plexuses and networks       offine nerve-fibres in the- cornea and
                                     in connective tissue.
     From its transparency, the simplicity of its structure, and the absence
of vessels over at least a great part of its extent, the cornea of the smaller
lower animals presents many advantages for studying the arrangement of
the ultimate nerve-fibres.           My friend and former pupil, Prof. Ciaccio, now
of Naples, very carefully studied this subject ; and the results of his obser
vations will be found in the Transactions of the Microscopical Society for
July 1 863, " On the Nerves of the Cornea, and of their distribution in the
Corneal Tissue of Man and Animals," by Prof. G. V. Ciaccio, M.D., of
Naples.       Of    the existence    of nerve-networks in this tissue there can be
no question     ;   but there is   some difference  of opinion regarding the manner
in   which the ultimate nerve-fibres are arranged.           This drawing represents
the    nerve-fibres in the cornea of the Hj la. The relation of the finest
nerve-fibres      to the corneal corpuscles is a question       of great importance.
Kiihne     has endeavoured to prove that the ultimate            nerve-fibres  are con
tinuous     with the processes of the connective-tissue-corpuscles,           and that
there is an actual continuity of tissue, such as he believes exists between
the nerve-fibre which perforates the sarcolemma of muscle and the pro
toplasmic matter which is in actual contact with the contractile tissue.

that the nerve-fibres pass over or under the prolongations from the corneal
corpuscles without being continuous with them. The fundamental arrange
ment here seems to be the same as elsewhere. The nerve-fibres run amongst
the tissue, but they are continuous neither with the proper fibrous tissue
of the cornea, nor with its nuclei     ;  and  if any influence is exerted by the
nerve upon the tissue or upon the nuclei, it is probably effected by the
current which is transmitted by the fibre, and is not due to any direct
continuity of texture.
   The figure to which    I now  point, represents a thin layer of the connective
tissue covering the posterior part of the mylohyoid muscle of the Hyla,
with the nerves and vessels. The bundles of fine dark-bordered fibres
can be very readily distinguished from the fine fibres given off from them
and forming a very extensive network in every part of the tissue.             In this
specimen, fibres can be     traced  from   the nerve-trunks   to  the capillaries, as
well as to the nerve-network of fine fibres imbedded in the connective tissue.
If  the reader imagines muscular fibres placed in the meshes of this net
work, he will,   I believe, have a correct idea of the manner in which nerve
is distributed   to muscle.    (See figure on opposite page.)       The same facts
are demonstrated in my specimens         of connective tissue from the abdominal
cavity  of the frog, the outer surface of the lungs, &c.
   The distribution of the finest nerve-fibres to the mucous membrane of
the epiglottis of the human subject is also upon the same plan, but the
finest nerves are more difficult to demonstrate.       In this figure the capillary
vessels and the nerves, as they lie immediately beneath the epithelium,
are represented ; and in this one a small portion of the tissue cut exceed
ingly thin, from one of the intervals between the capillaries, is represented

                                   and plexuses.
   It has been already shown that fine nerve-fibres are distributed to the
cornea, to the fibrous tissue in the abdomen of the frog, and to that of the
pericardium and of other parts, which is destitute, or nearly destitute,
of  vessels, and which at the same time is a tissue which can scarcely be
regarded as being more immediately influenced by nerve-fibres than the
ordinary forms of cartilage, which are undoubtedly destitute of them.             To
assert that these fibres are in some manner directly concerned with the
nutritive process is begging the question ; and as cartilage is undoubtedly
developed and nourished without the direct influence of nerve- fibres, it is
probable that the nutrition and development of such tissues as the above,
which are closely allied to cartilage, do not depend upon the nerve-fibres
which are distributed to them.           These nerve-fibres probably perform a
totally different service.
   Pale nucleated nerve-fibres are also distributed to capillary vessels, as is
well shown in the figures to which I now direct attention.          That the fibres

seen in the specimens from         which these drawings have been taken are true

the nervous nature of the fibres distributed to muscle itself        ; indeed, if these
fibres distributed to the capillaries are not nerve-fibres, none of the fine
fibres in the cornea, fibrous tissue, &c. already alluded to and represented
in my drawings, are nervous.          Fine nerve-fibres can be followed from the
nerve-trunk,    and traced to their distribution on capillary vessels, as repre
sented in this drawing, and as            I have also shown to be the case in my
Memoir      " On  the Papillae of the Frog's Tongue," presented to the Royal
Society in June 1864.         Some of the fibres can be traced from the imme
diate neighbourhood of the capillary, where they for the most part ramify,
in the surrounding tissue, and may            be followed    to the point where they
pass into undoubted nerve-trunks.
    With reference to the office performed           by these nerve-fibres, a care
ful   consideration     of all the facts      I  can ascertain in connexion with
this question, leads      me to the conclusion       that these fibres, close to the
capillary vessels and in tissues destitute of capillaries, are not concerned
in special sensation, but are the afferent fibres to the nerve-centres in
which the efferent fibres distributed         to the small arteries take their rise.
I   believe   that these fibres do exert        an influence    upon   the  process  of
nutrition, but only by their indirect influence upon the nerves which govern
the calibre of the small arteries transmitting the nutrient fluid to the
capillaries nearest to the tissues in which they ramify.
    Although time precludes me from entering into this part of the inquiry,
I  may be permitted to allude briefly to the mechanism which I believe is
concerned in regulating the nutritive process, as it occurs in the tissues of
man and those higher animals whose nutritive operations continue to be
carried on with comparatively little alteration under very varying external
conditions.      The arrangement      I  am about to describe appears to be, within
a certain range of variation,          self-adjusting.     If, however, the limits be
overstepped     in  either  direction,   as not   unfrequently happens, under the
very artificial conditions to which man and many of the domestic animals
are exposed, the range of self-adjustment             is exceeded, and oftentimes a
part    of  the mechanism      is completely destroyed and can never again be
effectually repaired or replaced.
    It is obvious that the afferent fibres above referred to, must be affected
by any alterations occurring in the flow of pabulum to the tissue in their
immediate neighbourhood.           Suppose, for example, the quantity of nutrient
pabulum flowing to the cells of a tissue to which nerve-fibres of this class
are   distributed,  to be unusually     great, these nerve-fibres would necessarily
be compressed by the swelling         of the surrounding      elementary parts which
absorb the pabulum.         This pressure would, in the first instance, so affect
the nervous centre as to cause a change in the condition of the efferent
nerve-fibres, which would induce contraction             of the small arteries trans
mitting the blood to the capillary vessels, and thus the quantity of pabulum
sent to this locality would be immediately reduced.                The nuclei of the
nerve-fibres would also participate in the increased absorption of nutrient

 matter    ; but precisely in what manner, I must not now discuss. If, however,
 the conditions which led in the first instance to the increased nutrition
 persisted, the pressure upon the nerve-fibres might go to the extent of
 paralyzing them, in which case the small arteries would become dilated ;
 the capillaries must in consequence be fully distended with blood, and that
 congestion which constitutes one of the earliest stages of inflammation                as
 it occurs in man and the higher animals, would result.
    I have already  indicated the wide differences in structure, mode        of growth,
 and in the changes occurring during action, between           the spherical and oval
 nerve-cells, and the so-called caudate nerve-cells.           These differences are
 sufficiently marked to justify me in regarding them ns two distinct classes
 of central nerve-cells performing very different offices or functions*.
    Several considerations have led me to conclude that the oval and spheri
cal ganglion-cells     are the sources of nervous power, while the so-called
caudate nerve-cells in the cerebro-spinal centre are the points at which
several different nerve-circuits intersect, and probably act and react upon one
another.      The marvellously complex and combined nervous actions depend,
in all probability, upon the perfection attained by this latter part of the
nervous mechanism.          I  have been led further to the opinion, not only
that the spherical and caudate nerve-cells are concerned with the reflex
phenomena of the vascular system, but that those forming the ganglia on
the posterior roots of the spinal nerves are intimately connected with the
general reflex actions occurring in the voluntary muscles when the cord is
divided transversely.       From the arrangement of the vascular nerves dis
tributed to the     vessels   of muscles, it is    easy to understand      how, by an
increased action of these vascular nerves, the contraction             of the muscles
of  a  limb might     be caused.      I  have demonstrated      that connexions exist
between the peripheral portion of purely sensitive nerves and the nerve-
fibres distributed to the tissues in which capillaries ramify, as well as to
capillary vessels themselves. These connexions would account for the
excitation    of involuntary    reflex actions by the application of a stimulus to
the general cutaneous surface.          If this view be correct, the ganglia on the
posterior roots of the      nerves,   rather than the different segments of the
spinal cord, must be regarded as the centres of reflex actions and also as the
nervous centres which, with the so-called sympathetic ganglia, preside
over all the vascular, and, through the vessels, over the nutritive pheno
mena of the body.         The facts and arguments in favour of these general
conclusions will form the subject of a separate memoir.

arrangement of nerves.    The nerves distributed to a tissue or organ are
often represented as if they all passed straight to their terminal distribu

direction from, and others towards the nerve-centre or peripheral part ;

as well as in mixed nerves.                 It   is also found in the case       of the sympathetic

attention     to the arrangement shown in these drawings, and especially to
that represented in this figure ; not that I would maintain that in the
finest fibres these three fibres are separated from one another or insu
lated by a layer of white substance, but, on the contrary, I consider
that in many cases these fine fibres, although they may often be split in
the longitudinal direction, nevertheless in their natural state form almost
homogeneous fibres, the material of which may permit the passage of nerve-
currents in the different directions indicated.            It is very probable that
the passage of the currents along precisely the same paths for a con
siderable     time may cause the decomposition of the nervous matter iu
 such a manner as to give rise to distinct lines, which might readily be
 mistaken for separate fibres, and after a time lines of fibres in an ap
 parently     transparent tissue would result*.         At an early period of de
 velopment,      nerves  form   a sort of  thin  expansion, in which the appear
 ance of fibres crossing one another in various directions may be after
 wards     produced    by the passage of the nerve-eurrents.           Beneath the ex
 ternal investment of      the  common fly    and  many    other  insects,  and beneath
 the soft, delicate perivisceral membrane of mollusca, I have seen the most
 beautiful and elaborate arrangement of apparent nerve-fibres of such a
 character as to justify the above inference.
     In the cornea, that part of some of the nerve-fibres from which several
 fine bundles radiate in different directions exhibits lines or fibres crossing
  one another in every direction which the emerging fibres take.
      This subject is capable of much further elucidation, and is well worthy
  of being considered in detail ; but in this Lecture I only allude to it cursorily
  because it bears, in a most important manner, upon the question of unin
  terrupted nervous circuits, and affords an explanation of the manner in
  which the complex arrangement which nerves ultimately exhibits is brought
  about.
  Of the" termination" of nerves inpapilla and           in special cutaneous nervous
      organs, such as the      papilla  concerned in touch and taste, and in the
      Pacinian corpuscles.
      Now in highly elaborate nervous organs like the papillae of the frog's
  tongue, which are very minute, and situated comparatively close to one
  another, we have an opportunity of studying, under great advantages, the
  course pursued by the constituent fibres of a bundle of nerves.                    And
  although     even here it is not possible to follow a single fibre for any great
   distance, a careful consideration of what can be demonstrated leads to the
   inference that to every one      of these papillae three    sets   of nerve-fibres  are
   distributed.
       I have always been able to demonstrate in the peripheral organs that               I
   have examined more than a single nerve-fibre; and where, as is almost

invariably the     case, numerous   terminal   organs   exist, these are     always
 connected    together by nerve-fibres which pass from one to the other.
Although    the  arrangement is not always so distinct as represented in this
drawing of the papillae from the tongue of the frog,          I  always find that
where a nerve-trunk divides into two sets of      branches,   there exists at the
point of division a fibre or fibres which seem to connect the two terminal
organs to which the bundles of fibres pass.       Passing to every touch-body
in the papillae of the skin of the finger, I find more than one nerve-
fibre ; and the corpuscle itself seems to consist of a very much coiled
and reduplicated nucleated nerve-fibre, as represented in this drawing.
    In the peripheral cutaneous nervous organs of many invertebrate animals
         I
which have examined, especially in some of the insects and annelids,               I
find a bundle of nerve-fibres, not a single nerve-fibre, as is usually repre
sented.    This drawing illustrates the view generally entertained       ; and  this
one, my own inference of the structure of these organs.               Even in the
Pacinian body I find no such indications of a true termination of the axis-
cylinder as is usually described : not only so, but in many cases I have
seen three    or four very wide lobe-like   continuations   of the axis-cylinder
bending downwards from its highest point, and passing apparently into
very fine granular fibres which lie between the laminated capsules, and are
continued into the nerve-sheath.        The drawing will illustrate the struc
ture of all these allied peripheral nerve-organs, according to my observa
 tions.
 Evidence in favour of continuous nerve-circuits, derived from the study          of
             the development of nerve-fibres distributed to muscle.
    The development of nerves distributed to muscle is most difficult to
 investigate, but it is a subject well worthy of most attentive study ; and
 although I cannot hope to give a clear account of the process,       I shall make
 an attempt to describe what I have myself seen.       The relation of nerves to
 the contractile tissue of muscle and other tissues, and the general arrange
 ment of nerve-fibres, having been determined, one cannot avoid asking how
 the fibres became arranged as we see them in the fully formed texture.
    Of the part taken by the masses of germinal matter there cannot be the
 slightest doubt ; for it can be shown most conclusively that as the nerves
 advance from the early to the complete stage of their development, the
 distance between the several masses of germinal matter gradually increases.
 This may be proved in the case of dark-bordered as well as of very fine
 nerve-fibres.    It is well shown in these figures. At an early period of
 the development of muscle, very numerous masses of germinal matter are
 seen amongst the muscular fibres, in   which transverse markings are already
  developed.    These, as I have been able to satisfy myself by researches
 upon the diaphragm and intercostal muscles of the fecial dog, are con
 cerned in the formation of nerves and capillaries.
     In the young caterpillar the surface of  some muscular     fibres seems to be

completely covered with nuclei          ;   and as development advances these nuclei
or masses of germinal matter          seem to separate   further and further from one
another, and the delicate nerve-fibres might be said to be drawn out from
them. At the same time the muscular fibre increases in size.       It will pro
bably be conceded that at an early period of development of a muscle there
are masses of germinal matter taking part in the development of the three
different structures — muscle, nerves, and vessels.   Besides these, upon the
surface of the muscle, and between the muscular fibres, are masses which
have perhaps already given rise to the formation of a soft granular and
slightly fibrous connective tissue. I thiuk that these last masses have
originated from the same parent masses as the others. Indeed it is certain
that this must be so. Of the masses taking part in the development of a
bundle of nerve-fibres, those on the surface produce not true nerves, but
connective tissue, and so with regard to muscles, vessels, and other textures.
   The part taken by the germinal matter in the development of muscles,
nerves, and vessels   may be studied in the fully-formed frog, and with
greater facility than  in the embryo.   At certain intervals amongst the
large muscular fibres of the frog may be discovered with some difficulty
some bundles of finer muscular fibres.    These are most distinctly seen,
however, in the thin breast-muscle of the frog, where they were discovered
by Kolliker. They were termed by him
                                         " nerve-tufts," and are figured in
his Croonian Lecture, delivered in           1 862      (Proceedings   of the Royal Society,
 1862, p. 78).        I
                    have had Kolliker's figure copied.    It does not, how
ever, represent all that may be seen in these swellings, prepared according
to the particular plan before alluded to (p. 258); for the numerous oval
nuclei, figured       in Kolliker's
                              drawings, are represented by him as being
pretty generally diffused throughout the swelling, and as not being con
nected with one another, or with any definite structure.    The relation of
the nerve-fibres to these nuclei is not indicated in Kolliker's drawing, nor
is the meaning      of these numerous nuclei discussed.
  Some of the nuclei (masses of germinal matter), however, are seen in
my specimens to be nuclei in the course of very fine nerve-fibres — nuclei
which take part in the formation of the nerve-fibres themselves. Others
are the nuclei of the muscular fibres which are undergoing development,
and over the surface of which the fine nerve-fibres are spread out. These
facts are demonstrated in several specimens which I have mounted in strong
glycerine and acetic-acid syrup*.   A portion of one of these is represented
in the figure to which       I
                         now point.  This drawing, which is magnified 700
diameters, appears somewhat confused, owing to the very close proximity
of the nerves to the muscles.          It   is,  careful copy of one of my

fibres.     These may be followed        for a considerable     distance amongst    the
developing muscular fibres.
    It  has been truly stated by Kolliker that the apparently single muscular
fibre bearing the swelling is really a bundle of very fine muscular fibres,
varying from three to seven, or more, in number, and that the apparently
penetrating nerve-fibres merely         pass between these imperfectly developed
muscular fibres.        I  cannot, however, agree with him in the view that the
fine muscular fibres result from longitudinal splitting of wider fibres. The
bundles of fine muscular fibres under consideration            extend, it is true, at a
certain period of their development, from one extremity of the muscle to
 the other ; but all the muscular fibres of the bundle do not reach so far.
 In one bundle sometimes ten or twelve distinct muscular fibres, very closely
 packed together, may be counted.             Near the swelling the muscular fibres
 are wide, and the fine, tapering, pointed extremities of other young mus
 cular fibres can also be seen.         These spindle-shaped muscular fibres are
 not nearly so long as the ordinary fully developed muscular fibres.                 In
 fact, at the swelling, several spindle-shaped, nucleated, already transversely
 striated muscular fibres may be observed, and the stages through which
 the elementary fibres       of voluntary muscle      pass in their development may
 be traced.
     In  these  " nerve-tufts "  we may indeed study, in the fully-formed animal,
 striped    muscle   and  nerve  in  every stage of development.        Vessels cannot
 be traced into the youngest tufts ; but in those which consist of several
 partly grown muscular fibres, capillaries are to be seen; so that the develop
 ment of muscles, nerves, and vessels can be studied in these imperfectly
 developed     "tufts."
     From the above observations, it will be seen that I cannot agree with
  Kolliker in the view he has taken of these bodies. He says, " Now if it
 be admitted that the finer muscular          fibres composing the bundle are gene
  rated by the division of thicker muscular fibres, as Weismann justly con
  cludes, the explanation of the nerve-tufts becomes easy, inasmuch as they
  may be conceived to arise from a simultaneous growth and division of the
  nerve-fibre belonging to the parent muscular fibre, in order that each of
  the young muscular fibres may obtain its branch of nerve" (Croonian
  Lecture, May 1862).
     So far from the narrow young muscular fibres resulting from the division
  of old   ones, the young muscles and young nerves are developed            from col
  lections   of nuclei  or masses   of germinal    matter, precisely resembling those
  which are    found in the embryo.         I  believe this to be an invariable law.
  Many facts make         me feel confident     that it is quite impossible that new
  textures can be formed by the subdivision of old ones.                Formation and
  development      take   place upon precisely      the same  principle in young and
  old tissues, in health and disease, in simple and complex organisms.             New
  muscular fibres may be developed from old ones in this way : — the "nuclei"
  may increase in number, the old muscular tissue may undergo disintegra

tion and disappear, in fact the nuclei may live and increase at its expense,
and     a new mass, consisting   entirely of nuclei, or masses of germinal matter,
by the agency of which the formed material of the new fibres is at length
produced, may result ; but never does old tissue split up into new tissue.
     As I have pointed out on many occasions, in fully-formed organs there
exists    a certain  proportion of embryonic germinal matter, which may un
dergo development at a future period of life, and if the greater part of this
becomes fully-formed tissue, still there remains embryonic matter for de
 velopment at a still later period, and so on.           In the situations of these so-
 called nerve-tufts in the breast-muscle of the frog, new elementary muscular
 fibres are added to those already formed, and the muscle grows as the frog
 advances in age.       In the formation and growth of the muscular fibres, and
 in the formation      and arrangement of the nerves around them, the move
 ments     of the several nuclei or masses of germinal matter to which I have
 drawn attention, play no unimportant part.                                  " On the
                                                            (See my paper
 movements of the living or germinal matter of the tissues of man and the
 higher animals," Archives, vol. iv. p. 150.)
     With reference to the nerves supplying             these  so-called nerve-tufts,  I
 would remark —
      1. That two dark-bordered        nerve-fibres,    running in the    same sheath,
  may often be traced to one part of the
                                               " nerve-tuft."
      2. Besides the dark-bordered fibre or fibres, there are invariably           very
  fine fibres running in the same sheath.
      3. That the dark-bordered        fibres  and the      accompanying fine fibres
  divide and subdivide very freely amongst the young muscular fibres, and
  that thus quite a leash of very fine nerve-fibres results, in the course of
  which numerous nuclei exist at certain intervals.             Many of these can be
  followed    upon   or between the muscular         fibres, for the distance of the
  twentieth of an inch or more from the oval swelling.               These  points   are
  well seen in the figures to which I now direct attention.
      4. That the dark-bordered     fibre or fibres which enter at the tuft are not
  the   only nerve-fibres distributed to these bundles of muscular fibres, but
  that invariably a bundle, consisting of two or three fine but dark-bordered
  fibres, is connected with the muscular fibres, at a point above or below
  that at which the swelling is situated, where the large fibre or fibres enter.
  Sometimes there are two such bundles, one above and one below.                 These
  not unfrequently give off branches, just before they pass to the muscular
  bundle, which pursue a longer course, and are distributed to other larger
  muscular fibres ; and oftentimes branches pass from one muscular bundle to
  more distant ones.
      From the above observations it follows that these "nerve-tufts" in the
  breast-muscle of the frog consist of developing muscular fibres, which are
  freely supplied with nerves ; and the number and distribution of the nerves
  render it probable, not only that there are entering and emerging fibres,
  nerve-loops,   and plexuses, or networks, upon the muscular fibres, rather

 264                             Dr. Beale — Croonian Lecture.                     [May 11,
 than    ends, but that the action of the new muscular fibres may be har
        free
 monized with those of the other and older elementary muscular fibres
 of the muscle by branches of nerve-fibres which are probably com
 missural.
    I   will next venture                          origin of the nuclei taking
                                 to consider the nature and
 part in the development of the muscular nerves ; and I would remark that
 in the frog it is comparatively easy to study the formation of even complex
 organs out of what used to be called a granular blastema.        In each suc
 ceeding spring-time not only new ganglion-cells but new ganglia and nerve-
 fibres, as well as vessels, are developed, and take the place of those which
 attained their perfect condition in the previous year, but which, having
 performed their work, have wasted and become converted into mere debris,
 a great part of which was removed during the period of hybernation.
   Now the formation of a new ganglion, of new muscular fibres, of new ves
sels, and other tissues, and even the formation of elementary organs of com
plex structure (as I have ascertained specially in the case of the uriniferous
tubes of the newt), results from changes taking place in a collection of
small spherical masses of germinal matter ; and these collections themselves
seem     to result from the division and subdivision              of at most   a few masses,
all of them of course being the descendants of the original germinal mass
formed when impregnation occurred.
   Now it may be affirmed most positively, that an entire organ, such as the
kidney-tube, or an elementary fibre of muscle, is not formed first and the
nerve then spread over    but the development of the tissue to be influ
                                    it,
enced proceeds pari passu with the development of the nerves which are
to influence it.       And in the adult animal, where the development of new
nerve-fibres      takes place, new muscles, &c., are developed in relation with
them.       I   have reason. to think, indeed    feel confident, that new nerve-
                                                    I
fibres cannot be developed so as to influence an old muscular fibre, or old
nerve-fibres caused to influence newly developed muscular tissue and in            ;

are distributed, as may be studied in the frog, all the old tissue seems to

the new tissue    developed from a mass of
                       is                  " formless blastema " — that is,
from    a   collection       of spherical masses   of germinal matter which could not
be distinguished            from the embryonic     mass   or collection which forms the
early condition of every living thing iu nature   and in the destruction

tially of the         same    nature     ;   and it would indeed         be very difficult to dis
tinguish     a collection       of spherical         masses       of germinal matter, from which
the tissues      new being are to be evolved, from a mass of young pus-
                 of    a
corpuscles, which may result from the rapid multiplication of masses of
germinal matter existing in any tissue of man or the higher animals. In
both cases the matter is formless                ;   and however much             the conclusion      may
be opposed to the affirmations                 of great authorities,         we are compelled, by a
review of the facts ascertained by observation, to infer that there is a far
greater difference in the power than there is in the chemical characters,
or physical properties, of the matter taking part in these changes.
   Many very interesting and highly important facts relating to this in
quiry may be obtained from a careful study of the minute changes which
occur in the development of the tissues of the imago or perfect insect
during the chrysalis stage.                   So far as       I   am    able to ascertain, the larval
tissues and organs are in the first instance completely removed, the ger
minal matter increases considerably in quantity, and at length a collection
of new masses of germinal matter results, which take part in the formation
of the new tissues of the developing imago. If those who so confidently
affirm that all the phenomena of living beings are physical and chemical
would investigate            some  of these marvellous changes, I venture to think
they would very soon             withdraw their confident assertions, and admit that
the construction of tissues and organs is a process not to be explained by
physics and chemistry, or accounted for by any of the known laws of
ordinary lifeless matter or force.
     I                                                        I
    must now advert to a question which feel incompetent to grapple with,
though I cannot permit myself to pass it over. Let me consider     in the                      if,
development of new muscular fibres, nerves, and vessels, as occurs in the
case of the nerve-tufts of the frog, or in the development of   new ganglion           a
connected   with the sympathetic,     there  are certain masses  of germinal
matter which, as the direct descendants of pre-existing masses in muscles,
nerves, vessels,      &c., take part in the development of these tissues respec
tively, or   if   they all result from changes occurring in what would be called
 by some     a   mass      of undifferentiated blastema            ?     In studying the early       deve
lopmental changes taking place in the embryo, one discovers nothing which
wonld justify the inference that one set of masses      concerned in the de  is
velopment of all the future muscles of the body, another of all the vessels,
another of all the nerves, another of all the glandular organs, and so on, —
each     of these      masses    or collections         being gradually           prolonged   to distant
parts   but
         ;      seems rather that the whole
                 it                                in the first instance formless,

and that the process of formation gradually proceeds in many parts at the
same time.     The brain      not formed first, and other parts of the nervous

itattains its fully developed condition in all its parts.    If masses of germinal
matter for the development of the respective tissues were first formed, and

an extension from each    of these to distant parts took place, it must follow
that the portion first formed would be the oldest; but all observation seems
to show that development gradually goes on in different and distant parts
at the same time.    And I infer that in the process of regeneration of the
lobster's claw, or of the lizard's tail, of the fully formed animal, the several
tissues constituting the organs are entirely developed anew from a formless
mass,   and not by the simple extension of the tissue of the muscles, nerves,
vessels, &c., which exist in the stump.   In the first instance there results
a   soft material, which exhibits no indications    of definite structure   ;   and as
development proceeds, the masses of germinal matter taking part in the
development of nerves are seen arranged in lines, and are continuous with
those in the nerves    of the stump.     It
                                        is, however, possible that new masses
of germinal matter may grow and multiply from these latter and extend
into the soft indefinite tissue first produced and destined to serve only
a very temporary purpose      ;                 I
                                            can consider this question advan
                                  but, before
tageously, I      must make further observations.  And it appears from ob
servations in the case      of the frog, that when                   part or
                                                         a new peripheral
organ is developed, new central nerve-cells are developed in connexion with
it. And it is probable (indeed it appears to me certain) that even in man
this development of new central and peripheral organs goes on in certain
instances.  For example, at each pregnancy in the human female, it is pro
bable not only that new muscular fibres, vessels, nerves, &c. are developed
in connexion with the growing uterus, but that new ?ierve-cenlres are also
produced, with which the new nerves are connected ; and I regard it as
most probable that during the development of the lizard's tail and lobster's
claw new central nerve-cells in connexion with the new nerve-fibres are
developed in the already existing but comparatively simple nerve-centres.
Of the relation of the ultimate branches of the nerve-filres       to the elements
                 of the tissue and to the germinal matter.
      In no   case does the nerve become continuouswith any part of the con
tractile tissue of muscle ; nor is it connected with the nucleus of the mus
cular fibre or with that of any other tissue.
   The ultimate nerve-fibre bears the same relation to the contractile tissue
of muscle that it bears to fibres of white fibrous tissue, to cells generally,
and to the processes of cells, such as the prolongation from the pigment-
cells of the frog, those of the corneal corpuscles in the cornea, &c.     The
arrangement is such as would lead us to infer that the tissue is influenced
by the current passing through the nerve, not by any change involving an
anatomical continuity of structure from the nerve to the tissue affected by
it,
  or even in actual contact with any part of     for in very many instances
                                                    it

we can prove that the nerve     not in very close contact with the tissue
                                   is                                               it
influences.Moreover, results resembling those which occur from the action
of  nerve may be brought about by the passage of
     a                                                current of electricity

              a               considerable distance from the muscle, and

 separated from it by non-conducting media ; so that, as I have before men
 tioned, it would seem probable that the varying degrees of muscular contrac
 tion are induced by the varying intensity of the current transmitted along
 a  continuous nerve-fibre.
 Arguments in favour of the existence of continuous nervous circuits founded
              upon the structure and arrangement of ganglion-cells.
     In a paper already    referred to, communicated      to the Royal Society in
 1864, and published      in the 'Transactions,' I     endeavoured to show that
certain ganglion-cells   which had been considered to be apolar or unipolar
 were invariably connected with at least two nerve-fibres, and that in many
cases one of these fibres was coiled spirally round the other, as is well
shown in this drawing.         These two fibres often appear as one ; but not
only have    I succeeded in demonstrating that they are derived from different
parts of the same cell, but that they pursue opposite directions in the
nerve-trunks.      I have been led to conclude that all nerve-cells give origin
 to more than one nerve-fibre,       and that these fibres, although they run
 parallel to one another       for a short distance, diverge and pursue very
 different and indeed opposite courses ; and     I  endeavoured to show that the
 arrangements I had observed received a ready explanation upon the view
 of the existence of complete nervous circuits.
     In  another  communication     previously referred to, published in the
 'Proceedings' of the Royal Society for 1864, entitled "Indications of the
paths taken by the nerve-currents as they traverse the caudate nerve-cells,"
 I  showed that there existed in the caudate nerve-cells    of the spinal cord and
medulla oblongata a remarkable series         of lines, which   passed from each
fibre connected with the cell across the body of the cell into every other
fibre which diverged from it.       I regarded these as indications of the paths
taken by the nerve-currents which traversed these cells, and my observa
tions led to the inference that every single cell was the seat of decussation,
and therefore     formed    part of the course, of a vast number of different
nervous circuits.    Upon this view of the constitution of the highly complex
central organs of the nervous system, it is not difficult to account for the
marvellous number of distinct actions effected, or of the still more wonder
ful combinations of actions which must occur in the great central organs
of the nervous system of man and the higher animals.            The axis-cylinder
of each dark-bordered nerve-fibre probably forms the common route along
which nerve-currents     pass from many different parts in the nerve-centre to
as many different points     in the periphery.     Fibres prolonged from several
different nerve-cells seem to combine to form one dark-bordered fibre ; but
these and other points will be readily understood by a cursory examination
of the diagrams to which I now direct attention, so that it is unnecessary
for me to describe them minutely.

so thin as to be invisible,    unless special methods of investigation are
resorted to.        It   has also been shown that near nervous centres, and near
their peripheral distribution, the bundles of nerve-fibres and the individual
nerve-fibres divide into very numerous branches.       The bundles of coarse

  for the discovery of imaginary roots carried as far as equations of the 5th
 degree inclusive.        The method, however, therein employed offered no
 prospect of success as applied to equations of the higher degrees.              I take
 this opportunity, therefore, of announcing that I have recently hit upon a
 more refined and subtle method and idea, by means of which the demon
 stration has been already extended to the 6th degree, and which lends itself
 with equal readiness to equations of all degrees.            Ere long I trust to be
 able to lay before the Society a complete and universal proof of this rule
 — so long the wonder and opprobrium of algebraists.                For the present     I
 content myself with stating that the new method consists essentially, first,
 in the discerption of the question as applied to an equation of any specified
 degree into distinct cases, corresponding to the various combinations of
 signs that can be attached to the coefficients ; secondly, in the application
 of the fecund principle of variation of constants, laid down in the third
 part   of my 'Trilogy,' and, in particular, of the theorem that if a rational
 function   of a variable undergoes a continuous variation flowing in one
 direction   through any prescribed channel, then at the moment when it
 is on the point      of losing real roots, not only must it possess two equal
 roots (a fact familiar to mathematicians as the light of day), but also its
 second differential,    and the variation, when for the variable is substituted
 the value of such equal roots, must assume the same algebraical sign*.             By
 aid of the processes afforded by this principle, which admits of an infinite
 variety of modes of application, according to the form imparted to the
 channel of variation, and constitutes in effect for the examination of alge-*
 braical forms an instrument        of analysis as powerful   as the microscope     for
objects of natural history, or the blowpipe for those of chemical research,
the problem in view is resolved with a surprising degree of simplicity ; so
 much so that, as far as I have hitherto proceeded with the inquiry, the
computations,      algebraical and arithmetical, which I have had occasion to
employ may be contained within the compass of a single line.                 The new
 method, moreover, enjoys the prerogative of yielding a proof of the
theorem     in the complete form in which it came from the hands of its
author (but which has been totally lost sight of by all writers, without
exception, who have subsequently handled the question), viz. in combina
tion with, and as supplemental to, the Rule of Descartes.                On my mind
the internal evidence is now forcible that Newton was in possession of a
proof of this theorem (a point which he has left in doubt and which has
often been called into question), and that, by singular good fortune, whilst
I have been enabled to unriddle the secret which has baffled the efforts of
mathematicians       to discover during the last two centuries,        I  have struck
into the very path which Newton himself followed to arrive at his con
clusions.

    function of x, with r equal roots a, may undergo no loss of real roots for
    any assigned variation imparted to the function : for the theory of the 7th

       As the chemical processes for the detection of certain organic poisons
    are very inconclusive in their nature, and as many of these agents produce
    effects of amost remarkable kind on the lower animals,       not surprising

    that their physiological action should have been employed as        test for   a
    their presence. Thus Dr. Marshall Hall suggested as means of discover
                                                                    a

    and quite recently MM. Tardieu and Roussin produced          large mass of
                                                                            a

    was believed to be the poison used.
       Those who have recommended the employment of evidence of this na
    ture have always relied on the similarity between the symptoms observed
    in the case of supposed poisoning during life, and the effects obtained on
    the lower animals by the extract believed to contain the toxic agent   and         ;
    as the action of poisons on man and on the lower vertebrata       certainly   is
    not always the same, the value of these physiological tests has been much
    disputed, and   not now admitted by most authorities in this country.
                      is                                                     It
    appears to us, however, that physiological evidence may be made inde
    pendent of any relation of this kind. It sufficient that the action of the

      *  The above   ison the supposition that one of the three equal roots remains unaffected
    in magnitude by the variation, whilst the other two change. If all three are to change
    simultaneously, infinitesimals beyond the first order and with fractional indices have to
    be brought into consideration; in that case, on making x=a, the variation need not
    become absolutely zero, but must contain no infinitesimal of the first order.       And a
    further limitation becomes necessary in addition to the conditions stated in the text, in
^   order that no loss of real roots may be incurred in consequence of the variation.

substance believed to contain the poison on the animal experimented on
be identical with the known effects of that poison upon the same animal,
and that these effects be capable of being produced by no other agent or,
at any rate, only by a limited number of other agents.
    In this spirit we have conducted a series of investigations, with reference
to the detection of digitaline and of certain allied substances. 1We selected
that poison, not only because of the interest which attaches to it at the
present time, but also because the chemical tests for it are peculiarly in
adequate.     The animals which we employed in all our experiments were
frogs.    Their sensibility to small quantities of poison, the fact that they
are but little liable to be affected by fear or other accidental circumstances,
and the independence of their organs, which makes it possible to determine
with accuracy the nature of the effects produced, have rendered them better
adapted for this purpose than any other animals ; and the objection ordi
narily urged against their use, that the action of poisons on them is often
different from that of the same substances on the higher animals, has no
validity when the question of physiological evidence is looked at from our
point of view.
    It has been expressly denied, by those who have advocated the use of
physiological tests, that animal extracts, such as those obtained from the
contents of the human stomach, or from vomited fluids, could in themselves
be poisonous to the lower animals.         We thought it desirable, however, to
make some direct experiments upon this point ; and, to our surprise, we found
that in almost every instance the toxic action of such extracts was most
decided and unmistakeable.          The effects produced were indeed very dif
ferent from those caused by digitaline ; and we think that we have been
able to distinguish quite clearly between them.          Still, the recognition of
the fact that these extracts exert a poisonous action, independently of the
presence of any of the ordinary toxic agents, must have an important
bearing    upon   the  application    of physiological   evidence.   Unless   some
points of difference should hereafter be discovered, it will render impossible
the detection of many vegetable substances (among which we may mention
lobelia,  emetina, veratrum     viride, and delphinium staphisagria) by their
physiological   effects.   x\nd  it makes invalid (at least so far as frogs are
concerned) all evidence of this kind, in which the state of the heart is not
more particularly described than has hitherto been the case, so far as
the frog-test for strychnia is concerned ; on the other band, though this
was not the primary object of our inquiries, we may remark that tetanic
spasms were produced by none of the numerous substances with which we
experimented, except veratrine and theine.           It is of course well known
that other agents, and notably some of the constituents of opium, produce
tetanus in frogs ; but on the whole our experiments lead us to hope that
this test will hereafter be found of more value than is now generally sup
posed to be the case.
   We have devoted a considerable        number of experiments to the solution

272        Drs. Fagge and Stevenson on Physiological Tests              [May 18,
of the practical question, whether it be possible to obtain the characteristic5
effects of digitaline, not only from the extracts of liquids to which it had
been artificially added, but also from extracts of the stomach-contents        and
vomited matters of dogs poisoned by that substance.           The results of these
experiments were perfectly satisfactory ; and we think that our observa
tions show conclusively that there is no difficulty in obtaining from these
complex mixtures physiological effects identical with those of a pure solu
tion of digitaline.
   Far more difficult to decide than the question       of practical applicability,
is the question a3 to the theoretical accuracy and conclusiveness of the
physiological test for digitaline and the allied poisons.         To this question
we do not venture to give     a  positive  answer.   Our   experiments justify, as
we think, the hope that this test will be hereafter found of very consider
able value in aiding in the detection of these substances ; but it can be
only by the combined labours of many observers, and not merely by one
series of experiments, that this point can be finally settled.
   The following are the conclusions at which we have arrived, and which
are deduced from      our own experiments in every instance, except where the
contrary is expressly stated, under heading 2.
    1 . Digitaline is one of a small class of substances of which the action
on frogs appears to be identical.          As the heart is the organ primarily
affected by them, they may be called cardiac poisons, so far as frogs are
concerned.
   2. These substances are, besides digitaline, the Upas Antiar, the Hel
leborus viridis, and perhaps other species of Helleborus, the Tanghinia
venenifera,    the Dajaksch     or arrow-poison of Borneo, the Can-oval and
 Vao, South American arrow-poisons, and the Scilla maritima. Of these
we have ourselves experimented        only with digitaline, antiar, the Helleborus
viridis and the H. niger, and the Scilla ; and we believe that we are the
first observers who have recognized the identity of the action on frogs of
the last of these plants with that of the other substances placed in this
group.     Besides digitaline, only two of them, namely, the HeUeborus and
the Scilla, are likely to be the subject of medico-legal investigation in
this country, and that but rarely.
   3. The characteristic effect of each of these agents on frogs is the pro
duction of irregularity of the heart's action, followed by complete stoppage
of its pulsations   ; the ventricle remaining rigidly contracted, and perfectly
pale, after it has ceased to beat ; the muscular power of the animal being
at this time unimpaired, and persisting as long as in frogs in which the
circulation has been stopped by other means, such as ligature of the heart.
   The irregularity in the heart's action, which precedes its stoppage, under
the influence   of these poisons is peculiar. The rhythm is but little altered ;
and the beats are not necessarily diminished in number, as has been sup
posed.     Sometimes, however, the ventricle makes only one pulsation for
two of the auricles, the number of its contractions being therefore lessened

   1865.]                       for certain Organic Poisons.                        273
   by one half.         More frequently the irregularity consists in one or more
   portions   of   the   ventricle (especially the apex) becoming rigidly white and
   contracted, while the remainder         of the organ continues to dilate regularlv.
   When these yielding pulsations are small, a peculiar appearance, as if the
   wall of the ventricle formed crimson pouches or protrusions, is produced.
      4. No other substance, except those mentioned above, has been found
  to produce this chain of effects, even in a single experiment.              We have
  ourselves tried nineteen different substances, consisting of vegetable extracts
  and alkaloids.          Of these, emetina, and the extract of the Delphinium
  ttaphisagria caused somewhat similar irregularity of the cardiac beats ; but
  in frogs, poisoned by these agents, the muscular power was always lost
  before the heart had ceased           to   beat, and the ventricle   stopped in the
  dilated, and not in the contracted, state.
      5. When digitaline is applied endermically to frogs, the characteristic
  effect is invariably produced, if a sufficient quantity be used.          This quan
  tity no doubt varies with the size of the animal, but may be stated gene
  rally at yj^th of a grain. Quantities less than xtI^1 gram usually produce
  no effect, or at most only temporary irregularity of the heart's action, of
  a more or less characteristic kind.           The result of the injection of doses
 larger than y^th grain is to diminish the interval between the administra
  tion of the poison and the stoppage of the ventricular beats. This interval
 appears to be seldom less than six or seven minutes, however large the
quantity of digitaline.
     6. Very poisonous effects are produced in frogs by the endermic ap
plication of alcoholic or acetic extracts of matters vomited by patients, or
taken from the human stomach after death.                The extracts are less poison
ous,    if  at all, to the higher animals.
     7. The symptoms produced by these extracts in frogs are in marked
contrast to those caused by the cardiac poisons.               Like these agents, the
animal extracts impair the action of the heart ; but their tendency is to cause
paralysis of its muscle, and stoppage in the dilated condition.                At the
same time, they generally destroy the muscular power of the animal.
     8. The cause of the toxic action of these animal extracts has not been
ascertained     ;   it is probably not always the    same, as the effects produced   by
different extracts are not perfectly similar. These effects are perhaps the
result of the combined action of different substances.             They are certainly

by these acids ; for the quantity of them contained in the extracts is too

matters,    or to fluids taken from the human stomach pott mortem, the
extracts obtained from such fluids almost invariably produce on frogs the
effects  of digitaline.
    11. This is due partly to the fact that the action of digitaline is gene
rally more rapid than that of the poisonous constituents of the extracts
themselves, but principally to the circumstance that it was necessary to give
only small doses of the extracts containing digitaline, in order to get the
characteristic action.
    1 2. The method     of dialysis fails in many        cases to separate digitaline
from complex organic         mixtures      which   contain    it; and this method is
rarely of service in aiding the detection of this poison by the physiological
test.
    13. When digitaline was administered to dogs in quantities little more
than sufficient to destroy life, the extracts derived from the matters vo
mited by these animals, or from the fluids contained in their stomachs after
death (when vomiting was artificially prevented), were found in each of
those experiments to produce on frogs unmistakeably the effects charac
teristic of the presence    of one of the cardiac poisons.

   We have now to add to the          list of "  cardiac poisons" the Manganja, an
arrow-poison, brought      from     the   Zambesi    Expedition by Dr. Kirk. Our
attention was directed to this substance, which is the fruit of an Apocyna-
ceous plant, by Dr. Sharpey, who informed us of the results of experiments
he had made on its action      ;   and we owe to his kindness the opportunity        of
confirming his observations by our own experiments.

    The coefficient 36*764 in (a) results from Ramond's comparison of tri
gonometrical with barometrical measurements (Mec. Cel. iv. 290). Bessel's
theory, with the numbers corrected by Plantamour {Ann. Metdor. de F.
 1852), makes it 36-809.     If this coefficient were adopted the values of
log G in Table II. would have to be increased by *00053.        This would
increase the results in the foregoing examples by 4 feet, 2-8 metres, and
 I *3 toise respectively. Verification of these numbers by actual levelling
is much needed, but it is rendered difficult by the uncertainty attending
the correction for temperature*.       Thus if E=l +-003665 . r, where r
degrees Centigrade is the temperature of the air at a height of x metres,
and X=R,ar-^(R, +«), it becomes necessary in the determination of the
formula to integrate rfX-f-E (see especially Bessel in Schumacher's Astron.

and have therefore             no reason to assume the alteration of temperature as

the height increases.                   Now Mr. Glaisher,            as the result    of his observations
    * The errors in determining the actual temperatures of the air in mountain ascents,
arising from the radiation of the ground, are not considered, because they are rather
errors of observation than of theory.

278                    Mr. Ellis     on the Corrections for Latitude             [May 18,
on the diminution of temperature with increase of height, gives a series of
average decrements such that on assuming the temperature to decrease m
degrees Fahrenheit for an elevation of n thousand feet, and representing a
degree Fahrenheit and a thousand feet, by a horizontal and a vertical unit
of length respectively, we shall find that the resulting curve approaches to
a rectangular hyperbola mn+am + bn=0, referred to axes parallel to its
asymptotes.   1We may then by the principle of least squares determine the
values     of a and b from his Tables*. But on comparing such a curve with the
curves      of alteration of temperature really observedf, the deviation from
the average appears so great in particular cases, that no advantage would
accrue from complicating the integration by the introduction of such a
law.
   The only course that appears open to pursue is to confine the limits
of the integration   to those small amounts which Laplace contemplated
in the passage cited, and calculate the height by sections. For it also ap
pears from Mr. Glaisher's curve, that for small alterations of height the
alteration       of temperature varies approximately       as the alteration     of height,
that     is,   that the curve                       from its tangent for com
                                does not deviate materially
paratively considerable distances.  1When the difference of level       many       is
thousand feet the difference of temperature           is
                                               generally »arge, and the curve
consequently differs materially from     straight line.
                                                a         No dependence can
then be placed on the result.      It would appear that we should be more
likely to obtain correct results by dividing the whole height into number         a
of partial heights, not exceeding 1000 metres or 3000 feet, and taking
fresh observations whenever the temperature altered abnormally. To have
a rough notion of when this occurs, an aneroid barometer and common
thermometer should be watched on the ascent.                   Mr. Glaisher's observations
tend to show that we may expect on an average        fall           a    of very nearly 4°
Fahr. for each inch of depression of the barometer under                a    cloudy sky, the

may therefore be considered as the normal alteration of temperature.      In
order to secure simultaneous observations at both stations for each section,
it would        be necessary to have two ascending parties,                one for each variable
station, each of which should be able to signal to the other. A stationary
observer at the lowest station would serve as a check on the other two.
This method introduces    many practical difficulties, but the reduction of
the observations is rendered very easy by Tables I. and II. The great
importance of thus calculating heights by sections will be rendered evident
by the following examples.

   * In the Ann. Mit. de F.     e.) M. Plantamour calculates the height of St. Bernard

by Be8sel's formula (taking account of the humidity of the atmosphere according to his
hypothesis, which     however, not in accordance with Mr. Glaisher's observations) as
                         is,
2473 metres.    In the Annuaire de la SocieU Mitiorologique de France, 1853, p. 249,
M. Plantamour gives tho height of the basin of the barometer at the hospice of
St. Bernard as 2493 metres, but does not there state how this result was obtained.
These heights being respectively 10 and 30 metres greater than that calculated by
Laplace's formula, would,     adopted as the height of the lower station in the second
                                if
calculation, give results more nearly in accordance with those in the third calculation.
The object here, however,    to examine the action of Laplace's formula only, and hence
                                is
the height assumed for St. Bernard must be that due to that formula.        But different
data give different results for  this height. Geneva   and  St. Bernard  are  too widely
separated horizontally, and have generally too great      difference
                                                                 a   of temperature, to
enable us to calculate the whole height in one section with any degree of confidence, as
there are probably many abnormal intermediate changes of temperature which, as will
be seen, tend to vitiate the result. Nor can any reliance be placed on adopting the
mean barometric pressures and temperatures.               If
                                                     any mean be taken,    must be the

280                   Mr. Ellis   on the Corrections      for Latitude         [May 18,
    Mr. Glaisher'g balloon ascents offer a very convenient series of examples
on account of the comparative closeness of his observations.               I have there
fore calculated two, Tables        III. and   IV.,  p. 286, which are important from
their height or remarkable changes of temperature, first, by determining
                                                               I
the height of each station from the lowest (which call the total method) ;
and secondly, by calculating the height of each station from the height of
the next lower station (which I call the gradual method).                 I have added
the differences of level between the stations as determined from both
methods and the differences between them, which are important for
discovering how the discrepancies between the two results are produced by
temperature.         Each station is lettered.       Two letters against a number, as
ah 5720, show that the height of the station h above the                 sea is found as
5/20    feet, when     station a is taken as the lower station with the height
assigned to it in the same column.            The distance a A is termed an interval.
A careful examination of these results will show that the gradual method
is probably the most trustworthy.
    In Table     III. up to station i, both results substantially agree, but in the
interval    ij   there is a sudden increase of temperature, which is quite ab
normal*.        The total method, from omitting all considerations of the pre
ceding lower temperatures, makes the height of the interval                 ij  exceed its
value as determined by the gradual method by 59 feet, an enormous amount
in a total height of 7518 or 7579 feet. The temperature again decreasing
from   j to k, the difference is not      so great, but the total method is 8 feet      in
defect for this interval.         Again, for m n there is only a slight fall of tem
perature,     and consequently the total method, ignoring the low absolute
temperature of the interval, makes the difference of level greater than the
gradual method by 27 feet.            In p q there is absolutely a rise of tempera
ture, and for the reason last stated, the total method makes the interval
 73 feet greater than the gradual.            The interval q r is a great contrast to
this.     The temperature falls very rapidly, 7°-l for a barometric depression
of -79 inch, which is nearly double the normal amount as previously de
termined      for the 14th inch of depression.              Hence the total method, by
 distributing the cold over the warm parts, makes the interval q r 73 feet
 lets than the gradual method.             Again, rs shows an excess of 103 feet in
the total method for a steady temperature, and s t a defect of 100 feet for a
 sudden fall    of temperature.       Mr. Glaisher's observations show that there
was a rise and        fall  of temperature between r and *, but as there were no
 simultaneous observations of barometer and thermometer, I have not been
 able to introduce them into the calculation.              The results after r are there
 fore very    doubtful.      The  interval  v w  is liable  to grave suspicion, not only
 from the great length of the interval, but the imperfect manner in which
the observations were unavoidably made.                 Supposing the observations to
   * It is readily seen that on the assumed law of temperature, Es + k. X = constant ; the
 sign of dx-¥dt depends on that of k, and is therefore supposed to be constant. When
 therefore dx-i-df alters its sign during part of the height, the law is vitiated, and the
 formula inapplicable.     The only chance of a decent approximation consists in separately
 calculating the intervals with decreasing and increasing temperatures.

I860.]            and Temperature      in Barometric Hypsometry,          ($c.        281
be correct, the total method makes the interval               v v' greater than the gra
dual by no less than 610 feet, owing to its distributing the warm tempera
tures over so large an interval of extreme cold.            If  we then omit the inter
val vw,      we find 359 feet for the sum of all the cases in which the total
method was in excess of the gradual, and 201 feet for the cases of defect,
leaving a total excess of 158 feet in 26450 or 26292 feet, which is thus
shown to be a very inadequate measure of the degree of uncertainty due to
the total method.
    In Table IV.     the results to c, or even d, substantially agree ; but at d the
temperature decreases very slowly, and soon becomes absolutely stationary.
Great differences immediately appear.              From I to r the temperature in
creases,     and the total method gains greatly on the gradual till at r it is
5-11   feet in advance.        At stations t,t the total method indicates a de
scent with a falling barometer, whereas the gradual method gives a very
 slow ascent. Mr. Glaisher's observations show that for the same baro
metric pressure of 14 637 inches, as at r, the temperature varied succes
 sively through 36°1, 38°- 2, 38°1, 42°- 2 Fahr., which on the total method
indicate different heights, whereas the gradual methods cannot admit any
variation of height without a variation of pressure.               The rapid fall of the
thermometer from u to w causes the total method to give very much smaller
intervals     than the gradual, but the nearly stationary temperatures of x, y, z
turn the balance the other way. On the whole, the total method gives
 686 feet in excess, and 335 feet in defect of the gradual method, remaining
35   1 feet in excess.      The temperature varied so abnormally in this ascent
 that little confidence      can be reposed in either result after station h, when
 the total method is only 32 feet out of 941 1 or 9379 in advance of the gra
 dual, which is still a large amount.
    It  may be objected to the gradual method that, by multiplying stations,
 it multiplies errors of observation.         But even when the stations are so un
 necessarily multiplied as in Tables        III. and    IV. (in which   nearly every re
 corded case of a simultaneous observation             of barometer and thermometer
 has been admitted), the error is not likely to approach that arising from the
 total method.       We may, however, calculate the ascent of Table             III. as far
 as r, beyond which, as already remarked, the variation of temperatures
 renders the results uncertain, in six instead of sixteen stations, as follows.

1400 feet,         which disappears in the abridgement, and consequently it again
loses      1 1               It

rather by change of temperature than by height ascended becomes appa
rent.  A better result is obtained by means of the seven sections a i 6327,

When the difference in barometric pressure      not great, and hence      is
is nearly  =/3'+/3", by applying the  reductions  in 'Proceedings,' vol. xii.
p. 516, the above condition becomes very nearly, that the decrement of
temperature should vary as the decrement of pressure, and this       the case                        is
for the normal decrements. Thus in Table III. the intervals     i,j lm,np                        a       k,
give for the quotients of the decrements of temperature divided           the                                 by
decrements of pressure 4*635, 4-07, 3*26, 3*92 respectively, and the dif
ferences of the lengths of these intervals, as determined by the total and
gradual methods, are only    —8, 13, 13 respectively.

the temperatures of the air, next dividing by 900, [and finally

  IV. "On         the Elasticity      and Viscosity of Metals."           By Prof. W.
       Thomson, LL.D.,           F.R.S., F.R.S.E. Received May 18, 1865.
      Among the experimental exercises performed by students in the phy
  sical laboratory of the University of Glasgow, observations on the elas
 ticity of metals have been continued during many years. Numerous ques
 tions of great interest, requiring more thorough and accurate investi
 gation, have been suggested by these observations ; and recently they
 have brought to light some very unexpected properties of metallic wires.
 The results stated in the present communication are, however, with one or
 two exceptions, due to the careful experimenting of Mr. Donald Macfar-
 lane, official     assistant   to the Professor of Natural Philosophy, whose in
 terested and skilful cooperation have been most valuable iu almost every
 thing I have been able to attempt in the way of experimental investigation.
     The subject has naturally fallen into two divisions, Viscosity, and
 Moduli of Elasticity.
      Viscosity. — By induction from a great variety of observed phenomena,
we are compelled to conclude that no change of volume or of shape can
 be produced in any kind of matter without dissipation of energy.                   Even
 in dealing with the absolutely perfect elasticity of volume presented by
 every fluid, and possibly by some solids, as lor instance homogeneous
crystals, dissipation of energy is an inevitable result of every change of
volume, because of the accompanying change of temperature, and con
 sequent dissipation of heat by conduction or radiation.               The same cause
 gives     rise  necessarily   to  some    degree of  dissipation  in   connexion with
every change of shape of an elastic solid.             But estimates founded on the
thermodynamic theory of elastic solids, which 1 have given elsewhere *,
have sufficed to prove that the loss of energy due to this cause is small in
 comparison with the whole loss of energy which I have observed in many
cases     of vibration.      I  have also found,   by vibrating a spring alternately
in air of ordinary pressure, and in the exhausted receiver of an air-pump,
that there is an internal resistance to its motions immensely greater than
the resistance of the air.          The   same  conclusion   is to be drawn from the
observation made by Kupffer in his great work on the elasticity of metals,
that his vibrating springs subsided much more rapidly in their vibrations
than rigid pendulums supported on knife-edges.                  The subsidence of vi
brations is probably more rapid in glass than in some of the most elastic
                                                     f
metals, as copper, iron, silver, aluminium ; but it is much more rapid
than in glass, marvellously rapid indeed, in some metals (as for instance
zinc) %, and in india rubber, and even in homogeneous jellies.

    t We have     no evidence that the precious metals are more elastic than copper, iron,
or   brass.    One of the new bronze pennies gives quite as clear a ring as a two-shilling
silver piece tested in the usual manner.

    The frictional resistance against change of shape must in every solid be
infinitely small when the change of shape is made at an infinitely slow
rate, since, if it were finite for an infinitely slow change of shape, there
would be infinite rigidity, which we may be sure does not exist in nature*.
 Hence there is in elastic solids a molecular friction which may be pro
perly called viscosity of solids, because, as being an internal resistance to
 change of shape depending on the rapidity of the change, it must be
 classed with fluid molecular friction, which by general consent is called
 viscosity of fluids.       But, at the same time, it ought to be remarked that
 the word viscosity, as used hitherto by the best writers, when solids or
heterogeneous        semisolid-semifluid      masses are referred to, has not been dis
 tinctly applied to molecular friction, especially not to the molecular friction
 of a highly elastic solid within its limits of high elasticity, but has rather
 been employed to designate a property              of slow continual yielding through
 very great, or altogether unlimited, extent of change of shape, under the
 action of continued stress. It is in this sense that Forbes, for instance, has
used the word in stating that " Viscous Theory of Glacial Motion" which he
 demonstrated by his grand observations on glaciers.                  As, however, he, and
many other writers after him, have used the words plasticity and plastic, both
with reference to homogeneous solids (such as wax or pitch even though
also brittle, soft metals,         &c.), and to heterogeneous semisolid-semifluid
masses     (as mud, moist earth, mortar, glacial ice, &c.), to designate the
property     f  common to all those cases of experiencing, under continued stress,
either quite continued and unlimited change of shape, or gradually
 very great change at a diminishing (asymptotic) rate through infinite
time, and as the use of the term plasticity implies no more than does
 viscosity     any physical theory or explanation of the property, the word
viscosity    is without inconvenience left available for the definition I propose.
    To investigate the viscosity of metals, I have in the first place taken
 them in the form of round wires, and have chosen torsional vibrations,
after th& manner of Coulomb,              for observation,   as being much      the easiest
way to arrive at definite results.             In every case one end of the wire was
attached to a rigid vibrator with sufficient firmness (thorough and smooth
 soldering    I find to be always the best plan when the wire is thick enough)               ;
bas been found scarcely possible to count more than twenty        of them in one case experi
mented on.
   * Those who believe in the existence of indivisible, infinitely strong and infinitely-
rigid very small bodies (finite atoms !) may deny this.
   t Some confusion of ideas on the part of writers who have professedly objected
to Forbes's     theory  while really   objecting only (and    I believe groundlessly) to his
usage   of the word viscosity, might have      been avoided if they had paused to consider
that no one physical explanation       can hold for those several cases, and that Forbes's
theory is merely the proof by observation that glaciers have the property that mud
(heterogeneous), mortar (heterogeneous), pitch (homogeneous), water (homogeneous), all
have of changing      shape  indefinitely   and continuously under the action of continued
stress.

the vibrator at its lower end.           I arranged sets of observations to be made
for the separate comparisons          of  the   following classes : —
                 same wire    with different vibrators of equal weights (to give
    (a) The
equal stretching-tractions),        but different moments of inertia (to test the
relation   between     viscous   resistances      against motions with different veloci
ties through the same range and under the same stress).
                                   different vibrators of equal moments of inertia
    (6) The same wire with
but unequal weights (to test the effect of different longitudinal tractions
on the viscous resistance to torsion under circumstances similar in all
other respects).
    (c) The same wire and the           same vibrator,        but different initial ranges in
successive experiments        (to test an effect unexpectedly            discovered, by which
the subsidence of vibrations           from any amplitude           takes place at very dif
ferent    rates according      to the immediately           previous molecular condition,
whether of quiescence or           of recurring change of shape through                 a wider
range).
    (d) Two equal and similar wires, with equal and similar vibrators, one
of them kept as continually as possible in a state of vibration, from day to
day   ;  the other kept at rest, except when vibrated in an experiment once
a day (to test the effect of continued vibration on the viscosity of a metal).
                                            Results.
    (a)   It  was found     that the loss       of energy in      a vibration    through one
range was greater the greater the velocity (within the limits of the experi
                                     between the losses at low and high speeds was
 ments) ; but the difference
 much less than it would have been had the resistance been, as Stokes has
 proved     it to be in fluid friction, approximately as the rapidity of the
 change of shape.           The irregularities in the results of the experiments
 which up to this time I have made, seem to prove that much smaller
vibrations (producing less absolute amounts of distortion in the parts of the
 wires    most    stressed) must be observed before any simple law of relation
between molecular friction and velocity can be discovered.
                                        increased, the viscosity was always at first
    (6) When the weight was
 much increased ; but then day after day it gradually diminished and be
 came as small in amount as it had been with the lighter weight.                          It has
 not yet been practicable to continue the experiments long enough in any
 case to find the limit to this variation.
     (c) The vibration subsided in aluminium wires much more rapidly from
 amplitude 20 to amplitude 10, when the initial amplitude was 40, than
 when it was 20.         Thus, with a certain aluminium wire, and vibrator No. 1

 kept vibrating nearly all day, from day to day, after several days, very
 much more molecular friction than in another kept quiescent except
 during each experiment.             Thus two equal and similar pieces of wire were

   Moduli of Elasticity. — A modulus of elasticity is the number by which
the amount of any specified stress, or component of a stress, must be divided
to find the strain, or any stated component of the strain, which it produces.
Thus the cubic compressibility             of water being »-rornr per atmosphere, its
"modulus of compressibility"               or its "volume modulus of elasticity," is
21000 atmospheres, or 76            x 13-596 x 21000=21*7 X 10" grammes weight
                   * Of same weight as No.   1,  but different moment of inertia.

per square centimetre (as 13-596 is the density or specific gravity* of mer
cury, and 76 centimetres the height of the barometric column corresponding
to the pressure defined as "one atmosphere").                        Or, again, Young's
" modulus," which        has generally been called simply the modulus of elasticity
of   a solid, is the  longitudinal traction of p stretched rod or wire of the sub
stance, divided by the extension produced by it.                Or, lastly, the " modulus
of rigidity," or, as it is conveniently called, simply "the rigidity" of an iso
tropic solid, is the amount of tangential stress divided                           T
by the deformation it produces, — the former being mea
sured in units     of force per unit of area applied, as shown
in the diagram, to each of four faces of a cube, and the
latter by the variation of each of the four right angles,
reckoned in circular measure.                                                      ^
     Measurements      of Young's modulus have           been made for many bodies by
many experimenters        ; but hitherto there have been very few determinations
of rigidity, notwithstanding the great ease with which this can be done for
wires by Coulomb's method.                 Accordingly, although several accurate
determinations of Young's modulus have been made upon wires of different
substances hung in the College Tower of the University of Glasgow (which,
by giving 80 feet of clear protected vertical space, affords great facilities for
the investigation), I shall in this paper only refer to some of the results as
bearing on the question, how are moduli of elasticity affected in one substance
 by permanent changes in its molecular condition ? which was my starting-
point for all     I have attempted to do experimentally           regarding the elasticity
 of solids.
     To determine rigidities by torsional vibrations,            taking advantage of an
obvious but most valuable          suggestion made to me         by Dr. Joule, I used as
vibrator in each      case a  thin cylinder of sheet brass, turned true outside and
    * The one great advantage of the French metrical system is, that the mass of the unit
 volume (1 centimetre) of water at its temperature of maximum density (3°-945 Cent.) is
 unity (1 gramme) to a sufficient degree of approximation for almost all practical purposes.
 Thus, according to this system, the density of a body and its specific gravity mean one
 and the same thing; whereas on the British no-system the density is expressed by a
 number found by multiplying the specific gravity by one number or another, according to
 the choice (of a cubic inch, cubic foot, cubic yard, or cubic mile) that is made for the unit
 of volume, and the weight of a grain, scruple, gun-maker's drachm, apothecary's drachm,

 shire, Lanarkshire, Dumbartonshire), stone for hay, stone for corn, quarter (of a hundred
 weight), quarter (of corn), hundredweight, or ton, that is chosen for unit of force. It is
a remarkable phenomenon, belonging rather to moral and social than to physical science,
that a people tending naturally to be regulated by common sense should voluntarily con
 demn themselves,    as the British have so long done, to unnecessary hard labour in every
 action of common business or scientific work related to measurement, from which all the
 other nations of Europe have emancipated themselves.         I have been informed, through
 the kindness of Professor W. II. Miller, of Cambridge, that he concludes, from a very
trustworthy comparison of standards by Kupffer, of St. I'etersburgh, that the weight of a
cubic decimetre of water at temperature of maximum density is 1000-013 grammes.

     Towards carrying out the chief object of the investigation, each wire,
 after having been suspended and stretched with just force enough to make
 it as nearly straight as was necessary for accuracy, was vibrated.                                      Then it
 was stretched by hand (applied to the cross bar soldered to its lower end)
 and vibrated again, stretched again and vibrated again, and so till it broke.

    Thus it appears that that specific rigidity which is concerned in torsion
is very markedly diminished in copper, brass, and iron wire when the wire
is elongated permanently by a simple longitudinal traction.            When I first
observed indications of this result, I suspected that the diminution in the
torsional rigidity on the whole length of the wire might be due to inequali
ties in its normal section produced by the stretching.           To test this, I cut
the wire into several pieces after each series of experiments, and weighed
the pieces separately.       The result proved that in no case were there any
such inequalities in the gauge of the wire in different parts as could possi-
blyaccount for the diminution in the torsional rigidity of the whole, which
was thus proved to be due to a real diminution in the specific rigidity of
the substance.       The following sets of weighings, for the cases of the wires
of the two last series of experiments on copper, may suffice for example : —

    By several determinations of observations on the elongations within the
limits of elasticity produced by hanging weights on long wires (about 80
feet) suspended in the College tower, it seemed that Young's modulus was
 not nearly so much (if at all sensibly) altered by the change of molecular
 condition so largely affecting the rigidity ; but this question requires fur
ther investigation.     The amount of the Young's modulus thus found was,
 in grammes weight per square centimetre, 1159 X 10" for one copper wire,
 and 1 153 x 10° for another which had been very differently treated.

   The highest and lowest rigidities which have found for copper (extracted
from the preceding Table) are as follows : —
   Highest rigidity, 473x 10°, being that of a wire which had been
softened by heating it to redness and plunging it into water, and which
was    found to be of density 8191.        Lowest rigidity 393-4 x 10s, being
that of a wire which had been rendered so brittle by heating it to redness
surrounded by powdered charcoal in a crucible and letting it cool very
slowly, that it could scarcely be touched without breaking             and which  it,
had been found to be reduced in density by this process to as low as 8-6/4.
The wires used were all commercial specimens — those of copper being all, or
nearly all, cut from hanks supplied by the Gutta Percha Company, having
been selected as of high electric conductivity, and of good mechanical quality,
for submarine cables.
   It ought to be remarked that the change of molecular condition pro
duced by permanently stretching         wire or solid cylinder of metal
                                                    a                       cer           is

therefore      be presumed to be reolotropic as to elasticity.           If so,    the rigidities
corresponding to the direct and diagonal distortions                    (indicated by No.       1
and No.     in the sketch) must in all probability

reflected from the surface of the mirror.          This instrument has been con
structed     on three     different  principles. In Drummond's (Philosophical
Transactions      for 1826, p. 324), by a simple mechanism, a normal to the
mirror is made to bisect the angle between the axes of two telescopes, one
of which is pointed to T, and the other to S ; consequently T will receive
the light of S reflected from O.          In Struve's (Breiteugradmessung, p. 49)
the mirror is directed by means of two sights attached to its support,
which are brought into the line OT. The heliotrope employed in the
 Ordnance Survey (Ordnance Trigonometrical Survey of Great Britain and
 Ireland, Account of Observations and Calculations of the Principal Tri
 angles, p. 47) is similar to Struve's, except that a single mark placed at a
 convenient distance in the line OT is substituted for the two sights.             In
 the two heliotropes invented by Gauss (Astronomische            Nachriehten, vol. v.
 p. 329, and v. Zach's Correspondence Astronomique, vol. v. p. 374, and
 vol. vi. p. 65), in Steinheil's (Schumacher's Jahrbuch fur 18*44, p. 12),
 and in Gallon's an optical contrivance is connected with the mirror, 60 as
 to throw a cone of sunlight in a direction opposite to the cone of sunlight
 reflected from the surface of the mirror, the axes of the two cpnes being
 parallel, and either very nearly or absolutely coincident.         Hence any point
 T, from which a portion of the former cone of light appears to proceed,
 will receive the light of the sun reflected from the mirror.
      The heliotropes I am about to describe produce two cones of sunlight
  thrown in opposite directions, like those of Gauss, Steinheil, and Galton,
 but differ from them in having no moveable parts, and from all but
  Galton's, and the sextant-heliotrope of Gauss, with a second moveable
  mirror, in requiring no support except the hand of the operator.
       One of these consists of a plane mirror, to an edge of which are attached
  two very small plane reflectors, a, c, forming with one another a reentrant
  angleof 90°, and making angles of 90° with the faces of the mirror.            If a
  ray be reflected once by each of the two planes a, c, it is obvious that the
 first and last directions of the ray will be parallel to a plane containing the
  intersection of a, c, and will make equal angles with the intersection of
  a, e, which is also a normal to the face of the mirror.          Therefore, if two
  parallel rays    fall, one   on the mirror,  and one on  either of the planes a, c,
  the direction of the ray reflected from the mirror will be parallel and
  opposite to that of a ray reflected once at each of the planes a, c.         When
  the small reflectors are made of bits of unsilvered glass, the brightness of
   the image of the sun is so far reduced after the second reflexion, as not to
  interfere with the direct vision of T, and the mirror can be pointed without
   difficulty.
       The other consists of      a plate of glass having parallel faces b, d, with
   two polished plane faces a, c on its edges, making right angles with one
   another, and with the faces b, d, the face d being silvered, with the excep
   tion of   a portion at the angle adc not larger than the pupil of the eye.
    It  is easily seen that if a ray of light incident upon b, and refracted

 1865.]      Prof. W. H. Miller on Two New Forms of Heliotrope.              299
through    h, so as to be reflected    internally once at each of the planes a, c,
emerge through      d, the  planes of  incidence and emergence will be parallel,
and the incident and emergent rays will make equal angles with the edge
ac, and therefore with a normal to the faces b, d.          Hence the portion of
the incident    ray which is reflected from the mirror will proceed in a
direction   parallel and opposite to that portion of the ray which, after
internal reflexion at   a and c, emerges    through d.
   In   order to ascertain that the construction      of such an instrument pre
sented no unforeseen difficulties,       I requested Mr. T. E. Butters, of 4,
Crescent, Belvedere Road,       the well-known maker of sextant-mirrors       and
artificial horizons, to form the     faces a, e on the edges of a piece of plate
glass,  and   then   had   the face d coated with chemically reduced silver.
Upon trial, the emergent light was found to be too bright ; but after
smoking the angle ade in the flame of a candle, in order to reduce the
intensity of the light, it became perfectly easy to make the centre of the
image of the sun coincide with the object T seen by direct vision.
   An image of the sun of suitable intensity for pointing might be obtained
by attaching to the edge of the mirror a piece of tinted glass, of the form
of the corner abed, with the faces b, d parallel to the plane of the mirror.

    "Sir, — The attention of the Fellows of the Royal Society has been re

 employment of iron in the construction and equipment of ships, and the
consequent augmentation of the embarrassment occasioned in their naviga
tion by the action of the ship's magnetism on their compasses.
    "The inconveniences which have already made themselves felt in the
ships of the mercantile marine, and which threaten to be productive of
very serious loss of life and property, unless remedial measures be adopted
similar to those which have proved so advantageous to the ships of Her
 Majesty's Navy, have induced the President and Council of the Royal
Society, after much consideration, to venture         on the step of calling your
attention, as presiding over the Department          of Trade, to a subject which
they believe to be of pressing importance.

   " It  is believed that the time has come when it is expedient that the
Executive Government should exercise a more direct and systematic super
vision over the adjustment of the compasses of ships of the mercantile
marine than it has hitherto done.        The opinion that it might do so with
advantage is not new, as may be seen from passages in the 2nd and 3rd
Reports of the Liverpool Compass Committee (2nd Report, p. 30 ; 3rd
Report, p. 38), but it has of late been gaining strength from the following
among other circumstances      : —
               * Published in the Proceedings, by order of the Council.

 1865.]                     on the Magnetism   of Ships.                     301
    "(1) The     great increase in the number of iron ships, as well as in the
amount     of iron used in the construction of such ships.
    "
      (2) The losses of iron ships.
    " (3)  The advances which have been made in, and the present state of,
the science of the deviation of the compass.
    " We may     consider these separately.
    " 1 . It is  believed that for some years the number of iron ships con
structed has greatly exceeded that of wood-built ships, and this is particu
larly the   case as regards passenger steamers.      In such vessels iron is now
 used not only in the construction      of the hull but in decks, deck-houses,
masts, rigging, and many other parts of the ship for which wood was till
recently used.       The consequence has been a great increase in the amount
 of the deviation of the compass, increased difficulty in finding a proper
 place for the compass, and increased necessity for, and difficulty in, apply
ing to the deviation either mechanical or tabular corrections.
    " 2.  Many recent losses of iron steamers have taken place, in which it is
 probable that compass-error has occasioned the loss. In most of these, how
ever, from the want of any record of the magnetic state of the ship, of the
 amount of original deviation, and of the mode of correction, and from the
investigations into the causes of the loss being conducted by persons not
instructed in the science, and who are necessarily incompetent either to
elicit the facts from which a judgment can be formed, or to form a judg
 ment on those facts which are elicited, no certain conclusion as to the
 cause of loss can be arrived at.       The investigations are, however, suffi
 cient to show the want of a better and more uniform system of compass-
 correction in the mercantile marine, and of more knowledge of the subject
 among masters and mates.
    " 3. Since the first introduction   of iron ships it has been a recognized
fact that they cannot be safely navigated without the compass being as it
is termed ' adjusted,' i. e. without the deviations being corrected either
mechanically by magnets or by a table of errors ; but at first the correc
tion of each ship was a separate and independent problem.         Now the case
is different.    The theory of the deviation, its causes, and its laws, are now
thoroughly     understood    and reduced to simple formulae, leaving the nume
rical magnitude of      a certain small number of quantities to be determined
by observation for       each ship separately ; and further, by recording, re
ducing, and discussing the deviations which have been observed in the
ships of the Royal Navy of different classes, numerical results, as to the
values of these quantities in ships of each class, have been determined
which promise to be of the greatest use in facilitating the complete deter
mination    of the deviation and its correction, and in suggesting modes for
constructing iron ships, and in the selection of the position of the standard
compass.      The science of magnetism, in its relation to navigation, is, in
fact, in a position in some degree analogous to that in which the science of
astronomy at one time was.           The principles of the science have been
                                                                   z 2

 302                         Communications       to the  Board of Trade              [June,
 established,        the formulae have been obtained          ; but numerical     values are
 wanted, which can only be derived from a large number of observations
 systematically made and discussed.                   At present these numerical results
 have only been obtained from, and are only applicable to, the ships of the
 Royal Navy.            Without      some    systematic direction, the mercantile marine
 can neither derive the full benefit of, or contribute its due share to, the
 advance of the science.
    " That      the subject is one coming properly within the cognizance of the
 Board of Trade may be inferred from the Legislature having already in the
 Merchant Shipping Act, 1854, sect. 301, art. (2), provided that 'every
 sea-going        steamship      employed to carry passengers shall have her com
 passes properly adjusted from time to time, such adjustment to be made
 to the satisfaction of the Shipwright Surveyor, and according to such
 regulations        as may be issued by the Board of Trade.'               The Shipwright
                                                       '
 Surveyor      is   then   (sect. 309)    to  make   a   declaration' that the 'compasses
 are such and in such condition as required by the Act,' and on such ' de
             '
                 the ' certificate
                                      '
 claration                              of the Board of Trade is issued.
    " It   does      not appear how these enactments are construed or carried
into effect. It is not, however, understood that the Shipright Surveyor is
 expected or is necessarily competent to do more than see that the ship is
furnished with proper compasses, but the goodness of the compass has
 nothing to do with the deviation ; the best compasses are affected by the
deviation      precisely in the same way and to the same extent as the worst*.
It  is not understood           that he exercises any judgment or control as to the
position of the compass, the amount of deviation, or the mode of adjust
ment, or any of the various points which are involved in the compass
         '
being properly adjusted.'
    " As regards the important subject of ' deviation,' all that has been done
by the Board of Trade consists, it is believed, in the publication of the
' Circular on Deviation '
                                     compiled by Admiral FitzRoy, the publication of
the Reports of the Liverpool Compass Committee, and the publication of
'
  Practical Information for Masters and Mates,' by Mr. Towson.
    "As regards the particular points to which the attention of the Board
of Trade may be invited, they may be considered under the following
heads:   —
    "
      (1) The         correction of the compass in particular ships.
    "                advancement of the science of deviation of the compass.
      (2) The
    "       The      education of Masters and Mates.
      (3)
    "1. As       before observed, it is now recognized that every iron ship must
have its compasses 'adjusted.'                  Hitherto two totally different modes of
   * This is subject to      the qualification that, from the diminution of directive force in
ships  having     large  deviations,  compasses of superior power and delicacy are required ;
and if the compasses are corrected by magnets, a particular arrangement of needles is
requisite.

1865.]                     on the Magnetism     of Ships.                      303
adjustment      have been practised,     each  of which lias its advantages and
 disadvantages.
    " i . The system recommended         by a Committee of Men of Science and
 Naval Officers appointed by the Admiralty in 1837, and which has been
uniformly followed in the Royal Navy from that time.               In this system
                     '
 each ship has a Standard        Compass,' distinct from the Steering-Compass,
 fixed in a position    selected, not for the convenience of the steersman, but
 for the moderate and uniform amount          of the deviation at and around it.
The ship is navigated solely by that compass.             The deviation of that
compass on each course is ascertained by the process of ' swinging' the
 ship ; a table of deviation is formed, and the deviations given by the
tables are applied as corrections to the courses steered.
    " 2. The system proposed by the Astronomer Royal in 1839, and which
is understood to be generally followed in the mercantile marine.            In this
system the deviations of the compass are compensated by magnets (and
occasionally     soft iron).   The ship is navigated by the compass        so cor
rected — generally the steering-compass, and generally without any tabular
correction.
    " It  would   not be right, considering the weight of authority on each
side, to pronounce any decided opinion against either of those modes of
correction when properly used.         The first system has proved in the Royal
Navy to be     one  which can   be used  without danger.     The  same  cannot be
said  of the second method      as regards the mercantile marine ; but the prin
cipal danger    of  the  method   arises from what is in truth an abuse of the
method : it is that, in reliance on the power of correcting any amount of
original deviation, however great, the navigating-compass is placed in a
position in which the original deviations are excessive and vary rapidly, and
in which no navigating-compass should be placed.
    " In merchant ships the most convenient place for the
                                                                 steering-compass
is generally near the upper part of the stern-post, the rudder-head, the
tiller, and the iron spindle of the steering-wheel — all, from their shape and
position, powerfully magnetic. The constructor and owner, for the sake of
economy, desire that the steering-compass should be the navigating-com
pass.     The compass-adjuster fears that any objection on his part would be
considered    a confession    of incompetence,    and that some less scrupulous
adjuster would not hesitate to undertake         the correction. The correction
can only be made by powerful magnets.            The compass is then held, as it
were, in equilibrium by powerful antagonistic force ; and when the changes
take place, which it is known do take place in all new iron ships, or when
any changes take place in the magnets, large errors are introduced, which
are the more fatal because the shipmaster is taught to believe that his
compass is correct.
    " This abuse of the method is one the temptation to which is unfortu
nately so strong, that it is believed it can only be effectually prevented by
prohibiting the     use of the steering-compass    as the navigating-compass,    or

304                   Communication   to the Board of Trade
rather    by requiring that the ship shall have a naviga ting-compass distinct
from, and in addition to, the steering-compass.
    " It is therefore recommended that every iron passenger-ship should be
required to have a standard compass distinct from the steering-compass in
a selected situation at a certain distance from all masses of iron ; that,
whether corrected or not, the original deviations of the standard compass
should not in ordinary cases exceed a certain limited amount ; and that on
each occasion of the compass being adjusted, a table of the deviations
should be furnished to the Master and returned to the Board of Trade ;
and that    if corrected by magnets, a return should be made of the position
of the magnets and of every subsequent alteration of their position.        Pro
vision may be made for exceptional cases, in which it may be found im
practicable to place the standard compass in a position where the original
deviation is within the limit, by requiring in such cases a special certificate
from the central authority.
    " It may be here observed, as regards many practical matters connected
with the adjustment of the compass in particular ships, in which at present
great diversity of practice prevails, that an organized department under a
skilful superintendent in constant communication' with the ports, would
probably be of the greatest service, not merely in laying down rules, but in
giving advice and suggestions to naval constructors, compass-makers and
adjusters, and producing a uniform system of adjustment at the different
ports, which would be generally understood by shipmasters.         Advice from
the same source would be not less useful to the authorities in the different
ports in suggesting means of facilitating the adjustment by meridian-marks
on shore, laying down moorings, &c.          It would probably be one of the
first duties of the superintendent of such a department to acquaint himself
thoroughly with the methods practised at the different ports, and to give
such suggestions, either in the form of reports to the Board of Trade, or in
private communications, or both, as might appear to him advisable.         Such
a superintendent would also be available as an assessor in investigations
into the loss of iron vessels, in cases in which there is any possibility of the
loss having been occasioned by compass-error.
    " 2. The advancement of the science of the Deviation      of the Compass.
    " Whatever    difference of opinion exists as to the advantage  or necessity
of   a Standard   Compass as regards the safety of particular ships, there is
none as to its being indispensable for any scientific inquiry into the amount
of the deviation and of its constituent parts and its changes. It is from
the Tables of the deviation     of such compasses, and such compasses alone,
observed at different times and places, and systematically reduced and dis
cussed, that those numerical results can be obtained which promise to be so
useful in securing in iron ships a place for the Standard Compass where the
deviation is of a safe and manageable amount, and in guarding against the
dangers which arise from chauges in the magnetism of recently built ships.
 It is from the recorded deviations    of such compasses that on the loss of    a

  1865.]                   on the Magnetism      of Ships.                     305
  ship a judgment may be formed of the effect of the deviation in causing any
  error in the course of the ship.
     "3. The education of Masters and Mates.
     " At present it may be said that entire ignorance of the
                                                                    subject is the
  rule.
     " The subject has not hitherto been a recognized branch of the educa
  tion of the seaman ; and the most skilful seamen frequently either ignore it
  altogether, or look upon it as a mystery not capable of comprehension.
  Now, however, that the principles of the science have been established, it is
  found that the subject is not one of any serious difficulty ; and although it
 might not be considered just to require Masters and Mates already certifi
 cated to pass an examination in a new subject, yet an opportunity might be
 given them of passing a voluntary examination ; and as regards future Can
 didates for a Certificate   of competence, notice might     be given that after a
 certain period, say two or three years, a certain amount of knowledge of the
 subject will be required from Candidates (and in the mean time a text-book
 containing the necessary amount of information might be prepared and
 published), and the Examiners of the Local Marine Boards will themselves
 receive instruction,    and,  if  necessary, undergo    an examination    on the
 subject.
     " For  the purposes indicated, it seems desirable to establish a department
 of   the Board of Trade under a competent Superintendent, the whole, or
 greatest part of whose time should be devoted to this subject.        Almost all
 the advances which have hitherto been made in the science, and which
 have placed England at the head of the science, are due to there having
 been for the last twenty-five years one Officer charged by the Admiralty
 with this duty almost exclusively.       Such an Officer becomes the depositary
 of all that is known on the subject, and has no difficulty in obtaining the
best scientific assistance.     It  seems desirable  that for some years at least
the Board of Trade should take advantage of the ability and experience          of
the present Superintendent of the Compass Department of the Navy.               It
is understood that there would be no practical difficulty, and there would
be many advantages in the present state of the science in having the
superintendence of the compasses of the Royal and Mercantile Marine
united in one head, with competent assistants in the two branches of the
service.     The subject, as has been observed, is not one of difficulty. Any
intelligent man could speedily      be instructed in all that would be necessary
to enable him       to discharge the duties of Assistant for the Mercantile
Marine    ;  and in the selection of such an Assistant, probably it would be
more important to look to general ability, intelligence, docility, and the
habit of, and aptitude for, dealing with men, and particularly with Masters
of merchant vessels, than to any previous knowledge of the subject."

for Trade, on the occasion of the vacancy in the Office               of Chief of their
Meteorological Department,            caused   by   the   untimely   death    of Admiral
FitzRoy, to request you to be so good as to bring under the notice of the
President and Council of the Royal Society the correspondence which
took place between that Society and this Office at the time of the institu
tion of the Meteorological Department as a branch of this Office ; and
particularly your letter of the 22nd February, 1855f, in reply to that from
this Office of the 3rd of June, 1854, in which, when about to institute the
Department, My Lords had desired the opinion of the Royal Society as to
what were the great desiderata in Meteorological Science.                     The recom
mendations     of the Royal Society conveyed in your letter of the 22nd of
February, 1855, were adopted            as the basis   of the proceedings of the Me
teorological Department        ;  instruments   were provided, logs were prepared,
furnished, and returned          to the office, and some progress was made in
carrying into effect the original programme.
    "But in 1859 or 1860, the French Government                      having adopted a
system of telegraphing         and publishing the actual state of weather from
one place to another, cooperation           in which was urged on the Board of
Trade by a Committee of the British Association and by Admiral Fitz
Roy, My Lords gave their sanction to what was proposed, and thence
forward a considerable part of the vote previously applied to obtaining
and digesting      observations     was diverted     to these Telegrams.          In 1861
Admiral Fitzlloy grafted on this system of telegraphic communication a
system of forecasting the weather (the forecasts being published in the
daily papers), and, on occasions of anticipated storms, the giving of special
warnings, communicated by telegraph to the different Ports, and there
made known by hoisting certain signals.              The whole, or almost the whole,
of the Funds originally voted for the purpose of observations were thus
diverted from their original scientific object to an object deemed more im
mediately practical.
    " In 1863, on the occasion of an increased estimate for the purpose of
these forecasts, it was determined to compare the forecasts and the warn
ings with the actual results.
    " As regards the daily forecasts, the daily
                                                        reports of weather published
by Admiral FitzRoy afforded, and still afford, ample means of checking
them.

 parisons    for certain  periods   were  tabulated and  laid before Parliament in
a paper, copy of which is annexed.             The data for continuing the return
are still kept,    and,  if it were thought right to incur the expense, it could
be continued      at any time.
    "My Lords at the same time addressed a further letter, dated 27th
 February, 1863, asking the opinion of the Royal Society as to the course
then being pursued by Admiral FitzRoy, and were favoured in reply by
your letter of the 27th March, 1863.
    "The     vacancy    in the Meteorological Department, occasioned by the
death of Admiral FitzRoy, has seemed to My Lords to present a fitting
opportunity to review the past proceedings and present state of the Depart
ment ; and with this view they are desirous of receiving any observations
or suggestions, with which the President and Council of the Royal Society
may be willing to favour them, on the constitution and objects of the
Department, and the mode in which those objects may be most effectually
attained.
    " The points on which the Board of Trade especially desire the opinion
of the Royal Society        are the  following : —
   "  1. Are the objects specified in the Royal Society's letter of the 22nd
February, 1855, still as important for the interests of Science and Naviga
tion as they were then considered ?
   " 2. To what extent have any of these objects been answered by what
has already been done by the Meteorological Department ?
   " 3. What steps should be taken for making use of any observations
already collected, or any compilations already made by the Department ?
   " 4. Is it    desirable to make any, and what, further observations on any,
and which of the subjects mentioned in the Royal Society's letter of 22nd
February, 1855?
   " 5. What is the nature of the basis on which the system of daily fore
casts and storm warnings established by Admiral FitzRoy rests ?            In other
words, are they founded on scientific principles, so that they, or either of
them, can      be carried on satisfactorily notwithstanding     Admiral FitzRoy's
decease   1
   "  6. If    they, or either of them, can be carried on satisfactorily, can
the Royal Society suggest any improvement in the form and manner of
doing it   ?
   "  7. Is it    desirable to continue down to the present time the tables of
results   corresponding to the forecasts and storm warnings which were
made out for certain periods in the year 1863, and were presented to Par
liament in April 1864 (Parliamentary Paper, No. 200, Session 1864, in
closed) ? The materials for doing this exist in the Office, and only require
clerical labour.
   " 8. Assuming it       to be desirable to continue the publication of the daily
reports of weather received from various stations, can the Royal Society

308                Correspondence     with the Board   of Trade
make any suggestions as to the extent to which it should           be carried, and
the form in which it should be done ?
   "  9. Have the Royal Society any general suggestions to make as to the
mode, place, or establishment in, at, or by which the duties of the Meteo
rological Department can best be performed ?
   " With   respect to these heads of inquiry, My Lords desire to observe,
in the first place, that they understand that the Admiralty are willing to
undertake,    and to place in the hands of their Hydrographer, all those
observations which can properly be made use of in framing charts for pur

   " The following is an attempt to comply with a request from Mr. Farrer
for some explanation, in a few words, of the method adopted in this De
partment with regard to Forecasts and Storm Warnings — the basis on which
forecasts have been made and cautions given.
   "Admiral FitzRoy has devoted three chapters            (XIII., XIV., XV.) of
his ' Weather Book
                       '
                         to this particular  subject.  I do not think the matter
can be thoroughly comprehended            without reference to those chapters.
The very brief explanation       which follows here must necessarily be most
incomplete.
   " About    ten o'clock   each morning (except Sundays) telegrams are re
ceived here   from  about   eighteen places round our own coasts, from a few
French ports, and from Heligoland. These telegrams report (in cipher,
for brevity) the state of the atmosphere, including pressure, temperature,
wind direction and force, degree of dryness, rainfall, state of sky and sea,
at each station.
   " The   observations thus telegraphed are immediately reduced, or cor
rected, for scale-errors, elevation, and temperature, and are written into
prepared forms.
   " The first copy, with all the telegrams, is passed to the chief of the
department, or the person appointed by him, to be studied for that day's

 1865.]                 on the Meteorological Department.                     809
forecasts.     At eleven, copies of the report, with forecasts,    are sent out to
'The Times' (for second edition), to the 'Shipping Gazette,' and to the
principal afternoon papers.        Copies of the forecasts, only so far as they
relate to weather expected in the Channel and on the French coasts, are
telegraphed to Paris (by special request) for the Ministry of Marine. The
whole   of this work is finished by about half-past eleven, when every one
in the department is free to turn his attention to other duties. Late in
the afternoon telegrams are received from a very few selected stations.
Should it appear necessary (which is now but seldom), in consequence of
this later information, the morning's forecasts are more or less modified,
and copies of the report are sent out for the next morning's early papers.
    " Besides this daily service, occasional storm
                                                        warnings, or cautions, are
sent to our own coasts and to Paris, and, when it appears advisable, also
to Hamburg, Hanover, and Oldenburg, by the request and at the expense
of the Governments of those States.
    "The basis upon which the forecasts and the cautions (which are merely
forecasts symbolized) are founded, may be stated briefly as follows : —
    "They are the result of theory and experience combined. They are not
predictions but opinions, although probably the best opinions that can be
formed    ;  for it is manifest that if we know what is and has been     occurring
around an area several hundred miles in diameter, we are in a better
position to form an opinion respecting the probable weather in a particular
district than any person who has not such facts at command.
    " Considering, with Dove, that there are two constant principal wind-
currents, north-east and south-west, of which the characteristics, especially
with regard to temperature and degree of moisture or dryness, are totally
distinct, all varieties of wind and weather in these latitudes may be traced
to the operation of these two main currents — singly, in combination, or in
antagonism — at times running in parallel lines but in opposite directions,
frequently      superposed,   and   occasionally   meeting  at various  angles  of
incidence.
    "Upon the relative prevalence or failure of either or both of these
currents all conditions of weather appear to depend.
    "It  is clear that changes must begin at some places earlier than at
others  ;   and the observations telegraphed daily to this department from the
outports afford the means of forming a very good opinion respecting the
nature and probable course of such changes.           In a paper of this kind one
or two examples must suffice, although           the various examples that might
be given are numerous, as also are the disturbing causes which must be
taken into account by a Forecaster.
    " Suppose      a  northerly (E.N.E.-N.N.W.) current to have been pre
vailing generally over this country with fine weather ; the barometers at all
 the outports, during the continuance of such weather, will have been
 steady, or slowly rising, nearly uniform, or slightly higher at the northern
 than at the southern stations ; there will have been much evaporation, and

 310                   Correspondence      with the Board    of Trade           [i une,
 the sky will have been comparatively clear and free from cloud, while the
 temperatures, when free from the influence of radiation, will have been
 somewhat below the average.
    " Suppose now the northern barometers rise rapidly above the average,
 while the temperature remains low and the sky clear. This is an indication
 of more wind from       a northern quarter, but probably      without rain.   Should,
 however, the southern        barometers fall at the same time, while the tem
peratures in the south are much higher than in the north, the wind will
probably increase to a gale from a northern quarter, and a sudden chilling
of the atmosphere in the south will           ensue, causing rain.
    "The     first approach    of a southerly     current is usually indicated     by a
diminution      of  pressure (falling barometers)      in the north and  west,  caused
by   a failure   of the polar current    ;  the upper clouds are seen to be passing
from the south, and the temperature increases.
    " Occasionally      a temporary    failure   of both currents takes place.      We
may have very low barometers, but for a day or two little or no wind.
Such a state of things, however, never continues long.              It is then espe
cially necessary     to watch  for  the first  signs of approaching wind.    The first
indication     is usually an increase of pressure in the direction from which
 the  wind   is  coming.    Should the French barometers rise rapidly or stand
(say) an inch higher than in Scotland, the result will be a gale from the
 southward.       Should both the French and the Scotch barometers rise rapidly,
while in Ireland and central England the pressure continues very low, we
may feel sure that both currents are approaching in force, and that the
collision will be violent, causing much rain, and (according to the angle of
incidence) either south-west and north-west gales, or a cyclonic movement,
which experience has shown will probably advance in an easterly or north
easterly direction.       On the other hand, should the increase of pressure be
 gradual and general, the combination of the two currents will be gradual
also, and, though there may be rain, the winds will not be violent.
    " There     are a few grand    rules, which, though not always free from dis
turbing causes, may be considered as generally holding good.
    " 1 st. The essentially distinct characteristics of the two main currents
 should never be forgotten.
    " 2nd. The direction of wind is usually from the place             of high baro
meter towards the region of low barometer.
    "3rd. The force of wind is usually proportional to the differences of
 barometric      pressure, not (as has been asserted by some) to the actual
 pressure.      It matters little how low the barometer may be, if it is equally
low for    a considerable distance around.         In such a case wind cannot follow
 at once, for there is no available supply at hand.
    "4th. It was believed by Admiral FitzRoy that there exists a lateral
transference      of the whole body of atmosphere eastward.
    " Electrical    and auroral occurrences       should be carefully  watched   ;  and
 the influence of high laud, &c., must be borne in mind.

     " There   is another point in connexion with forecasting in which Admiral
  FitzRoy    took  great interest, namely, the frequency with which important
  atmospheric disturbances have been preceded by disturbances on electric
  wires above ground, and also on submarine wires.
     *'
        No argument, or opinion, with regard to the advisability or otherwise
  of the continuance of the present system of forecasting is offered here,
  because none was asked for.        I  may mention, however, that the system,
  though at first objected to at the Paris Observatory, has since been adopted
  at that place, but that nevertheless the London forecasts are still sent
  daily to the French Ministry.of Marine at the request of that department.

                        From General Sabine   to  Mr. Farrer.

     " Sir, — In replying    to your Letter of the 26th of May, the President
  and Council think it may be desirable to advert in the first instance to that
  which has constituted the chief occupation of Admiral FitzRoy's Depart
  ment in the last four or five years, viz., the systematic forecasting of the
  weather by means of telegrams received from stations comprised within a
  certain limited area, and, on occasions of anticipated storms, the giving
  special warnings conveyed by telegraph to the different ports in the United
  Kingdom, and there made known by hoisting certain signals.
     " The system of forecasting which Admiral FitzRoy instituted and pur
 sued has been expressly described by himself as ' an experimental process,'
 based on the knowledge conveyed by telegraph of the actual state of the
 winds and weather and other meteorological phenomena within a specified
 area, and on a comparison of these with the telegrams of the preceding
 days, so as to obtain inferences as to the probable changes in the succeeding
 days.    The proper test of the efficiency and usefulness of such a system of
 cautionary signals at the different ports is to be sought in the measure of
 success which it appears to have attained — always remembering that the
 system under consideration can only be regarded as in its infancy, and that,
 if continued, its improvement, and consequently its importance, may be
 expected to be progressive from year to year.             In Admiral FitzRoy's
 Report    to  the Board   of  Trade  in May  1862,  the    opinions of the ship
masters at several ports in regard to the practical value which they attached
to the storm-signals were given at length.        Of the 56 replies published in
the Appendix of that Report, 46 were decidedly favourable, 3 decidedly
unfavourable, and 7 expressing no decided opinion. A statement so favour
able on the whole, obtained so very shortly after the system had been first
brought into operation, must surely be considered to have fully justified
the Board     of Trade in directing its further prosecution.
    "The return     to the House of Commons, dated April 13th, 1864,         a copy
of which accompanied your letter, presents a comparison of the probable
force of the wind as indicated by the signals in the year commencing

312                   Correspondence     with the Board    of Trade           [June,
April   1st, 1863, and      terminating March 31st, 1864, and its actual state,
as reported in the three days following the exhibition of the signals ; and
Mr. Babington has since been so obliging as to communicate in manuscript
a return having the same object in view for the year April 1st, 1864, to
March 31st, 1865.
   " From the first of these documents, the President and Council learn
(in p. 7) that the whole number of signals which were hoisted at different
places, and of which reports were received, between April 1, 1863, and
March 31, 1864, amounted to 2288; of these the number which proved
correct in respect to the Force of the wind equalling or exceeding • a fresh
gale,' was 1284     ;  in 462 cases the stations were reached by the gale (or a
still stronger wind blew) before the signal was hoisted ; and in 726 within
forty-eight hours after the signal was hoisted.             Hence we may conclude
that (omitting the 96 cases in which the gale occurred between 48 and 72
hours after the signal was hoisted) 1 188 signals, or more than half the
whole number of 2288, were justified by the state of the weather, either
when the telegraphic message reached the station, or within forty-eight
hours afterwards.
    " With   respect to direction of wind in a gale indicated by signal, the
'warnings' are reported to have been much less frequent.                 Of the 402
signals   indicating    direction   as well  as force, 271  agreed, and  131 did not
agree with the real direction of the wind — being a proportion          of about two
correct to one incorrect.
    " The   manuscript     with which Mr. Babington has favoured the Council
since the receipt of your letter of May 26, 1865, contains a summary of
the cautionary signals between April 1, 1864, and March 31, 1865, with
notes stating their success or failure.          From these it appears that signals
were hoisted    on    40 days   in the  course  of  the year, 29 of which appear to
have been justified by the event, 8 to have been failures either in respect
to force or direction, and 3 were late, the gale having already commenced.
There    are also 5 cases    in which it is admitted that signals might have been
made with advantage when none were sent.
    "It   seems not unreasonable to attribute           to increased experience the
marked improvement           of these results upon those of the preceding year, and
to anticipate still further improvement.
    " The method adopted in preparing            the storm-warnings    has been very
ably and lucidly explained by Mr. Babington in a paper dated May 11,
 1865, presented by him to Mr. Farrer, by whom a copy has been sent to
the President and Council.           Possibly it may be viewed as the best arrange
ment that this branch          of the duties of the office shonld continue      as at
present under the direction of Mr. Babington, by whom it has been virtually
carried on for several months past.
    " On the subject of storms of a cyclonic character originating in the
 British Islands or in their vicinity, the interest of which was adverted to
in the reply from the Rx,yal Society to the Board of Trade, March 27, 1863,

 1865.]                 on the Meteorological Department.                          313
 reference has been made to       Mr. Babington for such further information         as
 may have been subsequently obtained.             His reply to General Sabine is     as
 follows : —
    "'I    can quite confirm your impression respecting Admiral FitzRoy's
 belief in the evidence of the existence of small cyclonic storms in England
 itself, originating in or near our islands, and generated in the brushing
 against each other of the       N.E.  and   S.W. currents    ; and in reply to your
 question    I beg to say that I believe there is satisfactory evidence of the
 existence of such storms, but that these small storms are not very frequent —
 three or four in a year perhaps — and that they are, I think, more common
 in summer than in winter, although usually of less violence. The direction
 of their motion is certainly almost invariably towards some point between
 N.N.E. and E.S.E. With regard to the rapidity of their motion, I scarcely
 feel able to express an opinion ; but at the ordinary rate of progression it
 takes such a storm about forty-eight hours to pass from Ireland to the
 Baltic.     Not unfrequently, however, they appear to die out (as it were)
 before travelling so far.'
    " The existence of such storms in our islands is a fact in meteorological
 science of considerable interest, for which we are indebted to the researches
 instituted and carried on by Admiral FitzKoy's department.                Though not
 of very frequent occurrence, they constitute a class of phenomena well
 suited for telegraphic advertisement, especially on our eastern and north
 eastern coasts.    It might    perhaps be practically desirable to indicate them
 by a special signal, distinguishing them from storms which have a more
uniform direction.       But however this may be, it seems to be desirable that
the occurrence of such storms and their attendant phenomena, as obtainable
at the time, should be carefully recorded, with a view to the records being
ultimately put together in elucidation of a branch of the meteorology of
our islands which has hitherto been but imperfectly examined.
    "We     proceed to notice the poiuts on which we are informed that the
Board of Trade especially desire the opinion of the Royal Society — and
particularly the inquiry whether the objects specified in the Royal Society's
letter  of the 22nd of February 1855     are  still viewed as of the same importance
for the interests of science and navigation as they were then considered.
    " The most prominent amongst these objects was the collection and co
ordination of meteorological observations made at sea, including such as
are required to form a correct knowledge of the currents of the ocean, their
direction, extent, velocity, and the temperature of the surface water rela
tively to the ordinary ocean temperature in the same latitude, together
with the variations in all these respects which currents experience in dif
ferent parts of the year and in different parts of their course.            These — as
well as the facts connected with the great barometric elevations and depres
sions which we know to exist in several oceanic localities, and their influence
on circumstances      affecting  navigation  — were noticed      as inquiries well de

314                Correspondence    with the Board   of Trade            [June,
serving the attention of a country possessing such extensive maritime faci
lities and interests as ours, and as forming a suitable contribution on our
part to the general system of meteorological inquiry which had been adopted
by the principal continental states in Europe and America.
   " We                 Mr. Babington that much was done by Admiral
           have learnt from
FitzRoy in the three or four years succeeding the establishment of his
office (and before the subject of storm-warnings had engrossed the greater
part of his consideration), in directing the attention of many of the com
manders of our merchant ships to the collection of suitable data, and in
improving their habits of observation and of record.      The logs of such
vessels form at present a large collectionof documents existing in the Office
of the Board of Trade, partially examined, and their contents partially
classified. The President and Council are glad to learn by your letter that
the further prosecution of this great and important branch of Hydrography
is about to be placed in the hands of the distinguished officer who now
presides over the Hydrographic Department of the Admiralty ; to whose
duties it appears indeed most appropriately to belong, and to whose office
no doubt the documents already collected will be transferred and made
available for public purposes.
  " There  remain, therefore, to be noticed solely the considerations which
relate to 'Meteorology proper,' t. e. to the Land Meteorology of the
British Islands.   We find that the principal States of the European con
tinent have almost without exception formed establishments for the collec
tion and publication periodically of the meteorology of their respective
countries.   The arrangements consist usually of a central office, at which
instruments and instructions are provided for a number of stations, greater
or less, according to the area which they represent ; at which stations ob
servations are made and transmitted     to the central office, where the results
of all   are reduced, coordinated,and published.   The small extent of the
area comprised by the  British Islands in comparison with the territories of
many of the European States, may require fewer stations ; but in a matter
now so generally attended to and provided for, it seems scarcely fitting
that our country should be behind others.     There     is,
                                                      moreover,     peculia
                                                                      a
rity in the meteorological position of the British Islands in respect to
Europe generally as its north-western outpost, in consequence of which an
especial duty appears to devolve upon us.    M. Matteucci, in very recent
                                                                  a
publication, has already made the important remark that extensive atmo
spheric disturbances which first invade Ireland and England are those
which, in winter more especially, extend to and pass the Alps (although
somewhat retarded    them), and spread over Italy — and thus that, though
                      by
receiving telegrams announcing storms taking place in the North of
Europe, in Germany, on the western coasts of France, and of those of
Spain, he finds that has in fact been most especially in the case of
                        it
announcements from England that storms so telegraphed have actually

  1865.]                 on the Meteorological Department.                     315
  reached Italy,     and been    found   to correspond   with the accounts subse
  quently received from Italian Mediterranean ports.
      " A few stations, — say six, distributed at nearly equal distances in a
  meridional direction from the south of England to the north of Scotland,
  furnished with self-recording instruments supplied from and duly verified
  at one of the stations regarded as a central station, and exhibiting a con
  tinuous record of the temperature, pressure, electric, and hygrometric state
  of the atmosphere, and of the force and direction of the wind — might
  perhaps be sufficient to supply authoritative knowledge of those peculia
  rities in the meteorology of our country which would be viewed as of
  the most importance to other countries, and would at the same time form
  authentic points of reference for the use of our own meteorologists.         The
  scientific progress of meteorology from this time forward requires indeed
  such continuous records, first, for the sake of the knowledge which they
  alone can effectively supply, and next, for comparison with the results of
 independent observation not continuous.          The actual photograms, or other
 mechanical      representations, transmitted weekly by post to the central
 station would constitute a lithographed page for each day in the year, com
 prehending the phenomena at all the six stations, each separate curve
 admitting of exact measurement from its own base-line, the precise value
 of which might in every case be specified.
      " The President and Council suggest that the Observatory of the British
 Association at Kew might, with much propriety and public advantage, be
 adopted as the central        meteorological station.    It already possesses the
 principal self-recording     instruments, and the greater part of them have
 been in constant use there for many months.            There will be no difficulty
 in obtaining, through the      intervention  of the  Committee of Management,
 similar instruments for the affiliated meteorological stations, and in arrang
 ing for their verification and comparison with the Kew standards, as well as
 in giving to those in whose hands they may be placed such instructions as
 may ensure uniformity of operation.          The records from the other stations
 may be received at Kew by post weekly, or more frequently if required, and
may be at once arranged for such form of publication as may be most
approved.        It seems expedient that, if practicable, the stations which
should be selected to act in concert and cooperation with Kew should be
in localities where     some   permanent establishment of a scientific character
exists, and where a certain amount of supervision may be secured.               In
this view the President and Council would suggest, as eligible, the follow

    "To     these six stations the President and Council would have been very
glad to have added two others, one in the south-west and one in the north
west of Ireland.         For the former of these, possibly Valentia may present
a  fitting locality, when an establishment shall have been formed there as
the connecting link, by means of the Atlantic Telegraph between Europe
and America.
    " Having      answered thus generally, it may perhaps be desirable to add
specific replies on the several points enumerated in Questions 1 to 9.
Preserving the order in which the inquiries are made, the replies are as
follows    :—
    "  Question    1. The President and Council are of opinion that the objects
           specified in the Royal Society's letter of February 22, 1855, are as
          important for the interests of science and navigation as they were
          then considered.
    "  Question 2. — Much has without doubt been accomplished in the col
          lection of facts bearing on Marine Meteorology, but as no syste
          matic publication of the results has yet been made, the President
          and Council are unable to reply more specifically.
   "   Question 3. — The President and Council recommend that the Sea
          Observations     should be placed in the hands of the Hydrographer,
          with a view to the introduction of the results into the Admiralty
          Charts.      They, however, at present have not sufficient information
          on the subject of the Land Observations which may exist in the
          office of the Board of Trade to justify them in offering any recom
          mendation thereon.
    "  Question 4. — The President and Council consider it very desirable
          that further observations should be made, especially with reference
          to oceanic currents and great barometric depressions, and generally
          on all subjects comprehended under the denomination of ' Ocean
          Statistics.'
   "   Questions 5 & 6. — It appears from the late Admiral FitzRoy's reports,
          as well as from the explanations of Mr. Babington, that the storm-
          warnings have been based on inferences drawn from observations
          extending over a considerable area ; and the President and Council
          recommend that they should be continued under the superin
          tendence     of that gentleman.     Respecting  the  daily forecasts of
          weather, however, they decline expressing any opinion.
    "  Question 7. — The President and Council are of opinion that it would
          be desirable that an annual report in a modified form should be
          made to the Board of Trade of the results from the storm-warnings
          in the preceding year, and should be communicated to Parliament,
          and thereby become known to the public.

          tion and ipvolve considerations which would occasion an incon

          to the mode in which it appears to them that the important subject
          of ' Meteorology Proper,' or the ' Land    Meteorology     of the British

                              dated June \2th, 1865.
                                                                          " Berlin.
    " My    views respecting the way in which meteorological communications
 may be made available for practical use in storm-warnings are in general
 accordance with the methods followed in England ; yet I acknowledge that I
 do not trust myself to announce daily probabilities, at least with the but
limited communications which reach me telegraphically.                 My investi
gations in regard to storms have hitherto had relation to great atmospheric
 disturbances in autumn and winter, hardly at all to the storms of summer,
in which the derangements of atmospheric equilibrium are much more
local, and therefore the limits of the region overspread by the storm much
narrower.      This is particularly true of the storms of the Baltic.        There,
relative barometric minima occur, which seem to be cut off as it were towards
 the south.      Probably the upper equatorial current first comes down in
those high latitudes, breaking into the locally warm moist air, and occa
sioning a north-west wind at the south end of the Scandinavian mountain
 ranges, over the Kattegat and the lowlands of Denmark.              Yet it is pro
bable that these disturbances are less local than they may seem to the in
 habitants of Western Europe, for they extend into the interior of Russia,
and may become more intelligible when viewed in combination with tele
graphically communicated data from Russia.          All   this must be studied      if
too hasty conclusions are to be avoided.
    " We have introduced the English warning-signals         into our Baltic ports.
We    leave to authorities  at the ports who are conversant with the subject
a discretionary power of showing warnings, in so far as they may be able to
form a judgment from the telegrams which we send them of our observations
here, and the general appearance of the sky, &c., viewed in connexion
with the whole local character of the weather ; but it is imperative on
them to hoist a signal when an actual storm-warning is telegraphed from
Berlin.     I wished to introduce the system gradually.          I consulted with
Kupffer, who had similar views. His death is a new misfortune, following
so shortly the loss of Admiral FitzRoy,      to whom    I  owed great thanks      for
                                                                   2 a  2

 318                           Letter   of Professor Dove                            [June
 much     kindness.      Also   I  had concerted      with Kupffer and Plantamour
 for attending the Swiss Scientific Meeting at Geneva at the end of August,
 and inviting the heads of the different systems of observation to assemble
 there, and consult in common as to the best modes of treatment, commu
 nication, and publication.          This must, no doubt, now stand over. As to
 the data to be communicated, it is no doubt right to give, as now, the
 height of the barometer at the moment the telegram is despatched ; but                   I
 think it would be desirable to add a sign indicating whether the barometer
 is rising or falling.       The cotemporaneous temperature is in many cases
 desirable, and thus I think that this communication might be so arranged
 that   some scientific    result could be based thereon.          If  the maximum and
 minimum       of the preceding day had heretofore been telegraphed, we should
 have gained six or seven years' materials for enabling us to judge whether the
 day of the telegram was a relatively warm or cold one. The same hour has
 in the diurnal variation       a very different meaning in different parts of the
 year ;   and   in the  summer    months it is difficult to draw any definite conclu
 sions from the temperatures at seven or eight o'clock.                   It seems to me,
 moreover, that in the present modes too little consideration is given to first
 laying down what it is desired to obtain.              For England, for instance, the
 reduction of the barometer to the level of the sea is not difficult ; but yet
 there are many land-stations in which one does not know whether this
 reduction      has been made or not.        Advances     in meteorology are based on
long-continued labours :         we seem now to want to take it by storm ; this
 may dazzle the public, but the results need control            if  they are to be recog
 nized as really such.
    " The idea that all storms are cyclones is indeed given up by most, and               I
have lately been taking some pains to contribute thereto.                   The introduc
                         '            '
tion of the word cyclonoid              means nothing more than that for a given
case   it is wished to leave the matter undecided.            It is a retrograde step.
    " I have read with great interest the paper headed ' Forecasts and
             '
Cautions        kindly sent to me. It seems to me very suitable to the desired
end.      I cannot    recognize any connexion with electrical currents ;          I cannot
discern any proper bases for doing so.
    " For meteorology itself, I should deem it extremely advantageous if,
as  you contemplate, the immediate data of observation in England were
placed under a common guidance such as that of the Kew Observatory.
The British Association does indeed represent in the freest and most inde
pendent manner scientific Great Britain as a whole.                    I do not certainly
recognize what the          British   and   Scottish Meteorological Societies have
supplied      in  this  direction  ;  but  an  accordant mode of publication and
treatment would still give quite other results.               So, for example, in the
monthly       communications      the   notice  of  the  barometric extremes of the
month with the indispensable mention of the date of their occurrence is
wanting.        These are the very things by means of which              it is possible  to
examine profitably the particular phenomena of a storm.

In  regard to telegraphic communications, Admiral FitzRoy once said to me
that reports from Eastern Europe were of little interest for England. This
may be granted where it is question of the storms which assail the English
and Irish coasts themselves.          But the commerce of the Baltic is for the
greater part in the hands of Englishmen, and I think that it would there
fore be conducive to English interests also if the efforts were facilitated
which are made by others to lessen the dangers to shipping in the Baltic.
As it is precisely north-west storms which are the most dangerous in that
sea, communications       from England are wanted for this.             Among the
numerous telegraphic communications received here daily, there are none
from England.        Would it not be possible to arrange an exchange, if only
for one or two stations ? The communication might be made through
Tonningen, by the cable, so as to avoid the German-Austrian Telegraph
Company, which declines to afford a gratuitous passage for our messages.

I. "    Description of a Rigid Spectroscope, constructed to ascertain
        whether the Position of the known and well-defined Lines of
        a    Spectrum is constant while the Coefficient of Terrestrial
        Gravity under which the Observations are taken is made to
        vary."     By  J. P. Gassiot,    V.P.R.S.      Received May 18, 1865.
    Shortly after my large spectroscope * had been removed to Kew Ob
servatory, Mr. Stewart mentioned to me that he had had some con
 versation with Professor Tait of Edinburgh, as to the practicability of
having a spectroscope constructed so as to preclude all errors of observa
 tions arising from a displacement of the prisms or the shifting of any of
the fixed portions of the apparatus.
    The particular object Mr. Tait and Mr. Stewart had in view, was the de
termining whether the positions of the known and well-defined lines of the
spectrum are constant while the coefficient of terrestrial gravity, under
which the observations are taken, is made to vary, Mr. Stewart consider
ing that, provided an instrument could be constructed so rigid in all its
parts as to preclude all possibility of error, the observations                 might be
made in balloon ascents, varying from two to four miles.
    I consulted   with Mr. Browning as to the practicability of constructing
the spectroscope.      He considered such an instrument could be made, with
sufficient rigidity in all its parts, to examine with great accuracy any given
portion of the spectrum which might be selected, and for which the prisms
would have to be adjusted and fixed.          I communicated with Mr. Coxwell
relative to the balloon ascents which would be required, and then deter
mined on having the spectroscope constructed.
    On testing the alteration in the position of the lines arising from change
of temperature, it was soon ascertained that the difficulty of constructing
a truly rigid spectroscope was far greater than had been anticipated.
    By the description of the apparatus, it will      be seen that
the prisms are arranged so as to bring the D-lines into the
centre of the field of view {fig. in margin), with a few of the
fainter lines on each side ; a perpendicular fixed line, and

    The observations having been originally intended to be made in balloon
ascents, the construction of the spectroscope had necessarily to be con
sidered in reference to some portable and easily manageable form, and it
was particularly desirable that its weight should be as low as possible.
These conditions      were obtained    by constructing and mounting it in a
T-shaped frame of gun-metal : in this manner the instrument was com
pleted so as to weigh little more than 40 lbs. ; but on carefully examining
the readings day by day in Mr. Browning's workshop, the errors arising

 from changes in the temperature were ascertained to be so variable that no
 reliable result could have been obtained.
    These    preliminary observations were nevertheless so far valuable, for
 they proved that changes of temperature were taken up very slowly by the
 prisms, and that it would be consequently useless to employ the instrument
 in balloon ascents where rapid fluctuations of temperature would continu-
-ally occur.
     I then determined to attempt the construction of a rigid spectroscope
 with which observations might be made either on board a vessel or on
 land, in various latitudes ; and as the question of the total weight of the
 apparatus became no longer of paramount importance, Mr. Browning de
 cided on mounting the instrument in cast iron. The adjustments of the
 telescope being dispensed with, it was mounted in two cast-iron blocks, and
 fixed on a bed of slate    ; the prisms, with their adjustments, were attached
 to an iron plate, the plate being bolted to the same slate-bed.               In this
 arrangement     the  observations   still  showed   discrepancies, which  were  con
 sidered to arise from changes in the adjustments of the prisms, produced
 by alterations    of temperature.       Mr. Browning then removed all the ad
justments     of the prisms,   and  also   the iron bed-plate, bolting the prisms on
 the bed of slate, and securing their correct position by filing and scraping.
 Full particulars of this arrangement will         be found in the description of the
 apparatus.
    The instrument has been carefully examined by Mr. Stewart, not only
 at Kew Observatory but also from time to time during the progress of its
 construction, as well as after it was completed in Mr. Browning's work
 shops ; and it may now be considered that, with ordinary care during its
 transit from place to place, any observations made with it can be depended
 on as far as the mechanical arrangement is concerned.
    I  am indebted to Mr. Browning for the description of the apparatus,
with the notes of the readings as they were made by himself.
    The optical arrangement is as follows : — In order to obtain great re
 fractive power in a moderate compass, the prisms were arranged as in
Plate VI. fig. 1. P and P' represent two prisms of heavy flint glass, having
sides    1\ inches high, and     3 inches long.        These prisms have refracting
angles    of 45°.    They  are  arranged     at the minimum    angle of deviation for
Fraunhofer's line D. R represents a prism of similar material and dimen
sions, but with a refracting angle of 22° 30', that is half P and P'.
    The dense flint glass of which these prisms are composed was made by
Messrs. Chance Brothers and Co. It has a specific gravity of 3-9. Its
mean refractive index is 1-G65, and its dispersive power 0-0752.                  The
prism R has the side further from P and P' silvered.              The nearest side is
placed at the same minimum angle of deviation from P as P is from P'.
    D and D' represent a compound prism, formed by cementing a very small
 diagonal prism D' on to a large diagonal prism D with a transparent
 cement, in such a manner that two of the plane surfaces are parallel. They

Owing- to the power of the instrument, only         very small portion of the

spectrum  can be  seen at once  in  the field of view.  The reflecting prism
R    is,
      however, provided with      tangent screw motion, which affords the
                                            a
means of bringing any portion of the spectrum into the field of view that
it may be desired to examine.
   Although having to contend with several disadvantages on the score of
reflexions not made use of    spectroscopes of the ordinary construction,
                                       in
and which of course cause loss                  of light and tend to deteriorate the defi
nition, yet   it    will, I   think,    be      admitted that the performance of the in
strument    is    satisfactory.

servatory, although that instrument has nine prisms.    The prisms of that
spectroscope   are, however, but little more than half the size of those in
the rigid instrument   now described.     It is to the large size of the
prisms, and the greater aperture and focal length of the object-glass, that
the superior performance of this instrument must be attributed.
    The temperature of the air and of the prisms is thus observed : — A
third prism (T P, fig. 3), exactly similar to P and P', is mounted on the slate
 block. This prism has a hole about £ an inch diameter and \\ inch deep
drilled in it vertically. A thermometer (Plate VI. T, fig. 3) with a fine
cylindrical bulb is inserted in this hole, the intervening space being packed
tight with copper filings.    The upper part is covered with a layer of fused
shell-lac. That the half prism may be about the same temperature as the
whole prisms, another half is cemented to it.     To avoid confusion, this half
is not represented in the diagrams.       The thermometer, after leaving the
prism, is bent  at right angles, and is carried across the top of the prisms on
a light metal frame.    Another thermometer (T', fig. 3), whose bulb is in the
air, its object being to denote the temperature of the air around the prisms,
runs parallel with that just described.   Both the prisms and thermometers
are enclosed under a metal cover, for the purpose of equalizing the tempe
rature                    them from injury.
             and protecting                  This cover has a long slip of
stout plate-glass let into the upper part of          it,
                                              through which the thermo
meters can be seen, and their readings observed.     The micrometer eye
piece and the cell containing the object-glass are each mounted on distinct
iron blocks. The body of the telescope which fills up the intervening space
is  mounted on two separate iron blocks not connected with those just
mentioned.   The tube which forms the body overlaps at one end the tube
of the eyepiece, and at the other the mounting of the object-glass, but
without being in contact with either. By this means the change of length
in the body-tube, produced      change of temperature, by far the most con
                                       by

to endeavour to determine     the temperature corrections which it will be
necessary  to apply to the results  obtained by the instrument, and also to
find if the line resumed its position exactly after the instrument had been
subjected to considerable changes of temperature, or carried from place to
place.    From Tables        III.
                           and IV. it may be noted that the readings have
a constant downward tendency.     To endeavour to account for this retro
gression,    I
             can only venture to hazard the suggestion that the index of
refraction       of the glass of which the prisms         made may be slightly
                                                                  are
varying from          some   change due to annealing not having yet been entirely
completed.
  Although    showing generally a downward tendency, the decline is not
quite uniform, and there are some apparent discrepancies in the readings ;
these may be errors of observation, arising principally from differences of
intensity in the source of illumination. Such differences tend to alter the
width of the bright line observed ; and as one of its edges is taken for the
point of measurement, the position of the line is apparently changed.
Mr. Stewart is, however, of opinion that these variations are so slight that
they will not be likely to interfere with the instrument being used for the
purpose for which it was designed.

    On the 5th of May the spectroscope was removed to the rooms of the
 Royal Society, Burlington House, where it still remains.
     The result of observing under a varied temperature of 40° Fahr.,
 the carrying of the instrument from the Minories to Kew Observatory, and
subsequently to the Royal Society, without affecting the readings, may be
taken as evidence that with ordinary care the spectroscope can now be
used with reliance as to the rigidity of its construction, thus fulfilling the
conditions which are indispensable for obtaining correct observations.
     It will  be observed that        it was my intention to have made arrange
ments with Mr. Coxwell            for   the observations being made with his bal
loon, but the weight of the entire apparatus (approaching two hundred
weight), and still more the difficulty of obtaining a uniform temperature
throughout the prisms, renders observing in this manner very difficult, if
not impracticable ;      I  therefore suggested to Mr. Stewart that, if the ob
servations were made in different latitudes, the object sought would be
obtained in a more satisfactory manner.
   The best, and probably the most satisfactory mode of observing, would
be to obtain the sanction of the Admiralty to allow the spectroscope
                                                                                    to be

placed on board one of Her. Majesty's vessels about visiting
tudes ; continued observations could then be             made,   and the   result thereof
from time to time forwarded to Kew Observatory.
    Mr. Stewart writes me, that to this time it has been assumed, without
proof, that the change of the coefficient
                                                    of terrestrial gravity does not in
itself alter any other coefficient of a body ; and if a reason is asked,
none can be given, since gravity is a force of the nature of which men of
science are confessedly ignorant, and that it would therefore be very desir
able that experiments should be undertaken with the view of setting this
matter at rest.
    It is to determine this, as far as the index of refraction is concerned, that
the spectroscope I have described has been constructed, and the assistance
of the President and Council of the Royal Society will be asked, in order
that the observations may        be made     with this apparatus by some trustworthy
observer, on board any of Her Majesty's ships, from oue point to another
 of the earth's surface.

II. "A    Description of some Fossil Plants, showing structure, found
       in the Lower Coal-seams of Lancashire and Yorkshire."                        By
      E. W. Binney, F.R.S.             Received May 12, 1865.
                                       (Abstract.)
    The author stated that, although great attention has been devoted to the
collection of the fossil remains of plants with which our coal-fields abound,
the specimens are generally in very fragmentary and distorted conditions
as they occur imbedded in the rocks in which they are entombed ; but
when they have been removed, cut into shape, and trimmed, and are seen
in cabinets, they are in a far worse condition.           This is as to their external
forms and characters.        When we come to examine their internal structure,
and ascertain their true nature, we find still greater difficulties, from the
rarity of specimens displaying both the external form and the internal
structure of the original plant.          It is often very difficult to decide which
is the outside,    different  parts of the stem dividing and exposing varied
surfaces which have been described as distinct genera of plants.
    The specimens described were collected by the author himself, and
taken out of the seams of coal, just as they occurred in the matrix in which
they were found imbedded, by his own hands.                This has enabled him to
speak with certainty      as to the condition       and locality in which they were
met with.
    By the ingenuity of the late Mr. Nicol of Edinburgh, we were furnished
with a beautiful method of slicing specimens of fossil-wood so as to examine
their internal structure.        The late Mr. Witham, assisted by Mr. Nicol,
first applied this successfully, and his work on the internal structure of
fossil vegetables was published in 1833.            In describing his specimens, he
notices one which he designated Anabathra pulcherrima.                 This did not do
much more      than afford evidence of the internal vascular cylinder arranged
in radiating series, somewhat similar to that described by Messrs. Lindley
and Hutton as occurring in Stigmaria ficoides, in the third volume of the
 ' Fossil Flora.'
    In 1839 M. Adolphe Brongniart published his truly valuable memoir,
" Observations    sur la structure interieure du Sigillaria        elegans comparee h
celle des Lepidodendron       et  des  Stigmaria    et a celle des vege-taux vivants,"
in the Archives du Muse-um d'Histoire Naturelle. His specimen of
Sigillaria eleyans was in very perfect preservation, and showed its external
characters    and internal structure       in every portion except the pith and
a broad part of the plant intervening betwixt the internal and external
radiating cylinders.      Up to this time nothing had been seen at all to be
compared to M. Brongniart' s specimen, and no person could have been
better selected to describe and illustrate it.           His memoir will always be
considered as one of the most         valuable   ever  contributed  on the fossil flora
of the Carboniferous period.

328         On Fossil Plants from    the  Coal of Lancashire,  fyc.    [June 15,
    In   1849, August     Joseph Corda published his 'Beitrage zur Flora
der Vorwelt,' a work of great labour and research.       Amongst his numerous
specimens, he describes and illustrates one of Diploxylon cycadeoideum,
which, although not to be compared to M. Brongniart's specimen, still
affords us valuable information, confirming some of that author's views
rather than affording much more original information.              All these last
                                             '
three specimens M. Brongniart, in his          Tableau de vegetaux fossiles con-
siderees sous le point de vue de leur classification botanique et de leur dis
tribution geologique,' published in 1847, classes as Dicotyledones gymno-
tpermes under the family of Sigillarees ; amongst other plants his Sigil-
laria elegans, Mr. Witham's Anabathra, and Corda's Diploxylon.
    In 1862 the author published, in the 'Quarterly Journal of the Geolo
                '
gical Society     of that year, an account of specimens which confirmed the
views of the three learned authors above named as to Sigillaria and
Diploxylon being allied plants ; but showed that their supposed pith or
central axis was not composed of cellular tissue, but of different sized
vessels arranged without order, having their sides barred by transverse
striae like the internal vascular cylinders of Sigillaria and Lepidodendron.
These specimens were in very perfect preservation, and showed the ex
ternal as well as the internal characters of the plants.
    All   the above specimens were of comparatively small size, with the
exception of that described by Mr. Corda, which, although it showed the
external characters in a decorticated state, did not exhibit any outward
resemblance to a plant allied to Sigillaria with large ribs and deep furrows so
commonly met with in our coal-fields, but rather to plants allied to        Sigil
 laria elegans and Lepidodendron.
    In  the present communication the author has described some specimens of
larger size than those previously alluded to, and endeavoured to show that
the Sigillaria vascularis with rhomboidal scars gradually passes as it grows
older into ribbed and furrowed Sigillaria,      and that this singular plant not
only    possesses  two woody    cylinders  arranged in radiating series, an in
ternal and an external one divided by a zone of cellular tissue, both increas
ing on their outsides at the same time, but likewise has a central axis
 composed of hexagonal vessels, arranged without order, having all their
 sides marked with transverse striae. Evidence is also adduced to show
 that  Sigillaria dichotomizes in its branches something like Lepidodendron,
 and that, like the latter plant, a Lepidostrobus is its fructification. The
 outer cylinder in large Sigillaria is composed of thick-walled quadran
 gular tubes or utricles arranged in radiating series, and exhibiting every
 appearance of having been as hard-wooded a tree as Pinites, but as yet no
 disks or striae have been observed on the walls of the tubes. Stigmaria is
 now so generally considered to be the root of Sigillaria, that it is scarcely
 necessary to bring any further proof of this proposition ; but specimens
 are described which prove by similarity of structure that the former is
 the root of the latter.

      The chief specimens described in the memoir are eight in number, and
  were found in the lower divisions of the Lancashire and Yorkshire coal-
  measures imbedded in calcareous nodules occurring in seams of coal.
      No. 1, Diploxylon cycadoideum, was from the first-named district, and
  the same locality as the Trigonocarpon, described by Dr. J. D. Hooker,
  F.R.S., and the author, in          a memoir on the structure      of certain limestone
  nodules inclosed in seams of bituminous coal, with a description of some
   Trigonocarpons contained therein*, and the other seven (Sigillaria vascu
  laris) were from the same seam of coal in the lower coal-measures in which
  the specimens described in a paper entitled " On some Fossil Plants showing
  structure from the Lower Coal-measures of Lancashire                "f,  were met with,
  but from    a different    locality in Yorkshire.

  the connexion of the binomial theorems given in my first paper on this sub

  to   expand/ (x+x-^S iu terms of—, which will                be sufficient   to indicate

            dx
 by Professor Boole in the paper I have just mentioned.                  The main object
 of the present paper, therefore, will be to ascertain that part of the expan

   In  a Memoir published in the Philosophical Transactions for the year!855,
 I applied the Theory of Definite Integrals to the summation of many intri
cate series.    I   have thought my researches on this subject might well be
terminated by the following paper, in which I have pointed out methods
for the summation of series of a far more complicated nature.
    I commence      with   some    remarks      intended    to give clear conceptions      of
the general method       of calculation.
    In any series,

Where a is    less than      unity, it is evident that we can sum the series by              a
definite integral when       ux=fdu    V1 Ux, U, and U being functions of a, and
the integral being taken between certain assigned limits.                     For it is mani
fest that the quantity under the integral sign then becomes a geometrical
progression.
    Again, for  a   similar reason    we can express by a definite integral the          sum
of the series
                           . . . + au^tc,    . . .  + a'n,»,ir, . . .  + &c.

where

Lastly,   we can sum the series

 VI. " Some       Observations on Birds, chiefly in relation to their Tem
       perature, with Supplementary Additions."            By John Davy, M.D.
        F.R.S., &c.      Received May 26, 1865.
                                     (Abstract.)
    This paper consists of four parts     :
    In  part first the author gives the results of his observations on the tem
 perature of the common fowl (as many as sixty-two), made at different seasons
 of the year, showing that the temperature of this bird ranges from 107° to
  109°Fahr. in recto; that that of the male is a little higher than that of
 the female, and of both, higher in summer than in winter.
    He states that he was induced to pay so much attention to the tempera
 ture of the common fowl, from Mr. Hunter having assigned it a temperature
 no higher than between 1 03° and 1 04°, a degree reached by some of the
 mammalia, and even exceeded.
    The  second part contains the results   of the author's experiments on the air
 expired by a certain number of birds, and on the air contained in their air-
 receptacles and bones.       They are introduced with some observations on the
 length of time birds are capable of retaining life under water, from which it
 appears that it differs greatly in different species, varying from ten minutes,
 as in the instance of the duck, to half a minute, as in the instance of the
 owl.
    From the analysis of the air expired in the act of drowning, it would ap
 pear that there is a certain loss of carbonic acid, equivalent to the propor
 tion of oxygen less than exists in the atmospheric air expired, — a loss, it is
 inferred, owing to absorption by the blood of the gas which has disappeared,
 as indeed is indicated by the darkness of colour of this fluid, and confirmed
 by the effects   of exhaustion by the air-pump.
    A  deficiency, too, of carbonic acid was found in the air     of the air-recep

 338             Dr. Davy on the Temperature      t$c. of Birds.      [June 15,
 tacles and in the air contained      in the hones, attributable    to the same
 cause.
     Of the third part, the subject is pulmonary and cutaneous aqueous exhala
 tion.    From the facts brought forward, and the experiments described, there
 appears to be proof afforded that birds perspire little and cool slowly, and
 consequently that their high temperature is partly owing to these two cir
 cumstances — the one (the latter) attributable to their clothing of feathers,
 the other (the former) to the little vascularity of their cutis.
    The subject of the fourth part is the kidneys and their excretion. As these
 organs are proportionally large in birds, and as their excretion is very much
less liquid than that of the mammalia, it is presumed that, from its carrying
 off less heat, it may be considered an element in the problem of the high
 temperature of birds, and that as the compound excreted is chiefly urate of
ammonia, it may conduce to a less expenditure of oxygen than if urea were
a constituent of their urine.
    In conclusion the author suggests that the high temperature for which
most birds are remarkable (not all, there being certain exceptions) may be
due to a combination      of circumstances, some positive, some negative, — the
positive chiefly the conversion of oxygen into carbonic acid, the negative
those conditions     influential mainly by economizing the heat produced or
checking     its escape.   Further, it is conjectured that there may be other
ancillary conditions, such as a powerful heart ensuring a rapid circulation, the
peculiar structure of the blood-corpuscles, and the little viscidity of the
blood of birds.
    Some remarks are added on the pneumatic system of birds, so distinctive
of their class, with conjectures on its uses, these in part obscure and seem
ing to require further research for their elucidation.
    The supplementary additions are given chiefly in a tabulated form, of
which there are five :
    The first contains a list of birds examined, altogether 64, of which
number 22 were found to have air in some of their bones, and 42 to be
without air in them.
    In the second the weight of a certain number of species is given (39),
and the weight of their feathers, and in most instances of their bones.
    In the third the weight of the principal bones of a selected number of
species (27) is stated.
    In the fourth the composition of some of the bones, as determined         by
calcination .
    And in the fifth the weight of the principal organs of five species.
    With    the exception of the last, some brief remarks are appended to each
Table.

        Balfour      Stewart, M.A., F.R.S., and P. G. Tait, M.A.                      Re
        ceived June 1, 1865.
     1. The authors were led, by certain views which they entertain regarding
the loss of energy by a body, to make experiments in order to test these
views, and about the end of 1863 they obtained results in air, which encou
raged them to have constructed an apparatus wherewith to procure rotation
in vacuo.
     2. The apparatus for this purpose was devised and executed by Mr.
Beckley, mechanician at the Kew Observatory, at which place the experi
ments about to be described were made.               In this apparatus a slowly revol
ving shaft is carried up through a barometer tube, having at its top the
receiver which it is wished to exhaust.              When the exhaustion has taken
place, it is evident that this shaft will revolve in mercury.             In the receiver
the shaft    is connected   with  a train  of toothed wheels, and ultimately causes
a circular disk to revolve 125 times for each revolution of the shaft.                The
 disks used have a diameter of 13 inches, and their plane is vertical.               Two
insulated    wires,  connected   with  a  Thomson's      reflecting galvanometer, are
carried through two holes in the bed-plate of the receiver, and are then
connected with a thermo-electric            pile, having the usual reflecting cone
attached to it.       The outside of the pile, and of its attached cone, is wrapped
round with wadding and cloth, so as to be entirely out of the reach of cur
rents of air.       The vacuum-gauge is on the siphon principle ; it was con
 structed by P. Adie, and there is every reason to believe that it is perfectly
 deprived of air.       The following figure will render the arrangements clear :
                                                           A B=    6  inches.

   3. The deflection     of the galvanometer-needle, produced by heating the
pile, is recorded by means of a small mirror attached to the needle, which,
as it moves, causes the reflected image of a line of light to travel over a
graduated scale. The galvanometer-needle is rendered very nearly astatic
by means of an auxiliary magnet ; and this arrangement can be made so
sensitive that if the temperature of the disk, exposed to the cone as in the
figure, were to rise 1° Fahr., this would be denoted by a change in the posi
tion of the line of light equal to fifty divisions of the scale.
   4.   In these experiments the disk was rotated rapidly for half a minute,
and a heating effect was, in consequence of this rotation, recorded by the
pile.    The object of this paper is to investigate the origin of this heating
effect.
    5.  In this investigation the authors prefer discussing the effect produced
on a metallic     disk. The metal alumiuium was chosen, from its lightness,
so as to diminish the weight upon the bearings as much as possible.           The
reason for preferring a metallic disk is that the heat produced in this case
affects the whole substance        of the disk, and can thus be approximately
measured.       The disk of this metal employed was ^jth of an inch thick and
13   inches  in  diameter; it weighed ten ounces, and in most of the experi
ments it was covered with a coating of lampblack, applied by means of
negative photographic varnish.         In some of the experiments a plate of rock-
salt, tightly secured in a brass fitting, was screwed upon the mouth of the
cone. When this was done, a small piece of anhydrous baryta was placed
within the cone to keep the inner surface of the salt dry, and a dish con
taining strong sulphuric acid       was likewise placed in the receiver.   Indeed
the latter was always used ; so that in the results obtained the residual air
may be considered as nearly dry, and the surface of the disk, as well as that
of the rock-salt, when this was used, nearly free from moisture.
   Furthermore, in order to obviate the objection that the electric currents
which take place in      a revolving metallic disk might alter the zero of the
galvanometer,      the position of the line of light was read before the motion
began, and immediately after it ceased, the difference being taken to denote
the heating effect produced by the rotation.        The turning was made in this
       —
way: As soon as full speed was obtained, which might be about 10 seconds
after beginning the motion, a chronometer was noted, and the handle was
turned at a uniform rate for 30 seconds, and thereafter stopped as soon as
possible.     The most convenient speed in vacuo was found to be 20 revolu
tions of the handle, or 2500 of the disk, in 30 seconds. It is believed that
the heating effect recorded may be considered as due to about 40 seconds
at full speed.
   6. The thermometric value of the indication given by the galvanometer
was found in this way : — The disk was removed from its attachment and laid
upon a mercury-bath of known temperature.             It was then attached to its
spindle again, being in this position exposed to the pile, and having a
temperature higher than that of the pile by a known amount.            The deflec

serted into the fitting of the latter, and after rotation there was uo indica
tion whatever.          Hence the above effect (art. 7) is due to radiant heat, and
not to currents of heated air reaching the pile.                Again retaining the rock-
salt, the interior of the cone was covered by black paper, and the effect
upon the pile was very much diminished : this also goes to prove that the
effect (art. 7) is due to radiant heat ; and it now remains to discover whether
this radiant heat comes from the rock-salt or from heated air, or from the
Burface of the disk.
     9. The following sets of experiments were made with blackened alumi

And when       a black paper cover was introduced into the cone, other things
remaining as before, the indications of the galvanometer were greatly dimi
nished. The effect produced without rock-salt is therefore also a radiant
heat effect ; and as the indications (in terms of temperature) are as large as
when rock-salt was used, we may conclude that the effect of art. 7 was to
no perceptible extent due to heating of the rock-salt, otherwise it would
have been diminished when the plate of rock-salt was taken away. Besides,
 as rock-salt is a bad radiator and a good absorber of its own heat, the plate
 would have had to be heated perhaps as much as 15° or 20°, in order to
 furnish a radiation equal to 0°-8 from the disk.                On both these accounts it
 is impossible      to  believe  that   the  effect   was due to heating of the rock-salt.
     10. Nor is it probable that the heating effect is due to radiation from
 heated air, since in order that nearly dry air of such a tenuity might
 give such a radiation, it would require to be heated enormously.                       But
 another proof that the effect is not due to air is afforded by removing the
 black from the aluminium disk and leaving it a rough metallic surface, when

342 Messrs. Stewart and Tait on                 the Heating    of a Disk,   fyc.  [June 15,
the indication       afforded by the galvanometer is reduced to about one-fourth
of  the amount with the blackened disk.
    11. It only remains that the heating effect proceeds from the disk, and
 since the heat-indication afforded by the galvanometer-needle remains nearly
constant for some time, this effect must be due to the heating of the whole
substance of the disk.
    1 2. Presuming, therefore, that the entire substance of the disk is heated,
the next point is to ascertain the cause of this heating effect.
    Now, in the first place, it cannot be due to conduction of heat from the
bearings, for in some of the experiments the disk was insulated from its
bearings by means of a plate of ebonite, and the result was the same.
    Again, it is not due to revolution under the earth's magnetic force, for
Professor Maxwell has kindly calculated the effect due to this cause under
the conditions of the experiment, and he finds it infinitesimally small.               Nor
is the effect due to the condensation of vapour of water upon the surface of
the disk.      In some of the experiments, when the vacuum was newly made,
there appeared to be a strictly temporary effect, due probably to moisture,
which increased the range of the needle, but only during the time when the
motion was taking place, for it very soon assumed its permanent position.                In
other experiments, when the air was very dry, there appeared to be a tempo
rary cold effect of a similar description ; but in all cases when the vacuum was
kept long enough for the sulphuric acid to act, the only effect was a perma
 nent one in the direction of heat, and this is that which has been described in
these experiments.          This permanent heating effect cannot, therefore, be due
to the condensation          of aqueous vapour, and indeed it is impossible to sup
 pose   that  in   the   presence of sulphuric acid so much vapour should remain
 suspended in air of so low a tension as to produce a permanent effect so
 very considerable by its deposition.
    13. In this endeavour to account for the heating effect observed, it would
 appear that we are reduced to choose between one of two causes, or to a
 mixture    of the two.
        (1)  It may be due to       the air which cannot be entirely got rid of.
       (2)   It is possible that     visible motion becomes dissipated by an ethereal
    medium in the same manner, and possibly to nearly the same extent, as
    molecular motion, or that motion which constitutes heat.
        (3) Or the effect may be due partly to air and partly to ether.
    14. Now,       if it be an air effect,  it is not one  which depends upon the mass
 of air.    For (art. 7) the effect for      a vacuum     of 0*3 in. is as large as for one
 of 0-65 in.   ;   and also (art. 9) the effect for a vacuum of 0-37 in. is as large
 as for one of 0*60 in. ; and further, in some approximate experiments, the
 effect produced upon a wooden disk, in a vacuum of 4*0in. and 2*0 in., was
 found to be the same as in one of 0-5 in., or very nearly so.                It may there
 fore be presumed that only a very inconsiderable portion of the effect ob
 served depends upon the mass of air left behind.                 It would, however, ap
 pear,   from    the  views   of Professor   Maxwell and Mr. Graham, that there is

 1865.]          Prof. Owen on the Skull       of Thylacoleo carnifex.          343
another effect       of air, namely, fluid friction, the coefficient for which they
 believe to be     independent of the tension ; and as far, therefore, as this effect
is concerned,        little is gained by diminishing the amount of the residual
air.      It  would appear, however, that the fluid friction of hydrogen is much
less than that of atmospheric air ; so that, were the heating effect due to
 fluid friction, it ought to be less in a hydrogen vacuum.           An experiment
 was made with this purpose ; and, other circumstances being precisely simi
lar, it was found that in a hydrogen vacuum the heating effect due to rota
tion was 22*5, while in an air vacuum it was 23*5. These numbers may
probably       be considered as sensibly the same, and this experiment would
therefore appear to denote that the effect is not due to fluid friction.
    15. The authors, in submitting these remarks to the Royal Society, do not
suppose that their experiments have yet conclusively decided the origin of
this heating      effect,   but they hope by this means to elicit the opinions of
those interested in the subject, which may serve to direct their future
research.

        an almost entire Skull of Thylacoleo carnifex, Ow."           By Professor
        Owen, F.R.S., &c.
                                        (Abstract.)
    In this Part      the author gives additional cranial and dental characters of
the extinct marsupial carnivore, Thylacoleo, deduced from examination
of better-preserved fossils, obtained from freshwater deposits in Darling
Downs, Queensland, Australia.
    The forepart of the skull, wanting in the first-described specimen from
similar deposits in the province of Victoria, is preserved in the present
specimen, showing the premaxillary bones, which are relatively larger than
in placental felines.          Each bone has three teeth, of which the foremost
is developed      into    a tusk, the second and third being very small.      There
is no canine, or no tooth developed as a laniary in the maxillary bone.
In the short extent of the alveolar border of this bone between the great
carnassial molar and the maxillo-premaxillary suture, there are two approxi
mate small round sockets, which lodged either one double-rooted tooth or
two small single-rooted teeth.           But dental development has mainly ex
pended itself upon the perfection of a pair of laniary incisor tusks, in
both upper and lower jaws, for piercing, tearing, and holding, and a pair
of caruassials in both jaws for flesh-cutting. These, in the present speci
men, closely agreed with those described in the former one, but were more
worn    :   they are the largest examples of these peculiarly modified shear-
blade teeth in the mammalian class. Although the tusks are incisors — not,
as in placental carnivora, canines — they possess, through the singular short
ness of the facial part of the skull in Thylacoleo,           the same mechanical
advantage, in their proximity to the biting-power         of the enormously    deve

 carnassial, but extend obliquely inward and forward, from the inner side
of its fore part.         There      is       the lower jaw between the
                                          no other alveolus    in
premolar one and that of the large lower tusk. The small 'tubercular'
molar on the inner side of the hind end of the upper carnassial, and the
two       tuberculars         behind the lower carnassial, are indicated    by
                                                                          their sockets

dental      formula      of Thylacoleo        as follows— Incisors j^J,

molars      J~    or   jpj,   Carnassials    j^j, Tuberculars j^J. Of      the incisors, the
foremost above are long and large tusks, like the pair below       of the other
                                                                            :
teeth, the carnassials, of unusually large size, are functioned as flesh-cutters,

expressed   in the  author's  first communication    as to the homologies of the
inferior tusks, and show that the genus Thylacoleo ranges, not with
the series now including Didelphys, Dasyurus, and Thylacynus, but with
the Diprotodont group, more eminently characteristic of the Australian
continent, and which       at present represented by, or reduced to, the genera
                                is
Phascolarctos, Phalangista with its subgenera, Macropus with its subgenera,
and Phascolomys.       The carnassial of Thylacoleo, in its large proportional
size, absence of the tubercular part, and indications of subvertical groovings
of the enamel, most closely resembles that tooth of the more ancient mar
 supial carnivore Plagiaulax, and        associated, in the lower jaw, as in that
                                                 is
 genus,  with  two  small  posterior  tuberculars,  one or two small premolars,
and one large incisive tusk, similarly directed obliquely upward and forward.
Few facts in mammalian palaeontology are more interesting and suggestive
than the occurrence in our hemisphere, during secondary geological periods,
of Marsupial forms, which find their nearest representatives in existing or
tertiary extinct Marsupialia of the continent of our Antipodes.

       nicated by Major-General         Sabine, President.           Received June 8,
        1865.
    Having lately made five voyages to India, leaving England on the 1st of
                                         I
 July and returning early in April, have observed the recurrence of certain
 facts relating to the weight and circulation of the air in the same part of
 the world at the same seasons of the year, from personal registration of
 the barometer, wet- and dry-bulb thermometers,            direction   and force    of the
 wind, &c., five times daily.
    These five voyages have carried us through the Atlantic Oceans from
 50°  N. to 40° S. lat. in the months of July and August ; again returning
 home, we have passed from 34° S. lat. to 50° N. lat. during the months
 of February and March each year.
    The accompanying diagrams* show the height of the barometer at noon
 in each degree  of latitude; and   as we were not in each degree exactly at noon,
interpolation    has been used    :  for instance, if in 24° N. lat. at noon the
barometer were 30- 12 inches, and in 22° N. lat. it were 30* 1 0 inches, it has
 been called 30*11 inches in 23°      N. lat. This plan is not to     be trusted, how
 ever, on the polar side  of the trade- winds, where the barometer is constantly
undergoing change, depending upon a series of independent gales, of which
something will be said by and by ; but it seems to give very correct results
in and between the trade-winds, where the height of the barometer had
long been noticed to depend chiefly upon the latitude and season of the year
    We will first allude to the five diagrams representing the outward pas
sage, the two upper ones lying to the west, or outside the Cape Verde
Islands, the three lower ones to the eastward, or between them and Africa.
    The first facts they prove are, that the barometer at this season ranges
lower to the eastward than to the westward of the Cape Verdes, the N.E.
trades extending further south to the westward, and the S.W. monsoon
(which at this season blows between the trades) sets in further north, and
blows stronger the nearer to Africa.
    We are told that the Great Sahara Desert being heated by the sun of
the northern summer causes an upward current of air, which draws in the
air from the sea to restore equilibrium, just as the heated lands in India
during the    same season cause a     S.W. monsoon in the Bay of Bengal, where
a N.E. trade would otherwise prevail.           Our barometer diagrams show this
by being lower near Africa, and gradually rising as the distance from the
demand is increased.       Again, in about 13° N. lat., where the S.W. mon
soon commences, it is always much more from the west than it is further
southward, where the wind draws to the south, and very generally turns

 into the    S.E. trades without any intervening     calm.    In  fact this heated
 part of Africa    seems at this season to have the power    of bringing the N.E.
 trades to an end in about 17° N. lat. between the islands and the main,
 instead of 13° N. lat. outside, and of causing an indraft from the west-
 ward ; it also gradually turns the S.E. trade which blows near Africa into
 a  S.W. wind, which we may suppose finds its way into the upper stratum
 of air over this heated land. Part of this S.W. monsoon seems to be
 formed of the damp cloudy air which exists in the doldrums, whilst the
 rest is evidently formed of clearer air — another evidence that it is part of
 the    S.E. trades.
     It  would be interesting to treat in a similar way a few logs of American
 ships leaving in July, and supplied with standard instruments, since they
 might show how far to the westward the barometer continues to range
 higher, and we have Maury's works to prove that the N.E. trades do
 extend nearer to the equator in more western longitudes.
    Having thus considered the curves of the outward passage from England
 with respect to their difference when further east or further west, we will
 view them in a north and south direction.           It will be noticed that the
 lowest barometer occurs in the belt     of doldrums, between the trades     ;  and
 by comparing the outward with the homeward route it will be seen, as is
 well known, that this belt is further north in July than in March.            It is
interesting, however, to see that the lowest barometer travels north or
south with the belt of doldrums, showing that its cause must be sought for
there, and not in centrifugal force, which might be supposed to fix it at
 the equator.
    The sailor is naturally led to ask how it is that the barometer is lower
here, a zone towards which two trade-winds are pouring in an immense
body of air along the earth's surface, and in nearly opposite directions; for
near the equator the trades draw more north and south. We suppose there-
can be but one answer, viz. that here the air rises, and forms those two
upper currents which rush towards the poles, above and counter to the
trade-winds.      Maury tells us that the so-called African dust is really South
American,      and that much     more rain falls in the northern than in the
southern hemisphere, from which he argues that the air which formed the
S.E. trades, having traversed more sea and picked up more moisture, rises
in these doldrums, and travels to the N.E. above the N.E. trades^; and
vice versd, that the N.E. trades travel to the S.E. above the S.E. trades.
He does not say how they pass each other, neither can we, but we have
strong evidence of a current of air travelling above and in opposite direc
tion to the trade-winds, because we generally see the high clouds travelling
in that direction.     We have, however, as it were, even seen the air ascend
ing   ; for on the 15th of March, 1865, in 4°   18' N. lat. and 20° 33' W.long.,
when we had light fleecy clouds passing over us from the N.E., and we lay
becalmed and roasting, longing for the trades, my chief officer came and
reported to me with a hopeful countenance that he had seen these light

 fleecy clouds travelling from the N.E.        None but those who have expe
 rienced these calms can imagine how anxiously wind is looked for : to the
 N.E. of us there was an arch of clouds in the sky extending from the S.E.
 to the N.W. points of the horizon, with a calm and low barometer on the
 south side of it where we were, and (as we found afterwards) the N.E.
 trade and a higher barometer ou its north side; therefore the arch of
 clouds was probably formed by the condensation of moisture as the air
 rose, while we lay becalmed at the foot of the inclined plane of still air, up
 which the N.E. trade was just commencing its ascent.
     Travelling south across the equator, it will be noticed how uniformly
 the barometer rises until we arrive at the southern limit of the S.E. trades ;
 but on referring to the homeward curves in February, it will be noticed
 how much lower the barometer ranged then than in August.           The home
 ward route through the Atlantic differing much from the outward, does
 this difference of barometer arise from difference of seasons or difference of
longitude? By comparing the routes near the equator, where they come
 very close to each other, and where the difference of height in the quick
 silver is as great as in any other part, I am led to think that it depends
 upon the different seasons.
     Whilst speaking of the homeward route, it is interesting to remark how
 on leaving the Cape of Good Hope we invariably had a valley, as it were,
 in the atmosphere, which quickly rose as we sailed to the N.W., even
 though we may have started in a south-easter, which is the high-barometer
 wind in these latitudes.     I had noticed that after rounding Cape Agulhas
 with a south-easter and high barometer, the column fell suddenly after
 rounding the Cape of Good Hope, though the S.E. wind continued ; and I
 suppose that the fall is caused by the air's ascending as it comes in contact
 with the high land : the curves seem to support this opinion.
     It will be noticed that at both seasons of the year there is a heaping-up
of the air at the polar end of each trade, in the place where Maury tells us
that two upper currents come to the surface of the earth ; the one we
have already alluded to, which conies from the equator towards the pole,
moving above the trades, clouds proving its existence ; the other, Maury
tells us, rises at the pole, and travels as an upper current, above the strong
westerly winds which prevail in high latitudes, towards the equator ; it can
hardly    be expected   to have many clouds, he says, as its moisture must
have been condensed by cold before rising at the pole, so that it becomes
cold dry air.
    We may ask what          evidence the  sailor can give for this theory   as
deduced from observation.
    First, then, from these heaps of air he finds two surface winds blowing
in opposite directions: the one moving towards the equator is cool, dry, and
heavy, the other moving towards the pole is warm, damp, and light.
He may well       say, If two surface winds blow in opposite directions from
this heap of air, there must be air brought to it by an upper current or

eurrents to keep up the heaping ; but he may naturally ask, how do I know
that an upper current comes from the pole ? First, because the prevailing
surface winds in high latitudes blow towards the pole, which air must re
turn ; and secondly, because the trade-winds are composed of cool dry air,
which could not have come from the equator: here there is pretty good
evidence that two upper currents come to the surface of the earth in these
zones where the air is heaped up, and again, that in     dipping to the surface
by some unknown means they cross each other, as Maury conjectured.
   Perhaps a few words may be desirable as to the manner in which the
westerly winds which blow in high latitudes appear to draw the air from
the heaps above mentioned. . Here we will refer to our experience in 40°
S. lat., where the normal circulation of the air is less interfered with by the
land.
   This parallel of latitude is subject to a series of                gales   which commence
at N. and end at N.W. or W.       As the north wind                    sets in, the barometer
falls, the air becomes warm, damp, and cloudy ; the wind gradually draws
round to the N.W., after a time rain accompanies the wind, the barometer
continues to fell, often fast, until in a heavy shower of rain the wind shifts
to the west, when the barometer immediately rises, generally followed by a
strong breeze from the westward, which decreases as the quicksilver rises,
very often settling         down into a calm.        After    a few    hours the north wind
sets    in again, with      a   falling barometer, and   a   repetition   of the whole series
takes place.
   One is naturally led to ask why the trade-wind draws air from this heap
in a regular continuous stream, when these gales are fitful. May it not be
because   in the direction in which the trade moves the meridians diverge
and give plenty of room for the flow, whereas the westerly winds have
converging meridians which seem to check the progress of the air.      These
fitful gales have always led me to think that the air waa checked in its
course. If further south, say in 50° S. lat., the wind continues steady from
the west (as Maury leads us to suppose is the case), then this zone of -40°
seems to act as a reservoir for the westerly winds, being constantly refilled
and steadily drawn off, only the stream into the reservoir is freer than that
which runs out.
   Now if we consider that these gales are composed of the warm damp
air which come to this heap from the equator above the S.E. trades, de
scending to the surface of the earth and travelling towards the pole, their
westing is accounted for by the change in the diameter of the circular
route which the air has to describe in accompanying the earth in its revo
lution. These gales changing from N. to N.W. and W. have been treated
as the  N.E. quarters of southern hemisphere cyclones ; and we read in the
'Nautical Magazine' of a ship's having hove to to allow one of them to
pass ; but   as we suppose, they form part of the normal circulation of the
                if,
air,   it   seems useless       to heave to to avoid them.       The source of these gales

being to the north of them is a sufficient reason why the wind does not
change to south of west.     The polar-wind gales which are experienced in
these high latitudes, seem to derive their air from that upper current
returning from the pole, part of which sometimes makes its downward way
to the surface in high latitudes, especially in spring.
   The gales of the southern hemisphere, just remarked upon, have their
exact counterpart in the high latitudes of the northern hemisphere, though
I  have not noticed them to be so constant, perhaps on account of there
being much more land in the northern hemisphere.      Still all seamen know
how, after getting north of the N.E. trades, we look for the wind to come
from S., S.W., and W., with warm air and rain.
    These curves, and the arguments                  deduced from them, seem           to favour
Maury's theory of the circulation of the air ; where he supposes two
rising currents we have a low barometer, and where he supposes two
descending currents we find a high barometer ; but they are also sug
gestive, and a series made with standard instruments for each month in
the year might lead to most useful discoveries as to the normal circulation,
and its disturbance by the effect of land. How strikingly these curves prove
the uniform state of the, atmosphere in those parts of the Atlantic between
the trades, at the same seasons of the year ! especially in contrast with their
sudden distortious on the polar side of the trades, where their irregularities
resemble the waves of the sea in the same latitudes, which may in fact be
called the resultants of these distortions.    Similar curves, outward and
homeward, deduced from the same logs, between the latitudes of 40° South
to 20° North, in the Indian Ocean and Bay of Bengal, would, I think, give
interesting results, and I hope some day to work at them.

of the equation. At the same time, the reductions necessarily effected in
the course of the proof of the extraneous factors are sufficient to indicate
that the formulae of the present memoir would lead to an equation of the
same form as that given by Professor      Cayley.

      Preparation    of Sulphobenzolic Acid.    Purification of the Benzol.
    As most specimens of benzol met with in commerce, even when rectified,
contain impurities besides toluol and the other homologues of benzol, I
have generally found it necessary to submit it to purification before using
it for the preparation of sulphobenzolic acid. The commercial article boil
ing between 80° and 90° C, was mixed with about one-twentieth of i.ts
bulk of concentrated sulphuric acid, and digested for eight or ten hours in
a flask furnished with a long condensing-tube.        By this means a consider
able amount of the impurities contained in the crude benzol were con
 verted by the acid into a black gelatinous mass similar in appearance to
that obtained in the preparation of defiant gas, a large quantity of sul
phurous acid gas was given off, and the impure benzol acquired a reddish-
 brown or dark purple colour.         It was separated from the black mass,
 washed with a small quantity of water, and again heated once or twice
with concentrated acid, but for a shorter time than at first, until fresh
 acid when heated with it ceased to become dark-coloured.         Iu this opera
 tion the benzol loses from 10 to 20 per cent., according to the amount of
impurity present, and small quantities of sulphobenzolic acid are produced.

Mitscherlich's statement* that he has "succeeded as little as Faraday in
combining benzol with ordinary strong sulphuric acid," I have found it
advisable, when large quantities of sulphobeuzolic acid are required, to
treat the purified benzol with ordinary commercial acid.
   Concentrated sulphuric acid and purified benzol, in the proportion of
about four measures of the former to five of the latter, were placed to
gether in a flask furnished with a long condensing-tube, and heated on a
sand-bath for eight or ten hours.     The flask in which the digestion is
performed should be very large in proportion to the quantity of benzol
employed,     so that       an extensive surface is exposed to the action                  of the

1865.]             Destructive Distillation        of the   Sutphobemolates.            353
stance introduced        into the retort should         not exceed   25  to 30 grammes at
each distillation.
     Florence flasks can be used           ; but, owing to their bad conducting- power
and the high boiling-point of            the oil, the result is not so favourable. When
the distillation is properly conducted in a copper retort, the dried sodium-
salt yields from one-fourth to one-fifth of its weight of crude oil.
     The crude oil was separated from the supernatant layer of water, and
distilled in a retort furnished with a thermometer.                     It began to boil at
80°     C,  and then rose slowly to 1 10° C, the distillate between these tem
peratures consisting of a small quantity of water and benzol.                    When the
 water had all passed over, the boiling-point rose very rapidly to 290° C., at
which temperature the greater portion of the liquid distilled over, leaving
 n black tarry residue in the retort.            This black residue, when more strongly
 heated, gave a further quantity of an oily body, which, when rectified,
 first yielded the substance boiling at about 290° C., and above 300° C. a
liquid which on standing some weeks deposited a small quantity of crystals.
 The quantity boiling between 290° and 300° C. was about two-thirds the
 weight of the crude oil.
     The rectified oil between 290° and 300° C. was again distilled, when
 nearly the whole of it came over at 292°*5 C., the boiling-point being re
 markably constant.           After another rectification in a current of hydrogen,
 it  was subjected      to analysis — the carbon and hydrogen being determined
 by combustion with oxide of copper and a current of oxygen, and the sul
 phur by ignition with carbonate of sodium and oxide of mercury.

     The formula       C„ H,„ S,     deducible from these analyses, is that of sulphide
 of phenyl, or a body isomeric with it. When pure it is nearly colourless,
 having only a very faint yellow tinge, and an aromatic but slightly alliaceous
 odour.       It has a high refractive power, sp. gr. 1*119, and boils at292°*5.
  It  is insoluble    in water, very soluble in hot spirit, from which it partially
 separates on cooling, and is miscible in all proportions with ether, bisulphide
 of carbon, and benzol. Its alcoholic solution, when mixed with bichloride
 of platinum, gives        a slight flocculent precipitate, which on standing resolves
 itself into    a reddi«h-coloured oil.         Nitrate of silver and chloride of mercury
 give no precipitate.
     When the oil was treated with sulphuric acid,              it dissolved in small quan

 tity, forming  a red solution,  which, on the application of a gentle heat,
 changed to a fine purple colour ; this disappeared on raising the tempera
 ture, the whole of the oil dissolved, and a solution was obtained of a faint
 greenish-black tinge.    When this solution was largely diluted with water
 it became nearly colourless, and on neutralization with chalk yielded (be
 sides the sulphate) an organic calcium-salt, very soluble in water.          The
 solution of the oil in sulphuric acid, when very strongly heated, blackened
 and gave off sulphurous acid gas. Solutions of the alkalies, whether aqueous
 or alcoholic, appear to have no action on the oil ; but when heated with
 solid potash, it was decomposed with the production of compounds I am at
 present investigating.
    Action of oxidizing Agents on Sulphide of Phenyl. — Sulphobenzolene.
 — When the oil C„ H,„ S was brought into contact with strong nitric acid, a
verv violent action ensued, accompanied by the copious evolution of nitrous
 fumes.    The mixture was then boiled for an hour or two with occasional
 addition of fresh nitric acid, and the solution thus obtained poured into a
large quantity of water, when a crystalline mass of a pale yellow colour was
precipiuted. This, when perfectly dried, was reduced to powder and washed
with ether to remove a small quantity of adhering oil, and the partially puri
fied product was recrystallized once or twice from benzol, and then several
 times from spirit, collecting apnrt the first portions which separate.        By
this means a substance    in beautiful  oblique prismatic crystals was obtained
in a state of perfect purity, whilst in the mother-liquors there remained a
large quantity of the same body mixed with a second substance crystallizing
in long needles, which, however, formed but an inconsiderable portion of
the whole.
    Although this is the method by which I first prepared the above de
scribed substance crystallizing in oblique prisms, I have since employed a
process which yields it with greater facility and in a much purer state. Ten
parts by weight of water, five of concentrated sulphuric acid, and two of
sulphide of phenyl, were placed in a flask furnished with a long condensing-
tube, and to the mixture, kept boiling, three parts of acid chromate of
potassium were added in small portions at a time. The digestion continued
for twenty or thirty minutes, and the mixture was then allowed to cool. The
green liquid was poured off from the cake of crystals, which, after boiling with
water to free it from sulphuric acid, was dried.       The nearly pure substance
was then crystallized, ence from  benzol  and once  from alcohol, when it formed
brilliant crystals which were perfectly pure.       A trace of the second sub
stance previously mentioned, crystallizing in long needles, was found in the
benzol mother-liquors.     By this last process, which is greatly preferable to
the nitric acid one, the rectified oil yielded its own weight    of crystals.

   This substance was analyzed in the same manner as the sulphide of
phenyl, — Nos. III., IV., V. being prepared by the nitric acid process, and
Nos. I., II., VI. by oxidation with acid chromate of potassium and sul
phuric acid.
   The analysis of this substance leads to the formula Cia H1„ S02, which is
the same as that of the sulphobenzene of Mitscherlich.             It differs greatly
from that body, however, both in its chemical and physical properties.                 I
shall therefore provisionally call it sulphobenzolene.
   It forms oblique prisms, which are often of large size when prepared by
crystallization out of benzol, in which it is rather soluble.           The crystals
obtained by both the processes above described were kindly measured for
me by my friend Charles Brooke, Esq., F.R.S., who states they
                                                                             " are of
the same form, the measurements corresponding exactly.               They belong to
the oblique prismatic system. The measurements must be considered as
only approximative, the surfaces of the crystals being imperfect." No
planes have been observed to determine the symbol a of the plane 1 a 1 .
   It is very soluble in hot spirit, from which it separates on cooling in a
manner closely resembling the crystallization of chlorate of potassium.               It
is also soluble in ether, bisulphide of carbon, and slightly in boiling water,
crystallizing out completely on cooling.         It  melts at 126° C, and    distils at
a much higher temperature.
    Sulphobenzolene       dissolves readily in concentrated sulphuric acid, and is
not decomposed         even when the solution is heated to the boiling-point.

 Water precipitates    the substance unchanged.         Aqueous solutions of the
 alkalies appear to have no action on the crystals ; but when they are heated
 with solid potash a powerful reaction takes place, with the production of
 new compounds.
     When sulphobenzolene is digested for some time with a mixture of con
 centrated nitric and sulphuric acids, it dissolves, and red fumes are evolved.
  If a large quantity of water be now added to the mixture, a copious pre
 cipitate is obtained, difficultly soluble in hot alcohol, from which it crys
 tallizes in minute needles.
                 Decomposition     of Sulphobenzolate of Calcium.
     When this salt was distilled in the manner described for the sodium
 compound, it underwent a similar decomposition — water and oil collecting
 in the receiver, and carbonic and sulphurous acids being evolved.        In this
 instance, however, a very high temperature was required, and the quantity
 of oil obtained was much smaller than from the sodium-salt, being only
 about   one-sixteenth   the weight of the dry sulphobenzolate of calcium
employed.      The crude oil, when rectified, commenced to boil at 80° C.,
 between   which and 110°C. small quantities of water and benzol came over.
The boiling-point then rose rapidly to 280° C., between which temperature
and 300° C. about one-fifth of the original quantity of oil came over.
Above 300° C. the distillate obtained became almost solid on cooling, con
sisting apparently of the same crystalline body of which a small quantity
only was obtained in the rectification of the crude oil from the sodium-salt.
    The portion distilling between 280° and 300° C., when submitted to the
action of sulphuric acid and acid chromate of potassium, yielded a crystal
line cake, which, after washing, was dissolved in hot benzol ; on cooling, a
few oblique prismatic crystals of sulphobenzolene were obtained, and like
wise a large quantity of the needle-formed crystals, probably held dissolved in
the oil previously to its being oxidized.     These   I am at present examining.
               Decomposition     of Sulphobenzolate of Ammonium.
    This salt, which melts   at about 200°  C,  is decomposed with great facility,
and at   a comparatively   low   temperature, yielding large quantities of bisul
phite of ammonium and benzol, with some undecomposed sulphobenzolate
of ammonium, and likewise a very small quantity of a crystalline substance
slightly soluble in cold water, the only residue in the retort being a little
carbonaceous matter.        On rectifying the benzol obtained in this decom
position,  a small quantity of a heavy oil was obtained, having a high boiling-
point, and which deposited crystals on cooling.          When oxidized, sulpho
benzolene seems to be formed in small quantity.

 it from the ammonium salts with which it is accompanied, dissolved in

 large micaceous scales.          Br one or two crystallizations out of spirit, and

and recrystallizes on cooling ; when more highly heated, it volatilizes.               It is
extremely difficult to reduce the dry crystals to powder, owing to their
toughness.         When boiled with a strong solution of potash it gives off
ammonia,       sulphobenzolate of potassium being apparently formed at the
same time.        Weak acids have little or no action on it. The analyses were
made for me by my assistant, Mr. C. E. Groves.

       M.A., M.D. Communicated by Dr. Sharpey.                    Received June
       14, 1865.
    The present memoir presented to the Royal Society is preliminary          ; it
does not profess to do more than to open the way to new work, and to show
the reasons why the restoration of action, in cases where life is suspended,
is at present so doubtful and difficult.
    In  the course     of my inquiries I have not confined myself to the mere
question of treatment as applied when there are still faint indications of
spontaneous animal action, or when such action has ceased only for the
moment.       It  is true that many of the experiments      related in this Paper
have reference, incidentally, to treatment under the circumstances named ;
 but I have had actually in view a much wider research.            I  have asked,
When an animal body that has undergone no structural injury (that is to
 say, no destruction of organ or tissue) has ceased to exhibit those actions
which indicate what is commonly called life, why may it not be restored at
a period previous to the coagulation of the blood in its vessels, if not pre
viously to the period when the new chemical changes, developed under the
form of putrefaction, are established ?
    To render the memoir concise, I have divided it into two parts. One of
these parts contains nothing more than the details of experiments, the ex
periments being classified in groups according to the object for which they
were performed.         It is my desire that this record should be preserved for
reference in the Archives      of the Society.   The other part, which is here
published, consists of an analysis of the experimental evidence, with the
 conclusions to which I have been led by the evidence.
                Analysis of the Experimental Evidence,
    In  the experimental inquiry all the animals operated upon had been sub
jected to such means for suspending their animation as produced the least
 possible amount of change in the structure of organs.          The animals were
 all healthy while living. To suspend the spontaneous action which they
 presented, and which marked their life, chloroform was employed in the
 large majority of cases ; but in some instances carbonic acid was used, and
 in others the process of drowning.
    The readiness with which chloroform can be employed, and the painless
 ness to the subject which is implied in its use, recommended this agent
 specially at first.    As the inquiry has proceeded I have seen no reason, so
 far, to introduce any modification, inasmuch as the continuance of experi
 ment and repeated observation have simply tended to indicate that the pro
 cess called
               " death " is unity ; and that if animal action, brought to a stand
 by chloroform,      could be reproduced by any process, the same restorative

 1865.]           restoring   the   Life of Warm-blooded Animals,       fyc.        359
 process would be applicable after every other kind            of suspension that was
 unattended by mechanical injury of structure.
    Throughout the inquiry I have kept steadily in view a process for resto
 ring the development of force which is constantly and successfully being
 performed.    A simple process enough 1 I mean the relighting of a taper.
 I see in the taper as it is burning the analogue of living action. The com
 bustible substance having the force stored up in it circulating through
 the wick as through so many vessels, becoming distributed in the presence
 of incandescent heat so as to combine with oxygen ; then itself liberating
 force, burning, and in the process showing spoutaneous action, the analogue
of living action.
   From this analogy          I
                          gather, further, that if I could set the blood burn
ing as it burns in life, after its natural combustion has been suspended, I
should relight the animal lamp, and that the redevelopment of force in the
form of animal motion, which is life, would be reestablished.
   But how in the case of the animal body is the light to be applied ? That
is the difficulty.
   Suppose that the taper or the fire were known only to us from their
spontaneous manifestations, would the task to restore their burning if
that had gone out be less difficult ? What philosophical process should
we adopt?      We should first most naturally take fire from fire when
that were possible.     But how, when that were not possible, should we pro
ceed to obtain the spark for kindling that which we might well know would
burn spontaneously after kindling, the proper conditions being supplied ?
In such case we should most naturally look for the process by which fire is
spontaneously exhibited, and we should discover it in the friction of one
body with another; in the friction of stone, for example, with iron.
Straightway we should imitate this and produce fire, and know how to
renew and perpetuate it.
   Again, in our observation of burning bodies we should see often that a
point of flame well-nigh extinguished would rekindle under a little addi
tional friction of air, or an additional communication of matter that would
burn, and we should acquire an art of sustaining fire by these measures.
   Lastly,   as we went on observing we should discover         that the force elicited
in the combustion could           be so applied   as to set in motion   almost endless
mechanism     ;   and we should learn, as we have learned, that however com
plicate the mechanism, however numerous its parts, it takes all its motion
from the fire.
   The physiologist who would distinguish himself by learning the art of
resuscitation must, I have thought, place himself precisely in the same
condition as the primitive man who, in the matter of ordinary combustion,
would pass to the civilized man through the phases I have described ; and
it seems to me that, so far as we have progressed we have become acquainted
with three natural steps      the inquiry at least. We have discovered that
                                  ill

 3G0                 Dr>  Richardson on the possibility    of         [June 15,
 existence again by gentle friction of air. We have learned by an experi
 ment, first thoroughly demonstrated before the Royal Society in the early
 days of its remarkable history, that when the animal fire is waning, owing
 to deficiency of fuel, that is to say, of blood, it may be revivified by the
 direct introduction of new blood.     Lastly, we have learned that the natural
 or spontaneous combustion of blood is due to the affinity of the oxygen of
 the air for combustible substance in the blood, when such substance is pre
 sented to the air over a sufficient extent of surface.
    These observations may be received as demonstrable truths ; and to them
may be added an inference which amounts nearly to a demonstration,
though all its elements have not yet been estimated — that the motion of the
animal (the action of its mechanical parts) is produced by the force evolved
in the process of combustion.
    The experiments submitted in this paper have reference to the best means
to be adopted for fanning into active life the animal fire that is expiring
but is not suspended.        But they extend also to the deeper questions,
whether animal combustion cannot be reestablished when it appears to
have been extinguished ? and whether so-called vital acts would not be
spontaneously manifested upon such reestablishment of animal combustion ?
    In the part of this paper which contains the details of experimental
research, the experiments are classified in three series.
    The first series of experiments has reference to attempts made to pro
duce combustion of blood in the lungs by the introduction of air — Artificial
Respiration.
    The second series embraces experiments in which attempts were made to
induce circulation of the blood by physical operations —Artificial Circu
lation.
    The third series supplies the records of experiments in which the effects
of an increased temperature upon the body were observed.
          First  Series of Experiments. — Artificial Respiration.
    Effects of simple inflation of the lungs with air.
                                                        — The first series of ex
periments, those in which artificial respiration was employed, exhibits,         I
believe faithfully, the precise value of artificial respiration.   In the preli
minary inquiries, the animals, having ceased to breathe, were immediately
subjected to artificial inflation by means of double-acting bellows.         The
result in every case was, that whenever the action of the heart had come to
rest, the temperature of the air employed being at various degrees, from
40° to even 120° Fahr., no reaction followed the inflation.
    In opening the bodies of animals thus treated, the lungs were invariably
found empty of blood, and in a large number of cases emphysematous,
while the right side of the heart was filled with fluid blood.
    The heart continues to beat when artificial respiration restores.     In one
striking experiment, where respiration had entirely ceased and no action of
the heart could be detected from pulsation, a recovery took place in a
                                                                            dog.

   Narcotism was again carried on to the same extremity, with recovery on
   inflation ; and this was repeated once more with the same result.            But in
   this experiment, although, to appearance, animal action was entirely sus
   pended, a minute examination of the heart, through an opening in the skin
   sufficiently large to allow the mouth of the stethoscope to rest on the ribs,
   but not to injure either them or the intercostal muscles, proved that there
   was still sufficient    action of the heart to produce a faint first or systolic
  sound.
      Cessation   of the heart during artificial respiration. Order of cessation.
  — These     experiments by inflation were modified.         So soon as the animal
  ceased to exhibit evidence of life, the artificial respiration was set up, the
  chest-wall was removed, and the effects of the artificial respiration on the
  heart were observed.          In every case where the operation was performed
  within five minutes the heart was discovered pulsating.             The action was
  uniformly best marked in the right auricle, next in the right ventricle,
  next in the left auricle, and next in the left ventricle.     Contraction remained
  longest also in the same order.           But it was observed uniformly that the
 contraction     of the right ventricle never sufficed to fill the pulmonary artery
 with blood     so as to reestablish the    pulmonic circuit.
     Effect of inverting the        body. — In  one case the animal was suspended
 with the head downwards while the right ventricle was contracting vigo
 rously. In this case blood passed into the pulmonary artery and faintly
 coloured the surface of the lung, which was previously pale ; but the pul
 monic circuit was not reestablished,           and after death the capillaries were
 found     to be    obstructed      mechanically   from coalescence of the blood-
 corpuscles.
     Effects   of artificial inflation with air raised in  temperature.   — These  ex
periments with the chest laid open were varied by the employment of air
at different temperatures.           The evidence was clear that when the contrac
 tions    of the heart were failing, an increase in the temperature of the air
 to 140° Fahr. caused       a more vigorous action,   which often lasted from five to
ten minutes.
     Effect of exposure to the air in exciting cardiac action.
                                                                     — To determine
whether the act of insufflation of air at a mean temperature of 60° was
sufficient of itself to set up contraction of the heart, two animals were de
stroyed with chloroform and allowed to rest fifteen minutes.              Then in one
animal artificial respiration with air at 60° was employed for five minutes,
and the hearts of both animals were immediately exposed to view.               There
was no action in either case at first ; but after exposure to the air for a few
minutes      the right auricle in both hearts commenced to contract, and the
ventricles followed.        But the action was in no way more determinate in the
animal     that was receiving air by inflation than in the other animal.             I
notice this point particularly, because some experimentalists, who have made
but one or two observations, on seeing the heart pulsate during artificial
respiration,    have conceived that the phenomenon was due solely to the in

 362                  Dr. Richardson on the possibility of                [June 15,
 nation.     I
             believe it myself to be due to the action of the external air, which
 at a moderate temperature gives up a little oxygen to the blood in the
                                                                             walls
 of the heart, by which some heat is evolved and therewith motion is exhi
 bited.  My reasons for this view rest on the facts that a current of air at 35°
 Fahr., brought to bear on the heart, at once stops the action, while another
 current above 60° restores         it,
                               and that    little vapour of chloroform or of
                                                  a
 ammonia blown upon the heart — both of which agents stop oxidation — im
 mediately arrests the action, which returns, at sufficient temperature, when
                                                          a
 these agents are lost by diffusion.    believe also that the right auricle
                                          I                                 last
                                                                              is
 to die, because its thin walls allow the passage of         to venous blood on

 their interior, since on washing out the auricle thoroughly with water, or
 on applying to  it  substance which prevents oxidation, the auricular motion
                      a
 at once declines.
    These remarks on the effect of artificial respiration in relation to the
 motion of the heart, do not apply with the same force when the air
                                                                            em

 chest islaid open, the action really being sustained by the diffusion of heat
 from the lungs to the heart but the action excited
                                    ;                   insufficient to produce

   Effects of other gases used in artificial respiration. —The experiments
were further modified by using for insufflation other
                                                       gases in place of com
mon air. Oxygen was thus used,
                                    oxyhydrogen, ozone, and air containing
0-20 per cent, of chlorine.    With two exceptions, the same observations
are applicable to these experiments as were made in
                                                      reference to those with
common air.     As    rule, the gases possessed no action on the heart to
                      a
restore the pulmonic current when the natural action had
                                                             been arrested.
The exceptions were, that when the action of the heart was
                                                            still feebly pro

ozone produced    aquicker restoration, the ozone being much the less
                                                                       objec

   Artificial respiration      electro-galvanic action. — The experiments on
                               by
artificial respiration were finally modified by
                                                using the electro-galvanic cur
 rent to excite the muscles of
                                  respiration so soon as natural respiration and
 circulation had ceased.      By inserting    fine ueedle, insulated except at the

long, in some cases, as seven minutes         ;and the phenomena are often re
markable, and to the inexperienced
                                          deceptive.   Thus, owing to the action
on the vocal apparatus, a
                              rabbit will scream as loudly as in life and,
breathing and screaming, might well be

                       Rdsume1. — Value     of Artificial Respiration.
  Reviewing the whole series of experiments, I am led to the conclusion,
and I think it admits of direct demonstration, that artificial respiration, in
whatever way performed, is quite useless from the moment when the right
side of the heart fails in propelling a current of blood over the pulmonic
circuit, and when the auriculo-ventricular valve loses its tension on contrac
tion of the ventricle.
   Break of blood-column. — At this point the blood-column is broken : the
resistance to the passage of blood is of itself almost overwhelming, while
the muscular action is decreasing in power in proportion as the difficulty of
propulsion is increasing.
   Obstacle      from       of blood-corpuscles.-— Another obstacle is in
                        coalescence
the blood itself. It                   coalescence of the blood-corpuscles
                            consists in the rapid
as the motion of the blood ceases.   This is so determinate, that within
three minutes   after its complete cessation, the blood, though still fluid,
often fails to be carried, even by a moderately strong stroke, over the lungs.
In one experiment the chest of a strong dog was laid open while the animal
was under chloroform, and artificial respiration was sustained. Both sides
of theheart were acting vigorously, and there was a good arterial current.
In the midst of this action, which could easily have been sustained for an
hour, the pulmonary artery was suppressed for the space of two minutes
and fifty seconds. Then it was liberated, and the ventricle, which was still
beating vigorously and gave out a valvular sound, carried the pent-up
column into the pulmonary vessel ; but there was no circuit.    The lung
was somewhat congested, and the capillaries were blocked up so as to resist
an impulse which, increased by galvanism, was more active for some minutes
after the liberation of the artery than it had been previously.
   Obstruction from coagulation of blood. — The last obstruction is the co
agulation of the blood ; but as this does not, as a general rule, occur (in
cases where the blood-vessels are not opened) within twenty minutes, and
often not within an hour, it may be considered a secondary difficulty,
though naturally fatal to success, according to our present knowledge, when
it has taken place.
                       Modes    of applying Artificial Respiration.
   Regarding the modes of applying artificial respiration, and the time, the
facts are briefly as follows
    1. It is unnecessary and even injurious to employ it so long as there is
any attempt at natural respiration*.
   2. Before employing               it,
                               the patient should be placed with the head
slightly   lowered,   position which will largely assist the right ventricle in
                        a
any feeble effort    may be making to propel
                       it                           current of blood into the
                                                          a
pulmonic circuit.
  3.   It   is   of the greatest importance that the air conveyed into the lungs
            *   On this point see observations 20 and 21 in the Experimental Part.

364                      Dr. Richardson on the possibility of                        [June 15,
should be at a temperature above 60°                 ;   air below that temperature should
never be used.
     4.   All
         violent attempts to introduce large quantities of air are injurious ;
for whenever the pressure of the blood from the right side of the heart is
reduced,  the danger of rupturing the air-vesicles by pressure of air is in
creased.   In a word, the practitioner should remember that he is doing the
same act, virtually, in artificial respiration, as he is when attempting to
relight an expiring taper. Any violence will only disarrange the mechanism,
and turn the last chance of success into certain failure.
   5. So long as care be taken to sustain a gentle action                     of respiration,   it
signifies little, in my opinion, what means be employed.     I have found a
double-acting bellows, described in the experimental part of this paper,
answer every purpose fairly.               If
                                 any philosophical-instrument    maker could
invent a good and portable electro-magnetic machine with my metronome
principle applied to       it,   so that from
                                        fifteen to twenty shocks per minute
could be passed from the larynx to the diaphragm directly, the most per
fect attainable artificial respiration would be secured so long as any mus
cular irritability remained         should suggest the value of such an in
                                    ;    and
                                           I
strument in cases where       could be brought into operation immediately
                                  it
after natural respiration has ceased.  In combination with air heated from
120° to 140° for inhalation, every possible advantage that could accrue
from      artificial respiration,      from respiration artificially excited,
                                        or rather
would be secured, the persistence of muscular irritability being at the same
time  sure index that the effort should not cease.
          a
                     Note on Receiving-houses            for   the Drowned.
   The observations   have made
                        I              respect to the influence of heated air
                                                in
lead me to suggest that, in all receiving-houses for those who are apparently
dead,   room should be set apart the air of which should be at 40° in
          a                                                                             1
summer, and 130° in winter.                If bodies     taken out     of the water showed any
indications     of breathing,       it   would in my opinion, to place
                                                 be sufficient,
them in such an atmosphere, simply providing                      by
                                                the position of the body
for the escape of water from the lungs. There would be under such con
ditions quick evaporation of water adhering to the bronchial surface, while
the warm air would quicken the respiration, encourage the action of the
heart, and prevent radiation of heat from the body.    If artificial respira

         Second Series of Experiments. — Artificial Circulation.
    In the second series of experiments an attempt was made by various
physical means to restore the circulation these attempts may be called
                                                          ;
attempts at artificial circulation.   Various processes were adopted.    In
one class of inquiry oxygen was gently infused into the circulation, either
in the form of gas, or in solution as peroxide of hydrogen, in order to see

   if by   this means the heart could be stimulated        to active contraction.   In
   other instances water heated to a given temperature was injected, or the
   vapour of water.       Again, electricity was brought into play ; and, lastly,
  various      mechanical  contrivances   were introduced,     either for forcing the
  blood over the system or for drawing it over.
       Injection of oxygen. — In respect to the effect of oxygen gas, found    I
  that when the gas freshly made from chlorate of potassa, but well washed,
  was driven into the venous current towards the heart by the vena cava su
  perior, the auricle and ventricle of the right side at once exhibited active
  contraction, which could be prolonged for an hour without difficulty by
  simply continuing the introduction of the gas at intervals ; but the contrac
  tion of the ventricle was never sufficient to produce a pulmonic current.
  When the gas was injected into the arteries, the current being directed
  towards the heart, so as to charge the structure of the heart itself with the
  gas through the coronary arteries, the heart in one instance made active
  movements which could be distinctly felt through the chest wall ; but the
 effect was only momentary ; and after it was over, the organ was found
  distended with gas and devoid of irritability.         In another case, on making
 a post-mortem examination of an         infant  that had been dead twelve hours,
 oxygen gas at a temperature of 96° was injected info the heart.            The organ
 became gradually distended ; and on the left side, both in the auricle and
 in the ventricle, tremulous muscular action, like very feeble contraction,
 was distinctly seen.        Whether this was due to the mechanical entrance of
 the gas or to true muscular contraction excited by the presence of the gas,
 is perhaps open to question, but I could make no distinction between this
 contraction and ordinary contraction as it is elicited immediately after death.
The subject of this experiment was fourteen days old. Previous to the in
jection there had       been  no cadaveric rigidity, but after the injection      this
phenomenon         was well marked.
      Injection   of peroxide of hydrogen. — The      experiments with the peroxide
of hydrogen were varied by passing the solution very slowly into the lung
through the trachea, so that the oxygen that would be liberated might come
into contact, together with the air afterwards introduced by the bellows,
with any blood remaining in the pulmonic circuit. A little fluid during
this process found its way into the left auricle through the pulmonary
veins, and the auricle thereupon contracted.            On injecting the peroxide, in
another experiment, over the arterial system, the blood on the venous side
was pushed forwards into the heart and it was made red in colour from
absorption      of the oxygen.     As the fluid found its way round the systemic
circuit, vigorous muscular contraction of the pectorals, of the muscles of
the neck, and of the diaphragm followed, but there was no reaction of the
heart.
     Oxygen excites muscular action. — I gather from these researches that
oxygen, introduced into the circulation directly, possesses the power of
calling forth muscular contraction.           This power seems to be due to the
combination       of the oxygen with    a little blood remaining in the circulatory

ments, by repeating the injection, were sustained for an hour.        This expe
riment shows that heat alone was the restorer of the muscular irritability.
    Electricity as an excitant of the circulation. — Electricity, in the form
of electro-galvanism, was employed in several experiments and in various
ways to excite the heart.     The little battery of Legendre and Morin, with
the addition   of the metronome    so as to regulate the stroke, was the   instru
ment used, and artificial respiration was combined with the electric process.
In one experiment the negative pole from the battery was passed along the
inferior cava into the right side of the heart, and the opposite pole, armed
with sponge at its extremity, was placed over the heart externally.          Suffi
cient action was excited to produce a pulmonic current by the contraction
of the right ventricle.    The left side of the heart also contracted on receiv
ing blood, an arterial circuit was made, and the animal exhibited for the
moment all the signs of reanimation.          In another case the insulated pole
from the battery was passed into the left side of the heart of a dog, the
opposite pole being placed on the divided chest-wall.      There was immediate
action of all the muscles of the chest, but the heart was uninfluenced.          In
a  third case a current was passed from the brain along the whole length of
 the spinal column, and artificial respiration was sustained for half an hour.
On opening the body, the heart was found full of blood on both sides and
was contracting,    but not with sufficient force to produce  a circuit.
    In a fourth   case, a dog being the subject    of experiment, electric com
munication    between the right side of the heart and the external part of the
organ   was  set up with artificial respiration, as in the first experiment of
this kind, only that the poles were reversed, and at the beginning of the
experiment the pole applied ultimately to the heart externally was placed
for  a few minutes previously    over the intercostal muscles.    In this experi
ment the heart did not respond at all, although the thoracic muscles made
vigorous contractions.
    The inference which I draw from these experiments with electricity on
the heart is, that by rapidly establishing a direct circuit between the blood
in the right side of the heart and the external surface of the organ, using a
 moist conductor from the positive pole for the external surface, a sufficient
contraction   may (I had almost said, by a fortunate accident) be induced in
 the right ventricle to drive over the pulmonic current of blood, and to allow
of its oxygenation by artificial inflation of the lungs. This fact at first
 sight looks small ; but I value it beyond measure, because it has demon
strated that, when the action of the heart has ceased, the chest of the ani
mal being open and all the conditions for reanimation being most unfa
vourable, the mere passage of blood from the right to the left side of the
 heart is sufficient to reestablish the action of the left side; that the left
 side thus reacting can throw a blood-current into the arteries ; and that
 upon the reception of blood by the system, general muscular           action and
 rhythmical action of the muscles of the chest are reproduced.

   Advantages     and dangers         of galvanism. — In         the advantages
                                                           considering
that may be derived from galvanism, certain dangers of it must not be for
gotten.    My experiments clearly showed that the natural muscular irrita
bility, while it is for a short time made more active by galvanism, is shortened
in duration.   This is natural.   The irritability of muscle is in proportion
to the degree   of force which  remains  in it after the blood is withdrawn,
which force is evolved in proportion as it is called forth. It is well, there
fore, in applying galvanism for any purpose to the subject in whom the
action of life is suspended, to use the agent for one definite object, and
to remember that, in proportion as it is used, its power for good di
minishes.
   Mechanical methods for restoring the circulation. — In the last division
of the physical series of experiments, the object held in view was to set the
blood mechanically in motion through its own vessels.     The attempts were
made (a) by forcing blood towards the right side of the heart and into
the lungs by the action of a syringe fixed in a vein, (6) by trying to draw
over a currentof blood into the arteries from the veins and over the lungs,
(c) by trying to inject the heart of one animal with blood derived from
another animal.
   Forcing-action by the veins. — A priori it seems an easy task to take an
animal so soon as it is dead, to fix a tube from a syringe in the external
jugular vein, to fill the syringe with blood, and by a downward stroke to
push on the blood in the course of the circulation.     From a mechanical
point of view, the operation is perfect in theory ; and when we remember
that the auriculo-ventricular valve of the right side becomes in fact a natu
ral valve for the piston, it is difficult to see how an artificial circulation can
fail to be established by this simple means. When we further remember
how easy it is to combine artificial respiration with the propelling process,
one must feel that, prior to a point of time when the blood has coagulated,
the process ought to succeed. Indeed, when the suggestion first occurred
to me, I was so struck by that rose from bed in the middle of the night

yet, however, been successful in my hands.   The practical difficulty lies iu
the adjustment of the force employed.              If
                                           too much force be used, the
vein gives way   ;   if   too little, the obstruction   in the pulmonary        artery and
lungs is   not overcome.     In further researches shall employ larger ani

   Suction-action by the arteries. — While conducting this forcing-process
for artificial circulation, another idea suggested itself, viz., that perhaps            it
would be possible to draw      current of blood over the lungs into the arte
                                 a

object in view,  a syringe, connected with an air-pump, was fixed       large   in   a
artery, and the barrel of the syringe was then exhausted.           When the
syringe was thus filled with blood, the motion of its own piston downwards

with the results just named were those in which it was attempted to stimu
late to contraction the dead heart of one animal with the force derived
from the blood issuing from the heart of a living animal.   In the experi
ment related as bearing on this point, although the force could not be
readily conveyed by the pulsating stroke of the living heart, it was shown
that twenty-eight minutes after the dead heart had ceased to pulsate, its
contractions were revived by the transference                           of the blood derived from the
heart of the animal that lived.

resembling arterial blood, and capable either of being readily compounded
when required, or of being kept ready for use, and capable also, when
heated to 98°, of restoring the muscular power of the heart, may not be
invented.         If
              it can, then the operation of injecting the heart by a carotid
or brachial artery will be the most important practical step yet made
towards  the process of resuscitation                        when the motion               of the heart has

     Third Series          op   Experiments. — Application of External Heat.
    The last series of experiments were conducted to ascertain the effects of
external heat applied to the body that has ceased to show evidence of life.                  I
was led to the inquiry by the fact that a kitten that had been under water,
to my direct knowledge, for two hours, became reanimated in my pocket, and
lived again perfectly.          To see what further could be done in this direction,
I placed three young rabbits, which had been drowned, in a sand-bath at
temperatures respectively of 100°- 110° and 120°.                 Afterwards other rab
bits that were destroyed by carbonic acid and chloroform were placed                       in
the same manner and exposed to the raised temperature for an hour.                         In
no case was there any restoration of vitality ; but it was observed that those
parts of the body that had been more directly exposed to the heat showed
the earliest indications         of cadaveric rigidity.      In the experiments where
the death took place from             chloroform,   and where the animals had been
exposed to a temperature of 100°, the heart at the end of an hour was
found still excitable, and on the right side was contracting well without the
application of stimulus.            This did not occur in the cases of death from
drowning and carbonic acid, nor yet in cases where the warmth was carried
above the natural temperature.             These observations are of moment as in
dicating     two   facts, —  viz., that chloroform   is less fatal as a destroyer of mus
cular irritability than either carbonic acid or the process of drowning ; and
that in the application of temperature to the external surface of the body
by the bath, it is not advisable to raise the temperature many degrees above
the natural standard.
     It is worthy     of remark that in one of the rabbits which had been de
stroyed by chloroform and exposed to a temperature of 100°, the muscular
irritability in the intercostal muscles was present thirteen hours after death.
In all the     cases the    right side of the heart was found free of engorgement,
while the left side and the arteries contained blood — thus indicating that a
pulmonic current had been produced.
                    General, Conclusions and Indications.
     I have already shown that artificial respiration is of service only when
 blood from the heart is being still distributed over the capillary surface of
 the lungs — or, to return to the simile with which I set out, that the process
 is simply one of fanning an expiring flame, which once expired will not, in
 spite of any amount of fanning, relight.             The further conclusion to which
 I  am at this moment          led, goes, however, beyond the process of artificial
 respiration     ; returning again to the simile, I venture to report that, even
 same rate as the stroke of the heart of the animal previously to its death.  The result was,
 that one hour and five minutes nfter the complete death of the animal, its heart, perfectly
 still, cold, and partly rigid, relaxed, and exhibited for twenty minutes active muscular
 motion, auricular and ventricular.     The action, which continued for a short time after
 the rhythmic injection was withheld, was renewed several times by simply reestablishing
  the injection.

when the heart has ceased (o supply blood to the pulmonic capillaries, during
the period previous to coagulation, the blood may be driven or drawn over
the pulmonic circuit, may be oxidized in its course, may reach the left side
of the heart,    may be distributed over the arteries, and that, thus distributed,
it possesses     the power of restoring general muscular irritability and the
external manifestations of life.    Hence   I infer that resuscitation, under the
limitations named, is a possible process, and that it demands only the ele

monstrable fact of modern science.

 XIV. " On       the Anatomy and Physiology of the Nematoids, parasitic
        and free; with observation^ on their Zoological Position and
        Affinities to the Echinoderms."       By Henry Charlton Bastian,
        M.A., M.B. (Lond.), F.L.S.          Communicated by       Dr. Sharpey.
        Received June 13, 1865.
                                    (Abstract.)
     After commenting upon the many conflicting statements which have
 been made concerning the anatomy of these animals, and more especially
 with regard to the presence or absence of a nervous system, and of real
 organs of circulation, the author alludes to the increased interest which
 has lately been thrown over this order by the discovery of so many new
 species of the non-parasitic forms, marine, land, and freshwater.
     He has entered fully into the description       of the tegumeutary organs,
 and has recognized a distinct cellulo-granular layer intervening between
 the great longitudinal muscles and the external chitinous portion of the
 integument.       This layer is one of great importance in the economy of
 these animals ; the author looks upon it as the deep formative portion of
 the integument from which the chitinous lamellae are successively ex
 creted.     It is bounded internally by a fibrous membrane, which serves as
 an aponeurosis for the attachment of the four great longitudinal muscles ;
 and the well-known lateral and median lines which have so long been a
 puzzle to anatomists are, he says, in reality nothing more than inter-mus
 cular developments of this layer.      In some species each of the lateral fines
  contains an axial vessel, though in very many others nothing of this kind
 is to be met with. A periodical ecdysis of the chitinous portion of the
 integument takes place in all Nematoids during the period of their growth.
     The author agrees with Dr. Schneider as to the nature of the transverse
  fibres attached to the median lines.       They are contractile prolongations
  from the longitudinal muscles, and may be considered extrinsic muscles
  for the propulsion of the intestinal contents, since the intestine itself has
  no muscular tissue in its walla.

 372      Mr. Bastian — Anatomy and Physiology of Nematoids. [June 15,
     Schneider's description of the nervous system in Ascaris megalocephala
 has been confirmed, and a similar arrangement has been recognized by the
  author in several other Nematoids.           It exists as a nervous ring encircling
  the commencement of the oesophagus, in connection with many large
  ganglion-cells.     The principal peripheral branches are given off from the
  anterior part    of the ring, and proceed to the region of the mouth and
  cephalic papillae.       Although well developed ocelli exist in many of the
  free marine     species,   no nerve-filaments    have yet   been detected  in con
  nexion with them.
     The organs of digestion are mostly simple, the principal variations being
 met with in the presence or absence of a pharyngeal cavity, and in the
  structure of the oesophagus.          In some species its parietes are distinctly
 muscular, whilst in others, as in the Trichocepkali and Trichosomata,
 they are as distinctly cellular.           Those possessing a pharyngeal cavity
 sometimes have       well-marked     tooth-like processes developed from its walls ;
 but the author believes that the chitinous plates which are sometimes met
 with in posterior swellings of the oesophagus are not '' gastric teeth," as they
 have been hitherto described, but rather valvular plates for ensuring greater
 perfection in the suctorial process by which these animals pass their food
 along this portion of the alimentary canal.
     The water- vascular system may be seen in many Nematoids in its most
 elementary condition, as a small tubular gland, with an excretory orifice in
 the mid-ventral region of the anterior part of the body.           In other Nema
 toids no trace of such a system exists ; whilst its most developed condition
 yet recognized in these animals may be seen in Ascaris osculata and A.
 spiculigera, where an intimate plexus of vessels, still in connexion with an
 anterior ventral pore, is met with in a peculiar development from the left
 lateral band.      Intermediate conditions between these extreme forms may
 be traced in other species       ; and from the obviously glandular nature of the
 tubular or pyriform organ met with so commonly in the free, and also in
 many of the parasitic species, he thinks considerable light is thrown upon
the function     of the " water-vascular " system.         He says, " Here we have
undoubtedly       to deal with an excretory         glandular apparatus.    No one
could for a moment regard these structures as at all analogous to vessels
 destined alternately to receive and discharge an external fluid medium.            I
believe that in the Trematoda and Ttsniada also, where similar though
often more developed systems exist, their function is in like manner one of
a purely     eliminatory kind ; and 1 therefore cannot but look upon the
           '                    '
name    of   water-vascular        apparatus as a singularly inappropriate appella
tion for this system of vessels."
     Other very peculiar transverse vessels exist in the deep integumental
layer of Ascaris megalocephala and A. lumbricoides, mostly running in pairs
from median line to median line, and, strangely enough, being about twice
as numerous on the right as on the left side of the body.
     The author believes that in the Nematoids but little provision exists for

1865.]     Mr. Bastian — Anatomy and Physiology of Nematoids.                         373
the oxidating portion of the process of respiration, and thinks that this
deficiency may be compensated by a greatly increased activity of glandular
eliminating organs.   Considering the conditions under whose influence so
many of the parasitic forms pass their existence, we can easily imagine that
the presence of any organs for effecting an oxidation of their tissues would
not only be useless, but actually baneful.    Glandular organs exist in the
greatest abundance in all Nematoids, and many of these are excretory organs.
In those species in which no modification of the ventral excretory apparatus
is met with, the author          has found      a very    large   number    of channels
running through the chitinous portion of the integument,               so as to   bring
its deep cellular layer in communication with the exterior.                These pores
are, he believes, complementary        respiratory     organs, and their development
is always in an inverse proportion to that of the other excretory organs.
Thus amongst the free Nematoids he has found them most numerous in
Dorylaimus stagnalis and Leptosomatum fguratum — species in which the
ventral excretory apparatus is entirely absent.        The same arrangement is
met with in the Trichocephali and Trichosomata, in which these integumental
channels attain their maximum development.              The gradually widening
longitudinal band long known to exist in the Trichocephali is due to the
presence of thousands of these channels in connexion with a glandular de
velopment of the deep integumental layer beneath.
    Many interesting facts are brought forward concerning the " tenacity of
     "
life of some of the free Nematoids, and their power of recovery after pro
longed periods of desiccation.       This has been long known as one of the
characteristics   of Tylenchus   tritici*,  but the author has found it common
only to the species of four land and freshwater genera, — Tylenchus, Plectus,
Aphelenchus, and Cephalobus.           The remainder of the free Nematoids are
remarkably    frail, and incapable  of  recovering even after the shortest periods
of desiccation.
   In the last section, on "The zoological position and affinities of the
Nematoids," the author enters fully into what he believes to be the points of
resemblance between these animals and the Echinoderms.                     The strongest
evidence   is,   he thinks, to be found in the fact      of the very close resemblance
between the nervous systems of these animals, differing notably as               it   does
at the same time from what we find     the Scolecida or Annelida.
                                               in                                  Then
the integumental pores which he has now discovered in so many Nematoids
can, he thinks, be paralleled only by the ambulacral and other pores met
with in the Echinoderms. Great similarities in the distribution of these
pores may also be observed in the two groups.      The Nematoids present
no trace of segmentation or lateral appendages to their bodies, but traces
of a radiate structure do exist. Their various parts and organs exhibit                  a
quadrate mixed with ternate type of development.

         College, London.        Communicated by Dr. Sharpey.             Received
         June 15, 1865.
                                     (Abstract.)
      The discrepancies in the statements made by various observers on the
  structure, as illustrated by the history of the development, of striated mus
  cular fibre, have induced the author to submit the question to a renewed
  and independent investigation.         He has examined the process in the tad
  pole, the  chick,  the  sheep, and  in  man, and with results which correspond
  very closely in all these classes. The investigation is most easy in the tad
  pole, as the early structures are of much larger size ; but observations are
  made with a comparatively greater precision when high magnifying powers
  are employed.      The author has used 900 linear in his observations on
  the tadpole, 1250 or 1850 linear in his observations on the chick and
 mammalia.       The earliest form in which muscular tissue appears in the
 tadpole is an oval body containing one or more nuclei, and densely filled
 with pigmentary matter. This body has a well-defined outline, which in
 duces the author to regard it as a cell, though he has not succeeded in
 isolating any distinct membrane.           Such bodies then increase in length
 with or without multiplication of their nuclei, and after a short period a
 portion of their structure loses in great part its pigment and exhibits a
 striation sometimes transverse, sometimes longitudinal, or occasionally both
 conjointly ; but there is no distinct line of demarcation at this stage between
 the striated and non-striated portion of the cell-contents, — showing that the
 change takes place within the contents of the cell.
     As the pigment gradually diminishes in the non-striated portion of the
cell-contents, a membrane can in some cases be very distinctly observed
limiting the whole structure, while in others it can only be seen around
the non-striated portion, and in the former case the presence of a striated
structure within this membrane is very distinct.       The nuclei are always found
 situated in the granular non-striated portion of the contents of the cell.
     The cell may elongate to a very long fibre, to which only a single nucleus
may be attached, or in the process of elongation a great increase in the
number of nuclei may take place.           In all cases the nucleus and fibre are
enclosed by a membrane, which the author regards as an extension of the
original membrane enclosing the cell in its earlier stages. The thickness of
the striated portion appears to be in direct proportion to the number of
nuclei enclosed within the membrane.
    With the advance of development the space occupied within the mem

 brane by the granular non-striated as compared with the striated portion
 of the fibre diminishes, so that the latter almost entirely fills the mem
 brane, the nuclei lying within the membrane but external to the striated
 portion, and surrounded by a small amount of the granular matter of the
 original cell-contents.
     The differentiation of the muscular fibre of the chick commences in the
 dorsal region, according .to the author's observations, after about forty-
 eight hours of incubation.        Here the first appearance is of nucleated oval
 bodies with well-defined outlines, but much smaller than in the tadpole,
 which the author regards as cells, though he has been unable to isolate a
 membrane.       These   rapidly elongate into fusiform bodies, in which    some
 times a faint striation becomes apparent.        Shortly after the commencement
 of the   third day long   fibres  appear, apparently from the elongation of the
 former, which are striated both longitudinally and transversely, and upon
 them is situated a nucleus, around which is some granular matter (the
 remains of the original cell-contents),         the whole being enclosed by a
 membrane.
     From the fourth to the fifth day a great multiplication of the nuclei
 follows within the membrane, and in proportion to this multiplication
 does the diameter of the fibre, and also of the strir*?d portion, increase.
     The author has observed a similar process in the growing extremities of
 the sheep and of man, and concludes that the growth of muscular fibre
 commences in the cells of the embryo by the elongation of the cells and
 multiplication of their nuclei, attended by a simultaneous fibrillation and
 striation of their contents.      He regards the sarcolemma as resulting from
 the extension of the wall of the parent cell, but thinks that the adult
muscular fibre should not be regarded so much in the light of a single
 many-nucleated cell, as the result of the fusion of many cells in the act of
formation, the separation of which, after the division of their nuclei, has
been prevented by the early fibrillation of their contents, — a view which ap
proximates somewhat to that held by Schwann, and which is also a mo
dification of the opinion expressed by Kolliker and Remak.
    The development of the muscular fibre of the heart in the chick com
mences, according to the author, after forty-eight hours of incubation, by
the appearance of stellate cells, which anastomose with one another in all
directions.     The processes which these give off increase in thickness, and
nuclei appear upon them, probably by multiplication of the nuclei of the
original cells.    Fibrillation and transverse striation of these processes ap
pear   from  the third  to the fourth day.     The structure becomes so complex
after this period, that the author has been unable to follow the development
further.     He has not been able to find any membrane resembling the sar
colemma upon these processes from the stellate cells, though with a power
of 1250 linear they may often be seen to have a double outline.               He
thinks the presence of a sarcolemma may be inferred from the fact that
the position of the nuclei in relation to the striated portion is the    same as
                                                                    2 f2

        Antedon (Comatula, Lamk.) rosaceus."             By Dr. W. B. Car
        penter, F.R.S.       Received June 15, 1865.
                                    (Abstract).
    The author, after adverting to the special interest attaching to the study
 of this typical form,  as the only one readily accessible for the elucidation of
the life-history of the Crinoidea, states it to be his object to give as com
plete an account as his prolonged study of it enables him to offer, of its
minute structure, living actions, and developmental history, taking up the
last at the point to which it has been brought in the memoir of Prof.
 Wyville Thomson.
    He prefaces his memoir with an historical summary of the progress of our
knowledge of the distinctive peculiarities of this genus, and of its relation
to the Crinoidea; and he shows that the first recognition of this relation
ship was most distinctly made by Llhuyd, at the beginning of the last
century, though that recognition has been passed without notice by most
subsequent writers, and is altogether ignored by MM. de Koninck and
le Hon in their recent history.
    The author then proceeds to describe the external characters of Antedon
rosaceus ; and shows, from its habits as observed in a vivarium, that al
though possessed of locomotive power, it makes so little use of this under
ordinary circumstances, that its life in the adult condition, no less than in
its earlier stage, is essentially that of a pedunculate Crinoid.
    He then gives a minute description of the several pieces of the skeleton —
the accounts of these previously given by J. S. Miller and Prof. Joh.
Miiller not being in sufficient detail to serve as standards of comparison to
which the parts of fossil Crinoids may be referred.       And he directs special
attention to the curiously inflected rosette-like plate, previously unnoticed,
which occupies the central space left within the annulus formed by the
adhesion   of the first radials. This plate is in special relation to the organ
termed by Joh. Miiller the " heart," but certainly having no proper claim
 to that designation, being a quinquepartite cavity in the central axis, from
the walls of which there pass out not vessels but solid cords of sarcode,
into the rays and arms, and also into the dorsal cirri.         The inflexions of
the rosette-like plate serve for the support and protection of the large cords
passing into the rays, each of which has a double origin, and a connexion
with the adjacent radiating        cords   that reminds   the anatomist    of the
"  circle of Willis."
    The skeleton of the adult differs    so widely in the forms and relations   of
its parts from that of the early Pentacrinoid larva described by Prof.
Wyville Thomson, that the derivation of the former from the latter can
only be understood by observation of all the intermediate stages.           When

 the calcareous skeleton of the calyx first shows itself, it consists only            of
 five oral plates arranged conformably upon five basal plates, as thus : —

    At   a stage a little more advanced (which has been described by Prof. All-
 man, Trans. Roy. Soc. Ed. vol . xxiii. p. 24 1 ), the rudiments of the first radials
 are found interposed between the orals and basals, alternating in position
 with both, as in the margin ; and between two of these
first radials there appears a single small unsymmetrical O           O    O   O     O
 plate, which afterwards proves to be the anal. The                a   a    a    a    a
 first radials undergo a rapid increase in size, and B               B    B   B     B
 soon become surmounted           by second and third ra
 dials, which project between the orals ; whilst the orals and basals, under
 going no such increase, are relatively very much smaller ; the anal plate is
 still found on the line of the first radials.      But
 from this time the radials form the principal              A'   A*    As   A*     A*

 a simple stomach with one orifice.       The highest
joint of the stem also undergoes        a remarkable    increase  in size, and begins
 to acquire the form of a basin with an inflected rim, constituting what is
 known in the adult as the centro-dorsal piece. When the calyx opens out,
 the five oral plates which originally formed a circlet around the mouth,
retain that position, and detach themselves entirely from the divergent ra
 dials, nothing but the soft perisomatic membrane filling up the space be
tween them.        These oral plates never increase in size, and towards the
end of the Pentacrinoid stage they begin to undergo absorption.                   I can
 still trace their basal portions in young specimens of the free Antedon ;
but as the creature advances towards maturity they are altogether lost sight
of. When the intestinal canal has been sufficiently developed to open on
the surface of the oral disk, the anal plate is lifted out of the position it
originally occupied, and is at last found on the anal funnel, far removed
from the radials.        This, like the oral plates, begins to undergo absorption
towards the end of the crinoidal stage, and completely disappears in the
early part of the life of the free Antedon. The radial plates increase not
only in size but also in thickness ; and channels which are left on their in
ternal    surface by vacuities in the calcareous network, are converted into
canals by a further inward growth of this, which completely covers them
in. It is through these canals that the cords of sarcode pass to the arms.
The basal plates, like the oral, remain stationary in point of size, and pre
sent no change in appearance or position until after they have been com
pletely concealed externally by the centro-dorsal         piece (the highest   joint of

the stem), which rapidly augments, both in absolute and in proportional
size, when the development of the dorsal cirri is taking place from its
convex surface.  By the end of the Pentacrinoid stage, this plate has ex
tended itself so far over the base of the calyx as completely to conceal the
basals ; and as the free Antedon advances towards maturity, it gradually
extends itself over the first radials, which then become adherent to it and to
each other.    The basals then undergo a most curious metamorphosis, con
sisting in absorption in one part and extension in another, by which they
finally become converted into five peculiarly shaped pieces, the ultimate
union of which forms the single rosette-like plate, which has been already
stated to lie within the annulus formed by the first radials of the adult
Antedon.       Hence the calyx finally comes to be thus composed                      :   —

   As the orals and the anal have entirely disappeared, no part of the pri
mordial calyx of the Pentacrinoid larva is traceable in  until we separate      it,
the adherent pieces which form its base, and search out the minute and
delicate rosette-like plate which   formed by the metamorphosis of the
                                              is
basals.
  The structure, physiology, and development of the digestive, circulatory,
and respiratory apparatus, and of the nervous and muscular systems, will

        Minute Anatomy of the Retina of Amphibia and Reptiles." By

                                             (Abstract.)
    The Chameleon's retina    peculiar in having a fovea and pecten, and in
                                   is
the nervous conducting   fibres  crossing the connective-tissue fibres in
stead of running parallel to them.      The fovea was discovered by Knox
in 1823, and minutely described by H. Miiller, who also discovered
the singular  arrangement  of the two sets of fibres in 1862.                                  It   is
a  circular pit situated at the posterior pole of the eyeball.                                A   dark
brown dot, surrounded by       lighter areola, marks its centre.

the bacillary layer, which contains cones only,     alone present.    is                          The
cones  of the fovea are long, slender cylinders placed vertically upon
the choroid.    From the centre of the fovea outwards, the cones become
stouter, shorter, and more numerous towards the periphery of the retina,

  where they are flask-shaped.        The other layers reach their maximum de
  velopment     around  the fovea  at   successively increasing distances from its
  centre.     From the inner ends of the cones, fine fibres proceed obliquely
  from the outer to the inner surface of the retina in a radial direction from
  the centre of the fovea to the periphery of the retina.            These fibres con
  nect the cones with the cells of the outer granule-layer ; they next form a
  thick plexus at the inner surface of this layer, which I term the cone-fibre
  plexus   ; then traverse the inner granule-layer, in which they connect them
  selves with round and roundly oval cells, and are continued through the
  medium      of the ganglion-cell-like    cells   of this layer into the granular
 layer, where they join the processes directed outwards from the cells of the
  ganglionic layer.     Thus they constitute an anatomical path between the
  cones and optic nerve-fibres.
      These oblique nervous fibres are crossed by vertical fibres of modified
  connective tissue directed radially from the centre of the eyeball.           Around
  the fovea the connective fibres traverse the cone-fibre plexus and the
  outer granule-layer in the form of stout vertical pillars corresponding to
  those which in the turtle    I  named the outer radial         fibres ; while  in the
  thinner periphery of the retina, the vertical, connective-tissue fibres are
  finer, and traverse all the layers between the inner and outer limiting mem
 branes.
      The pecten lies excentrically at 1"' from the centre of the fovea. Its
 minute structure agrees with that of the Gecko's.
      The distribution of the optic nerve-fibres with respect to the fovea
 resembles that which obtains with reference to the yellow spot in the
 human eye.
 XVIII. " Additional         Varieties    in Human Myology."                By John
         Wood, F.R.C.S., Demonstrator of Anatomy in King's College,
         London.     Communicated by Dr. Sharped                   Received June 9,
         1865.
     In  the past winter session thirty-six subjects have been dissected in the
 Anatomical Rooms at King's College.             In them the author has directed
especial attention to the combinations of muscular aberrations in the same
 individual, with    a view to obtain    data for ascertaining any relation that
may subsist between such abnormalities in different parts of the body.
     In one subject, a muscular man about 5 feet 8 inches high, with promi
nent features, aquiline nose, somewhat high cheek-bones, well-pronounced
chin, and good skull-development, an extensive departure from the ordinary
type was observed in every part of the body, the abnormalities being more
numerous than in any other subject previously noted.
     In the neck, on both sides, was a well-developed and powerful levator
claticxda, in all respects like that first described and figured by the author
in    a paper read    last year before    the Royal     Society.     It was connected

380          Mr.  J. Wood — Varieties in Human Myology.             [June 15,
above with the posterior tubercles of the second and third cervical vertebral
transverse processes, arising with the fibres of the levator anguli scapula.
Passing downwards, forwards, and outwards, as a muscle about an inch
wide, it was inserted into the outer third of the clavicle, behind the fibres
of the trapezius muscle, and opposite the conoid tubercle of that bone.
   The fasciculus was muscular in nearly its whole extent (fig.   1 a).
                                    Fig.  1.
   Arising from the hinder border of the first rib with the sterno-thyroideut
muscle, and passing over the common carotid artery to be inserted into
the cervical fascia at the upper part of the neck, was a costo-fascialis cer-
vicalis muscle, precisely similar to that described and figured in the paper
before alluded to.

1865.]           Mr. J. Wood — Varieties in Human Myology .                        381
    In the axilla, on both       sides, the latissimus dorsi sent a muscular slip
three-fourths of      an  inch  wide,  in front of the vessels and nerves, to be in
serted, with the upper sternal fibres of the pectoralis major, into the
outer bicipital ridge of the humerus (fig. 1 e).              A similar detached slip
arose from the seventh rib, close below the pectoralis major, and was inserted
separately     into    the  bicipital ridge    a  little higher than the foregoing
(fig. 1 b).
    From the outer border of the first rib, near the cartilage, arose a thin,
fleshy, triangular muscle which, widening gradually, dropped fibres of in
sertion into the second, third, and fourth ribs, close outside the origin of
the pectoralis minor.          It was entirely distinct from the intercostals, and
may be termed a supra- costal muscle.             It   existed on both sides, but was
more marked on the left (fig. I d).
    In the upper arm was a well-marked brachio-fascialis, exactly similar
to that described in the last paper, arising with the upper fibres of the
brachialis anticus, and inserted into the semilunar fascia of the elbow,
intervening between the brachial artery and median nerve close above the
bend of the elbow.
    In the right arm only was a large fusiform muscle, arising, by a thin
lunated aponeurotic tendon, from the oblique line of the radius under the
origin of the jlexor sublimis, and inserted by a narrow spreading tendon
into the deep surface of the anterior annular ligament close to the tra
pezium.
    Some    of the fibres could     be traced into the middle    portion of the palmar
fascia.
    This muscle was also found in another muscular male, associated,              as in
this case, with a remarkably developed extensor brevis digitorum mantis.
It seems to be a homologue of the tensor fascia plantaris given in the
 series of drawings accompanying the last paper.
    A   strong and distinct palmaris longus and brevis were also present.
There was increased differentiation of the flexor sublimis digitorum.
    The flexor pollicis longus gave a strong muscular slip to the indicial
portion of the flexor profundus digitorum.
     The third lumbricalis was double, half going to the third and half to
 the fourth digit, and implanted in the usual manner into their opposed
 sides.    This was also seen in another subject.
    There    was   an   extensor proprius    digiti medii from the lower end of the
 back   of the ulna and interosseous ligament, distinct from the indicator
 muscle, and inserted into the dorsal expansion of the common extensor
 tendon, lying on its deep surface and sending lateral slips to the metacarpo
 phalangeal ligaments.
     The extensor ossis metacarpi pollicis, on both sides, had three distinct
 tendons, one to join the abductor pollicis, another to the front of the tra
 pezium, and the third, the largest, to the base              of the metacarpal bone.
 This is a common arrangement.

 382            Mr.  J. Wood  — Varieties in Human Myology.               [June 15,
     The left abductor pollicis was    a double muscle,    which is also commonly
 found.
     On the back of both hands was        a good specimen of the muscle first
 described and figured by the     author,  in his last paper, as an extensor brevis
 digitorum manus. It was arranged in three slips, arising by a common
 aponeurosis from the magnum and unciform bones, the two outer inserted
 with the dorsal interossei muscles into the extensor aponeurosis at the
 base of the middle finger ; and the inner, into the same structure at the
 base   of the ring-finger.
     This muscle was also found very well marked in another muscular male
 arm, associated with the fusiform deep palmaris just described.
     Fig. 2 is drawn from this specimen, and it will be seen that in it there
 is a still closer approach to the ar-                       Fig. 2.
 rangement of the extensor breris
 digitorum pedis, inasmuch as the
 outermost slip is not inserted with
 the second dorsal interosseus into
 the   middle    finger, but with the
 first palmar interosseus into the
 ulnar side of the index or second
 digit and its extensor aponeurosis.
 This specimen has       been preserved
 as a preparation    for the Hunterian
 Museum of       the  Royal College of
 Surgeons, where it may be in
 spected by those interested in the
 question.
     In the foot of the subject first
 mentioned, the tibialis anticus on
 both    sides, sent forwards  a   tendi
 nous slip, one-eighth of an inch wide,
 to be inserted with the tendon of
 the extensor proprius hallucis into
 the base of the first phalanx of the
 great toe.      (This was also found
 in  a female subject on both sides.)
    The peroneus brevis sent off a tendinous slip (peroneus quinti) to the ex
 tensor aponeurosis of the little toe on both sides.
    The peroneus tertius, on both sides, had a very broad tendon, which
 was   inserted into the base    of the fourth    as well  as the   fifth metatarsal
 bone.
    The    same peroneal disposition   (tertius and quinti) was also observed in
another muscular male foot, with an additional peculiarity which caused it
 to be selected as the subject of fig. 3, where it is seen at a. In both these sub
jects an abductor ossis metatarsi minimi digiti was present on both sides. In

the subject of the figure, it was the largest specimen the author has met
with since he first discovered the muscle as a frequent abnormality in the
human foot.
                                     Fig. 3.
   In the second metatarsal   space,   both the bones forming its sides gave
origin to both the plantar and dorsal interossei muscles, producing the
appearance as if the dorsal interosseus proper were divided between the
second and third digits.
   The arteries of the arm in this subject were generally irregular. There
was an axillary origin of the radial, and the superficial arch supplied the
index and pollex by the aid of a large superficial volar.
   We have thus in this remarkable subject a development of a true levator
claviculee, such as is found in all kinds    of apes, monkeys, and bats, and
offsets from the pectoralis major and latissimus      dorsi similar to the ehon-
dro- and dorso-epitrochlear found also in these animals and the moles
and birds.
    We have further a brachio-fascialis or quasi third head of the biceps
usually found in birds ; a muscular connexion between the flexor pollicis

 384            Mr. J. Wood — Varieties in Human Myology.                    [June 15,
 longus and flexor digitorum profundus, as found in the apes and monkeys ;
 with a curious addition of the nature of a tensor fasciee palmaris, forming
 a close homologue with the plantaris flexor found in many of the lower
 animals   ;  a double   lumbricalis,  as often seen in the apes ; and a     proper ex
 tensor of the middle finger.         There is a redundancy of the extensor ossis
 metacarpi pollieis and       abductor  pollicis, and an extensor brevis digitorum
 on the back    of the hand. This last curious muscle the author has now traced
 in all stages of its segregation and posterior displacement from the fibres of
 the dorsal interossei, which indicate strongly the light in which we should
 view this muscle on the dorsum of the foot.           (In the fore paw of the Sloth,
 Professor    Huxley has shown the author a similar displacement and use of
 the dorsal interrossei as extensors of the digits, while the palmar, as in
 most of the lower animals, fulfilled the part offlexores breves as well as
 divaricators of the digits.      This function in the Sloths is rendered neces
 sary by the imperfect development and abnormal displacement of the
 tendons of the extensor longus.)          Lastly, in the foot of this subject we
 have the tibialis      anticus and peroneus brevis muscles sending forwards
tendinous slips to their respective digits (first and fifth). A special abductor
 of the metatarsal bone of the fifth digit, such as Professor Huxley and
 Mr. Flower      have shown to exist uniformly in the higher and lower apes,
and a    double   origin of the first plantar interosseus muscle, complete the
list of irregularities which render the above subject one of the most re
markable the author has ever dissected.
    In a  thin female subject of low stature was found, on the right side only,
the remarkable muscle given in fig. 4.           It consisted of a roundish fusiform
slip (a) arising tendinous from the first cartilage below the subelavius close
to the manubrium sterni, passing across the subclavian vessels and nerves
quite distinct from the last-named muscle, and inserted iuto the upper
border of the scapula and suprascapular ligament, where it was connected,
 to some extent, with the origin of the omo-hyoideus (c).            From this point
of insertion another slip of muscular fibres passed forwards, upwards, and
outwards, to be inserted, with the subelavius, into the outer third              of the
clavicle   (i).
    This muscle     seems to be the same        as that  given in the author's first
series under the name of a double subelavius, with the addition of a con
necting slip to the clavicle.        It seems to the author to represent pretty
closely the sterno-scapular muscle, while contributing to support the thorax
in the pachyderms and ruminants, in which animals it is continued                 as far
as the manubrium.
    In the same subject was a slip, on the left side only, arising from the
eighth rib, with the digitation of the serratus magnus, and inserted into
the short head      of the biceps close to the coracoid process.      A   rather larger
muscle like this was described and figured in the first             series,  under the

    In the left arm of this subject, was found, for the fourth time, the curious
muscle first described in the author's last paper as the extensor carpi radial is

longior, and inserted by a long tendon into the base of the metacarpal of
the pollex, below and distinct from the extensor ossis metacarpi pollicis.
In this instance no slip was given to the abductor, as is sometimes the
case.    The author had the satisfaction of showing this specimen to Pro
fessor Sharpey, with the levator claviculee before described.           Professors
Ellis and Huxley, and Messrs. Flower and Pettigrew of the Royal College
of Surgeons, also inspected it. It was not present on the right side, but
here a muscular connexion existed between the supinator longus and ex
tensor carpi radialis longior.     There was no palmaris longus on the left
side, and only a small one     on the right.    On the left side also the fourth
lumbricalis was absent.
    In the body of a fine young Negro, which was very carefully dissected
and observed, few departures from the ordinary muscular arrangement
were observed, and these were present only in the upper extremity.              Iu
the left arm was a complex arrangement of the flexor sublimis digitorum.
Two large muscular slips from the coronoid origin of this muscle passed
to the tendons of the deeper muscles.        The inner and more superficial ter
minated in two long tendons, which passed separately under the anterior
annular ligament, and became blended in the middle of the palm with those
of the flexor profundus going to the fourth and fifth fingers.          The outer
slip also divided (a little higher up) into two tendons.      One of these joined,
in the   middle  of the  forearm,  that  of the flexor, pollicis longus ; and the
other, after receiving a muscular head from the radius below the last-named
muscle, became connected in the palm with the perforating tendon of the
index, giving part origin to the first lumbricalis.         Here were three ad
ditional tendons intermediate between the flexor sublimis and profundus,
passing separately under the annular ligament.          Additional tendons have
been before met with in this position in Europeans, but the author does
not remember to have met with them to the extent seen in this Negro. In
the same arm, the third lumbricalis joined the ulnar side of the middle
finger instead of the radial side of the ring-finger, which had no lumbricalis.
The interossei muscles were regular, that to the thumb (the first palmar of
Henle)    was also present.    All the palmares muscles were well developed,
as well as the plantares and the peroneus tertius.           The latter was con
nected at its origin (as is commonly found) more intimately with the exten
sor tendons of the fourth and fifth toes, than these were with those        of the
second and third.
   The arteria comes nervi mediant was very large, forming the greater
part of the superficial palmar arch, and supplying the thumb and index.
   In a well-formed tall adult Lascar, with a good cranial development,
features  of an elevated type, and of    a deep olive colour, the most careful
observation   detected no further irregularity than an extensor proprius of
the middle finger on both sides, arising partly in common with the indi
cator, and inserted into the common extensor aponeurosis.          There was also
an increased differentiation   of the flexor sublimis digitorum.

       In two muscular        male   subjects were found a well-marked sternalis
    brutorum, very similar to that figured in the last series, and in both (as in
   that case) on the right side only. In another male it was found on the
   left side only    ; and in a fourth, slips of tendon, intermingled with muscular
   fibre, were found on both sides, passing from the sternal tendon of the
   sterno-mastoideus      down to the cartilages of the ribs as low as the sixth,
   and evidently of     the nature of a sternalis muscle.       Two of these subjects
   were affected with further abnormalities,         confined to the arms.    In  the
   right arm of     one was found     the tensor  fascia palmaris before described,
   and associated with the extensor brevis digitorum manus (given in fig. 2).
   The latter was present in both hands. The palmaris longus on the left
   side was much stronger than that on the right.              In the right arm also
   was a muscular slip connecting the flexor profundus with the flexor
  longus pollieis, a double indicator muscle, and no less than three ex-
  tensor tendons to the little finger.        In the subject in which the sternalis
   brutorum     existed on the left     side only, were found, in both arms, slips
  connecting the flexor         sub/imis with the flexor longus pollieis, and a
  distinct muscle, arising from the radius inside the last muscle, and be
  coming connected, by means of a long and strong tendon, with the perfora
  ting or deep tendon of the index just below the annular ligament, pre
  cisely similar to one given in the last series.           On the dorsum of both
  hands were found three well-marked and distinct muscular slips, forming
  an extensor brevis digitorum, arising in common as high as the posterior
  annular    ligament.      Small slips representing these, and passing to the
  middle and ring-fingers only, have been found in no less than six other
  subjects during last session.
      In another     male left arm were     found   combined    the following abnor
 malities, viz.     three heads to the biceps, a double palmaris longus, and a
 double tendon to the extensor minimi digiti.            Right arm normal.
     In   two subjects were seen, in the legs, good samples of the extensor
primi internodii hallucis, distinct muscles, with a strong tendon, as de
 scribed and figured in the last series.       In five subjects were found, on both
 legs,    tendinous slips representing the peroneus quinti.            In that from
 which fig. 3 was taken (a very tall and muscular man), it will be seen that
the digital slip passes in a curious way through a division of a large tendon
of the peroneus tertius, at its insertion into the bases of the fourth and
 fifth metatarsals.       It is associated also with an abductor ossis metatarsi
minimi digiti.
     In connexion with these more common irregularities of the peroneal
tendons, the author would call attention to that given in fig. 5 from a
left female foot, in which the tendon of the peroneus longus (a), as it
turns over the cuboid bone, gives distinct and sole origin to the flexor
brevis minimi digiti (b), and to the outermost plantar interosseus of the
same     digit (c).

the    more     remarkable     may now        be briefly      de
scribed.                                                                   Fig. 5.
    In   a female was found, on both             sides, an in
creased development of a common irregularity,
viz. a broad muscular slip from the tendon of the
latissimus       dorsi,    passing across the axillary
vessels   and nerves to be inserted with the deeper
or    sternal    fibres of the pectoralis major.             This
slip   was  separated     from   the  rest  of the   latissimus
by a well-marked tendinous intersection, and was
connected with the ninth rib.             In a male subject,
which presented          an abnormal       subclavian     slip of
muscle       closely resembling that in fig.            4, were
found     upon the larynx two small but                  curious
muscular slips arising from the lower border of the
thyroid cartilage on the left side, between the
crico-thyroid and thyro-hyoid muscles, and pass
ing obliquely across the median line, in front of
the thyroid isthmus, to be inserted into the front of
 the fifth ring of the trachea, near to and parallel
 with each other.          They seemed to be prolonga
tions of the superficial fibres of the crico-thyroi-
 deus, with the tendency to cross the median line
 more commonly          shown by the hyoid and              laryngeal   muscles than else
 where.
     In a male pharynx, the middle constrictor showed an irregularity. A
 few of the upper fibres, on both sides, arose from the vaginal process of
 the temporal bone, and, curving inwards and upwards, were inserted with
 the rest of the upper fibres of the constrictor into the pharyngeal ridge
 and median raphe.         This[arrangement is somewhat different from that of the
 salpingo-pharyngeus described by Cruveilhier and not unfrequently found
 in this situation.
     In  both arms     of a muscular male was found           a small slip of tendon giving
 off  a fourth head to the biceps, and springing from the tester tuberosity
 of the humerus at the insertion of the capsule and tendon of the sub-
 scapularis.       This is a bicipital head of the same character as the fourth
 head described by Meckel as arising sometimes from the greater tubero
 sity at the edge of the bicipital groove. The third head in the present
 case arose in the usual situation, from the upper fibres of the brachialis
 anticus.
     In  a feebly developed male        left arm was found a curious offset from the
flexor pollicis longus.         On   its  inner side, arising partly in common with
 this muscle, was a penniform muscle of good size, ending in a long and
 strong tendon which, after passing under the annular ligament, became
 continuous with the outer of the two heads of a double
                                                                           first lumbricalis

  muscle.     The other head was derived in the usual penniform way from the
  indicial tendon of the perforans. The whole muscle was larger than
  common, and was inserted in the usual way.
     The same hand presented also a double insertion of the third lumbricalis,
  which was divided between the inner side of the medius and the radial
  side of the ring-finger, and inserted in the usual way.          The middle finger
  is thus provided with a lumbricalis on each side. An exactly similar ar
  rangement to this was found in another subject, a female, on both sides.
     In a muscular male, the extensores radiates of the left arm exchanged
  tendinous slips of considerable size.         That from the longior was highest,
  and joined the brecior just below the place where the latter gave off its
  return slip to join the tendon of the longior at its insertion into the base
  of  the second metacarpal.          Mr. Langmore,     a student  of University Col
  lege, has lately written to the author to say that he has seen in a subject there
  dissected, a muscle arising with the extensor carpi radialis longior, the
  tendon of which, passing under that of the brevior, was inserted to its
 ulnar   side   into the base    of the middle metacarpal. These irregularities
  are interesting in their bearing upon the occasional occurrence of the
  extensor carpi raaialis accessorius before described.           This muscle, how
  ever, is distinguished from all these by its insertion into the metacarpal        of
 the pollex, and its frequent connexion with the abductor in the manner             of
 the tendon      of the extensor ossis tnetacarpi.
     In many       feet  of both   sexes, examined   during the session, were found
  sesamoid     bones developed        in the tendon of the tibialis anlicus, and
 playing    over    a bursa on the internal cuneiform cone.        In one, a male, a
  strong distinct slip of tendon passed from it to join and strengthen the
 inner division of the plantar fascia, being ultimately attached to the base
 of the great     toe.
     In  many of the       same  feet, and in others, a sesamoid bone was likewise
 found in the tendon of the tibialis posticus, placed to the inner side of,
 and playing over, the scaphoid bone.            Its relation to the occurrence of an
 additional tarsal bone in this situation in the hinder limbs of the Arma-
 dilloes and other Edentata is suggestive.             The special muscle found at
 tached    to it  in  these  animals  is produced apparently by a differentiation of
 fibres of the tibialis posticus, similar to that which frequently occurs in
 the tibialis anticus in the human subject, as shown in the author's last
 paper read before the Society.
     In a small male foot (right) was found a slip of muscle revealing a
 transitional formation towards that universal in the apes, and sometimes
 seen complete in the human subject.              A small slip of muscle from the
Jlexor    brevis    digitorum (fig. 6 A) is joined by a similar one, arising by a
 tendinous origin from the outer part of the tendon of the flexor longus
 (a).     The two, after joining, result in a tendon, which instead of
 forming a regular perforatus for the little toe, becomes blended with
 that of the long or perforating Jlexor at the first phalanx, giving off slips

 only to the middle         and ungual     phalanges.  On the other foot no ab
 normal muscle, but a similar blending of the tendons of the little toe was
 found.
    Attention having       been drawn by Mr. Huxley to the importance of as
 certaining  the   arrangement of the interotsei muscles in the hand and foot,
 and especially the usual or most frequent manner of insertion in the
 toes  in the human subject, the author has carefully examined these
 muscles in a considerable number of subjects.              It was found that in
 the hand, although the origin of these muscles is usually such as de
 scribed in   anatomical      works,  viz.  of the dorsal by  a double  penniform
 arrangement from the adjacent metacarpals, and of the palmar by a single
 penniform origin from the metacarpal of its own digit, yet in several cases
 the so-called first palmar interosseus, viz. that of the index, had a bi-
 penniform origin from both second and third metacarpals, exactly as that
 on the corresponding side of the same digit in the foot.             This abnor
mality is sketched in fig. 7 a.              The dorsal interosseus of the same
 space  covers  it by  its double  penniform origin (one portion of which is repre
sented divided in the sketch).
              Fig. 6.                                    Fig. 7.
Both the muscles are perforated by the arterial branch of communication
from the dorsum to the palm.           In this hand is also well seen the palmar

interosseus  of the thumb (4) exposed by the division of the abductor
indicts, and lying upon the flexor brevis, with the deep fibres of which it
is usually confounded.
   The insertions of these muscles are invariably (as usually described, and
as seen in the sketch) divided between the base of the phalanx (where it is
blended with the capsular investment of the joint derived from the extensor
aponeurosis) and the sides of the extensor tendon, passing with the fibres
from   the lumbriealis,   partly to the middle,         and chiefly     to the ungual
phalanx.
  In the foot, the same occasional reference to the type occurring in the hand
is found, in the origin of the first plantar interotteus.       This muscle is
sometimes a double penniform, arising from the adjacent second and third
metatarsals on the plantar aspect of the second dorsal, and, like   per         it,
forated    by
            the communicating artery.    In both the hand and foot where
these irregularities are found, the respective digits to which the muscles
are attached seem somewhat larger in proportion than             usual, the
                                                                         is
size and extent of attachment    of the muscles appearing to be determined
by the  size and  uses of the  corresponding digit.  The foregoing abnor
malities of the interossei reflect some light upon the differences in the
normal arrangement in the upper and lower extremities, which have often
perplexed anatomists.   The terms dorsal and plantar or palmar, referring
to position only, and not to the action of these muscles, have apparently
somewhat obscured the homologies of the separate muscles.
  In the hand, the middle digit being the most bulky, has                 a   double or
dorsal interosseous muscle for each      of its divaricators.         Its divaricator to
the pollex excludes from the third metacarpal the divaricator from the
pollex of the second digit, and obtains origin for itself from the dorsal part
of the secoud metacarpal, so becoming       dorsal muscle.
                                             a                The transverse
convexity of the back of the hand gives     a    dorsal prominence to the middle
metacarpal and its digit over the rest.          This  explains the circumstance
of this muscle assuming    a   dorsal position    over the palmar interosseous         of
the index.
  In   the foot, the first and second metatarsals and their digits attain               a
greater proportionate size and dorsal prominence, to fulfil their chief func
tion of sustaining and propelling the body.   Here we find the divaricator
to the pollex of the second digit (the first palmar interosseous of the
hand) becoming developed into       a double penniform muscle, with    dorsal a
position, excluding  the  divaricator   to the pollex of the third digit (the
second dorsal of the hand) from attachment to the second metatarsal, and
itself acquiring an origin from the third metatarsal.
   An occasional recurrence of one to the type of the other might have
been expected under peculiar conditions of development.                  Mr. Huxley
informs the author that he has found, almost invariably,               that the inter
osseous muscles in the foot are inserted entirely into the bases of the pha
langes, and are not, as in the hand, prolonged by    tendinous expansion in

common with the lumbricales, into the extensor aponeurosis, and so to the
middle and extreme phalanges.    He looks upon this as one characteristic
distinction between the hand and foot.   In the arrangement which the
author believes to be almost general in respect to the insertion of the
interossei in the foot, and which supports essentially Mr. Huxley's view, it
will be found that the bulk of each tendon is implanted into the base of the
first phalanx, blendingwith the lateral ligaments of the metatarso-phalangeal
joint, while only a few of the dorsal fibres are sent upwards and forwards,
 to meet and blend with the slips sent down to the sides of the joint from
 the extensor aponeurosis.   These are not, however, so distinct and powerful
as we find them in the hand, and, in                    their thin and scattered appearance,
differ entirely from the insertion of the lumbricales                         tendons into the more
forward part of the same extensor aponeurosis.

  In March last my attention               was drawn to a very small specimen               of Killas,
with some minute blue crystals on     associated with
                                                  it,      few equally small    a
green crystals. The latter   proceeded I to investigate with  the goniometer.
They proved to have almost identical angles with Atacamite, and, presuming
them to be crystals of that mineral,   neglected them in order to measure
                                                  I
the angles of the blue crystals.   These proved also to belong to the pris
matic system, and evidently were new mineral. a The specimen had come
to the Museum from Mr. Tailing, of Lostwithiel,  dealer from whom the     a
National Collection has received             a very large proportion of its finest Cornish
minerals,       and whose attention          had been called to this specimen          the     by
novelty of its appearance.       Mr. Tailing no sooner was apprised of the in

are described        in this memoir, and they            are now in the collection under            my
charge.

or, as occasionally, a quartzose vein-stone, usually presents on its surface a
very thin glaze of a greyish-white colour, and endowed with a remarkable
metallic lustre.    On this   a thin layer, sometimes but i-th of an inch in thick
ness, of the blue crystals is met with, and on that a thicker agglutinated
mass of the same mineral of rather a paler blue colour. Sometimes this paler
variety exhibits a very fine sky-blue colour, and assumes the form of folia
tions with the appearance of small and extremely thin crystals, which are,
in fact, an aggregate of crystals generally twinned, and in the form of
laminae.
   Above the whole is occasionally seen a coating, varying in thickness from
an eighth to half an inch, of a faintly bluish- or greenish-white mineral with
a fibrous, and sometimes a slightly foliated, structure.
   The place of the blue mineral is often taken by one of a fine green colour,
varying from a dark emerald to verdigris-green, and often crystalline.              Oc
casionally also crystals of Brochantite may be seen, sometimes in clusters,
and occasionally also mixed with this green mineral.

   The first of these minerals that        I propose to describe is that which occurs
in crystals and crystalline masses, whether of the deeper or lighter lines of
blue.     I propose to call it Langite, in honour of my valued friend and late
colleague Dr. Viktor von Lang, now Professor of Physics at Gratz.
   Langite crystallizes in very minute generally dark and somewhat greenish
blue crystals belonging to the prismatic system, the ratios of the parameters
being a   : b : c=l  : 0 5347   :  0 63-16.   The forms observed   are (1 0 0), (0 0 1),
(1  1 0), (2 0 1), and (0 10).      The inclinations found between normals to thin
planes being

The plane 0 0 1 is brilliant ; 1 0 0 rather less so, as is the rarer plane 0 10;
the plane 110 sometimes exhibits hollows, the sides of which are parallel
to the cleavages. The specific gravity of the mineral is 3*48 to 3- 50. Its
hardness less than 3.    On looking through a section of one of these
microscopic crystals of Langite, ground parallel to the plane [ 0 0 1] in the
polarizing microscope, the plane of the optic axes is seen to be parallel to
10 0; but though coloured rings are visible, the axes lie beyond the field,
and the double refraction is weak.           Probably, however, the first mean line
is the normal to 0 0     1,   and it is negative.  The symbol for its optical orien

  It   is a fact worthy   of remark that Langite is geometrically isomorphous
with Leadhillite.
    Langite is insoluble in water, but readily soluble in acids and ammonia.
When submitted to the action of heat, it loses its blue colour, turning at
first bright green.    As the heat is increased, it passes gradually through
various darker hues of this colour, till it becomes of a dull olive-green, and
ultimately black.     Water is given off the whole of the time, which in the
later stages of the change has an acid reaction.     Before the blowpipe, it
gives off water and acid fumes, colours the flame green, and becomes reduced
to metallic copper with carbonate of soda on charcoal.      The                          chemical
composition of Langite is represented by the empirical formula,
                                    4Cu" O 5H'2 O S04.
which may     be   written    as

lead, and the water estimated by the loss.
       From the slight differences in the numbers given by the sulphuric-acid
determinations in these minerals, and from the difficulty of determining the
values of traces of iron, lime, and impurities as disturbing elements in the
 calculation         of the analysis, the water-determinations               are especially    impor

with the formula 3 Cu" H'2Os +Cu"S04+H'aO would take place at a

with the formula of Brochantite, 3 Cu" !!',©2+ Cu" S04 at a temperature
of about 230° or 240° C.

                                    II.   Waringtonite.
    The mineral to which        I would ,next invite attention is one with a colour
varying from emerald to verdigris-green that occurs sometimes mixed with
Langite, but more often forming with it a continuous coating on the Killas
 or vein-stone, one part of this coating being in such cases Langite, and
 another part of it consisting of the mineral in question.           At first I was in
 doubt whether this green body was not the result of the action of heat on
Langite — in fact     a pseudomorph       after that mineral.
    Subsequently,     however,    Mr. Tailing sent     me some unmistakeably     crys
talline specimens, and as at that time         I had already made its analysis, there
could no longer be any doubt that it was a new mineral.
    I propose to call it " Waringtonite " in honour of my friend Mr. Waring-
ton Smyth, Inspector of Mines to the Crown Lands, and to the Duchy of
Cornwall, &c.
    The crystallography of Waringtonite presents a difficult problem, for the
reason that it carries only one very distinct plane.           The prevalent form of
the crystals, which are almost microscopic, is that of a double curved
wedge (or, to use a familiar illustration, like a stonemason's double-
edged hammer),        the flat summit being formed by this distinct but narrow
plane.     That plane is characterized by great brilliancy, is bounded by
curved outlines, and though often fissured near its extremities by the accu
mulation of two or more parallel crystals in optical contact at their centres,
is otherwise without striation.          If we call this plane, by its analogy to the
brilliant and nnstriated        plain in Langite,     0 0 1, and refer a very   minute
plane occasionally seen on the acute edges of the wedge to the form I 0 0,
we find the planes 0 1 0, 0 1 0, and those in the zone [0 1 0, 0 0 1] repre
sented by rounded surfaces, from which it is impossible to obtain any accu
rate measurements ; and the prism planes in the zone [1 0 0, 0 1 0] are
likewise much curved.         There would      seem to be two prisms     in that zone,
one of which         forms    a   normal     angle   approximately    determined     as
 1 1  0, T 1 0 = 28° 30' very nearly.
    It is difficult to say whether Waringtonite is prismatic or oblique. The
plane 0 0 1 forms an angle of 90° with those in the zone [010, 100]; and the
principal planes indicated by the planes of polarization, as seen on looking
down the normal to 0 1 0, are parallel to 10 0 and 0 0 1; but it is very
difficult to speak with certainty as to the exact directions of the planes
of polarization    as seen when    looking through the plane     0 0 1, and as to the
direction of a plane      of polarization really bisecting the acute angles of the
wedge.
   The crystals often occur in interpenetrating          forms, with the appearance
of being twins.
   The angles, however, between corresponding planes in the two indivi
duals are not sufficiently uniform for the establishment of a twin plane.

     Like Langite, Waringtonite, though insoluble in water, is readily dissolved
by acids and ammonia, and its behaviour before the blowpipe                           is similar to
that of Langite.
     Its specific gravity is 3-39 to 3*47.
     Its hardness is        3 to 3-5.      It abrades calcite, but not Arragonite.            When

 smooth surface      of porcelain or chalcedony, it                     leaves the celestine        without
perceptible abrasion.            Brochantite,        on the other hand,                 deeply    cuts into
that mineral.
   In comparing the physical characters of    these two minerals, one has fur
 thermore  to observe that, besides their differences in hardness and specific
 gravity (in Brochantite G=3-87-3-9), their crystallographic habits are
entirely dissimilar. Thus if we assume, for comparison's sake, the angle
obtained for the normal inclination of the planes 1 1 0, 1 1 0 in Warington-
ite to correspond to that between e e' or 1 0 1, 10 1 of Brooke and Miller
in Brochantite,            of view from which we see the two minerals in the

most advantageous orientation for comparison, we shall find that the planes
of the form ( 1 0 1 ) in Brochantite, like those of ( 1 1 0) in Waringtonite, are
much curved      the plane 1 0 0, however, is a well-marked plane in Brochan

is furthermore       a most conspicuous     plane in the latter mineral, while the

 " On      the Rate  of Passage       of Crystalloids into and out of the Vas
        cular and Non-vascular Textures of the Body."                      By Henry
        Bence Jones, A.M., M.D., F.R.S. Received April 26, 1865*.
    It occurred to me that possibly, by means of the spectrum,                  I  might
 trace the rate of passage of medicines into the vascular and non-vascular
 textures, and prove their presence, and determine the time during which
 they remain in action in some        of the tissues far more accurately than had
 yet been done.
     I was fortunate enough to obtain the assistance of Dr. A. Dupre, who
 had already published a paper in the Philosophical Magazine on the
 presence of lithium and strontium in the waters of London ; and I am
 greatly indebted to him for carrying out all the suggestions which I thought
 requisite for proving how soon the salts of lithia pass into the different
 vascular and non-vascular textures of animals and of man, and how quickly

these salts again pass      out and cease to be detectable in the different parts
of the body.
   I   shall divide this paper into five sections : —
    1 . On the method of analysis, and its delicacy.
   2. Experiments on animals to which salts of lithium were given, upon
the rate of their passage into the textures.
   3. On the rate of the passage of lithia-salts out of the textures.
   4. On experiments on healthy persons, and on cases of cataract.
   5. On the presence of lithium in liquid and solid food.
                  1.  On the Method    of Analysis, and its  delicacy.
   Three methods of preparing the substance to be analyzed were followed,
according as much or little lithia was present.
   When plenty of lithia was present, it was immediately detected in the
spectrum by simply touching the substance containing lithia with a red-
hot platinum wire.         In the case of liquids, a portion of a drop was taken
up on the end of the wire, and it was then put into the gas-flame.
   If   no lithia was thus detectable, a larger or smaller portion of the sub
stance was extracted by distilled water twice or thrice, and the liquid was
evaporated to dryness, and the residue was then tested.
   If    very little lithia was present, it was necessary to incinerate a larger
or smaller portion of the substance, and to treat the ash with sulphuric
acid, to exhaust the resulting sulphates with absolute alcohol and evapo

carbonate of lithia = to about g.ooo.ooo of a gr»'u on be detected by the
spectrum analysis.
   To determine the delicacy of the test for the chloride of lithium, the
following experiment was made : — One grain of chloride of lithium was
dissolved in one litre of water.        Of this solution 100 cub. centime, were
taken     and again diluted to one litre, this latter solution containing 0' I
grain of chloride of lithium to the litre.
   When further diluted to five times its bulk, the lithium reaction was still
seen    faintly on a wire taking up O'OG grain of solution.       The line is most
distinctly    visible in the evening, in  a  somewhat  dark room.
   This dilution is equal to O-l grain of chloride of lithium in 5 litres of
water, or 1 grain in 50 litres.          1 litre= 15,440 grains,    or 50 litres=
7/2,000 grains.          In 0106 grain of this solution there are therefore
0*00000008 grain chloride of lithium, or about TXoo'oTo^ootf1 of » grain of
chloride of lithium. This contains only £ part of lithium, so that the
TSToo'oToo o^1 of a gram of metallic
                                            lithium, when pure, gives the spec
trum reaction.
   When the chloride of lithium was dissolved in urine, the           test was from
twice to six times less delicate than in distilled water.

2. Experiments on animals to which salts of lithium were given, upon the
                       rate of the passage into the textures.
     Experiment 1 . Two guinea-pigs were fed for several days on the same
food.     One was killed, and the urine, the nails, hair, blood, bones, muscles,
nerves, cornea, and crystalline lens were examined by the spectrum, and
no trace of lithium was found anywhere.                 The other was given half
a grain of chloride of lithium for seven days, and for two days one grain.
It    was then killed, and the lithium was found everywhere, even in the
cornea, crystalline lens, hair, and toe-nails.       In these it was more distinctly

     Experiment    2. Another guinea-pig, fed on the same food as the first
two, was given only half a grain of chloride of lithium for three days.
The third morning the lithium was detectable, by analysis, in the hair ;
 the fourth day it was killed, and the lithium was found everywhere, as
 in the last instance.
     Experiment 3. Another, after the hair and nails had           been examined    for
 four days and no lithium found, was given three grains of chloride of
 lithium. In two hours and a half lithium was detected in the hair of the
                                           found in the hair of the back ; much

 more was then in the hair      of the belly.     In twenty-six hours it was killed.
 Lithium was found everywhere,
                                     —  both in the outer and inner part of the
 lens very distinctly, and in the cartilage of hip- and knee-joiuts.               The
 spleen and liver seemed to have less
                                          lithium than the vitreous and aqueous
 humour and the lens.
      Experiment 4. A guinea-pig was given three grains of chloride of
 lithium, and in twenty-four hours it was killed. Lithium was found in the
 cartilage of the hip- and knee-joints, in the centre
                                                             of the lens, in the nails,
 and in the outer moisture of the eye.
                                                                  no trace of lithium,

 hours ; as usual, lithium was found in all
 in the kidneys.        Little was found in the blood. It was quite evident
                                                               in the outer layer of
 in the cartilage of the hip-joint, and very distinct
                                                         found   in the centre of the

 the same result.

      Experiment 6. In a guinea-pig, much younger
 was killed eight hours after three grains
                                                        of chloride of lithium, the
  whole   lens was penetrated, — the smallest particle, even one-twentieth
  the size of a pin's-head, taken from each part
                                                            of the lens, showing the
 lithium    distinctly.     The whole lens of another pig that had taken no
                                                             trace of lithium.

      Experiment 7. Another guinea-pig was given
  lithium, and it was killed in four hours.        Lithium was found in the fibrin,
  serum, and corpuscles of the blood, in the cartilage of the hip-joint, and in

the lens,   even  in its most central part.      There was scarcely any difference
 between the inner and outer part.            The vitreous and aqueous humours
 showed much more evidence          of lithium  than the lens itself did.
     Experiment 8. A guinea-pig, the urine of which gave no trace of
 lithium, had three grains of chloride of lithium, and was killed in two and
 a half hours.     The lithium was found in the cartilage of the hip-joint dis
tinctly but faintly. The blood showed the lithium very distinctly, much
more so than in any of the previous experiments. The outer portion of the
lens showed lithium, though but slightly.           The inner portions of the lens
 showed more.       The vitreous and aqueous humours showed lithium very
 distinctly.
     Experiment 9. A large guinea-pig was given three grains of chlo
 ride of lithium, and it was killed in an hour.             Lithium was found in
 the blood, urine, and nails very distinctly ; in the cartilage of the hip- and
 knee-joints very faintly ; in the vitreous and aqueous humours of the eye
 very distinctly. No lithium was found in the lens, not even when half the
 lens was taken for a single experiment.          The stomach contained food.
     Experiment    10.  Another     guinea-pig  was  killed an hour after the same
 dose. The lithium was found strongly in the blood, bile, liver, and kidney.
Traces occurred in the brain and in the cartilage of the hip-joint. It was
 present distinctly in the humours of the eye and in the lens.            The differ
 ence between the inner and outer part of the lens was very marked.             The
 second eye was not examined for more than fourteen hours after the first
eye. After this time the centre of the lens contained as much lithium as
the outer part did.      The stomach contained water.
    Experiment 11. A young guinea-pig, fasting, was given three grains of
 chloride of lithium, and thirty-two minutes afterwards it was killed. Li
 thium showed faintly in the cartilage of the hip-joint ; very distinctly in
the humours of the eye ; distinctly in the outer part of the lens, very faintly
in the inner part ; nearly the whole of the inner part had to be burnt to
give the appearance.         Lithium was very distinct in the blood, and re
markably so in the nails.
    Experiment 12. Another young guinea-pig, fed in the same way, and
bought at the same place as the two former, was killed without taking
any lithia.     No lithium was found anywhere.            The whole of the spleen,
one kidney, and one lens were incinerated, and each ash was used for a
single experiment, and in no instance was lithium found.               There was no
lithium in the cartilage of the hip-joint, nor in the blood, nor in the nails.
    Experiment 13. A very young and small guinea-pig that had been
kept fasting for thirty-six hours, was given three grains of chloride of
lithium, and it was killed in half an hour, the urine having been previously
examined, and no lithium found in it.            Very much lithium was found in
the blood and in the urine        ;  very slight traces in the cartilage and in the
brain.    The lens showed        no lithium when incinerated entire, but the
aqueous extract     of the lens showed minute traces of lithium.

404               Dr. B. Jones on         the   Passage  of Crystalloids        [1865.
    Experiment 14. An old guinea-pig, also fasting for about thirty-six
hours, was given the same quantity of chloride of lithium, and was also
killed in half an hour.          No lithium could be detected before the dose in
the urine, nor in the toe-nail of one leg.              After taking the lithium, the
animal was wrapped         up in a cloth, the leg only being left out, to prevent
it from licking the     toe   ; after death, the nails of this leg showed that some
lithium    was   there.     The sciatic nerve showed traces of lithium.            The
cartilage    of the   hip-joint,     when    touched   with   red-hot wire, showed   no
lithium, but scrapings from the surface showed traces of lithium. The
humours of the eye showed traces of lithium, but the lens showed no
lithium even in the watery extract.               The brain showed only exceedingly
faint traces of lithium. The stomach was almost completely empty.
    Experiment     15.  A    guinea-pig was kept fasting for twenty-four hours ; it
was then given three grains of chloride of lithium, and it was killed in a
quarter of an hour.          Lithium was found in the bile, liver, kidney, and
blood very distinctly ; very faintly in the brain and in the cartilage of
the hip-joir.t, and in the humours of the eye. None was found in the lens.
The stomach contained only some water, no solid food.
    Experiment 16. Three fresh guinea-pigs were taken, one was killed
without taking any lithium. The urine showed no lithium in one drop,
but the ash of the urine showed traces of lithium. No lithium could
be detected in any of the organs, not even by treating the ash of the
kidney with sulphuric acid and alcohol.
    The two remaining animals were each given one quarter of a grain of
chloride of lithium.
    The first was killed in five and a quarter hours afterwards.                All the
organs, except     the   lens    of  the   eye,  showed  lithium   by simply touching
them with the red-hot wire.              The urine and the bile showed the lithium
very distinctly.       The blood showed lithium faintly. The vitreous and
aqueous     humours     showed traces of lithium.           An aqueous extract of the
lens showed no lithium.             The animal was a large and old one, and the
 stomach was nearly empty.
    The second was killed twenty-four hours after one quarter of a grain.
    None of the organs showed any lithium by simply touching them with
a  red-hot wire.       The ash of the kidney showed traces of lithium, and so
did the ash of part of the liver.             No lithium could be detected either in
the vitreous and aqueous humour or in the lens ; the urine and the bile
showed lithium in one drop, but only faintly.                Possibly the lithium had
not   been  absorbed     in   this  case.     The state   of  the stomach, as regards
food, was not recorded.
*
    It follows from these experiments, that when no lithium is taken no
lithium can be found in the different textures, but that even in a quarter
of an hour three grains of chloride of lithium given on an empty stomach
may diffuse into the cartilage of the hip-joint and into the aqueous
humour of the eye.          In very young and very small guinea-pigs the same

1865.]     into and out of tlie Vascular and Non-vascular Textures.        405
quantity of lithium in thirty or thirty-two minutes may give traces of
lithium in the lens ; but in an old animal in this time it will have got
no further than the aqueous humour.         If the stomach be empty, in au
hour the lithium may be very evident in the outer part of the leus, and
very faintly in the inner part ; but if the stomach be full of food, the
lithium does not in an hour reach the lens. Even in two hours and a
half lithium may be more marked in the outer than in the inner part of
the lens.    In four hours the lithium may be in every part of the lens, but
less evidence of its presence will be obtained there than from the humours
of the  eye.   In eight hours even, the centre of the lens may show less
than the outer part.     In twenty-six hours the diffusion had taken place
equally through every part of the lens.      Even one quarter of a grain in
twenty-four hours showed lithium everywhere except in the lens.
    Experiment 17. To endeavour to determine the different rate of ab
sorption and excretion in young and old animals, four guinea-pigs were
taken ; two were young, and two were old.       The four, after fasting for fif
teen hours, were each given two grains of chloride of lithium.          Two of
them, one young and one old, were killed in six hours.
    The young animal showed lithium distinctly in the outer and inner part
of the lens, and also in the cartilage of the hip-joint, when touched with
a red-hot wire.    The stomach was about half full of food.
    The old one showed lithium distinctly in the outer part of the lens,
but scarcely the faintest trace in the inner part. The cartilage of the
hip-joint showed lithium quite    as distinctly as the cartilage  of the young
Pig-
    The other two guinea-pigs were kept. After forty-eight hours, the
urine of both showed lithium very distinctly in one drop.        Six days after
wards, the urine of the young animal still showed lithium faintly in each
drop.    The urine of the old one found in the bladder after its death
showed lithium faintly in each drop.
    Both were killed on the sixth day, and no lithium could be detected in
the alcoholic extracts of the kidneys, livers, or lenses of either.
    A short series of experiments were made with the view of determining
the rate at which the salts of lithium diffuse into the textures when
the lithium is injected into the skin instead of passing through the
stomach.
    Three grains of chloride of lithium in solution were injected into the
skin of the back of the neck of a guinea-pig, and the animal was killed in
twenty-four minutes.
   The urine, bile, kidney, and liver showed lithium very distinctly. The
cartilage of the hip-joint showed lithium distinctly when touched with
a red-hot -wire.    The aqueous humour showed lithium very distinctly,
but the lens, when washed, showed only a very minute trace ot lithium
when the entire lens was taken at one time on the wire.          The toe-nails
showed lithium very distinctly.

     Another had     three grains injected     under the skin of the neck, and     it
 was killed in ten    minutes.
    The humours       of the   eye  showed lithium distinctly, but the aqueous
humour showed         decidedly   more than the vitreous humour. The inci
nerated aqueous extract of the lenses showed lithium very faintly.              The
large nerves of the leg also showed lithium very faintly.
    Another guinea-pig had a grain and a half of chloride of lithium
injected under the skin of the neck, and in five minutes it was killed.         The
aqueous humour showed lithium distinctly.             The vitreous humour showed
none.     The blood and bile showed lithium very distinctly. The kidney
and urine showed lithium faintly, and the liver very faintly.
     In another pig three grains of chloride of lithium were injected into the
skin of the neck, and the animal was killed in four minutes.
    The blood and the bile showed lithium very distinctly ; the blood
 showed it rather more than the bile.           The bladder contained only a few
 drops   of   urine,  which   showed    lithium   distinctly. The kidney showed
lithium -fairly well.      The liver showed the lithium only very faintly, and
in   some parts not at all.
    The aqueous humour showed lithium distinctly.              The vitreous humour
showed no lithium.
    So that, when injected under the skin,
    3 grains in twenty-four minutes gave lithium in the lens and everywhere.
    3 grains in ten minutes gave lithium in the lens and everywhere.
   1| grain in five minutes       gave  lithium in the aqueous humour and in
          the bile.
    3 grains in   four minutes gave lithium in the aqueous humour and in the
          bile.
    3. Experiments      on  the Rate    of  Passage   of  the Lithium   out of the
                                       Textures.
    Experiment 18. Five guinea-pigs were given two grains of chloride of
lithium each. They were killed at different periods ; the first in six
hours.     The smallest particle of the lens showed the lithium very dis
 tinctly ; a decided difference, however, was detectable between the inner
and the outer part.         The cartilage of the hip-joint showed lithium very
 distinctly when touched with the red-hot wire.             All the organs and the
 blood showed lithium very abundantly.              The stomach contained very
little solid food, but was half full of liquid. The second and third were
 killed in twenty-four hours.        The lenses of both showed the lithium very
 distinctly ; no difference was perceptible between the inner and the outer
 part.    The cartilage of the hip-joint showed no lithium when touched
 with the red-hot wire ; but a small portion taken off the surface showed
 lithium distinctly.
     The fourth guinea-pig was killed in forty-eight hours. The lens showed

1865.]     into and out   of the Vascular   and Non-vascular Tex tures.       407
lithium very distinctly.      A  small piece taken from     the cartilage   of the
hip-joint showed only traces of lithium.
    The fifth was killed in ninety-six hours.      The lens showed no lithium
even when a considerable      proportion of  it  was  taken for one experiment.
The aqueous extract of-half one lens showed no lithium.         A small portion
of the cartilage of the hip-joint showed no lithium.          The urine showed
lithium very distinctly even in one drop.
    Experiment 19. Six fresh guinea-pigs were taken. The first was killed
and examined, having had no lithium.            The two lenses, incinerated and
treated with sulphuric acid and alcohol, showed no lithium.           The ash of
the kidney showed no lithium directly, but when treated with sulphuric
acid and alcohol, showed a distinct trace of lithium.
    The five others were given each one grain of chloride of lithium.
    The first was killed five and a half hours after the dose.     The cartilage
of the hip-joint showed lithium faintly when merely touched with            a red-
hot wire.     The lens showed lithium distinctly in the outer part, scarcely
 a trace in the inner part. The vitreous and aqueous humours showed
lithium very distinctly. The stomach was quite full.
    The second was killed twenty-four and a half hours after the lithium
 was taken.     The cartilage of the hip-joint showed no lithium even in a
 small particle scraped off the surface.     The lens still showed lithium dis
tinctly, though less so than in the first ; no difference was perceptible
between the inner and the outer portion.
    The third was killed in forty-eight hours.       The lens showed no lithium
in a small particle taken on a loop of the wire. The aqueous extract of
 the lens showed only faint traces of lithium.       The urine showed lithium
Tery distinctly   in a single drop.
    The fourth was killed in seventy-two and a half hours. The lens
 showed no lithium when the ash was treated with sulphuric acid and
 alcohol.    The ash of the kidney showed no lithium directly, but when
 treated with sulphuric acid and alcohol, showed traces of lithium.            The
 urine still showed lithium distinctly in one drop.
    The fifth guinea-pig : on the seventh day after the dose, the urine showed
 lithium in one drop ; ninth day, still faint traces of lithium in the urine ;
 eleventh day, urine directly shows no lithium, but the ash still shows
 faint traces ; thirteenth day, ash of urine shows no lithium, but alcoholic
 extract shows lithium distinctly ; fourteenth day the same ; sixteenth day
 the same ; thirty-sixth day, when killed, no lithium could be detected in
 the bones, nerves, lens, or vitreous or aqueous humours, nor in the urine,
 kidney, or liver.
     Experiment 20. Two guinea-pigs, in the urine of which no lithium
 could be detected, were given each half a grain of chloride of lithium.
    In three hours and fifty minutes afterwards one was killed. The car
tilage of the hip-joint showed no lithium when simply touched, with a red
                                                                    2  h  2

hot wire.     Scrapings from the surface of the cartilage showed faint traces
of lithium. The sciatic nerve, humours of the eye, and the brain showed
faint traces. The muscles of the thigh showed the lithium much more
distinctly than the sciatic nerve. The lens showed lithium very dis
tinctly in the aqueous extract, but not otherwise.        The blood and bile
were very rich in lithium.      The stomach  was   moderately full of food.
   The other animal, which was given half a grain, was kept until the
lithium ceased to appear in the urine.
    Fourth day. Lithium distinctly in the urine.
    Tenth day. Urine showed exceedingly minute traces of lithium.
    Eleventh day. Still traces.
    Thirteenth day. Urine shows no lithium in the quantity adhering to
       the wire.
    Fourteenth day. Still lithium in the alcoholic extract.
    Twenty-seventh day. Still traces of lithium.
    Thirtieth day. The animal was found dead.
    The ash of the urine found in the bladder (about a quarter of an ounce)
 showed no lithium.       The alcoholic extract of the ash showed lithium
faintly. The alcoholic extract of the ash of one kidney showed no
lithium.     And the alcoholic extract of the two lenses showed no lithium.
    Experiment 21. Two guinea-pigs, the urine of which contained no li
thium, were each given one quarter of a grain of chloride of lithium.
    One was killed in four hours and thirty-five minutes.          Lithium was
found very faintly in the spleen, very distinctly in the blood, in the urine,
 and in the bile.     Faintly in the sciatic nerve and in the brain.        Very
faintly in the scrapings of the cartilage. Pretty distinctly in the vitreous
and aqueous humours, but very faintly in the aqueous extract of the lens.
The stomach was moderately full.
    The other was kept until the lithium ceased to appear in the urine.
    Second day. Lithium very distinctly.
    Fourth day. Minute traces of lithium.
    Sixth day. A drop or two of urine shows no lithium, but on evaporating
 and incinerating one-twelfth of an ounce, the ash shows lithium very dis

    Eighth day. Still in the ash.
    Tenth day. Ash of urine shows only the merest trace.
    Eleventh day. Ash of urine shows no lithium ; but when treated with
 sulphuric acid and alcohol, lithium is still distinct.
    Thirteenth day. Still lithium in one quarter of an ounce.
    Fourteenth day. Alcoholic extract from one-eighth of an ounce shows no
lithium.
    Sixteenth day. The animal was killed.        The fluids and organs were
incinerated, the ash treated with sulphuric acid, excess of acid driven off

and the       dry residue extracted with absolute alcohol, alcoholic extract
evaporated, and dry residue tested.         The two lenses gave extremely feeble
traces of lithium.      One-eighth of an ounce of urine and bile gave traces of
lithium.      Ninety grains of liver gave traces. One quarter of an ounce of
blood gave no lithium. An entire kidney, weighing ninety grains, distinctly
contained lithium.
    Experiment 22. Two guinea-pigs, the hair and nails of which showed no
lithium, were given each three grains of chloride of lithium.
    In the first, in two hours no lithium was in the hair. In four hours
lithium was in the hair of the belly, but scarcely perceptible in the hair of
 the head.      In twenty-four hours it was very distinct in the hair of the
belly and the head, and in the nails.        For five days it was detected in each
drop   of  the   urine.   Ten   days  afterwards the urine showed lithium very
distinctly ; only after thirty-two days was lithium absent from a few drops
of the urine.        The thirty-third day after the dose the animal was killed.
No lithium was found in the bile, liver, blood, lens, kidneys, spleen, or
other parts, by simply taking a small piece of the organ on a red-hot wire.
The evaporated aqueous extract of the two lenses showed no trace of li
thium ; when, however, the two kidneys were incinerated, the ash treated
 with sulphuric acid, the resulting sulphates exhausted with absolute alcohol
 and the alcoholic extract evaporated to dryness, lithium was easily detected
 in the residue. A portion of the liver, treated in the same manner, also
 yielded lithium.
    The second guinea-pig gave traces of lithium in the urine when one-
 eighth of an ounce was evaporated and treated with sulphuric acid and
 alcohol, thirty-nine days after the lithium was taken.
    It follows from these experiments on the rate of passage of lithium into
and out    of the body, that —
    With three grains of chloride of lithium,      a young guinea-pig in half nn
 hour had lithium in the watery extract of the lens.         An old guinea-pig in
 the same time had no lithium in the lens.
    With two grains,      a young    guinea-pig in six hours had lithium dis
tinctly in all parts of the lens. An old guinea-pig had in the same time
 scarcely any lithium in the inner part, but some in the outer part of the
lens.
    With the     same quantity,  in six days neither a young nor an old guinea-
pig gave     any trace of lithium in the alcoholic extract of the kidney, liver,
or lenses.
    When two grains of chloride of lithium were taken, after six hours the
lithium was more distinct in the outer than in the inner part of the lens.
In twenty-four hours no difference in the different parts of the lens was
detectable.       In forty-eight hours still no difference was observed. In
ninety-six hours (four days) no lithium was detectable in the lens or in a
cartilage of a joint ; still the urine showed lithium very distinctly even in
one drop.

 410               Dr. B. Jones on       the Passage     of Crystalloids             [1865.
      After one grain    of chloride of lithium, in five hours and a half the lithium
 was more distinct in the outer than in the inner part of the lens.              In twenty-
  four hours and a half there was no difference throughout the lens.                       In
 forty-eight hours the watery extract of the lens showed faint traces of
 lithium.      In seventy-two hours and a half (three days) the alcoholic ex
 tract of the lens showed no lithium.             The urine still showed lithium dis
 tinctly in one drop, and continued to do so for seventeen days in the
 alcoholic extract.
     After a quarter of a grain, in five hours and thirty-five minutes lithium
 was distinct in the vitreous and aqueous humours, and very faintly in the
 lens.     After sixteen days, the minutest traces of lithium were detected in
 the lens, the liver, and the kidneys, but no trace could be found in the
 blood.      (This animal had perhaps somehow eaten the minutest quantity of
 lithia in the food*.)
     After half a grain of chloride of lithium, in three hours and fifty minutes
 traces of lithium could be found in the lens, and for thirty-seven or thirty-
 eight days traces of lithium could be found in the urine.
     After three grains of chloride of lithium, in four hours lithium was ill
 the hair of the belly, and for thirty-two days the urine showed lithium very
 distinctly. The thirty-third day after the lithium the lens was found to
 contain minute traces of lithium, and after thirty-nine days the lithium was
 in the alcoholic extract of the urine.
   4. Experiments on the Rate of Passage of Lithium through the Human
                  Body, and into and out of the Crystalline Lens.
     Experiment 1 . A man took ten grains of carbonate of lithia dissolved in
 water, four hours after his midday food.
     In five minutes no lithium could be detected in the urine.
     In  ten minutes lithium was evident.
     In eighteen hours it was present in the nails of the hands and feet, and
in the hair of the beard and body           ;  apparently most where there was most
perspiration.         No lithium could        be found     in the hair of the head or
whiskers.
     In forty-two hours very perceptible.
     In sixty-six hours another dose of ten          grains was taken.
     In ninety hours lithium was detectable in the hair of the head.
     For three days after the second dose it was perceptible in one drop              of the
urine, but rather doubtful in the hair and in the nails.
     For six days after the second dose lithium was detectable in the urine.
     For eight days after, no lithium could be detected when the eighth of an
ounce of urine was evaporated.
    * Tho skin of guinea-pigs throws off lithium, and it collects on the hair and nails, so
that it is possible for the animal to redose itself with lithium from its own body, and thus
to keep lithium passing in and out of the textures much longer than if a single dose only
were taken.

  2865.]     into and out of the Vascular and Non-vascular Textures.          411
      Twelve days afterwards, though no lithium was in the urine or the hair
   of the head or whiskers, it was detectable in the hair of the body.
      Experiment 2. The same man three hours after breakfast took ten grains
  of carbonate of lithia.
      In five minutes lithium  was just perceptible in the urine.
      In ten minutes extremely distinct in one drop of the urine.
      In twenty-four hours very distinct in the urine.
      Fourth day. Traces of lithium when the urine was concentrated by        eva
  poration.
     Fifth day. Less perceptible in evaporated residue.
      Sixth day. No lithium could be detected in evaporated urine.
     £xperiment3. The same man took ten grains of carbonate of lithia after
  fasting for seven hours.     The urine was passed every second minute after
  taking the lithia.
     Second, fourth, and sixth minute, no lithium.
     Eighth minute, traces of lithium very slight.
     Tenth minute, lithium distinctly present.
     Third day afterwards lithium very distinct.
     Fourth day. Lithium faintly found in each drop of urine.
     Fifth day. Lithium very faint in each drop.
     Sixth day. Only the merest trace.
     Seventh day. No lithium in the eighth of an ounce evaporated to a few
 drops.
     Eighteenth day. Two ounces of urine incinerated, and the ash heated with
 sulphuric acid and alcohol, showed no lithium.
     Twenty-first day. Nails of the hands and feet still show lithium.
     Experiment 4. The same man, two hours and a half after a little food,
 took ten grains of chloride of lithium : one nail on the hand and one on
 the foot were varnished before taking the lithium.
    Second and fourth minute afterwards no lithium was in the urine.
    Sixth minute, traces of lithium.
    Eighth minute, distinctly present.
    Tenth minute, very distinctly.
    Twenty-five hours afterwards none of the nails showed any lithium.
    Forty-four hours. Scrapings of the unvarnished nails on the hands and
feet showed lithium distinctly.      The further the scraping was carried the
less lithium was found.       The scrapings of the varnished nail of the hand
shows only traces of lithium.     The varnished nail of the foot has no lithium.
A small particle of the skin from the hand or foot shows lithium distinctly.
Perspiration shows lithium distinctly. The hair of the head or whiskers
shows no lithium.
    Third day. Nails the same as yesterday. The unvarnished nails show
lithium ; the varnished, none. Urine shows lithium most distinctly.
    Fourth day. Urine shows lithium in one drop.
    Fifth day. Urine still shows minute traces of lithium in one drop.

   Sixth day. Urine shows no lithium.         Ash of the urine shows faint traces
of lithium.
   Seventh day. Ash of urine shows no lithium.           Alcoholic extract shows
traces.
   Eighth day. Alcoholic extract from one ounce of urine still shows traces
of lithium.
    Ninth day. Alcoholic extract from one ounce of urine shows no lithium-
   Experiment 5. A boy, aged sixteen years, took five grains of chloride
of lithium, and the urine was passed every second minute.          Half an hour
previously he had eaten some bread and butter.          No lithium could be de
tected    in the urine previous  to the taking of the dose.
    Second minute, no lithium in the urine.
    Fifth minute, none.
    Ninth minute, none.
    Tenth minute, very faint traces of lithium.
    Thirteenth minute, lithium very distinctly present.
    After twenty-four hours lithium still very distinct.
    Second, third, fourth, and fifth day. Still very distinct.
    Seventh day. No lithium was found in the evaporated residue.         The ash
of the residue shows very slight traces.
    Eighth day. The alcoholic extract from one ounce of urine shows no
lithium.
    Experiment 6. The same boy had his hair, nails, and urine examined,
and no lithium was found.
    Five grains of carbonate of lithia was then given to him.
    In  two minutes, five minutes, ten minutes,     no lithium was found in the
urine.
    In  twenty minutes lithium was distinctly present.
    In  eighteen hours the lithium was found in the nails, none in the hair     of
the head.
    In thirty-two hours, still none in the hair of the head. Very distinctly in
 the root and tip of the nails.
    Another five grains of carbonate of lithia was then given.
    In  nineteen hours lithium was detected in the hair of the head.
    In  four days a drop    of the urine showed lithium very distinctly,   as  did
the hair and nails.
    In five days the same.
    In seven days one drop of the urine shows no lithium, but if the urine
is slightly concentrated by evaporation, lithium is still perceptible.
    In eight days one-eighth of an ounce evaporated still shows slight
traces.
    In nine days no lithium in one-eighth of an ounce of urine.
    Experiment 7. The same boy took five grains of carbonate            of lithia,
 but he omitted previously to empty his bladder.
     In  five minute?, lithium not yet detectable in the urine.

     Four days afterwards traces of lithium still in the urine.
     Five days afterwards slight traces in one-eighth of an ounce of urine
when evaporated.
     In six days afterwards no lithium perceptible in the urine.
     Experiment 8. Twenty-five grains of chloride of lithium were dissolved
in one gallon of water, and the feet and ankles of a man were kept in the
solution for two hours ; at the end of this time the urine was passed and
examined for lithium, aud no trace could be found in the aqueous extract
of the ash of one quarter of an ounce of urine.
     These     experiments agree very closely with some which I made many
years since on a full-grown German who had an open bladder, admitting
the urine to be caught as it came from the kidneys.

minutes.       Iron was detected once in seven minutes and twice in ten minutes,
and it was very distinct in fifteen minutes.
   Professor Mulder also made many experiments on this patient, but         I am
unable to find any account of his results.
   In   the 'Medical Gazette' for 1845, pp. 363 & 410, Mr. Erichsen gives
some experiments he made on a boy of thirteen who had an open bladder.
He    states that twenty grains    of ferrocyanide of potassium were detected in
one minute in the urine.         The stomach was fasting, and the salt was dis
solved in three ounces of water.         Forty grains taken three quarters of an
hour after a full meal were only detected after thirty-nine minutes.
    Forty grains in four ounces of water were twice detected in two minutes,
and no trace could be found after twentyrfour hours ; once in two minutes
and a half ; once in six minutes and a half ; once in fourteen minutes ;
once in twenty-seven minutes ; and once in thirty-nine minutes.
   Twenty grains of ferrocyanide he once detected for twenty-eight hours.
    It follows from these experiments that ten grains of carbonate or chloride
 of lithium, taken two and a half, three, or four hours after food by a man,

  I860.] into and       out of the Vascular and Non-vascular Textures.          416
 require between five and ten minutes to pass from the stomach to the urine,
 and this quantity of carbonate or chloride of lithium will continue to produce
 traces of lithium in the urine from six to seven, or even eight days.
     Five grains of chloride or carbonate of lithia, taken shortly after food by
 a boy, gives no appearance in the urine until from ten to twenty minutes,
 and this quantity continues to pass out for five, seven, or eight days.
     Experiments made by the ordinary mode of analysis showed that
     Four grains of sulphate of the protoxide of iron, taken almost fasting by
 a man, gave a trace in the urine in seven minutes.
     Seven grains gave distinct appearance in ten minutes          and ten minutes
 and   a half.
     One grain of iodide of potassium, taken by the same man fasting, appeared
 in  the urine in twelve minutes.
      Experiments    on the  Rate   of Passage of Lithium into and     out of the
                                    Crystalline Lens.
     Through the kindness of Mr. Bowman and Mr. Critchett at the Moor-
 fields Ophthalmic Hospital, lithia water, containing variable quantities of
 lithia, was given to different patients about to be operated on for cataract.
     Experiment 1 . The hard cataracts from two patients who had taken no
 lithia water were examined ; no trace of lithium could be found in either
lens.
    Experiment 2. The hard cataracts from two other patients who had no
lithia water were examined ; an aqueous extract of each lens was made ;
one showed the most excessively feeble lithium line ; the other lens did
not give the slightest indication.
    Experiment 3. The hard cataracts of two other patients who had taken
no lithia water were examined ; the alcoholic extract of the ash, after treat
ment with sulphuric acid, showed no lithium in either lens.
    The lens of a third patient was examined when no lithia water had been
taken, and the alcoholic extract showed no lithium.
    Experiment 4. The lens of         a man aged seventy was extracted      twenty-
five minutes after he had taken twenty grains of carbonate of lithia in
water on an empty stomach         ; no lithiIm could be detected in the lens.
    Experiment 5. A woman,         set. sixty-four, at 9 a.m. took twenty grains of
carbonate of lithia in      water;   both lenses were extracted at 11^ a.m. the
same day.      Neither of the lenses showed any lithium when touched with
a red-hot wire, but the aqueous extract of one lens showed lithium faintly,
and the aqueous extract of the other lens showed lithium distinctly.
    Experiment 6. An eye was removed three hours after twenty grains of
carbonate of lithia had been taken ; the lens was removed half an hour
afterwards, and on examination every portion of the lens contained lithium.
The circulation through the eye had been healthy, and the lens itself was
clear.
    Experiment    7.   The soft lens of    a girl aged fourteeq was examined after

 416             Dr. B. Jones     on the Passage   of Crystalloids       [1865.
 ten grains of carbonate of lithia in water had been taken five hours before
  the operation, and the same quantity four hours before extraction.
    The smallest fraction of the lens showed the lithium distinctly.
     Experiment 8. Another patient with two soft cataracts took twenty
 grains of carbonate of lithia seven hours before one operation ; but the
 capsule of the lens had been previously broken, so as to expose the cataract
 to the aqueous humour.
    Lithium was found very distinctly even in the smallest particle of the
 cataract.
     Four days after the first operation the capsule of the other lens was
  broken,  so as to expose the cataract to the aqueous humour ; and seven
 days after the first operation the second operation was performed.
    In this cataract not the slightest trace of lithium could be found.
    A  woman with diseased heart drank some lithia water, containing fifteen
 grains of citrate of lithia, thirty-six hours before her death ; and six hours
 before death she drank the same quantity.
    After death the crystalline lens, the blood, and the cartilage of one  joint
 were examined for lithium.
    The cartilage showed lithium very distinctly ; the blood showed lithium
 very faintly ; and when the entire lens was taken for a single examination,
 the faintest possible indications of lithium were obtained.
    Another patient five and a half hours before death drank lithia water
 containing ten grains of carbonate of lithia.
    After death the cartilage of one joint and the crystalline lens were
examined.
    The cartilage showed lithium very distinctly.      When half the lens was
taken for a single analysis, only very faint traces of lithium could be fouud.
    When no lithia had been taken, seven cataracts were examined most
carefully, and one only showed an exceedingly feeble trace of lithium.
    When twenty grains of carbonate of lithia were taken twenty-five minutes
before the operation, the lens showed no lithium ; the same quantity taken
two and a half hours before, showed lithium in the watery extract ; three
and a half hours before, showed lithium in each particle; between four and
five hours before, the same ; seven hours before, the same ; seven days
before, not the slightest trace of lithium.
    Thirty grains of carbonate of lithia, taken between six and thirty-six
hours before death, showed the faintest indications of lithium in the lens.
    Ten grains of carbonate of lithia taken five and a half hours before death,
gave only faint traces of lithium in the lens.
 On the Passage    of Solutions of Lithium    through the Textures after death.
    A  sheep's eye was examined after death and no lithium could be detected
in any part. Two other eyes were placed in a solution of chloride of
lithium containing one grain to one litre of water.         Twenty-three hours
 afterwards the lithium was found to have penetrated through the entire

 I860.]       into and out  of the Vascular   and Non-vascular   Textures.    417
 eye.     There was, however, a perceptible difference between the amount of
 lithium in the inner and outer part of the lenses.
     Two other sheep's    eyes had a small  portion of the cornea in front and the
 sclerotic removed at the back    ; they were then placed in a moderately strong
 solution of chloride   of lithium, aud the aqueous humour     was examined from
 time to time.
     After eighteen hours the aqueous humour showed lithium distinctly,
 and when the lens was extracted the lithium was found throughout its
 substance.
     Two other eyes were placed whole in a solution containing one-tenth of
a grain of chloride of lithium to one litre of water.
     In twenty-four hours the lithium had penetrated the entire eye. No
 difference was perceptible in different parts of the lens.
     The rate at which a solution of chloride of lithium diffused through the
stomach of a fresh-killed guinea-pig which had taken no lithium was de
 termined.
     A solution of one grain of chloride of lithium in twenty grains of water
 was put into the stomach, and it was hung up so that the solution gravi
 tated to the lowest part.        The outer side of the stomach opposite the
 solution was touched from time to time with a loop of platinum wire, which
was afterwards tested for lithium.
     In first minute.  No lithium came through the stomach.
     In second minute.     No lithium.
     In third minute. No lithium.
     In fourth minute. No lithium.
     In fifth minute. No lithium.
    In  sixth minute. Traces of lithium.
    In  seventh minute.      Traces of lithium.
    In  eighth minute. Lithium was very distinct.
    The stomach of another guinea-pig was filled with a solution of lithium
containing one grain of lithium in about half an ounce of water.              The
stomach was entirely filled and laid flat on a plate.           The ends of the
stomach and round the side showed lithium coming through in four minutes.
The upper part of the stomach showed the lithium coming through in
fifteen minutes.
            5.  On the Presence   of Lithium in Solid and Liquid Food.
    An ounce of each substance was taken.         It was dried or evaporated, and
incinerated carefully at a low red heat in a muffle on a platinum tray.       The
ash was tested for lithium first by taking a small fraction on a loop of a
platinum wire into the flame of the spectroscope.          When no lithium was
thus detected, the ash was treated with sulphuric acid, and heated to expel
the excess of acid ; the dry residue was extracted with absolute alcohol,
the solution filtered, evaporated to dryness, and the residue taken up in a
 drop   of water and tested by the spectroscope.

    I hope in a future paper, with the help of Dr. Dupre*, to show that Thal
lium, Rubidium, and Caesium, by spectrum analysis, can be traced even
into the crystalline lens, and to determine the rate at which they pass in, if
not out of, the textures ; and by other means we shall endeavour to trace
the passage of other crystalloids throughout the textures.
                                   Conclusions.
   1.  On the Rate   of Passage of Solutions of Lithium into        the Textures     of
                                       Animals.
    In  guinea-pigs, even in a quarter of an hour after three grains of
chloride of lithium are taken into the stomach, the lithium may be found
not only in all the vascular textures, but even in the cartilage of the hip-
joint, and in the humours of the eye.            If  the same quantity is injected
into the skin, in ten minutes it can be detected in the lens and everywhere ;
and even in four minutes the lithium may be detected everywhere except
in the lens.
    In half an hour after the    same quantity is taken into the stomach,      lithium
may be found in the crystalline lens.
    After it has been taken eight hours, it may not have passed completely
into the inner part of the lens.
    In twenty-six hours it will    be found    in every part of the lens.
    When half    a grain  only of chloride of lithium was taken, in less than

1865.]       into and out of the Vascular and Non-vascular Textures.             421
four hours traces were found in the lens. And even when only a quarter
of a grain was taken, faint traces of lithium were found in five and a half
hours.
2. On the Rate      of Passage of Solutions of Lithium       out of the Textures of
                                        Animals.
    After two grains of chloride of lithium, in six days neither a young
nor an old guinea-pig gave any lithium in the kidney, liver, or lenses.
    After two grains, in four days no lithium could be found in the lens, nor
in the cartilage of a joint.
    After one grain, iu three days the alcoholic extract of the lens showed no
lithium.
    After  a quarter  of    a grain  of chloride of lithium, in sixteen days the
minutest traces of lithium were detected in the liver, kidneys, and lens.
    After half a grain, for thirty-seven or thirty-eight days traces of lithium
could be found in the urine.
    After three grains, traces were found in the lens for thirty-three days,
and for thirty-nine days, the smallest quantity could be found in urine.
    The skin of guinea-pigs throws off lithium, and it collects on the hair and
 nails; so that it is possible for the animal to redose itself with lithia from
its own body, and thus to keep lithia passing in and out of the textures
 much longer than     if  a  single dose only were ti.ken.
 3. On the Rate    of Passage of Solutions of Lithium      in*and out of the Human
                                          Body.
    In ten-grain   doses,   lithium may   be found in the urine in from five to ten
 minutes, and continue to pass out for six or seven days.
    In five-grain doses it may be in the urine in from ten to twenty minutes,
 and continue to pass out even for eight days.
    In  twenty-grain doses, it may be found in small quantity in the crystal
 line lens in two and a half hours, and be present iu every particle of the lens
 in three and a half, five, and seven hours ; and no trace of lithium may be
 detectable in the lens after seven days, when twenty grains of the carbo
 nate of lithia had been taken.
            4. Results   of the   examination  of Solid and Liquid Food.
     Although almost every kind of vegetable food, and almost every fluid
 which we drink, contains infinitesimal quantities of lithia, yet rarely,
 if ever, can lithium be detected iu any part of the body of man or animals,
 unless some larger quantity is taken than ordinarily occurs in the food or
 drink.

          On the Passage       of Chloride of Rubidium into    the Textures.

  vol. nv.                                                            2  I

422               Dr. B. Jones on the Passage of Crystalloids                          [1865.
At 6.30    p.m   it was  killed.     Rubidium      was    not detectable anywhere         ;  not
even satisfactorily     in the urine.
     Another guinea-pig        was    given ten grains of chloride of rubidium                  at
1  1.20 a.m.      At  3 p   n.  scarcely any rubidium could be detected in                    the
urine.     The following day, at 11 a.m., it was given five grains more.                       At
2 p.m. rubidium was just detectable in the                urine.    The  next day,  at  2   p.m.,
it was again given five grains,          the rubidium       being  just  perceptible     in the
urine.     Twenty-five hours afterwards it was killed.
     Extremely minute traces of rubidium were found in the kidney and
                                                                                                in
the blood ; somewhat more, but still very faint traces, in the liver.                    In the
cartilages no rubidium could be found, nor in the aqueous
                                                                             humour      of the
eye.      When the whole lens was incinerated at once the smallest possible
 trace of rubidium      was found.        The urine showed traces of rubidium.
     An elderly man took nineteen grains of chloride of rubidium four hours
 before he was operated on for cataract.               The most careful search could not
 find any rubidium in the lens after its removal.
     Another patient, with a double cataract, was given twenty grains of
 chloride    of rubidium.       One lens was extracted ten hours afterwards, ao/1
 the other seven days afterwards, but in neither could traces of rubidium be
 found.
     It  was found by experiment that ,          6 '0 u u
                                                          of  a grain   of chloride of rubi
 dium in water was detectable by the spectrum analysis.                     ^
                                                                                   of   a   grain
  in urine could be distinctly observed.
            On the Passage       of Chloride of Ceesium into the Textures.
      Delicacy   of the   reaction for Casium. — One grain of chloride of               caesium
  in 400 cub. centims. of water just gives the blue              caesium lines in a   quantity
  of solution that can adhere to the loop of a platinum wire which took up
  0-05 of solution.       The -
                                  a 5
                                      L     part of a grain of chloride of caesium in
  water can be detected.           If   potassium is present       in the  same solution       the
  test is much less delicate.
      In  urine,   one grain of chloride of caesium in 200 cub. centims. is the
  limit of the reaction for a quantity remaining on the loop of the same wire
   as was previously used.         Hence               of a grain of chloride of caesium in
                                             ^2^^-
   urine can be detected.
      A guinea-pig was given three grains of chloride of caesium, and twenty
   hours   afterwards     another     three grains.       Twenty hours after the second
   quantity it was killed. The ash of the urine showed caesium slightly.
   No caesium could be detected in the two lenses taken for one examination ;
   nor in the liquid humours of the eyes. A small portion of the ash of the
   kidneys and liver showed no caesium, but aqueous extracts, after con
   centration, showed caesium faintly.            No caesium could be detected in the
   blood, nor in the bile.
       A guinea-pig was given six grains of chloride of caesium, and six grains
    more nineteen hours        afterwards    ; twenty-four hours after the second             dose

1865.]      into and out   of the Vascular and Non-vascular Textures. 428
it was killed.    No  caesium could     be found   in the lenses, nerves, aqueous
humour, blood, or bile.        Urine, kidney, and liver showed caesium slightly
in the aqueous    extract  of the  ash.
    A guinea-pig was given ten grains of chloride of caesium, and twenty
hours afterwards ten grains more. Twenty-seven hours after the second
dose it was killed.
    The evaporated and incinerated extract of the two lenses showed the
cfesium only faintly.       The aqueous humour of the eye showed caesium
faintly.    The evaporated and incinerated extract of the two large nerves
 of the legs showed caesium pretty distinctly.
          On the Passage    of Sulphate of Thallium into     the Textures.
    A  rabbit was given one grain of sulphate of thallium. 'J he urine, passed
 two hours after the first dose, gave the reaction very clearly.
    Another rabbit was given three grains of sulphate of thallium, and it
 was killed twenty-one hours and a half afterwards.           This rabbit took no
 food after the dose    of thallium, but the stomach        was  found  completely
 full of dry food. Thallium        was   found in the kidneys, liver, and spleen,

 of substance adhering to the wire into the flame. The blood, lens, and
 cartilage showed none in this manner. The aqueous extract, however, of
 the coagulated blood and lens showed thallium distinctly.           The cartilage
  of the hip could not     be thus     examined, owing to the small quantity to
 be got.
     Another rabbit was given three grains of sulphate of thallium, and it

     A  guinea-pig was given two grains of sulphate of thallium, and twenty
  hours afterwards it took two grains more ; twenty-two hours after the
  second dose it was killed.        The urine showed thallium only after con
  centration.   Small pieces of the liver, kidney, cartilage of the short ribs,
  and large nerve of the leg showed thallium distinctly.               Humours of
  the eye showed thallium distinctly.           Aqueous extract of the lenses to
  gether  showed  it distinctly.     The   blood  showed no thallium directly, but
  the aqueous extract of a small quantity of coagulated blood showed
  the thallium very faintly. The brain showed the thallium also very faintly.
  The toe-nails showed the thallium very distinctly; and the hair of the
  belly also showed it very distinctly.
     Another guinea-pig was given two grains of sulphate of thallium, and
  it was killed in six hours.          The aqueous extract of the lens showed

  extract of the two large nerves showed no thallium.

and stomach       showed silver fairly, by means of galvanic precipitation of
silver or copper.      The ash of the bile showed silver rather less distinctly.
The ash of the urine showed the silver only very slightly. The ash of
the lenses     showed only very slight traces of silver, and the ash         of the
brain showed none.

    A guinea-pig was given four grains of chloride of strontium         ;  in seven

though     a  whole lens was taken for the examination by the spectrum
analysis.
    Another guinea-pig was given ten grains of chloride of strontium ; in
fourteen hours and a half it was killed.        A small quantity of urine showed
no strontium, and no strontium was found in the ashes of the kidney or

    To  a  third guinea-pig    half a grain of chloride of strontium   was   given.
Nineteen     hours afterwards the urine showed traces of strontium,       and then

another     grain  was  given;   and  twenty-four hours after this half a grain
more.      Twenty-seven hours afterwards another half grain of chloride of
strontium     was given.     At this time then the urine showed strontium very
distinctly.     On  the  sixth day another half grain, and again on the seventh,
eighth, ninth, tenth, and eleventh day, until five grains and a half were
taken.      The twelfth day it was killed.      The urine showed strontium dis

    1865.]             Pendulum Base Observations       for India.             425
    " An   Account    of the Base Observations made at the Kew Observa
          tory with the Pendulums to be used in the Indian Trigonome
          trical Survey."    By Balfour Stewart, M.A., LL.D., F.R.S.,
          Superintendent of the Kew Observatory, and Benjamin Loewy,
          Esq.    Received June 13, read June 15, 1865.
       Her Majesty's Indian Government, on the recommendation of the Royal
   Society, lately decided that pendulum observations shall be made at different
   stations in India in connexion with the Great Trigonometrical Survey of
   that country.
       The object of these proposed observations may be stated in a very few
   words. The labours of those engaged in the Trigonometrical Survey have
   already disclosed the fact that the direction of the plumb-line in the north
  ern stations of India was influenced to some extent by the mass of the
  Himalayas, and it was therefore thought highly desirable that the influ
  ence   of these mountains upon the intensity of terrestrial gravity should    be
  investigated in addition to their influence upon its direction. The propriety
  of this view will at once be evident, if we reflect that by knowing the
  change produced not only upon the direction of gravity, but also on its
 intensity, we know at once all the particulars of the disturbing mountain-
 force both as regards magnitude and direction.
      It was therefore with the view of ascertaining the alteration which these
 mountains might cause upon the intensity of gravity that the Indian pen
 dulum observations were decided upon.         In consequence of this decision.
 Captain Basevi, R.E., and first assistant in the Survey department,     was ap
 pointed    to superintend  the observations,   and instructed  to repair to the
 Kew Observatory previously to his departure for India, in order to become
 acquainted with the necessary instruments, their adjustment, and the
 method of observing with them.
     After attending daily at the Observatory from the beginning of Septem
ber to the middle of November, this officer was perfectly instructed in
every particular necessary for the practical      part of these observations,  as
well as for their calculation and reduction.      He was then obliged to   leave
for India, being prevented by his early departure from making the necessary
base determinations    with the instruments at Kew Observatory.
    The best arrangement of apparatus formed the subject of careful discus
sion with Colonel Walker, Superintendent of the Indian Survey ; and the
experimental arrangements ultimately adopted received the sanction of this
officer, who, besides suggesting several improvements, made himself tho
roughly acquainted with all the details of the apparatus.

    A   room suitable for these observations was constructed in the south-east
corner of the Observatory, the expenses of which were defrayed from the
Government          Grant Fund of the Royal Society.
    The following simple diagram will         be sufficient to show the experimental
arrangement in the Pendulum-room.

       pillar bearing a slub attached also to the wall at W, to which the receiver (R) is
       rigidly  fixed.
 T  is the telescope for the observations of the coincidences, mounted on a pillar which
       stands in a depression, so that the observer is not under the necessity of kneeling
       down during the observation.
     In   every other part the arrangement is entirely similar to that de
 scribed by General Sabine in the Philosophical Transactions for 1829, —with
 this difference, that the receiver was in our experiments a copper one with
 glass windows.         The whole of the apparatus was made by Mr. P. Adie,
  who-deserves the highest praise for the excellent manner in which the work
  was executed by him.
      The pendulums used were those marked                    No. 1821 and No. 4, used
  formerly by General Sabine          in  different     parts of the globe. The former
  was also used by Mr. Airy in his Harton experiments.
                  Method  of registering and      reducing the Observations.
      The manner in which the number of vibrations, made by a detached
   pendulum, are determined from a series of observed coincidences with the
   pendulum of a clock has been so often described, that we may refer to the
   writings of Kater, Sabine, Daily, and others on the subject.                 The esta
   blished methods have been followed throughout in these experiments, and

the only change introduced was a very slight one, with the view                                     of obtaining
a more correct arc of vibration.
    It is usual
             to observe the arc a little after the coincidence, which does not
give the true arc corresponding to it. To obviate this, the arc was read in
our series about 30 seconds before, and again 30 seconds after each observed
coincidence, marking first the right edge of the tailpiece and then the left
one.      If
          we call these four readings of the scale a, b, c, d, we may consider
                                               (a~b) + (c~d)

as a very exact representation                   of the reading for the arc at the instant of
the coincidence.
    The adjustment  of the diaphragm, disk, and tailpiece was made very
carefully at the commencement    of the experiments.   Nevertheless it was
found slightly deranged when the pendulum was reversed.      In this case,
as is well known, the disappearance and reappearance of the disk are not
each instantaneous           ;    but    we see   first     one      side of the disk, then the other
disappear, and in the same order reappear, so that we have four events,

will give us the time of coincidence.                           In   a   few sets of our series the first
formula was used         ;       but   it      that the correct registration in

in one instance preferable to stop the clock and repeat the adjustment, and
afterwards    similar derangement was rectified by
                 a                                       lateral motion of the  a

nicety without stopping the clock.

former experimenters.                   It

of star-transits, the results of which are given in Table I. The rate was
somewhat unequal during the experiments, the range being equal to -;^ths
of a second ; and besides, the unfavourable state of the weather occasioned
longer intervals between the observations than was desirable.                 To free the
results as far as possible from any errors arising from this source, the rates
were represented in a series, as shown in Table II., which also gives the
actual number       of vibrations made by the sidereal clock in             a mean    solar

1865.]                   Pendulum Base Observations                     for India.               431
  C. Correction          for   temperature.         — Two         thermometers     were fixed, one to
the lower, the other to the upper part of a brass bar, which was made by
Mr. Adie, of precisely the same form as the pendulums.
   The brass bar being fixed near the middle of the receiver, close to the
swinging pendulum, every change in the temperature of the latter was of
course shared by the brass bar, and indicated by the two thermometers,
which were extremely sensitive and read to *05 of a degree.  The readings
of these two thermometers were in the first instance corrected for index-
error.  The instruments having been very carefully compared with the
Kew Standard, a table of index-errors was made from these comparisons,
and, by interpolation, giving the errors from degree to degree. Another
correction was applied for the observations in the exhausted receiver on
account of the effect of exhaustion on the glass tubes of the thermometers.
This effect was determined very accurately by a series of experiments at
Kew, and found to              be equal for both                  thermometers,    and amounting to
0°*43  for a decrease in pressure of 29*210 inches.                                This correction is
smaller than that assumed by General Sabine and the late Mr. Baily, who
make it      J
           of a degree for the thermometers which they employed.
  Our experiments showed the remarkable fact that the correction is by no
means proportional to the decrease in pressure. The diminution of the pres

             gives the mean temperature found in this manner for each ex
periment, and shows the mean of all observed temperatures for each pendu
lum, to which temperature all the experiments made with that pendulum
have been reduced. For this reduction    would have been bestitwe had had                if
 an opportunity of swinging the pendulums at extremes of temperature, say
 about 50° distant from each other. But the desirability of sending the appa
 ratus to India under the care of -Mr. Hennessey, who left    the March mail,       by

432                  Pendulum Base Observations         fur India.             [1865.
prevented such a course, and we availed ourselves of the elaborate series of
experiments on the temperature corrections of pendulums, made by General
Sabine (vide Phil. Trans. 1830, p. 251), which gives 0144 vibration per
diem for each degree of Fahrenheit's scale.             General Sabine found in a
former series this correction nearer to 0-43 ; and he says, in the above men
tioned publication, " The probable error which may be incurred by employ
ing the correction 0-44 for each degree as now determined, can only be very
inconsiderable    ; but when the differencesof temperature amount to 50°, which
is a case of actual experience in pendulum observations, the question of
whether 0143 or 0-44, for example, be the more correct value, involves an
uncertainty    in the ultimate result   of no  less than   half  a vibration a day."
   The pendulums which       we used were not those employed by General        Sabine
in his determinations, but they were made by the same maker at the same
time, and very probably from the same kind of brass, and there cannot be
the least doubt that the true correction           will lie between 0-43 and 0-44.
We have therefore adopted 0-435 for our reductions              ; and as the greatest
difference  in  temperature   between   a single experiment and the mean is less
than 11°, the greatest error would in this case amount only to -;-g^ths of a
vibration per diem, an error too small to affect seriously the mean result          of
the whole.
   At the    same    time we must state that, as Colonel Walker and Captain
Basevi inform us, experiments will be made in India with both pendulums,
to ascertain their exact constants with regard to expansion, and that our
results will of course have then to be modified accordingly.

    This correction has        been  only applied to the ultimate mean number of
vibrations     of each pendulum.
    Taking     Bessel's   value for the semiaxis major and the eccentricity of the
earth, and h— 17*5 feet as given by measurement and the known height of
our standard barometer, the logarithm of the factor for this correction is

  44.0               Dr. Davy on the Temperature,              §c., of Birds.           [1865.
  "  Some Observations on Birds, chiefly relating to their Temperature,
          with Supplementary additions on their Bones." By John Davy,
          M.D., F.R.S., &c.            Received May 26, 1865 *.
      The observations which          I  have now the honour to submit to the Royal
   Society, have been made with the hope of contributing something to the
  elucidation of the high temperature for which birds as a class are remark
   able.
        I. Of the      Temperature      of the   Common Fowl (Gallus domesticus).
      Mr. Hunter, in his paper entitled " Of the Heat, &c. of Animals and
  Vegetables," published in the Philosophical Transactions for 1778, states
  that he found the temperature of the common fowl, both male and female,
  in the intestinum rectum between 103° and 104° of Fahr. From such ob
  servations as     I  have made, both in Ceylon and in England, it would appear
  that the temperature of this bird is considerably higher.                  In the former I
  found it as high in recto as 110° aud 1 1 1°, and this in December, when the
  average temperature of the atmosphere, in that part of the island where the
  trials were made, is about 77°, which was the temperature of the air at the
  very time.       In the latter I have found it to vary from 107° to 109° *. That
  the temperature of the common fowl should be a little lower in England
 than in Ceylon, is no more than might be expected, from the analogy of
 the difference of temperature of man in the two climates ; and, in accord
 ance, in the     fowl   I  have found that even in England there is a slight differ
 ence in favour       of the warmest months, comparing the results then obtained
 with those in the coldest.
     Of the want of agreement between Mr. Hunter's results and mine I can
 offer no satisfactory explanation.            I have thought it right to advert to them,
 he being so deservedly a high authority in physiology.                  Were his results to
 be depended on, then, were the common fowl to be considered as a fair ex
 ample of the temperature of birds generally, they could hardly be consi
 dered as a class peculiar for highness of temperature, some of the mammalia
 having a temperature differing but little from that which he assigns to the
 common fowl f.           Or, if not a fair example, then an exception, and the
    * Read June 15,     180.*». See Abstract, page 337.
    f The trials from which the last-mentioned results were obtained have been made
during the last two or three years, using a delicate thermometer of Negretti arid Zambra
made for the purpose, which hud been compared with a standard instrument.                  The
fowla tried wero all barn-door fowls, living at large, and having the run of afield. The
number of females examined was 37, of males 25. The mean temperature of the former
in  recto was 107°64 ; the highest 109°, the lowest 107° ; of the latter the mean tempe
rature was 108°-25, the highest 109°, the lowest 107°.
    } In
           Ceylon I  found the temperature of the blood of the wild hog, as it flowed from
the divided great cervical vessels, 10t)°, and that of the pig in England, in two instances,
of the   same degree ; both were in excellent condition,    and were killed in December    ;  of
one tho temperature       of the blood   was tried ; of the other, the cavity of the abdomen.
Tho temperature of the sheep         I  have found   to vary from 103° to 105° in recto  ;   the
latter in Ceylon.

    common fowl would have to be placed amongst those birds, few in number,
    chiefly palmipedes, ocean-birds, peculiarfor lowness of temperature*. Now,
    as neither   of   these conclusions     is admissible, it seems unavoidable that           Mr.
    Hunter's results must       be received as inaccurate.
    II. Of the expired Air,       and   of the Air        in the Air-receptacles and Bones       of
                                               Birds.
       1.        expired air. — That which I have examined has been obtained
            Of the
    from birds in the act of drowning. It is worthy of remark, may premise,       I
    and I am not aware that the fact has been noticed by any previous in
    quirer, that different birds vary as to their power of retention of life under
    water.   The goose expires          I
                                    have found in about ten minutes ; the duck
in about the same time ; the common barn-door fowl in about four or four
and a half minutes ; the turkey in about three minutes ; the jay in about a
minute and a half ; the pigeon, the carrion-crow, rook, jackdaw, in about a
minute ; the robin, the hedge-warbler in about the same time ; the black
bird in about three-quarters of a minute ; the tawny owl, the bullfinch,
the house-sparrow, in about half-a-minute.      Those birds which are capable
of retaining the air longest emit little air commonly when first submerged ;
but later, shortly before the extinction of life, they expel it in large quan
tities ; those, on the contrary, especially the smaller birds, which soonest
die, expel no air in the act of drowning.
    I have examined the air from the goose in one instance only ; it was a
portion of the last emitted.     Tested by milk of lime and phosphorus, it
was   found  to consist of 7*5 carbonic acid gas, 92-5 azote.
    The air from a duck, a small portion collected after four minutes' sub
mersion, was composed             of 2-38 carbonic acid, 9-52 oxygen, 88-10 azote.
From another duck two portions of air were tried, one after five minutes'
submersion, the other after between eight and ten. The first consisted of
7*5 carbonic acid, 7-5 oxygen, 85 azote ; the second of 15-7 carbonic acid,
4*1 oxygen, 80-2 azote.
   From the common fowl the air was examined in two instances                          ;   in both
it was that which was emitted           near death.           Of   one, the composition was 6-18
carbonic acid, 5*08 oxygen, 82-84 azote                   ;   of the other,   3*3 carbonic   acid,
7*79 oxygen, 88-89 azote.
      From    a pigeon, the air emitted        (it   was      pretty considerable in quantity)
consisted     of   11*1   oxygen, 89-7 azote.
  From these results, and from       few others which
                                             a            have obtained,  I                     it
would appear that in the air expired                 by
                                         birds in the act of drowning there

is a certain loss        of carbonic acid,     a loss equivalent     to the proportion of
oxygen less than exists in the atmospheric air inspired ; and it may be in
ferred that the deficient carbonic acid was absorbed and retained in the blood;
and that      it was   so, was indicated     by the very dark colour of the blood ob
 tained by the division of        the great cervical vessels immediately after the
extinction of life, and further by the large quantity of air that was disen
gaged from the blood when subjected to the air-pump *.
     2.  Of   the   air from the air-sacs. — On the air from these receptacles              I
have made the following experiments               : —
     From    a  turkey killed by drowning, a portion of air was collected by a
puncture       made under water into the air-vesicles under the sternum. It was
 found to consist of 15*5 carbonic acid, 84-5 azote.
     From    a duck deprived      of life in the    same manner, a portion        of air was
 obtained from the abdominal            air- receptacles.     It  was composed     of 10*52
 carbonic acid, 5*26 oxygen, 88-32 azote.
     These results would seem to warrant the inference that the very delicate
 membrane of which the air-receptacles are formed, is like that of the air-
 cells of the lungs pervious to air ; and the further inference, that the defi
 cient carbonic acid in the air examined was owing to its absorption by the
 blood.
     3.  Of the air      contained in the bones.    — The    experiments    I  have made on
 this air have been confined chiefly to that of           the humerus.        I may  premise
 that in every instance in which I have examined                  the lining membrane of
 the hollow bones of birds (the air-containing bones), I have found it dis
 tinctly vascular ; in this respect differing from the membrane of the air-
 receptacles communicating with the lungs situated in its thoracic and ab
 dominal cavities.         Not unfrequently, both in the humeri and femora, the
 vessels have had the appearance             of being varicose, and this when the ex
 amination was made a few minutes after death.
     From the humerus of a common fowl, killed by drowning, a portion of
 air obtained was found to be composed of 4-7 oxygen, 95-3 azote. The
 bone was dissected out under water, and its head there removed to allow
  free exit to the included air.
      From the humerus of another fowl killed by the division of the great
  cervical vessels, the air procured consisted of 8-3 carbonic acid, 8-3 oxygen,
  83*4 azote. In this instance the bone was dissected out under water, whilst
  the fowl was still warm. No air escaped until the delicate bony tissne (the
  reticulated structure) was broken through, and indeed then but little,
  until the head of the bone had been removed.
     * Two    trials of the blood were made, one in which the blood wae received in water
  previously purged of air, the other in which it was received in weak solution of potaas*,
  also exhausted of air by tho pump : the difference was remarkable, so much air being
  disengaged from the first, so little from tho second.
     It may be deserving of mention that in the instance in which the blood diluted with
  water was allowed to coagulate, no air was disengaged by the action of the pump until
  the resisting clot was broken up, when the disengagement on exhaustion was copious.

1865.]              Dr. Davy on      the Temperature,     eye, of Birds.               443
    From     a  third fowl,  a cock weighing ten pounds and three-quarters,          killed
in the same manner as the last, the air from the humerus,                measuring one-
tenth of a cuhic inch, consisted         of 15 oxygen and 85 azote.
     From the humerus of        a rook, a few minutes after the     bird had   been shot,
the air obtained,       measuring -22 cubic inch, was composed of            11   carbonic
acid, 89 azote.
     From the humerus of a tawny owl, three days after the death of the bird
by drowning, the air collected consisted of 5*5 carbonic acid, 5-5 oxygen,
 89 azote.
     Though these results are not so uniform as might be expected, they seem
 to prove that the air in the bones undergoes the same change as in the air-
 sacs, and that there is an absorption, more or less, of the carbonic acid
 formed by the blood contained in the vessels             of the lining membrane, the
 quantity varying according to circumstances.              It may be conjectured that
 the difference in the results may partly be owing to the air-passage, the fo
 ramen or foramina, in the head of the bone, being more free in some in
  stances than in others
              III.   On Pulmonary and Cutaneous Aqueous Exhalation.
     The loss of water by exhalation from the lungs in the air expired, and
 from the cutaneous covering of the body by evaporation, must be con
 sidered material elements in the problem of the animal heat of birds.                  And
 inasmuch as birds drink but little, inasmuch as their skin generally is very
 thin, dry, and little vascular; further, as the air in expiration has to
 pass over a considerable length of surface of comparatively low tempera
 ture before it enters the open air, their loss of heat owing to these condi
 tions     must be small,      and more especially so, taking into account the
  admirable covering of feathers, such bad conductors of heat, with which
  they are provided.
      The only experiments I have to describe bearing in part on what has
 just been stated, chiefly the last-mentioned, are the following on the rate
  of cooling.
      Two fowls, hens of the       same brood, were selected      for trial. The weight
  of each after loss of blood, having been         killed  by  the  division of the great
  cervical vessels, was five pounds.         The temperature of one (No. 1), ascer
  tained just before, was 107°-25 in recto ; of the other (No. 2), 108°.                 The
  latter was rapidly deprived of its feathers, with the exception of the wings,
  whilst on the other they were left on. Both were suspended by the legs,
     *  I have occasionally found a delicate transparent membrane connecting some      of the
   eancolli.  Invariably the opening into the humerus is obstructed by the nauscle attached
  to the cavity in which the foramen or foramina above mentioned are situated. Mr. Hunter
  found when the trachea of a cock was tied, and " the wing cut through the os humeri,"
  the passage of air to the lungs was so difficult as to render it impossible for the animal
  to livo longer than to prove that it breathed through the cut bone.     — Observations   on

  These results seem sufficient to show that birds owe much                                         of their high
temperature,   especially its preservation, to their clothing of feathers.
Further, it may be remarked in proof of the little activity of their cuticular
structure (except, indeed, in the growth of feathers), that birds are never
observed to eat,    or have their feathers wet from condensation on them
of perspired moisture ; nor am I aware that their breath becomes visible,
to use a popular expression, in the coldest weather.   And in accordance
it would appear, comparing birds with animals of other classes, that the
proportion of their aqueous element is somewhat less, which also harmo
nizes with an inconsiderable cooling effect from cutaneous evaporation — a
fact which some of the results given seem to prove, and as is shown by the
following, so far    as trials     on the dead are applicable, inferentially                                      to the
living animal.
  Of four  sparrows just shot, one (No. 1) weighing 414-5 grs. was sus

                     IV. — Of the Kidneys and their Excretion.
     Another element in the problem of the temperature of birds is the kidneys,
with th        excretion.     As is well known, these organs in birds are propor
tionally large and active-; their secretion, not inconsiderable in quantity,
and formed chiefly of urate of ammonia, is voided in a state far removed
from the liquid, hardly semifluid from the little water it contains.                Hence
in the performance of the function there is but little loss of heat. Moreover,
as it would appear from ultimate analysis that the urate contains less
 oxygen than urea, there must be a less expenditure of oxygen in its forma
 tion, leaving more for a more profitable conversion into carbonic acid.
      What are the general conclusions which are admissible from the pre
 ceding results ?
       Do they not warrant the inference that the high temperature of birds is
 owing to a combination of circumstances, some positive, some negative ; the
 one, the positive, acting      through the air inspired and the conversion of oxy
 gen into carbonic acid gas, productive of heat ; the other, the negative con
  ditions, such as those mentioned, influential mainly by economizing the heat
  when produced, or checking its escape ?
       Besides these negative conditions, it may be open to question, consider
  ing the proportional smallness of the lungs of birds, and the smallness of
  the nerves with which they are supplied, whether there are not other cir
  cumstances concerned of an ancillary kind — such, to enumerate some of
  the most probable, as a powerful heart, especially a powerful left ventricle ;
  the quality of their blood, that but little viscid, as indicated by the little,
  if any tendency of the red corpuscles to collect in piles * ; the large pro
  portion of these corpuscles, and their nucleated structure, a structure with,
  which may be connected an electrical influence.
       If the chief use of the peculiar pneumatic system of birds be to secure
  a high temperature, it is probable, and is in part already admitted, that it
  may subserve other uses inferior only in degree of importance in relation
   to the habits and well-being of the class : for instance, as generally ad
   mitted, it may conduce to great power of flight in some, to running power
   in others, to vocal power in a third ; and, in all, may not the thorough,
   aeration of the blood, as denoted by its more florid hue even in the veins,
   be essential to the energy, to that intensity of action and endurance for
   which the muscles of those birds in which the structure under considera
   tion is most developed, are so remarkable ?
       The subject in its entireness, it must be allowed, is full          of interest.  It
    affords in the variety of structure         exhibited by different birds, supple
    mentary   to  the  lungs,  ample   scope  for further research.      Why some birds,
    such as the woodcock, the snipe, the swallow, birds of rapid and long
    flight, should be destitute of air in their bones ; why the small birds, with
    few exceptions, the tits for instance, some of the smallest, should expe-
       * In no instance have  I seen the blood-corpuscles of any bird to cohere and form
    rouleaux or piles, nor bove I seen a buffy coat on the blood of birds.

1865.]          Dr. Davy on      the Temperature,      fyc,   of Birds.                4A7
rience the same exemption ; why one bird, the apteryx, a solitary example
should be without air not only in every part of its osseous system, but also
without air-sacs ; and another bird, the grouse, not remarkable for power
of flight, should have air in its femora as well         as humeri,         are   questions
which at present it may      difficult to answer, but which, it may be hoped,
                            be
were careful and minute inquiry instituted, might be satisfactorily accounted
for on the teleological principle of fitness of structure to use.
  If I may be allowed to offer a conjecture, it seems to me probable that
in our commonly received generalization relative to the consumption of
oxygen in the respiration of birds, the quantity presumed to be used has
been overrated, and that in many instances the expenditure of this gas may
be found to be less   proportionally than in the mammalia.
  As supplementary to the preceding observations, I would beg to state
some further particulars respecting birds, the results of the inquiry in
         I
which have been engaged.
  1st.    Of the birds   examined.   — All of them    were natives        of the Lake Dis
trict, with two or three exceptions which will be specified, and all were
obtained between November and March, excepting those marked with an
asterisk, which were shot in April and May.     They may be divided into
two sections, one including those birds in one or more of the bones of
which air was found to exist communicating with the lungs.       The other,
of those birds in which in the corresponding bones no air could be detected.
The birds were all at least one year old, an ample time, I apprehend, for
the marrow which exists probably in the bones of every individual of the
class at the time of hatching, and for some time after, to be absorbed in
those in which it is not permanently present.
   It may be right to remark that in every instance the question whether
air was present or not was determined by an examination of the contents
of the particular bones, and not merely from their appearance, which, as
regards colour, is sometimes deceptive.
   Of the birds belonging to the first section, the bones, which are named
after each, were those only in which air was found,                 •*.

   Of the birds in each section, the crania, with some exceptions, contained
air. The skull of the water-ouzel is one of the exceptions.                 It is not cel
lular like that of the majority, but compact and sinks in water.               Its greater
heaviness may be suitable to the habits of the bird, seeking its prey in the
bed of ruuning streams with its head downmost.                 The same compactness
of bone is seen in the crania of          the   Scolopacidae.      This compactness is
remarkably     contrasted    with  the  cellular  state  of  cranium    of certain other
birds, in which     it is most strongly ^marked, where lightness as well as power
of resistance is   needed,    such as that of the owls and tits.
   There are certain bones which in the adult stage of the bird appear to
be   without both marrow and air        ;  the scapular arch is occasionally an ex
ample of    this, especially its posterior wing*, and also the sternum.
    Professor Rudolph 1Wagner, in his 'Elements of Comparative Anatomy*
(English translation), refers to the blackbird and thrush as instances of
birds which have         air in their femora.       I  have    sought for air in these
bones in all the thrushes          I have examined,        seven different species, but
have found only marrow.           If verified it would be a curious fact, that in
one country air should occur in the bones in question and in another
marrow.
   Whether the circumstance of the presence or absence of air in the bones
is deserving of attention in the classification of birds, may be worthy of the
consideration of the naturalist. In all the tits I have examined, and the
number has been considerable, especially of the blue tit, I have never found
marrow in the humeri, and the same remark applies to these bones in the
larks, but not to those of the pipits.
    2nd. Of the proportions of certain parts of birds as determined by weigh
ing. — In the Table which follows a statement is given of results, comprising
the weight of the birds examined, of their feathers, and, with a few excep

and after drying, that the difference or loss was 12-5 per cent.

inserted, the heading of the other columns is sufficiently distinctive.                          The
primates of the wings and the quill-feathers of the tail in each instance were

by two weighings, one before, the other after the feathers bad been taken
out, the loss, including the whole of the quill-feathers, showing the total
amount.        When    a trial was made of more than             one   of  a species,   the results
have been inserted, on the idea that possibly they may be of some interest
in relation to variations ; these no doubt depending on many circumstances,
 such as sex, condition as to fatness, and others less easy                   of appreciation.

the quill tail-feathers, is well known to the naturalist.  In all the instances
in which I have weighed the primates of each wing,        have found them, if  I
not precisely of the same weight, to differ in the smaller birds not more
than by     *1   or   -01 grain, and in the larger the difference has rarely exceeded
1 grain ; a degree of equality this which might be expected, as essential
to the regularity of flight ; and small as it                  is,

   Comparing their bones, those of the larger and more powerful, as might
also be anticipated, appear, too, proportionally heaviest.
   Comparing individuals of the same species, whether as to the total weight
of birds, or of feathers and bones, variations will be found to occur. The
skylarks may be mentioned as examples, and also the tits, the former ob

     The results given in the preceding Table may justify the remark, — a con
clusion that might be anticipated, that generally the comparative weight of
the bones of each species of birds bears a relation to the power exercised
by the limbs on parts to which they belong ; of this striking examples are
afforded in the instances of the upper and lower extremities of the buzzard
and common fowl ; of the one, the buzzard, a bird of powerful flight, the
wing-bones are proportionally the heaviest ; whilst of the other, the fowl,
which makes so little use of its wings and so much use of its legs, the
opposite is the case     ; and other contrasts not less striking are noticeable.
     Also, as might be anticipated, and in accordance with what was before
 observed of the feathers, the primates of each wing, the weight of the bones
 of each    was found to be nearly the same,            the difference being no greater
 than might be expected from the mode of              preparing them.
     4th. Of the Composition of some of the principal bones. — This was
 ascertained by calcination, by which merely the proportion of animal or
 combustible matter was determined and that               of the incombustible, chiefly
 phosphate of lime.        I shall first give the results of the trials on humeri
 and femora : in each instance the shafts of these bones were selected ; and
 previously to a thorough drying over steam, they were deprived of their
 investing membrane internally as well as externally.                 Though the quantities
 employed did not exceed a few grains, and were even less than a grain from
  some of the smaller birds, yet as the weighing was carefully made to the
  one hundredth of a grain, the results may be received as tolerably reliable
  for comparison.

      If inferences   may be drawn from these results, they seem to favour the
   conclusion, first, that the proportion of phosphate of lime is somewhat greater
   in the bones of birds, the cylindrical of the extremities, than in the like
  bones of the Mammalia        ; and secondly, that the composition of those con
   taining air and of those containing marrow is much the same, which is not

in accordance with a statement that has been made, that the former have
a larger proportion     of earthy constituents *.
     It may generally be stated, I believe, that the composition and structure
of   each particular bone has relation to its function, — that where unyielding
resistance is required, there, cateris paribus, the proportion of phosphate
of lime is largest, as witnessed in the majority of the long bones of the ex
tremities    ; that where yielding and elasticity are needed, the proportion of
animal matter is somewhat more considerable, as seen in the sternum, cra
nium, ribs, and maxillae.
     Also it may    be generally stated,     I  believe, that in different species of the
same     family   or genus of birds, the composition of corresponding bones
varies comparatively little ; and that where there is a variation, it too is
 connected with use, irrespective of size.               And the same remark, I am dis
posed to infer, would be near the truth relative to the proportional weight
 of the bones in different      species.        The following results        are  offered   in
 illustration.

      Of the  above,  some   of the crania were cellular, others were compact,
  sinking in water. The crania of the owl and water-ouzel, as already men
  tioned, are extreme examples, and yet their proportion of phosphate
  of lime and animal matter is much the same, both conditions of bone, the
  very cellular structure of the one, and the compact structure of the other
  without cells, being suitable to the habits of the individual, — in the owl,
  great strength with lightness ; in the water-ouzel, strength with a compa

     Here    I would beg to offer a few remarks more on the               subject of the bones
of birds.       It is stated, and by so high an authority as Professor Wagner,
 that their hollow bones are whiter than those filled with marrow.                          Gene
 rally this is a fact, and for the reason that, being translucent, the latter owe
 their colour to the marrow within them. Accordingly their colour varies
 with the colour of the marrow.             Thus in some in which the marrow is of a
light    hue,  almost   white,  as  in  the    instance of the tawny owl, its ulna and
 radii are so white as to suggest their containing air.                  In another (the yel
 low-hammer), in which the marrow is of a bright yellow, as is also the fat,
 the long bones have the same hue.                 The same hue is seen in the bones of
 the cuckoo, and from the same cause,                  and also, but in a less degree, in
 those of the greenfinch.         Nor    are there wanting examples            of a dark colour
 of the bones, from a dark         colour    of   the marrow : those of the little sand
 piper may be mentioned as an instance.                    Generally it may be remarked
 that the femora are darker than the humeri ; and that the lower portion o-f
 the tibiae is very much lighter than their upper, corresponding to the colour
 of the marrow in each. Another circumstance influencing the colour of
 the bones of birds is the degree of thickness of their walls.                      The thicker
      * The bone of the under bill of the godwit, like that of      the majority of the long-billed
  birds, is very slender and remarkably elastic, especially its anterior portion, that which
 is covered   with integuments and a hard horny cuticle; the same portion is cellular and
 very vascular, suitable for renewing the growth of the beak as it is wasted in use, a
 remark more or less applicable to the beak of birds generally.

                                       (Abstract.)
    In a   recent note *   we have briefly described the synthesis of butyric and
 diethacetic ethers by acting consecutively upon acetic ether with sodium
 and the iodide of ethyl.         In the present paper we have the honour to lay
before the Royal Society the detailed results of one section of this research,
embracing the action        of sodium and the iodides of methyl, ethyl, and amyl
upon acetic ether.
            I. Action of Sodium      and  Ethyl Iodide upon Acetic Ether.
    When acetic ether is treated with sodium at a temperature gradually
rising to 120° C., hydrogen is evolved, and a thick brownish liquid pro
 duced   ;  the latter solidifies  on cooling to a yellowish mass, presenting the
appearance of beeswax.           On digesting this solid mass with ethylic iodide
at 100° C. for several hours, a number          of products are formed, which on the
addition     of water, may    be  distilled off from a residue consisting chiefly of
iodide   of sodium. The distillate can readily be separated into an aqueous
and an oily portion. The latter then presented the appearance of a light
straw-coloured oil, possessing a pleasant and fragrant odour. It was washed
and then dried over chloride         of calcium; and submitted to fractional distil
lation,    by which traces of alcohol, acetic ether, and ethyl iodide were
 effectually removed from the other products, which now boiled between
 120° and 265° C.         We have described the constituents of this complex
liquid under two distinct heads, viz. : —
    1st. Products depending upon the duplication               of the atom of acetic
ether.
    2nd. Products derived from the replacement of hydrogen in the methyl
of acetic ether by the alcohol-radicals.
    In order successfully to separate the two products from             each other, and

 especially to disentangle their constituent compounds, it is absolutely ne
 cessary to operate upon large quantities of material.             But if this be done,
 there is obtained a considerable quantity of the products of the first divi

 vision boil considerably below these temperatures.

    Submitted to analysis, this liquid was found to consist             of two bodies of

 separable from each other by repeated rectification, and also by the action
 of boiling aqueous potash, which decomposes the second but scarcely affects
 the first.

 entered into in the paper, we propose for these bodies the following names

    Ethylic diethacetone carbonate is     a colourless      and somewhat oily liquid,
possessing a fragrant odour and a pungent          taste.      It is insoluble in water,
but miscible in all proportions with alcohol and ether. Its specific gravity
is -9738 at 20° C. It boils between 210° and 212°, and distils unchanged.

 The density of its vapour          was found to be 6-59.          The above formula, cor
 responding to two volumes, requires the number 6-43.                      Boiling aqueous
 solutions of potash and soda have scarcely any action on ethylic diethace-
 tone carbonate, but baryta-water and lime-water decompose it with great fa
 cility,  as do also boiling alcoholic      solutions of potash and soda. In all cases
a carbonate of the base is precipitated, and alcohol, together with a light
 ethereal liquid, is separated.
    This liquid, freed from alcohol by repeated washing with salt and water,
boiled, after drying over chloride of calcium, between 137°*5 and 139° C.
Submitted to analysis, it yielded results corresponding with the formula

    Diethylated acetone is a colourless, transparent and mobile liquid, possess
ing a penetrating odour of camphor, and the burning and bitter after-taste
of the same substance. It is very slightly soluble in water, but miscible in all
proportions with alcohol and ether.               Its specific gravity is 18171 at 22° C.
It boils at 137°*5 to 139° C. A determination of its vapour-density gave
the number 3-86, the above formula requiring 3-93.                     Diethylated acetone
does not oxidize in the air, neither does it reduce ammoniacal solution of
nitrate    of silver when boiled with it.          Mixed with concentrated solution of
sodium bisulphite,         it forms an oily compound which scarcely exhibits signs
of crystallization        at 0° C.   It suffers no alteration by prolonged boiling
with alcoholic potash.            It is isomeric with butyrone, with a ketone ob
tained by Fittig        * in the distillation of calcium valerianate, and with cenan-
thol. From the first it is distinguished by its lower boiling-point (138°),
butyrone boiling at 144° C., and Fittig' s ketone at 161° to 164°, and from
the third by its different properties, which are essentially those of a ketone
and not of an aldehyde. The difference in structure of three of these bodies

vapour-density is 2*92, theory requiring 2-97.                   Dimethylated     acetone
closely   resembles    its ethylic homologue    in all its  chemical   properties ; like
diethylated acetone, it is oxidized with difficulty, and does not very readily
form a crystalline compound with bisulphite of soda— differing in the latter
respect markedly from its isomer, ethylated acetone, and also from me
thylated acetone described below.
    Ethylic dimethacetone carbonate and ethylic methacetone carbonate boil
at the same temperature, and cannot therefore be separated by rectification ;
but we have prepared and examined the ketone from the second of these
 bodies ;   viz. methylated acetone, which has the formula
                                    f CMeH,

    Methylated acetone is best obtained in a state of purity by combining it
with bisulphite of soda, pressing the beautiful crystalline compound so
 formed between folds of blotting-paper to remove traces of dimethylated
acetone, exposing it over sulphuric acid in vacuo, and then regenerating the
methylated acetone by distillation with aqueous potash.               The liquid so ob
tained, after drying over quicklime and rectification, gave analytical results
corresponding      with the above formula.
    Methylated acetone is a colourless, transparent and very mobile liquid,
possessing an odour like chloroform, but more pungent.                    It is tolerably
soluble in water, and more than slightly so in a saturated solution of com
mon salt.       Its specific gravity is 18125 at 13° C. It boils at 81° C., and
its vapour-density is 2-52, the above formula requiring 2*49.                Methylated
acetone is identical with the ethyl-acetyl obtained by Freund * in acting
upon chloride of acetyl with zinc ethyl.               Methylated acetone forms a
splendidly crystalline compound with bisulphite of soda, and in its other
chemical properties so closely resembles ethylated acetone as to require no
further description.        It retains alcohol with such tenacity as to render its
separation from that liquid by washing and treatment with chloride of cal-

         III. Action  of Sodium and Amyl Iodide      upon Acetic Ether.
    For this reaction the compounds     of sodium derived from acetic ether
were prepared as before, and were then submitted to the action of amylic
iodide for several hours at the boiling-point of the mixture. *When the
sodium had all become converted into iodide, water was added and the su
pernatant liquid decanted. We reserve a complete description of this liquid
for our next communication, and will here confine ourselves to the separa
tion from it of cenanthylic acid, which was obtained as follows: — The
crude product, after drying over chloride of calcium, was submitted to rec
tification, and the portion boiling between 170° and 190° C. collected apart
and decomposed by ebullition with alcoholic potash.            By this treatment
we destroyed any ethylic amylacetone carbonate and ethylic diamylacetonc
carbonate that were present, and obtained a potash-salt of an acid derived
from acetic acid by the substitution of one atom of amyl for one of hydrogen.
The potash-salt thus obtained was distilled with excess of sulphuric acid
diluted with a large quantity of water.      Upon the distillate there floated
an oily acid, possessing an odour resembling cenanthylic acid.         This acid
was converted into an ammonia-salt, from which a silver-salt was prepared
by precipitation.   After being well washed with cold water, this salt yielded
numbers on analysis closely corresponding with the formula of amylacctate
or cenanthylate of silver :

    We have   also examined the barium-salt,    which   is an amorphous soapy
substance.     Dried at 100° C., -2/15 grm. gave *1599 grm. of barium sul
phate, corresponding to 34-62 per cent. of barium.         Barium cenanthylate
contains .*M-G9 per cent. of barium.      We believe amylacetic acid to be
identical with cenanthylic acid.
    The concluding    portion of the paper is devoted to a discussion of the
theoretical   bearings of the reactions above described, and to the investi
gation of the internal     architecture of the synthetically prepared ethers,
acids, and ketones.

  For the purpose           of examining               the question of the identity or the
isomerism         of these hydrocarbons,       I        selected methyl-hexyl and hydride of

   The quantity which I obtained wad only           sufficient   for determining the
boiling-point and the specific gravity, both        of which nearly coincide with
those of ethyl-amyl ; and although I could          not investigate its reactions,   I
believe that these also will agree with those       of ethyl-amyl, so that the two
hydrocarbons      appear to be identical.
(2) Hydride of Heptyl from Azelaic Acid. By C. Schorlemmer and
                                   R. S. Dale, B.A.
   One of us has shown that by heating a mixture of azelaic acid and
caustic baryta to a dull red heat, an aromatic liquid is obtained, which
chiefly consists of the hydrocarbon C7 H1".           By oxidizing castor-oil with
nitric  acid  on  a large  scale, one   pound  of pure azelaic acid was prepared,
which yielded about one ounce of a hydrocarbon boiling between 95° and
100°.      Subjected to fractional distillation, a small quantity of hydride of
hexyl from the suberic acid, which still adhered to the azelaic acid, was
separated, and now the liquid boiled constantly at 100°-5 C. (corrected).
The sp. gr. at 20° o C. was found to be 0 6840.
   The determination of its vapour-density gave the following results            : —

    This hydrocarbon is very easily attacked by chlorine, the chloride
C, H15 CI being chiefly formed, together with a small quantity of higher
chlorinated products.
   The chloride boils at 151°-153°C., and has the specific gravity 0-8737
at 18°*5.     It is a colourless liquid, smelling exactly like the chloride ob
tained from ethyl-amyl.

    By heating this chloride with acetic acid and acetate of potassium in
sealed tubes, heptylene and acetate of heptyl are formed.               This decompo
sition goes on much quicker than in the case of the chloride from ethyl-
amyl ; and the proportions of the substances formed also differ, as only a
very small quantity of heptylene is produced, and the chief product con
sists  of the  acetate, whilst the chlorides from ethyl-amyl and from petro
leum yield these two substances in about equal quantities.
    The heptylene boils at 95°-97°, and has the specific gravity 0-7026 at
 19°-5.
    The faint garlic-like smell is identical with that of the heptylene de
 scribed in my last paper.

   From the      acetate  the alcohol was prepared by heating with a concen
trated solution of caustic potash.          Dried over caustic baryta, the alcohol
boiled at 164°- 167°.
   The specific gravity at 19°-5 = 0-8286.
   Its odour cannot be distinguished from that of the alcohol from ethyl-
amyl.
   By oxidizing it with chromic acid, first the odour of ccnanthol is per
ceived, and then an oily acid is obtained, which by its smell, as well as
the analysis of its silver-salt, was recognized as cenanthylic acid.
   01 1 205 of the silver-salt obtained by saturating the rectified acid distillate
with carbonate of silver, gave 0-0551 of metallic silver, or 45-72per cent.,
the formula C7 H13 Ag 02 requiring 45-57 per cent. Ag.
   The annexed Table gives the boiling-points and specific gravities of the
hydrocarbons C7 H1„ of different origin, and their derivatives.           From these
data, as well as from the experiments detailed in         this  and   in  my former
papers, it appears that we meet here with examples of absolute isomerism,
viz. compounds having the same percentage composition and the same con
stitutional formula (A. Crum Brown), but differing from each other in
their physical properties.         This is not only the case with the hydro
carbons, but also, in a greater or less degree, with their derivatives.
   Ethyl-amyl and hydride of heptyl from azelaic acid, as well as the corre
sponding chlorides, were obtained in as pure a state as possible, and in pretty
large quantities ; and although only small quantities of the acetate, alcohol,
and define from the hydride were at our disposition,          yet the greatest care
was taken to obtain them pure, and all determination          of the boiling-points
and specific gravities were carried out under the same circumstances, the
same thermometer always being used, so that they may be fairly compared
with each other.

           C. M. Warren has lately published * an investigation on the hydro
      carbons contained in the American petroleum, which he isolated according
      to a new method of fractional condensation.                           He states that the petro
      leum contains two series           of the hydrocarbons C„ Hon+2, the isomeric pairs
      of which show a          difference    in their boiling-points of 7°-8°.
           Some of the results which              I    have formerly obtained tend to confirm
      this view.
           Frankland, Wurtz, Pelouze, and Cahours found 30° as the boiling-point
      of hydride of amyl ; the hydrocarbons of the same composition, which I
      isolated from         the light oils obtained             from Cannel coal, boils constantly
      between 39° and 40°.              The hydride of heptyl obtained from the same
      source boiled at 98°-99°, and the same hydrocarbon I found in American
      petroleum, whilst Pelouze and Cahours give 92°-94° as the boiling-point ;
      and in my last communication                  I   have quoted some experiments made by
      Mr. Wright, who found that from that part of American petroleum which
      boils between 95°-100°             a considerable quantity             of a hydrocarbon,        C7   H.s,
      may be obtained which boils constantly at 90°-92°.                               These latter hydro
      carbons and        their  derivatives     show,     even    after   repeated rectification, higher
       specific gravities than the isomeric alcohol -radicals and the hydrocarbons
      from azelaic acid.
           Thus it appears that bodies showing                   a   purely physical isomerism are as
       numerous in the marsh-gas family as                   in the case of the terpines, Cl„ H1,.
           In order to complete (his investigation,                   I intended to study in the same
       manner the hydrocarbons               C, HM, namely hydride of hexyl from suberic
       acid, methyl-amyl, and, if            possible, ethyl-butyl ; but this intention could
       not be carried out, as I could not succeed                    in preparing methyl-amyl. This
       hydrocarbon appears             not  to  be   formed      by any of the methods which are
       employed to prepare the so-called mixed alcohol-radicals.                                A mixture of
       the iodides of methyl           and   amyl     is  exceedingly slowly          attacked   by sodium.
      The boiling-point of the mixture                  is below the fusing-point of sodium, and
       the metal soon becomes coated with a hard crust of iodide of sodium.                                   I

 added, therefore, a sufficient quantity of pure amyl to raise the boiling
 point, but even the sodium in the fused state acts very slowly, a consider
 able quantity of gaseous products being evolved.
     After the mixture had been heated lor a week, large quantities of the
 iodides were still present, and after destroying these by strong nitric acid,
 the remaining hydrocarbon was found to be pure amyl.
     No better results were obtained by adding anhydrous ether to the
 mixture.      The action in the cold is exceedingly slow ; heated in senled
 tubes, the iodides       are   soon decomposed ; but besides gaseous           products,
 only amyl, and not a trace of a mixed radical, is formed.
     Besides hydride of heptyl, other products are formed by the action of
 caustic baryta upon azelaic acid.           Of those only one could be obtained in
 a pure state.        If the aromatic liquid which is first obtained is distilled
 with water, hydride of heptyl chiefly distils, and a brown oily liquid re
 mains behind, which, after cooling, solidifies to a crystalline mass con
 taining a brown aromatic oil which may be removed from the crystals by
 pressing between blotting-paper.              The solid substance is repeatedly re-
 crystallized   from   hot   diluted  alcohol,   in which the still adhering oil is very
 slightly soluble.      The pure substance is thus obtained in small colourless
 needles, which are grouped in tufts.                It is odourless and tasteless, very
 soluble   in ether   and   in  alcohol,  insoluble     in water, melts between 41° and
42°, solidifies     again at 40°, and distils between 283°-285° (not corrected)

the whole of the bromide was lost, with the exception of the portion treated
with caustic soda.         This was washed with water, dissolved in ether, and

 III.   " On the Laws of Connexion        between the conditions of a chemical
       Change    and  its  Amount."       By A. Vernon Harcourt and W.
       Esson.      Communicated by Sir B. C. Brodie, Bart., F.R.S.
       Received September 5, 1865.
                                     (Abstract.)
    The amount of    a chemical   change under any conditions which allow of
 its completion, depends ultimately upon the amount of that one of the
 substances partaking in it which is present in the smallest proportional
quantity.     But if the change be arrested before any one of the reagents is
exhausted, its amount depends upon the conditions under which it has oc
curred.     These conditions, in the simplest cases, are the quantity of the
several reagents, their temperature, and the time during which they have
been in contact.     The laws of connexion between these conditions of a che
mical change and its amount are the subject of an investigation upon which
the authors have entered.        An account of the first stage of this investiga
tion is contained in the present paper.
    Although every chemical change is undoubtedly           governed by certain
general laws relating to the conditions under which        it occurs, the number
of cases in which the investigation of these laws is possible is extremely
limited.    For it is requisite both that the amount of change should be
readily estimated, and also that all the conditions affecting it should be sus
ceptible of measurement and of such independent variations as must be
made in order to determine the separate influence of each.
    The first reaction chosen for investigation was that of permanganic acid
upon oxalic acid.     It is well known that when a solution of potassic per
manganate is added to a solution containing an excess of oxalic acid and
sulphuric acid, a change takes place which in its final result is represented
by the following equation : —
    K3 Mna 03 + 3 H2 SO, + 5 H2 C2 04 = K2 S04 + 2MnS04 + 1 0 CO, + 8H,0.
This reaction occurs at the ordinary temperature ; it is thus comparatively
easy to keep the temperature      of the solution absolutely constant during its
progress.    It occupies, under a due arrangement of other conditions, a con
venient interval of time, and can be started and terminated at a given
moment.      The reagents are readily obtained in a state of purity, and can
be accurately divided and measured as liquids.       Lastly, no other condition
besides those named affects the result : when each of these is fixed, the
amount of change observed in successive experiments is always the same.
Nevertheless this reaction, as appeared in the course of its investigation,     is

not well adapted to the purpose in view.     It is not chemically simple.
More than one change occurs under the circumstances of the experiment,
and the equation above written represents only a net result.  But the ex
amination    of a second and simpler reaction in which the authors              are at
present engaged, has confirmed an explanation which had already suggested
itself to them of the results of this series of experiments, and thus they are
now enabled to present these results together with a theory which explains
and is supported by them.
   The effect of varying the amount of each of the reagents and the dura
tion of the action was successively investigated. The remaining condition
of temperature was not made the subject of experiment, owing to the dis
covery of the complex nature of the chemical change.    A series of Tables
contain the numerical results of these experiments.   The principal com
plication arises from a secondary reaction which takes place between per
manganic acid and the manganous salt formed by its reduction.   It became
necessary, in consequence of this action, to include manganous sulphate
among the reagents the effect of whose variation was to be determined.
  The general method of experimenting was briefly as follows : — Measured
quantities of the standard solutions of oxalic acid, sulphuric acid, and man
ganous sulphate were mixed with a measured quantity of water and the
whole brought to a temperature of 16° C.       A measured quantity of a stan
dard solution    of potassic permanganate was added, and the time of the
addition    noted.  Throughout the course of the action the temperature,
observed by means of a thermometer passing into the fluid, was kept rigo
rously constant. When the required interval had elapsed, an excess of
potassic iodide was thrown in, and the liberated iodine, which furnishes an
exact measure of the residual permanganic acid or manganic oxide, esti
mated by means of a standard solution of sodic hyposulphite.   The amount
of chemical change occurring in any given time with any given amounts of
the several reagents can thus be determined.
    1.Variation of Sulphuric Acid. — Each experiment of this series was
allowed to proceed for four minutes.   Oxalic acid and potassic permanga
nate were employed  in the proportions in which they act one upon another.
The quantity of sulphuric acid        was varied from the proportional     quantity
up to seven times that amount.   A regular           increase in the amount of che
mical change within the allotted time occurs with each increment of sul
phuric acid. The relation of these quantities, which formed the subject
of many series of experiments,        is,
                                  however, of  complex character.
                                                          a        Two
or three reactions,   it shown, occur simultaneously, and each of these
                           is                                                       is
influenced by the acidity of the solution.
    2. Variation of Manganous Sulphate. — At the ordinary ten*j-,
a dilute and feebly acid solution,              acid acts very slowly
                                            permanganic                         .
oxalic acid, but the presence of  manganous salt, formed
                                      a                             by
                                                               its reduction
or previously added, causes great acceleration.
                                 a               This acceleration    shownis
to reach    amaximum when three molecules of manganous sulphate are
taken to one of permanganate.          By the reaction of these quantities man

472                    Messrs. V. Harcoort and Esson on the                        [Nov. 16,
gauic binoxide is formed according to the equation
        K,   Mna 0„ + 3 MnS04 + 2 H„           0= K2 S04 + 2 H,   SO, +   5   MnO,.
  3. Variation of Oxalic Acid. — The results obtained in this series of
experiments are at first sight paradoxical. The quantity of permanganate
reduced in three minutes, which was the time allowed to each experiment,
increases with the proportion of oxalic acid up to a certain point ; it then
diminishes  until another point is reached, after which further additions of
oxalic acid produce again a very gradual acceleration.    The result is the
same whether only oxalic acid, potassic permanganate and manganous sul
phate are taken, or whether sulphuric acid is added to these.    The maxi
mum action occurs with five molecules of oxalic acid and one of perman
ganate, that is with proportional quantities.     The second and constant
minimum is nearly attained with ten molecules of oxalic acid.     Probably
the manganic binoxide formed by the reaction of manganous sulphate and
potassic permanganate combines with an excess of oxalic acid to form a
compound whose decomposition proceeds more slowly than the action of
free binoxide upon it. The conditions of the minimum action may be thus
represented    :   —
                       1.   MnO, + 2 H2 C, 04 = MnC, 0„ + 2 H2 O.
                       2.            MnC4 0, = MnC, 04 + 2 COa.
   There is found in the first instance a clear brown solution, the colour of
which slowly fades.
   4. Variation of the Time. — If it were possible for all other conditions
of a chemical change to remain constant,                 if,
                                                for example, the substances
reacting could be added in proportion as they disappeared, and those
formed either were without influence or could be removed, the effect of                    a
variation of time might be confidently predicted.    In such case the total
                                                                          a
amount of chemical change would be directly proportional to the duration
of the action.   But when one or more of the substances diminishes in
quantity as the change proceeds, the relation  no longer of this simple cha
                                                           is
racter.   Experiments upon this relation form the remaining and chief part
of this inquiry. Each experiment of series exactly resembled every other
                                                a
except in the time allowed to elapse before the action was interrupted.
And thus                               exhibiting the course of single
             each series may be regarded as                                            a
experiment, and showing how much of the active substances still remain at
any time from its commencement.
   In the earlier series the reagents were employed in proportional quanti
ties, and itwas observed that for most of the determinations the product
of the number expressing the duration of the action and of the number
           y-the amonnt of active substance still remaining,        constant  is   a
     ,.Ly.   The first stages of the action exhibit, however,     divergence  a
,lom this law. This divergence       explained by
                                          is       reference to the  simulta
neous occurrence of two gradual actions, that in which manganic hinoxide

   proportional quantities are destroying one another, is shown to follow from
   a law the generality of which the authors hope to establish — namely, that
   the total amount of chemical change varies directly with the amount of
   each  of the substances partaking in it.
      In the later series of experiments the necessary condition, that the ratio
   of the reagents should remain constant throughout the action, was fulfilled
   by taking all but one of them in great excess as compared with that one.
   Under these circumstances a single substance gradually disappears, all
  around it remaining unchanged ; and according to the law above enunci
  ated, the total amount of change occurring at any moment is proportional
  to the quantity of substance then remaining.          It is shown that if this be
  the case, the numbers representing the amounts of residue after equal in
  tervals of time should form a series in geometric progression.      This relation
  is actually exhibited by some of the experimental series ; but the greater
 number of them do not conform to it.          The reason of this is to be found
 in the fact that more than     one reaction occurs under the circumstances       of
 these experiments, and that it is only possible to measure the total effect.
 Experiments upon the solution in which the gradual oxidation of oxalic acid
 has taken place are adduced to show that some other oxidized product
 besides carbonic acid is formed, and it is inferred that more than one agent
 takes part in its oxidation.    Also the facility with which hydrated peroxide
 of manganese reacts with dilute sulphuric acid and manganous sulphate to
 form a solution of mangano-manganic sulphate renders it probable that
 this salt is produced in the experiment.      With an excess of oxalic acid and
 manganous sulphate the red colour of potassic permanganate disappears as
 soon as this salt is added to the mixture.      The formation of manganic bin-
 oxide appears to be instantaneous.       It finds itself in presence of two sub
 stances, both of which act gradually upon it — oxalic acid and manganous
 sulphate, the latter producing an intermediate oxide, probably the protoses-
quioxidc, which is also reducible byoxalic acid. It is possible that other oxides
 besides these may be formed ; but it is almost certain, from the experimental
results, that the action is not more simple than this. At the end of each expe
riment both or all of these oxides are alike instantaneously reduced by hydri-
odic acid and thus measured conjointly. Finally it is shown that an equation
may be constructed embodying this hypothesis, and that all the series of
experimental numbers may be expressed by equations of this form.               The
paper concludes with a mathematical        discussion,   by Mr. Esson, of various
points in the theory of this action.       An outline of his statement is here
appended.
     When a single substance is undergoing chemical transformation under
constant conditions, it is shown by experiment that the law of connexion
between y, the quantity of substance remaining unchanged, and x, the time
during which the change has been proceeding, is y=aax ; where a is the
quantity of substance present     at the beginning   of the change, and a   a con-

stant which depends upon the conditions under which the change takes
place.     From this equation is derived dy cxydx, which expresses the fact
that the amount of change varies directly with the time and with the quan
tity of substance.
    Cases of complex chemical change can be investigated by the application
of this general law. When two substances are reacting in proportional
quantities, the amount of change is proportional to the amount of each, and
the equation for determining the character of the reaction is dy xydx, or
 1    1      x
         =      where a is the quantity  of substance present at the beginning of
 the change.        If  a is very large, the eqnation reduces to xy^=b, i. e. the
 quantity of substance remaining unchanged varies inversely as the time.
    It is shown that the complexity of the results obtained in the experiments
 on the decomposition of potassic permanganate is probably due to the fact
 that there are two substances undergoing change, and that one of these
 substances is gradually formed from the other.            The equations for deter

     Mention is made in the paper referred to of the comparatively low tem
 perature of certain birds.       Another example of the same kind occurs in the
 goose   ;  in two instances  I  have found its temperature in recto 101°, and in
 a  third 103°-5.      The trials were made in November; the          geese had not
 previously been confined, were about seven months old, fully feathered
 (few birds have a warmer clothing), and the weather at the time was
 moderate     ;  the temperature of the open air between 40° and 50° Fahr.
     Notice is also taken of a bird, the grouse, not remarkable for power of
 flight, having air in its femora as well as in its humeri.            I  have since
 found     another example of the same kind in the pheasant, a bird even of
 feebler flight    ; in no instance, and I have examined several specimens,

     In reference to the statement implying that those bones of birds
 which contain air in their adult        state, in an earlier stage contain marrow,
 later observations have led me to infer that, instead of marrow, these bones
 have their canals impacted with blood-vessels, which in process of the
 bird's growth shrink and       are absorbed.

                                    (Abstract.)
    The paper is divided into ten short sections.        In the I st the experiments
of Sir William Herschel and of Prof. Mfiller on the sun's radiation are
described.     In the 2nd are given a series of measurements which show the
distribution of heat in the spectrum of the electric light.               In the 3rd
section is described a    mode    of  filtering  the   composite radiation of an in
tensely   luminous   souroe  so  as  to  detach  the  luminous  from the non-lumi
nous portion of the emission.           The ratio of the visible to the invisible
radiation determined in this way is compared and found coincident with
the results of prismatic analysis.        The eminent fitness of a combination of
iodine and bisulphide    of carbon as a ray-filter is illustrated, and in the 4 th
section experiments with other substances are described ; various effects
obtained in the earlier experiments on the invisible rays being mentioned.
In the 5th section the absolutely invisible character of the radiation is
established ; it is also proved that no extra-violet rays are to be found at
the obscure focus.      Numerous       experiments on combustion produced by
invisible rays are also described in the 5th section.               The 6th section
deals with the subject of calorescence, or the conversion of obscure radiant
heat into light.    In section  7 various modes      of experimenting are described
by which the danger incident to the use of so inflammable a body as the
bisulphide of carbon may be avoided.             In the 8th section are described
experiments on the invisible radiation of the lime-light and of the sun. In
the 9th section the effect obtained by exposing papers of different colours
at the dark focus are mentioned ; while the 10th and concluding section,
deals with the calorescence obtainable from rays transmitted by glasses of
various kinds.
II.    " Notice of the Surface of the Sun." \By John Phillips, M.A.
        LL.D., F.R.S. , &c., Professor of Geology in the University of
        Oxford.    Received October 27th, 1865.
    It  appears desirable, as a first step to a right theory of the condition of
the sun's surface, that the appearances which it presents should be re
corded in some systematic way.           Photographs will suffice for the distribu
 tion of the spots, but careful eye-drawings must be appealed to in evi
 dence of the form, arrangement, and intestine motions of the parts of those
 spots, and eye-drawings with measures are the only means of recording
 accurately the dotted, areolar, granular, crested, and other arrangements

which under the general title of "porosity" have been recognized over
the whole face of the sun. Descriptions cannot be complete, but, what is
more, they may be, and probably often are, misleading — words which call
up right ideas of things often fail very much when required to perform
the same function for new objects not well understood.   With this con
viction           in my mind, I have requested the Royal Society to accept                       a few
drawings              representing    features       on the sun's face   as they appear      to me
looking through a telescope of known dimensions, and used in a certain
way.             If
         observers would send sketches made at the telescope, showing
what they see, or think they see, — not finished paintings to illustrate
hypothetical ideas, — these sketches, by gradual accumulation and com
parison, would at last furnish evidence by which even a great theory might
be brought   to a satisfactory test. Therefore it is that I presume to offer
to the Royal Society some additional sketches of the " porosity " of the
sun, as seen in good observing weather in this month of October*.
     The whole surface of the sun,                   as seen on the   24th and 25th, appeared
quite free from any dark patches large enough to be called spots — offering
in this respect a singular contrast with its aspect on the 1 7th, when the
large doubly nucleated spot, of which I sent a sketch a few days since,
was so conspicuous near the (apparent) right edgef.
   On this apparently even and marble-like surface, a power of 50, with
the full aperture of 6 inches, made manifest the existence of the porosity
at every point, from the centre to near the edge, the distinctness being
greatest over all the middle part of the area.   By applying successively
powers of 75, 100, 135, and 180, it was easy to observe the general effect,
and the particular features                 of diversity.
                                          The clock-rate being regulated
exactly, any particular part of the disk might be kept continually under
view         ;   and to increase the distinctness         of the object, or rather the comfort
of the observer in looking at                 it,
                                 the field was contracted by diaphragms to
one-half or one-third of the usual diameter. The great obstacle to strict                    a
observation               of any small    selected    part of the sun's disk   is   unsteadiness   of
the head,    circumstance troublesome to portrait-photographers,
                      a                                            but more
injurious to  astronomers.    believe thisIkind  of error to be  one  of the
elements of personal equation, and that    can sometimes only be cured by
                                                            it
allowing the observer to take hold of the moving telescope.    This, thanks
to       Mr. Cooke's solid construction, can be safely done.

one observer, with the precautions stated                  to what degree they are affected

which is carefully moved out of focus inwards and outwards. Under these
conditions, the soft undefined mottling which it shows catches the eye, and
appears clearly to be caused by parts not differing in structure from the
more shadowy spaces between them, except by there being less effect of
shadow points and lines on the parts which are relatively lighter.              Here
 and there apparently dark specks appear, either in the darker tracts or on
 the lighter parts ; and there are specks of all degrees of darkness, as well
 as lines   of greater or less distinctness.

 eyepiece, the appearances can be sketched as well as an artist can picture
 a tree with its leaves, a heap of broken stones, or some dissected and areo-

 without patient attention, and eyes and head in a good state. Here the
  texture appears to be areolar, with much irregularity in the shapes, but no
 great inequality of size.           Dots of extremely small dimensions, sometimes
  quite   black,   appear singly or in pairs in the centres of several areolae.

  and elsewhere scattered about it.            The number of short irregular discon
  tinuous lines which occur mixed with dots is very great ; none of them
  appear to be regularly curved or regularly straight, but seem to be intervals
  merely between more enlightened parts.              It does not seem to me that dots
  of greater darkness usually appear at the intersections or terminations of
  these fissure-like     objects.
      PI.  XII.   fig. 4, is intended to convey the impression arising from a close
  study of one small space quite definite in character and marked by distinct
  small dots, one elongated in the middle part of a subpentagonal space,
  around which other less regular areolae were gathered.             After much atten
   tion, it appeared to me that the boundaries of this rude pentagon were in
   part broken up into irregular short loops and dots ; and though the obser
   vation was difficult, I am not afraid to trust it. This selected space is drawn
   on a larger scale, but it was not seen with higher powers than No. 3.

   The spot to which the above notices refer has been made the subject of
careful observations by M. Chacornac, who has issued interesting descrip
tions and drawings of it from October 7 to October 16.                The Rev. Mr.
Howlett has also scrutinized the same object, and prepared drawings to
October    17, the day when my first sketch was made.                Thus we have
for this spot observations through one rotation and a half, and we may
perhaps have the pleasure of welcoming it again in a new form. — J. P.

      of Geology in the University of Oxford.              With Drawings.        Re
      ceived November 15, 1865.
   On the 17th of October,       1865, at 2 p.m. the spot referred to had tra
versed a great portion of    its arc, and was approaching the limb. It showed
two large unequal umbrae, and in each       of them   a blacker nucleus.    Between
them were several small dark dots, partially coalescent.          The   edges of the
umbrae were very irregular.           In the smaller umbra       two bright dots.
Above the larger umbra (which appeared to the right in the telescope) was
an exceptionally bright band, traversed by two dark threads ending in dark
dots.   This band crossed     a part  of the umbra, like   a bridge,  but itself was
there traversed by a small bar.         Four bright patches lay in the continu
ation of this facula toward the prolonged upper (apparently) extremity of
the penumbra, which was itself more luminous than other penumbral parts.
The penumbra had broken         edges, and an  interior mottling of small brighter
and darker spaces directed variously toward the umbrae. The granulated
surface of the sun with soft gleaming facular ridges was conspicuously
seen, and tracts of darkly dotted surface were seen beyond each extremity
and on one side    (PI. X. fig. 1).
   Nov. 4, 9.45. — The spot had now returned by rotation, and was very
distinctly seen amidst far extended clouds of bright faculae, though reduced
to less than half its former dimensions.       It retained the two umbral tracts ;
but it was now the left-hand tract which was the larger.           Being about    15°
from the limb, the general figure was oval, as usual ; the umbras were of
irregular figure, the larger one cut into by bright branches from the inter-
umbral space.      Dark dots amidst the faculse on the border (PI. X. fig. 2).
   Nov. 6, 9.45. — The spot had reached, about 45° from the edge, and
appeared less elliptical, and otherwise changed in aspect.           The large um
bra was much dissected by bright streams, and the smaller one had assumed
a distinctly tripartite shape. The edges of the penumbra appeared rugged.
Many small spots and dark dots towards the edge of the disk (PI. X. fig. 3)
   Nov.   11, 9.45 — The    spot had now passed the central meridian, and
was greatly, altered, and almost cut into two parts by a bright facular mass,
passing between the umbrae.         The larger of these is now in a pentagonal

gation.       The smaller umbra is tripartite, and has small gleaming points in
it.    Several black dots in the surrounding surface, amidst faculae, areolae,
and other structures very distinctly seen for a great part of this day with
good definition (PI. XI. fig. 4).
     Nov.   13, 9.45. — Very great change            in general figure and in the several
parts of     the   spot.    The larger spot      is now  cut in twain ; the smaller spot
is reduced to two dots, surrounded by a large bright space. The spot is
now about 36° from the limb (PI. XI. fig. 5).
     Nov.    15. — The spot is very near the edge, and          of course almost elliptical
in outline (PI. XI. fig. 6). The              faculae  which accompany it are seen on a
smaller scale in PI. XI. fig. 7.

    The   President    then addressed the Society as follows    : —
        Gentlemen,
 In    my last year's Address    I informed you of the steps which had been
 taken, with the approval of the Council, to obtain the concurrence of Her
 Majesty's Government in the printing and publication of the Catalogue of
 the Titles  of the Scientific    Memoirs contained in Scientific Periodicals in
 all languages, from the commencement of the present century to the end
 of 1863, the manuscript of which had been prepared under the direction
 and superintendence of the President and Council, and the cost defrayed
from the funds of the Society.          Her Majesty's Government having been
pleased to accede to the proposition that had been then made to them,
the Serial Catalogue, as originally proposed for the Society's Library, is
now in progress of rearrangement in alphabetical order according to author's
names, to be followed       by an alphabetical Index according to subjects.
The preliminary questions regarding the type, and the form and size of the
pages, having been discussed and agreed upon with the authorities of the
Stationery Office, the first portion of the manuscript, containing the titles
of all memoirs having the letter A as the first letter of the author's name,
has been prepared, and is now placed in the printer-s hands, so that the
printing may be forthwith commenced.
    In  the meantime    the endeavours     to render    the work   more complete
have not been     relaxed ;    the number of titles, which in my last year's
Address was stated to exceed 180,000, has been since extended to 213,000 ;
and will continue to be augmented whilst the printing is in progress.        It is
proposed that all titles which should not be in time to be entered under
their respective alphabetical heads shall be included in a supplementary

 1865.]                        President's Address.                              483
 volume, which shall      also comprise    the titles of memoirs which must be
 regarded as Anonymous,      having been published      without the author's name.
 The original Serial Catalogue prepared in manuscript for the use of the
 Fellows of the Society still remains in the Library ; and it is with great
 satisfaction that I am able to add that the Library itself already possesses
 the Transactions, Journals, and other periodical works in which two-thirds
 of the 213,000 titles already collected for the Catalogue are contained;
 and that every endeavour is making to render the Library as complete as
 possible in this important branch of scientific literature.
     The total expenses hitherto incurred in the preparation of the Catalogue
 amount to £1626 ; and to this a small annual addition will            be required
 until the printing and publication shall have been completed.
    The Fellows of the Royal Society, and those especially who are in
 terested in the progress of Sidereal Astronomy, will hear with pleasure
 that the communications, passing through Her Majesty's principal Secre
 tary of State for the Colonies, between Sir Henry Barkly, K.C.B., F.R.S.,
 Governor of the Colony of Victoria, and the President and Council of the
 Royal Society, regarding the establishment at Melbourne of a telescope of
great optical power for the observation of the Nebulae and multiple stars
 of the southern hemisphere, have led to a vote which has passed the
 Legislature of Victoria of £5000 for a suitable telescope, to be con
 structed under the superintendence of the President and Council of the
 Royal Society.      In the Anniversary Address in 1862, and again in that of
 1863, I availed myself of the opportunities             then afforded of making
known to the Fellows the progress of the communications which at each of
 those dates had taken place between the Government of Victoria, the
authorities    of the Melbourne Observatory, and the Royal Society ; and
I have now the satisfaction of laying before you the following letter, re
ceived on the 23rd of last month from Professor Wilson, Honorary Secre
tary of the Board of Visitors of the Melbourne Observatory : —
          „Y

                                        " The University, Melbourne, Aug. 21, 1865.
    " It  is with very great satisfaction that I forward to you the following
resolutions of the Board of Visitors adopted on the 15th inst. : —
    "  1.  That the President of the Royal Society of London be informed
that the Legislature of Victoria has voted the sum of £5000 for the
purchase of an equatorial telescope, one half of which sum has been
already remitted to the Crown Agents in England, and placed at the dis
posal of Major Pasley, of the Royal Engineers, for the purpose ; and that the
Government has placed the correspondence connected with it in the hands
of the Board of Visitors.
    '' 2. That the President and Council of the Royal Society be requested
to give the Board of Visitors the benefit of their assistance in selecting a
maker, settling    Ihe contract, and superintending        the construction   of the

484                            Anniversary Meeting.                     [Nov. 30,
telescope, so as best to carry out the recommendations contained in the
Report of the Royal Society to the Duke of Newcastle, 18th December 1862.
    " 3. That Major Pasley be requested to place himself in communication
with the President and Council of the Royal Society, and, after ascertaining
their views, to enter into such contract as will most effectually carry them out.
    " I enclose also a copy of a letter received from the Treasury, on which
the foregoing resolutions are based, and a copy of the letter which I send
to Major Pasley by this mail.
    " The great interest which you have shown in this matter leads the
Board of Visitors to count confidently on your further assistance in bring
ing it to    a successful   conclusion.    The request contained in the second
resolution    is not intended to imply that in the opinion of the Board any
further discussion as to the form of telescope or the maker is necessary.
The Board thinks, and I believe that it is also your opinion, that the dis
cussion which has already taken place has settled that question, and that
Mr. Grubb's proposal should be adopted. This is not distinctly expressed
in the resolution, because Mr. Grubb's name is not mentioned in the
Report of the Royal Society, and because the Board desires to leave you
free in the ev*nt of anything having happened to Mr. Grubb, or of any
discovery having been made which would tend to modify your opinion.
    " In any case the Board, bearing in mind the great length of time that
has elapsed since the proposal for a telescope was first made, and having
now received authority from the Government to act in the matter, is de
sirous of securing the completion of the telescope at the earliest possible
time consistent with the highest attainable perfection in the instrument ;
and considers that this end will be most effectually secured by leaving you
quite free to act in the matter, and trusting to you to secure the co
operation of those eminent practical astronomers whose names you men
tioned as willing to superintend the work during its execution.
   " Mr. Grubb's last estimate is £4600 for the telescope complete ; and
this, I believe, covers everything, including the erection in Ireland for a trial.
   " The .sum    voted is £5000, and the balance, £400, will be available for
a spectroscope and     for a photographic apparatus adapted to the telescope,
and will still probably leave sufficient to pay the freight to Melbourne.
As these two adjuncts will not occupy long in making, it will probably be
desirable not to commence them till the telescope proper is approaching
completion, so that the latest improvements may be introduced into them.
   " Trusting    to your earnestness to induce you to undertake the great
amount    of trouble  we are imposing    upon you,
                             " I  remain, my dear Sir,
                                        " Very faithfully yours,

   To the information     contained in this letter     I have now the satisfaction
of being able to add that since its receipt Mr. Grubb has signified his
readiness to proceed in the construction of a telescope corresponding to
the specification contained in his letter to Dr. Robinson of Dec. 3, 1 863,
printed in the second portion of the correspondence respecting the Southern
Telescope, — the execution to be under the supervision of the Earl of llosse,
Dr. Robinson, and Mr. Warren De la Rue, who, on their parts, have
accepted   the responsibilities   of superintendence.       The contract between
the Crown Agent for Victoria         and  Mr.   Grubb     is in process of execu
tion, and in eighteen months from its date we may hope that the telescope
will be in readiness to be embarked for Melbourne, where in the meantime
preparations will be made for its reception and mounting.            The selection
of an Astronomer fitted by education and acquirements to be entrusted
with its use at Melbourne, and who may be willing to devote his entire
energies to the cultivation of the splendid field which will be open to him,
must be the next anxious and important duty devolving upon the Mel
bourne authorities.      If in its execution they should require any assistance
from the Royal Society, such assistance will assuredly be most readily given.
    The arrangements connected with this subject being so far advanced, I
have thought    it desirable to place on record     a consecutive statement  of the
steps by which they have been brought to their present stage ;          and I have
done this in the form of a Note (Note A)*, to avoid trespassing unneces
sarily upon your present attention.
    The welcome intelligence has been received from Colonel Walker, F.R.S.,
 Superintendent of the Trigonometrical Survey of India, of the safe arrival
 in that country of the Pendulums prepared for the experiments which it is
 proposed to make at the principal stations of the survey, and of the
 vacuum-apparatus in which the pendulums are to be vibrated.              As it has
been proposed to make the Kew Observatory the Base Station of the
 important observations which may be made with these instruments in many
 parts of India, a full and very careful series of Base observations were made
 with them at Kew before they* departure for India. These have been
 printed in the Proceedings of the Royal Society in the present year in the
 form of a communication from Messrs. Balfour Stewart and Loewy.
    In the course of the last Session an important paper was communicated
 to the Society, and has been since printed in the Philosophical Transactions
 for 1865, Art. V., entitled " On the Magnetic Character of the Armour-
 plated Ships of the Royal Navy, and on the Effect on the Compass of par
ticular arrangements of Iron in a Ship," by Staff-Commander Frederick John
 Evans, R.N., F.R.S., Superintendent of the Compass Department of Her
 Majesty's Navy, and Archibald Smith, Esq., F.R.S.
    In the course of the reading of this paper, and in the discussion which
                                   * See note A, p. 503.

486                                  Anniversary Meeting.                   [Nov. 30,
followed   it,            of any proper provision for the instruction or
                 the absence
guidance of the builders, fitters, and navigators of the ships of oar mer
cantile marine was strongly dwelt upon.    It well known that the number
                                                       is
of iron ships recently constructed greatly exceeds that of wood-built ships.
In such vessels iron    now used, not only in the construction of the hull,
                            is
but in decks, deck-houses, masts, rigging, and many other patts of the
ship, for which wood was till recently used.     The consequence has been            a
great increase in the amount of the deviation of  the compass, increased diffi
culty in finding    asuitable place for the compass, and an increased neces
sity for, and difficulty in, applying to the deviation either mechanical or
tabular corrections.
   Many recent losses of iron steamers have taken place, in which there              is
reason to believe that compass-error occasioned the loss. In most of these,
however, from the want of any record of the magnetic state of the ship, of
the amount of the original deviation, and of the mode of correction — and
from the investigations into the causes of the loss having been conducted
by persons uninformed or not interested in the science, and who are neces
sarily incompetent therefore either to elicit the facts from which judg       a
ment can be formed, or to form              a    judgment on those facts which are
elicited — no    certain conclusion as to the cause of the loss can be arrived at.
The investigations are, however, sufficient to show the want of          better
                                                                             a
and more uniform system of compass-correction in the mercantile marine,
and of more knowledge of the subject on the part of those who are
entrusted with the fitting and navigation of these ships.
    Acting in conformity with the opinions expressed in the discussion
which followed the reading of the paper by Commander Evans and Mr.
Smith, and availing themselves of the counsel of those who are justly regarded
as possessing the greatest practical experience on such subjects in this or
any other country, the President and Council addressed a letter to the
 President of the Board of Trade, bringing under his consideration         sub   a
ject which they have reason to believe    of pressing importance, requiring
                                                  is
that measures      of more stringent
                        a                   and effective character should be taken
in   the direction already followed         by Her Majesty's Government in such
legislative enactments as         those contained in the Merchant Shipping Act of
 1854 ;   and, impelled     strong conviction of the impending danger, they
                             by  a
have ventured to suggest the expediency of steps being taken for the mer
cantile marine similar in character to those which have been found to work
so successfully     in   the Compass Department        of the Royal Navy.
   The lamented decease of the late Admiral FitzRoy induced     desire on
                                                                        a
the part of the Board of Trade to review the past proceedings and pre
sent state of the department of that Board which had been placed under
Admiral FitzRoy's direction.    Adverting to the fact that at the forma

desiderata in Meteorological Science, and had received in reply a letter
from the President and Council (dated February 22, 1855) containing
recommendations which were eventually adopted as the basis of the pro
ceedings of the Meteorological Department of the Board of Trade, the
Board was now desirous of being informed to what extent those objects
had been fulfilled by what had already been accomplished, and whether
the objects which had been so specified were still considered as important
for the interests of science and navigation as they were then considered.
    The Board of Trade were also desirous of obtaining an opinion from the
Royal Society regarding the Forecasts of Weather and the Storm Warn
ings which had not been included in the original recommendations of the
 Royal Society, but had originated with Admiral FitzRoy himself and had
formed a considerable part of the duties of the Meteorological Depart
 ment since 1859.
    To enable the President and Council to form a judgment on the ques
 tions referred to them, the Board of Trade supplied them with the following
 documents : —
     1.  Admiral FitzRoy's Report to the Board of Trade, dated May 1 862.
     2.  A Report by Mr. Babington (Admiral FitzRoy's first assistant) on
 the method adopted in the department with regard to forecasts and storm-
 warnings.
     3. A return to the House of Commons, dated      April 13, 1864, present
 ing   a comparison  of the probable force of the wind as indicated by the
 signals in the year from April 1, 1863, to March 31, 1864, and its actual
 state as reported in the three days following the exhibition of the signals.
     4. A manuscript return, furnished by Mr. Babington, having the same
 object for the year from April 1, 1864, to March 31, 1865.
     The first of these documents contained the opinions of the Shipmasters
 at several ports on our coasts, officially requested and given, in regard to
 the practical value which they attached to the storm-warnings.      Of these
 replies, by far the greater number were decidedly favourable, three only
  out of fifty-six being decidedly unfavourable.     The date of the Report
  containing   them was  May  1862  ; and the two  subsequent Reports, dated
  respectively in 1864 and 1865, exhibited in comparison a marked improve
  ment in successive years.    Upon the authority of those statements, and
  viewing   the system of forecasting which Admiral FitzRoy had instituted
  simply (as described by himself) as "an experimental process," based on
  the knowledge conveyed by Telegraph of the actual state of the winds and
  weather and other meteorological phenomena within a specified area,
  and on a comparison of these with the telegrams of the preceding days, so
  as to obtain inferences as to the probable changes in the succeeding days —
  taking into account also the evidence supplied of the improvement in the
  forecasts of each year compared with those of the preceding year — the Pre
  sident and Council were of opinion that it was not unreasonable to antici
  pate that the system, so far at least as regarded the storm-warnings,       if

  continued, might receive still further improvement ; and that possibly the
  best arrangement at the present time would be that this branch of the
  duties of the office should continue ns at present, and be carried on under
 the direction of     Mr. Babington,    by whom it had been virtually superin
 tended for several months past.
     With reference to those branches of inquiry which had been originally
 suggested by the Royal Society in the letter of the President and Council
 of February 22nd, 1855, the reply, as might reasonably be expected, was
 of a more decided character. The most prominent amongst the objects
 recommended in that letter was the collection and coordination of facts
 bearing on what may perhaps not improperly be termed Oceanic Sta
 tistics, — viz. all such facts as are required to enable a correct knowledge to
 be formed of Currents of the Ocean, their direction, extent, velocity, and
 the temperature of the water relatively to the ordinary ocean temperature
 in the same latitude, together with the variations in all these respects
 which currents experience in different parts of the year and in different
parts of their course. These, as well as the facts connected with the great
persistent barometric elevations and depressions which we know to exist in
 several oceanic localities, leading to a knowledge of their causes, as well as
of their influence on circumstances affecting navigation, were noticed in the
letter of February 1855 as inquiries well deserving the attention of a
country possessing such extensive maritime facilities and interests as ours,
and as likely to form a suitable contribution on our part to the general
system of meteorological inquiry which had then recently been adopted
by the principal continental states in Europe and America.
    It was learnt from Mr. Babington that much had been done by Ad
miral FitzRoy in the three or four years succeeding the establishment
of his office (and before the subject of storm-warnings had engrossed the
greater part of his thoughts), in directing the attention of many of the
commanders of our merchant ships to the collection of suitable data, and
in improving their habits of observation and of record.             The logs of
such vessels, we were informed, constitute at present a large collection of
documents existing in the office of the Board of Trade, partially examined,
and their contents partially classified.       A full and careful examination
of these for the purpose of ascertaining the amount and value of their
contents was our first recommendation, to be combined with a considera
tion   of the most fitting mode in which the information they might be
found to contain may be made available for public use.          Such an exami
nation may      also be expected   to lead to improvements   in the  instructions
which have been issued to our merchant seamen, who have doubtless be
come more competent to conduct, and even to extend, the observations for
these and similar purposes, than when the system was first introduced.
Those amongst us who have read with the attention it deserves the admirable
paper in which Captain Henry Toynbee has enriched our Proceedings
in the past year with the results of his five Indian voyages, will not doubt the

competency or the disposition that may exist amongst our merchant seamen
to collect materials of the highest value for the investigations which the
President and Council originally recommended ; and we can entertain no
doubt that, whatever itiay prove to be the amount and value of the ma
terials already collected, they will form but a small contribution towards
that general embodiment of the statistics of the ocean which the great in
crease  of our commercial activity makes of pressing importance, and which
may be expected to shorten materially the passages between distant ports.
   The Board of Trade were also desirous to know whether the Royal Society
has any recommendations to make with reference to what may be called
"  Meteorology proper," viz., meteorological observations to be made on
land, in addition to the marine observations which were so strongly urged
in the letter of the President and Council of February 1855.
   The reason why the advantages to be derived from a well-directed system
of maritime observations was more particularly   pressed on that occasion was,
that neither the instruments     nor the modes of observation suitable for   a
well-organized, general, and efficient system of land meteorology had been
then prepared.     The circumstances which constituted the difficulty in this
respect were well stated by Lieut. Maury in a letter addressed to the
United States Government, dated November 6, 1852, subsequently trans
mitted by the American minister to the Earl of Clarendon, and printed in the
papers preceding the Brussels conference, which were presented to the
House of Lords in February 1853. This difficulty no longer exists, having
been wholly obviated by the self-recording system of observation, for which
the necessary instruments have been devised and brought into use at the
Kew Observatory.
    The President and Council have had therefore no hesitation in expressing
 the opinion that systematic meteorological observations at a few selected
land stations in the British Islands are desirable, in addition to the marine
meteorological observations, in order to complete a suitable contribution
from this country to the meteorological observations now in progress in
the principal states of Europe and America, under the authority of their
respective Governments.       A few stations, say six, distributed at nearly
 equal distances in a meridional direction from the south of England to the
north of Scotland, furnished with self-recording instruments supplied from
 and duly verified at one of the stations regarded as a central station, and
 exhibiting a continuous record of the temperature, pressure, electric and
hygrometric state of the atmosphere, and the direction and force of the
 wind, might perhaps    be sufficient to supply an authoritative knowledge of
those peculiarities in the meteorology of our country which would be viewed
as of the most importance to other countries, and would at the same time
form authentic points of reference for the use of our own meteorologists.
The scientific progress of meteorology from this time forward requires in
 deed such continuous records — first, for the sake of the knowledge which
 they alone can effectively supply, and next for the comparison with the

490                           Anniversary Meeting.                       [Nov. 30,
results of independent observation not continuous.          The actual photograms,
or other mechanical representations, transmitted periodically by post to
the central station might be made to constitute a lithographed page for
each day in the year, comprehending        the phenomena at all the six stations —
each separate curve admitting of exact measurement from its own base-line,
the precise value of which might in every case be specified.
   The President and Council have added a suggestion that the Observatory
of the British Association at Kew might, with much propriety and public
advantage, be adopted as the central meteorological station.              It already
possesses   the  principal self-recording   instruments,   and  the greater  part of
these have been in constant use there for many months.                 There would
be no   difficulty in obtaining similar instruments for the affiliated meteoro
logical stations, and in arranging for their verification and comparison with
the Kew standards, as well as in giving to those into whose hands they
may be placed, such instructions as may ensure uniformity of operation.
   You are aware that Royal Princes, Foreign as well as British, who signify
 their desire to enter the Society, and are proposed accordingly, are under
stood to be entitled to immediate ballot. On a late occasion, however, it was
found that, according to the strict letter of the statutes, the head and repre
sentative of a Royal House might be inadmissible by privileged election,
whilst members of the same family of inferior rank were entitled to it. His
 Royal Highness the Count of Paris having expressed a desire to join our
body, it appeared on referring to the Statutes, that although he is the son of
the late Duke of Orleans and hereditary representative of the late King of the
 French, yet, inasmuch as his father had not been a " sovereign prince," the
 Society was precluded from showing him a courtesy which it may extend to
other members of his family who look up to him as the head of their house.
The Council, believing that the Society would desire to see this anomalv
corrected, took, after due deliberation, the prescribed steps for amending the
Statute ; and being advised that the usage of Her Majesty's Court would
afford a suitable criterion of rank applicable to the case, introduced words
                                              ''
extending the privilege in question to           any foreign Prince who is received
by Her Majesty as Imperial Highness or Royal Highness." The unanimous
election of the Count of Paris under the amended Statute may, I think, be
taken as a ratification of the act of the Council.
   I  am glad to avail   myself of this opportunity of stating that the reduc
tion  of  the automatic    records of the bifilar magnetometer at Kew during
the seven years from 1858 to 1864 inclusive has now been completed, so
far as to make known the relative amount of magnetic disturbance in
each of those years.      The results are shown in a note (B)*, by which it will
be seen that 1859 was a year of decided maximum, the aggregate disturb
ances    in that year being considerably greater than          in 1858, and     dimi-

  nishing progressively from 1859 to 1863-1864:               in  18G3   and  1864 the
  amount     of disturbance was nearly identical, and was only about one-third
   of the amount in 1859.          From the general aspect of the photographic
  traces   in the present year (1865), there appears reason to believe that
  the epoch of minimum is now passed.                If this be so, the years 1863-64
  will have been the fourth return of the epoch of minimum since 1823-24
  (Arago's Meteorological Observations, English translation, Editor's Note,
  pages 355 to 357), thus confirming the coincidence with the decennial
  variation   of the sun-spots discovered by Schwabe.
     Those who regard with interest the progressive establishment of the
  theory which assigns a cosmical origin to the Terrestrial Magnetic Varia
  tions, will have noticed the remarkable, but not altogether unanticipated,
  testimony borne to the decennial variation by the annual values of the
  magnetic Inclination at Toronto in the years from 1853 to 1864, in the
  volume recently published by Mr. Kingston, Superintendent of that Ob
  servatory.     The general effect of the disturbances of the Inclination at
 Toronto is to increase what would otherwise be the amount of that ele
 ment    ;  therefore, if the disturbances have       a decennial  period, the absolute
 values of the Inclination      (if   observed with sufficient delicacy) ought to
 show in their annual means a corresponding decennial variation, of which
 the minimum should coincide with the year of minimum disturbance, and
 the maximum with the year of maximum disturbance.                   I have placed in a
 note (C)*- the annual values derived in each case from the regular monthly
 determinations, commencing with 1853, and ending with 1864, taken
 from the publication       referred to, whereby it will be seen that an actual
 variation does exist such as       I  have indicated, 1853 being a minimum and
 1859 a maximum         ; the increasing progression being uninterrupted          from
 1853 to 1859, and the decreasing progression uninterrupted from 1859
 to 1864, the date of the latest published results.
     It was in the year 1853      that the Toronto Observatory was transferred
 to the provincial authorities, and was placed by them under the direction
of Mr. Kingston. The Inclinometer employed is the same which was
described in a paper in the Philosophical Transactions for 1850, Art. IX.,
entitled "On the Means adopted in the British Colonial Magnetic Ob
 servatories for determining the Absolute Values, Secular Changes, and
Annual Variations of the Terrestrial Magnetic Elements ;" and the as
sistants by whom the observations were made were the same persons who
had performed the same duties when the Observatory was under the
direction of Officers of the Artillery.         The results are aValunble exemplifi
cation of the accuracy attainable when proper attention is paid to the
selection of the instruments, and to the employment of careful and skilful
observers.       Such evidence is of more than ordinary interest at the present
time, when such institutions are rapidly increasing.

Royal Society has appeared in the Proceedings ; and the Fellows have
thus been made acquainted, in a general way, with the conclusions which
have been based on the observations so obtained.         The state of the atmo
sphere permitting, pictures of the sun are taken daily by Miss Beckley,
daughter of the resident mechanical assistant ; and these are as regularly
measured and discussed by .Dr. Loewy. In this way has been accumulated
a vast mass of materials on which to found conjectures as to the nature of
the physical forces operating at the surface of the sun ; and, taking these
materials as a basis, Messrs. De la Rue, Stewart, and Loewy have drawn
the conclusions enunciated in their several papers on solar physics.        It is,
however, by no means improbable that other investigators, could they ob
tain access to the same full and complete details of the observations and
measurements, would succeed in evolving other and most important theories
of solar activity, and thus that our knowledge of the subject might be
greatly advanced.     It is moreover evident that in a method of observa
tion so new, and in a subject so intricate,     the minutest fact can hardly be
dismissed as insignificant, seeing that, whatever its present apparent isola
tion, it may hereafter be shown to stand connected with an important
series of facts, towards   a right theory of which it may indeed furnish im
portant aid.    It has therefore to be considered in what way the publica
tion of these voluminous details can be best effected.       Pending this, how
ever, I am glad to state that the authors above-named have themselves
determined to print in detail their first paper, and that a sufficient number
of copies will be placed at the disposal of the Society for distribution
among the Fellows.

the rifle, a range fully equal to that of powder, and, in experiments at the
 School of Musketry at Hythe, under the superintendence of Major-General
Hay, has made excellent shooting, producing diagrams at 1000 yards,
hardly, if at all, inferior to those obtained from the best small-bore rifles
of the day. These diagrams were obtained with a Whitworth Rifle : in
the first, 10 consecutive shots were fired at 1000 yards, with a mean radial
 deviation of 1*65 foot; in the second, 9 consecutive shots at 1000
yards, giving a mean radial deviation of 2*02 feet.       And in the third, 20
consecutive shots were fired at 1000 yards, giving a mean radial deviation
of 2-43 feet. The charge in all cases was 25 grains of gun-cotton, the
angle varying from 3° to 3° 3'.
   The cartridges with which these shots were fired were made by hand :
the defect of cartridges so made is obvious, viz., that they may not be
strictly uniform.     But this is an inconvenience remediable by the employ
ment of very simple machinery.
   In preliminary trials above 2000 rounds have been fired out of one and
the same rifle, without occasioning the slightest injury to the piece.
   The advantages of the cotton charges were manifest in the diminution
of recoil  and smoke, and in the entire absence of fouling.
   The demand for cotton charges for sporting-purposes has become very
considerable since the shooting-season commenced, and they are under
stood to have given very general satisfaction.
   It  is not unreasonable to anticipate that the principles of construction of
the cartridges which have proved so successful in the adaptation to small
arms, may eventually, with suitable modifications, make cotton available
for iron ordnance, as a substitute, in a greater or less degree, for powder,
which is far more dangerous in manufacture and storage. As far as has
been yet tried, the cotton is found to keep perfectly well for any length of
time submerged in distilled water.
   I proceed   to the award of the Medals   : —
   The Council has awarded the Copley Medal to M. Michel Chasles, For.
Mem. U.S., for his Historical and Original Researches in Pure Geometry.
   The historical and original researches of Chasles extend over a period
of about forty years. Throughout this time he has devoted his energies,
with a constancy of purpose rarely equalled, to the restoration and ex
tension of those purely geometrical methods which, bequeathed to us from
antiquity, had their growth arrested during the middle ages, and their utility
temporarily eclipsed by the brilliant discovery of coordinate geometry by
Descartes.     In his well-known ' History of the Origin and Development of
Geometrical Methods,' published in 1837 and crowned by the Academy
of Brussels, Chasles thus expresses what has proved to be the leading object
of his life's labours : —
   " I propose to show, so far as my feeble means will permit, that in a
multitude of questions the doctrines of pure geometry most frequently
present to us that easy and natural path which, penetrating        to the very
                                                               2 p2

 origin of truths, brings us into actual contact with each individual truth,
 and at the same time reveals to us the mysterious chain by which all are
 connected."
    The elaborate work here quoted* is unique of its kind ; it is our highest
 authority on all matters connected with the history of geometry, of which
 science it carefully traces the development from the time of Thales and Py
 thagoras, down to the earlier part of the present century.               Although pro
 fessing   to  be an  aperru   merely,   it nevertheless  represents  a  vast   amount of
 historical research, and is moreover enriched by copious notes containing
 the results of important original investigations.
    In the year 1846 the foundation of a chair of modern geometry was de
 cided upon by the Faculty of Sciences at Paris, and Chasles was at once
 chosen to supply a demand which his own researches had in a great measure
 created.      Thus commenced that personal influence on the younger geo
 meters of his country which still continues, and is traceable in all their
productions.        Another result of this appointment, by which geometers of
 all nations have greatly profited, was the publication, in 1852, of his ' Trea
tise on the Higher Geometry           'f, — a  work in which the three fundamental
principles of pure geometry are, for the first time, fully and systematically
expounded.         These principles embrace the modern theories of anharmonic
ratios, of homographic divisions and pencils, and of geometric involution.
 An anharmonic ratio is in reality a ratio of two ratios, the latter having
reference to two pairs of segments determined by any four points of
a line.      On one peculiar property of this ratio — that of its remaining
unaltered by projection — all modern geometry may be said to be
founded.        Homographic divisions consist of two rows of points, in the
same straight line or in different ones, which so correspond that the
anharmonic ratio of any four points of one row is equal to that of
the corresponding points of the other row.            Finally, two homographic rows,
in the same straight       line, are said to form an involution when to any point
whatever of that line one and the same point corresponds, no matter to
which of the two rows the first point may be conceived to belong.                 Usually
there are two points in such an involution, each of which coincides with its
own corresponding point ; by a mere accident of position, however, the
actual existence of these double points may be destroyed, whilst all other
properties of the involution remain intact.            In this contingency originated
a mode of speech of the greatest utility in geometry.               The double points
are said     to  be real  in  the  one  case, and  imaginary   in the   other.    For the
undisguised and philosophic introduction of imaginary points and lines
into pure geometry we are chiefly indebted to Chasles.

      The term         anharmonic      ratio,   now   universally    employed, is due to
   Chasles ; the ratio itself, however, appears to have been known to Pappus,
   the eminent Alexandrinn geometer of the fourth century.                   Chasles, indeed,
  has shown that        this ratio probably constituted an essential feature of those
  three famous books on Porisms, which Euclid is known to have written,
  but of whose nature vague indications merely have been transmitted to
  us in the mathematical          collections of Pappus.       Robcrt Simson of Glasgow,
  the   well-known       translator of Euclid's 'Elements,' was the first who satis
  factorily solved the enigma concerning the real nature of Porisms, and
  he also succeeded in partially restoring the three lost books.                       Chasles,
  however, was the first to restore them completely; and this he has done in
  a work* which is admitted to be a valuable addition to the history of
  geometrical       science,   as  well as a model       of ingenious and philosophical
  divination.
      Chasles has contributed         to the advancement      of pure geometry, not only
  by means of the three complete works already alluded to, but also through
  the publication of numerous smaller memoirs.                    Of these the following,
  by no means the only important ones, demand a passing reference.
      The papers on " Stereographic Projections" converted a method ori
 ginally devised for the construction of maps into a powerful instrument
  of geometrical transformation.              Two able memoirs on " Cones of the
 Second Order" and on "Spherical Conies," thanks to the translation,
 published in 1841, by Dr. Graves of Trinity College, Dublin, had a direct
 influence on pure geometry in our own country.                   A paper " On the Corre
 spondence between Variable Objects" furnished us with a principle of the
 greatest utility in all higher geometrical investigations.                 In several other
 memoirs the method of generating curves of higher orders by means of
 homographic pencils of curves of inferior orders is perfected, and new
 properties are thereby deduced of plane curves of the third and fourth
 orders.      The theory of non-plane curves, especially those of the third and
fourth orders, had its origin, for the most part, in Chasles's memoirs ; and
 the modern science of kinematics is indebted to him for two valuable papers
on the finite and infinitesimal displacements of a Solid Body. The pro
blem of the attraction of Ellipsoids, rendered celebrated by the investiga
tions of Newton, Maclaurin, Ivory, Legendre, LagraBge, and Laplace, re
ceived from Chasles its first complete synthetical solution.                 In this problem,
too, originated the conception of coufocal surfaces of the second order, the
theory of which he has since greatly perfected.

and in   it the three principles already alluded to find their most appropriate
field of application.      The second volume of this treatise is looked forward
to with interest, as it will contain a full exposition of the admirable researches
on conic sections wherewith       Chasles has just crowned     his labours.   These
researches, a brief account of which appeared during the past year in
the pages of the ' Comptes Rendus,' have put us in possession of an
entirely new method, the nature and utility of which may be rendered
intelligible   even to those who have not made modern geometry a subject            of
special study.
    For the determination       or  construction    of the curves usually called
conies, and     of which the hyperbola, parabola, and ellipse       are species, five
conditions     are  requisite and, in general, sufficient.    The nature of these
five conditions may be such, however, as to admit           of their being satisfied
 by more than one conic.         For instauce, although one conic only can be
 described through five given points, there exist two distinct conies, each of
which passes through four given points, and touches a given line. Hence
arises the important      general question, Roto many conies are there capable
 of satisfying any five conditions whatever 1 By the new method of Chasles
 we are enabled to answer this question, hitherto a difficult one, with great
 facility. Starting from the elementary cases where the five conditions are
 of the simplest possible kind, consisting solely of passages through points
 and contact with lines, he gradually replaces those conditions by more
 complex ones, and finally arrives at a simple symmetrical                  formula
 which fully answers the above question.           Seeing  how   numerous    are the
 questions in conies which may be ultimately reduced to the one here
 solved, we may, without exaggeration, assert that in this single formula a
 great part of the entire theory of conies is virtually condensed.
     The method has been aptly termed by its eminent discoverer a method
 of geometrical substitution. It involves the consideration of the properties
 of a system of conies (infinite in number) satisfying/our common conditions.
 Such a system is for the first time defined in a manner closely analogous
 to that in which curves are distinguished          into orders and classes. We
 merely require to know, first, how many conies of the system pass through
 an arbitrarily assumed point, and, secondly, how many of them touch any-
 assumed line. These two numbers or characteristics, as they are termed,
  being once found, all the properties of the system of conies are thereby-
  expressible.     For instance, the sum of twice the first characteristic and
  three times the second gives us the order of the curve upon which                the
  vertices of every conic of the system are situated.
     This new method of characteristics        has been already applied to curves
  of higher orders, as well as to surfaces ; and, considering the magnitude
  of the new fields of investigation thus opened out, it is probable that, as
  an instrument     of purely geometrical research, the method of Chasles will
  bear comparison with any other discovery of the century.

         Professor Miller,
      M. Chasles being prevented from being present in person to receive the
  Medal which has been awarded to him, I have to request you as our Foreign
  Secretary to receive it for him, and to transmit it into his hands.      It will
  assure him of the very high estimation in which his labours, in a branch
  of mathematical research which for more than a century has been little
  followed and little encouraged, are held in this country.
      The Council has awarded      a  Royal Medal to Joseph Prestwich.      Esq.,
  F.R.S., for his numerous and valuable Contributions to Geological Science,
  and more especially for his papers published in the Philosophical Transac
  tions, on the general question of the Excavation of River Valleys ; and on
 the Superficial Deposits in France and England, in which the Works of Man
 are associated    with the Remains of Extinct Animals.
      It is now not less than sixteen years since the Geological Society awarded
 to    Mr. Prestwich   the Wollaston Medal, the highest honour in their gift,
 for the researches and discoveries he had then made ; and it may be said
 without disparagement to the services he had then rendered to geology,
 that the works he has since completed and published greatly outweigh in
 amount and value what he had achieved in 1849.
      Before that time his writings comprised memoirs both on the palaeozoic
 and tertiary strata : — one on the Old Red Sandstone strata containing
 ichthyolites,   and on some beds of the glacial period at Gamrie ; and
 another, a very elaborate one, on the coal strata of Coalbrook Dale, in
 which he explained in detail the structure of that coal-field, and the
 arrangement and distribution       of the fossils throughout a long succession
 of the carboniferous strata.       In the tertiary formations he introduced a
 considerable    reform in the classification of the English series by proving,
 amongst other points, that the central division of the Bagshot Sands
 coincided in date with the "calcaire grossier" of the Paris Basin, instead
 of occupying, as was before supposed, a much higher place in the series.
      After 18-19, continuing his researches on the English tertiary formations,
he made two other important steps in the advance of our knowledge, viz.,
  1 st, by showing that the clays of the Island of Sheppey, those of Barton,
and those of Bracklesham,          in Hampshire, instead of being all three
contemporaneous, according to the then received opinions, were each due to
a separate period,    — an important rectification of the chronological order of
the British tertiary formations ; and, 2nd, by pointing out that beneath the
fluviatile beds of Woolwich, or that series commonly called the plastic clay
and sands, there existed an older marine formation, for which he proposed
the name of the Thanet Sands — a subdivision            now generally recognized
and adopted.        By establishing the true     position of this subdivision, a
decided step was made towards filling up the wide gap which still divides
the lowest of our Eocene strata from the Maestricht beds or upper part of
the chalk.

     After completing these and other papers, too many to enumerate here,
Mr. Prestwich undertook the more difficult and complicated task of corre
lating the successive tertiary formations of England, France, and Belgium ;
and communicated the results in Memoirs published in the Geological
              ' Journal,'
Society's                 embodying the fruit of many years of travelling and
much thought and study.
     In  1851    Mr. Prestwich published   a separate work on the water-bearing
strata around       London, facilitating the subterranean search for water by
giving actual measurements and probable estimates of the thickness of the
chalk and other beds immediately above and below the chalk, and suggesting
means of obtaining an additional        supply of water for the metropolis.
     In  1 859  Mr. Prestwich presented to the Royal Society a highly important
memoir on the occurrence of flint-implements associated with the remains
 of animals of extinct species in France and England ; and another paper
 in 1863, on the theoretical questions connected with the same subject.
     In these memoirs, as generally throughout all his writings, Mr. Prestwich
 has exhibited in a very marked degree a combination of unwearied labour
 and patience in the accumulation of facts, with a remarkable impartiality
 of judgment in the deduction of their bearing on the existing state of know
 ledge, — a combination, the value of which cannot be too highly estimated.
        Mr. Prestwich,
     I present    you with this Medal in testimony of the high sense entertained
 by   the   Council,  and specially by those Members of the Council who are
 engaged in the same pursuits as yourself, of your laborious researches,
 and of the spirit in which they have been conducted, in the rectification of
 many important points in the geology of this and of neighbouring coun
 tries, and in tracing out the facts of the occurrence of implements, the
 work of man's labour, in association with the remains of extinct animals.
     The Council has awarded a ltoyal Medal to Archibald Smith, Esq.,
  F.R.S., for his papers in the Philosophical Transactions and elsewhere on
 the Magnetism       of Ships.
     The irregularities to which ships' compasses are liable from the disturb
 ing influence of the iron contained in the ship, originally noticed by the
  astronomer Wales in the voyages of Captain Cook, and- subsequently by
  Flinders at the commencement of the present century, attained a magni
  tude in the first of the polar voyages of discovery, viz. that of 1818, which
  forced on the attention of those who were responsible for the navigation of
  the vessels the indispensable necessity of meeting and surmounting the
  difficulties and dangers occasioned thereby.       Having been attached to the
  two first of these expeditions to take charge of all matters of a scientific
  character, this duty devolved more especially on myself ; and before the
  expedition of 1819 quitted the northern shores of Britain (those of the
  Shetland Islands), two leading characteristics of modern practice — the

establishment of a standard compass, in a fixed and suitable position, by
which compass alone the ship's course should be directed and all bearings
should be taken, and the formation of a table of deviations on the several
points   of the compass by the method now              so universally practised of
swinging the     ship — were    adopted   in both the ' Isabella ' and the ' Alex
ander.'     The systematic      character   of the deviations, unprecedented in
amount, which were experienced by these ships in subsequent parts of their
voyage, attracted the attention of an eminent French geometrician, Poisson,
who published, in 182-1, two papers in the Memoirs of the French Institute,
containing a mathematical theory of mngnetical induction, with formulae in
volving coefficients to be determined by observation, expressing the action
of the soft iron of   a ship upon her compass — and, in a subsequent memoir,
adapted the formulae to observations made on shipboard sufficient in num
ber to determine the coefficients in the particular case of the soft iron
being symmetrically distributed on either side of the principal section of
the ship.      The application of these formulae was verified by deviations
calculated for different positions in the high northern latitudes, where the
absolute values of the magnetic elements, as well as the deviations of the
compass on board, had been observed by the polar ships, the observed
and calculated deviations showing a remarkable accordance.
    About twenty years after the date of the Arctic voyages, the system of
compass-correction, which had been so successfully practised in the ships
 engaged in those voyages, was definitely adopted in the Royul Navy, on the
recommendation       of  a committee     appointed by the Admiralty, including
 among its members two of the officers who had served on these voyages,
 viz. the late Sir James Clark Ross and myself.
    At  a somewhat later epoch the       Magnetic Survey of the Antarctic regions
brought into prominent view the importance and value of Poisson's theory.
 By far the greater part of the Survey having to be executed by daily ob
 servation of the three magnetic elements on shipboard, it became desirable
 for the deduction of the results, that the fundamental           equations of Pois
 son's theory should      receive such  a  modification   as should  adapt them to
 the form in which the data generally present themselves.             This was the
 first great service which Mr. Smith       rendered   towards  the correction of the
 irregularities occasioned by the magnetism of ships.            Himself a mathe
 matician of the first order, and possessing a remarkable facility (which is
 far from common) of so adapting truths of an abstruse character as to
 render them available to less highly trained intellects, he derived, at my
 request, from Poisson's fundamental equations, simple and practical for
 mulae including the effects both of induced magnetism and of the more
 persistent magnetism produced in iron which has been hardened by any of
 the processes through which it has passed.            These formula; supplied the
 means of a sufficiently exact calculation when the results of the Survey
 were finally brought together and coordinated.            They were subsequently
 printed in the form       of  memoranda     in the   account of the Survey in the

   not iron ships) the difference of the

                                                    Royal Navy.
      Owing in great measure to these researches, the system
                                                                   practised in the
  Navy has been brought to its present advanced state.
      The outline of the system may be stated
                                                 briefly as follows : —
      1 . As regards the
                         building of ships.   It has been ascertained that the
 amount of disturbance is greatest in iron
                                               ships which are built

 ports) with their heads to the North, and is still
                                                              further and greatly
 increased in armour-plated ships when
                                            they are plated with their heads
 the same direction in which they were built.
                                                                                   in
                                                        It is therefore desirable
that iron ships should not be built with their
                                                        heads to the north, and
that armour-plated ships should be plated in the
                                                          reverse position to that
in which they were built.
     2. In respect to the fitting of ships.   It is held to be essential that in
every ship a Standard Compass should be fixed in a
                                                                position selected,

of any kind should be placed, or should be suffered to remain, within a
certain distance of the Standard Compass ; in the British naval service this
distance is    7 feet :  and all vertical  iron,  such as stanchions,   arm-stands,
&c., should be at a still greater distance ; in the British naval service this
distance is 14 feet, — whether on the same deck or immediately below it.
    It is not difficult to select a place where the Standard Compass can be
most advantageously placed ; but it is difficult, and some more stringent
measures are required than at present exist, to induce ship-builders to
adapt the arrangements of the vessel to the requirements of the compass.
    3.   In respect to those who have to navigate the ship.         Every iron ship
should be swung when her cargo is complete, and when she is ready in all
respects for sea.       Tables of the deviation of the Standard Compass on each
course should be made according to the directions now universally adopted
in Her Majesty's Navy, the tabular deviations being applied as correc
tions to the courses steered.           The table of deviations to be carefully
watched as the ship proceeds on her voyage, by comparison with the azi
muths of celestial objects, and reformed as changes in the geographical
position of the ship, or in the magnetic condition of her iron, take place,
according to rules which have been devised for that purpose, confirmed
by experience, and published by authority.
    By a strict adherence to the precautions, arrangements, and practices
which have been thus briefly sketched, the compass may still, in great
measure, retain its place as the invaluable         guide to the mariner     in iron
ships, as it was formerly in wooden ships.
    But with the increased employment            of iron increased vigilance is re
quired in those on whom the responsibilities             devolve.    The assiduous
labours of several eminent men, and prominently amongst them of Mr.
 Smith, have placed it in the power of any intelligent seaman to navigate
his iron ship with safety ; but it cannot be too strongly inculcated, that no
 processes of supposed correction — whether tabular or mechanical — should
 be allowed to interfere with the habitual and constant practice of examin
 ing the Standard Compass, on all occasions when the state of the heavens
 will permit, by comparisons with celestial objects.
    The benefits of Mr. Smith's labours have not been confined to our own
 Navy. The works to which he has contributed have been translated into
 the German, llussian, and French languages. The British system has been
 adopted in Russia, whose vessels have to navigate a sea in which the mag
 netic dip, and consequently the deviation of the compass, is even greater
 than in our own seas.          A Compass Observatory has been established at
  Cronstadt to fulfil the same purposes as our Compass Observatory at
 Woolwich.       Amongst our neighbours the French, whose fleets approximate
 the nearest to our own in the species of defensive armour which is perilous
  to their navigation, the system adopted in this country to preserve the
  utility of the compass has been the subject of a special mission appointed

 Marine by M. Darondeau, entitled " Rapport a sou Excellence le MinUtre
 de   la Marine sur une Mission accomplie en Angleterre pour etudier les
 questions relatives a la regulation des Compas."             The principal conclu
 sions of this Report in reference to the compass by which the ship's course
 is to be directed, may be stated in a few words ; and I shall employ for
 this purpose M. Darondeau's own expressions, as they are a remarkable
 testimony to the value of the system adopted in the British Navy.
     " Etablir sur tous les batimens un ' Standard Compass,' ou compas de
 relevement a poste fixe, qui ne serait pas corrige.         Ce compas devrait etre
 assez (-leve pour permettre de prendre les relcvemens par dessus le bastin-

    The italics    are mine   ; but the repetition of this last injunction is M. Da
rondeau's own,        and is emphasized by him by being made to occupy a line
by itself.
    M. Darondeau also recommends the employment in the French Marine
of compasses similar to the Admiralty compass of the British Navy, having
four    needles   attached    to the card in the manner and for the purposes
originally suggested by Mr. Smith ; and he does not fail to urge on his
countrymen the indispensable duty of examining the deviations of the
Standard Compass by reference to the heavenly bodies, whenever the state
of the weather will permit.

my position in this chair allows me this day to enjoy — in mine being the

                                     Note A  .
   The    steps  which have led to the procurement of a large reflecting
telescope    for active employment in the southern hemisphere originated in
a resolution passed by the General Committee of the British Association
assembled at Birmingham in September 1849, during the Presidency of
the Rev. Dr. Thomas Romney Robinson. The resolution was as follows : —
    " That an application be made to Her Majesty's Government to esta
blish a reflector of not less than 3 feet in diameter at the Cape of Good
Hope, and to make such additions to the staff of that observatory as may
be necessary for its effectual working ; and that the President be requested
to communicate with the Earl of Rosse and Sir J. llerschel, the Astronomer
Royal, Sir Thomas Brisbane, and Dr. Lloyd on the subject ; and to ob
tain the concurrence in the application of the Royal and Astronomical
Societies of London, the Royal Society of Edinburgh, and the Royal
Irish Academy."
    The communications thus directed having been made, the President
and Officers of the British Association received on the 9th of the No
vember following (1849) a reply from the Council of the Royal Astrono
mical Society, declining to cooperate with the British Association in re
commending the establishment of a large reflector at the Cape of Good
                              "
Hope, on the ground that a system of observations essentially meridional,
as those of the Cape Observatory now are, has very little in common with
a system of observations with a large reflector.     The Council conceive that
the subjects and methods and difficulties of the last-mentioned observa
tions absolutely require the entire energies of a superintendent fitted by
his talents and education to be the head of an observatory.         They con
sider therefore that the proposal in question amounts to nothing less than
the establishment of a new observatory, a measure which the Council [of
                                                                     "
the Royal Astronomical Society] are not prepared to recommend.
   The reply of the Council of the Royal Society of Edinburgh was dated
                                                 "
December 10, 1849, and was as follows : — The Council [of the Royal
Society of Edinburgh] are of opinion that it i3 not expedient at present to
take part in the proposed application to Government relative to the large
reflecting telescope, suggested to be sent to the Cape of Good Hope."
   No specific reply appears to have been received from the Royal Irish
Academy, it having        been stated in a letter from Dr. Lloyd to the Rev.
                         " the Council of the
Dr. Robinson, that                              Royal Irish Academy had de

of the Academy."

    The reply from the Royal Society        of London was dated April           19,
 1 850,  and was as follows  :—
    " The   President  and Council of the Royal Society agree entirely with
the British Association in their estimate of the importance of the active
use of a large reflector in the southern hemisphere, and deem the subject
well worthy of a recommendation to Her Majesty's Government, in which
they would he ready to concur; but they would deem it advisable that,
in such recommendation,       the locality to which the telescope should be
sent, and the establishment to which its use should be confided, should be
left to the choice of Her Majesty's Government."
    These replies were submitted to the Council of the British Association
 on the 20th of May, 1850, when the Council passed the following reso
lution : —
     " That the object which the General Committee had in view in their
resolution for a recommendation to establish a large reflector at the Cape
of Good Hope, viz. the systematic observation of the nebulae of the
 Southern Hemisphere with an instrument of great optical power, would
be accomplished by the establishment of such an instrument in any other
part of the Southern Hemisphere which should be equally suitable for
the observations in question ; the Council are therefore of opinion that the
 President   will be  carrying out the spirit of the recommendation of the
 General Committee, by putting the proposition to be made to Her Ma
jesty's Government in the general form suggested by the President and
 Council of the Royal Society, and by concurring with the President of
the Royal Society in submitting the recommendation so modified to the
consideration of Her Majesty's Government."
    The President (Dr. Robinson) was further requested to draw up a Me
morial to accompany the Resolution, and to communicate thereupon with
the Earl of Rosse, President of the Royal Society.          The Memorial pre
pared by Dr. Robinson, and concurred in by the Earl of Rosse, was presented,
 in accompaniment with the Recommendation of the General Committee
 thus amended, to Earl Russell (then Lord John Russell), the First Lord of
  the Treasury.    The Memorial itself may be referred to in the " Report of
 the Council to the General Committee       of the British Association assem
 bled at Edinburgh in     July 1850."    The reply from the Treasury was as
 follows : —
                                           " Treasury Chambers, August  14, 1850.
     " Sir, — I  am commanded by the    Lords Commissioners of Her Majesty's
  Treasury to acquaint you that your Memorial of the 3rd ultimo, addressed
  to Lord John Russell, applying, on behalf of the British Association for the
 Advancement of Science, for the establishment in some fitting part of Her
 Majesty's dominions of a powerful Reflecting Telescope, and for the ap
 pointment of an observer charged with the duty of employing it iu a
 review of the Nebulae of the Southern Hemisphere, has been referred by
 nis Lordship to this Board ; and I am directed to inform you with re

ference thereto, that while My Lords entertain the same views as those
expressed by you as to the interest attaching to such observations, yet it
appears to their Lordships that there is so much difficulty attending the,
arrangements which alone could render any scheme of the kind really
beneficial to the purposes of science, that they are not prepared to take
any steps without much further consideration.
                                            " am, Sir, &c. &c.,
                                               I
                                                    -' G. CoRNEWall LEWIS."
    This reply, though failing to meet the not unreasonable expectations
which had been founded on the intrinsic importance of the subject itself
and on the earnest recommendation it had received from the two principal
scientific institutions of the kingdom, was still so far satisfactory that it
conveyed the approval of the Government of the principle of the proposi
tion ; it was reasonable to believe therefore that by perseverance and by a
judicious selection of times and opportunities the object would    be eventually
secured.      Such was the view taken by its promoters ; and in accordance
with this view the subject was again brought under the consideration of
the British Association at their Meeting at Belfast in September 1852, in
the opening address of the President, suggesting that a decision should be
taken — whether any, and if any, what official step should be adopted for
its immediate furtherance.       After the usual discussions in Sections and
 Committees,    the General Committee passed the following Resolution : —
    " That it is expedient to proceed without delay in the establishment in
 the Southern Hemisphere of a Telescope not in."erior in power to a 3-feet
 Reflector  ;  and that the President (Col. Sabine), with the assistance of the
 following gentlemen, viz. the Earl of Rosse, Dr. Robinson, Lord Wrot-
 tesley, Professor Adams, the Astronomer Royal, J. Nasmyth, Esq., \Vm.
 Lassell, Esq., Sir*D. Brewster,    and  E.  J  . Cooper, Esq., be requested to
 take such steps as they shall deem     most desirable to carry this resolution
into effect."
    The first step taken by this Committee was to communicate the resolu
 tion to the President (The Earl of Rosse) and Council of the Royal Society,
 who (on the 25th of November, 1852) resolved as follows :
                                                                 —
    " That the President and Council agree with the British Association in
 considering it desirable to proceed without delay in obtaining the establish
 ment of a Telescope of very great optical power for the observation of
 Nebulae in a convenient locality in the Southern Hemisphere ; and that a
 Committee be appointed to take such steps as they may deem most desi
 rable to carry out this resolution. The Committee to consist of Ihe Presi
 dent, Officers, and Council of the Royal Society, with the addition of Sir
 John Herschel, Sir John Lubbock, and the Dean of Ely." It was also
  agreed that the Committee should act conjointly with the gentlemen named
 in the Resolution passed by the British Association.
     The joint Committee applied themselves in the first instance to a con

 sideration  of the most suitable construction and dimensions of a telescope
 for the desired purpose.        This was effected by a correspondence amongst
 the members of the Committee, passing through the Secretary of the Royal
  Society, the letters being printed for greater convenience in circulation. The
 proceedings of this Committee were terminated by a meeting of its mem
 bers at the apartments of the Royal Society on July 5, 1853, -the Earl of
 Rosse, President,in the Chair; when the following resolutionswere passed : —
    " I. That    the Committee approve the proposition made by Mr. Grubb,
 and contained in Dr. Robinson's letter of June 30, 1853, for the construc
 tion of a four-foot Reflector.
    "  2. That application      be made to   Her Majesty's Government     for the
 necessary funds.
    "  3. That the Presidents      of the Royal Society and of the British Asso
 ciation, accompanied by Dr. Robinson, who was associated with the Earl of
  Rosse in the former application, and Mr. Hopkins, the President elect of
 the British Association, be a deputation to communicate with Government
 respecting the preceding Resolutions.
    "  4. That the Earl     of Rosse, Dr. Robinson, Mr. Warren De la Rue, and
 Mr. Lassell be a Subcommittee for the purpose of superintending the pro
 gress of Mr. Grubb' s undertaking."
    No record appears to have been made of the subsequent steps taken by this
 Committee ; but it is understood that the application was made to the Earl
 of Aberdeen, who had become First Lord of the Treasury, and that the
 reply received   was   that  "  no funds could be then spared as the country
 was engaged in the Crimean war ; but that when the -crisis then impending
 was past the matter should be taken up."            Lord Aberdeen's retirement
 from office, and subsequent death, rendered this promise      of no avail.
    I must now advert     to a circumstance which has exercised a most beneficial
influence on the proposition for a southern telescope, and has contributed
greatly to bring it to its present advanced stage.       Amongst the Members
of the Mathematical and Physical Section of the British Association who
took part in the discussions relating to the telescope at the Belfast Meet
ing, there was one, Mr. William Parkinson Wilson, Professor of Mathe
matics in Queen's College, Belfast, who was remarked for the deep and
earnest interest with which he viewed the subject.            Appointed shortly
afterwards to the Mathematical          Chair in the University of Melbourne,
Professor    Wilson appears to have been impressed by the suitability of
Melbourne for such n telescope, both from its latitude and climate, and
from the increasing wealth and public spirit of its inhabitants manifested
in the liberal support given to many scientific institutions.         Melbourne
enjoyed also at that time the great advantage of a Governor, Sir Henry
Barkly, whose education and acquirements enabled him to appreciate the
importance in such a colony of scientific cultivation.          Being appointed
 Hon. Secretary of the Board of Visitors of the Melbourne Observatory,

then in process of organization, and with the sanction of the Governor, who
was President of the Board, Professor Wilson submitted to the considera
tion of the Observatory Committee of the Philosophical Institute of Vic
toria a scheme for the establishment at Melbourne of a reflecting telescope
of 4 feet aperture to carry out the objects which had been proposed by the
Royal Society and British Association, as already narrated.          In this pro
position Professor Wilson was warmly supported by Captnin Kay, R.N.,
F.R.S., one of the Board of Visitors, who had been for several years Super
intendent of the Magnetical and Meteorological Observatory in the sister
colony of Tasmania.       After discussions at several Meetings, a Memorial
was adopted and presented to the Chief Secretary of the Government,
adverting to the favourable condition of the finances of the colony, and
urging the establishment of such a telescope at Melbourne " as suited alike
to render an important service to science, and to redound           highly to the
credit of the colony, both in Australia and in Europe."
   The favourable reception of this Memorial by the Government of Vic
toria, and the proceedings which followed, will be best explained by the
following despatch from Sir Henry Barkly to the Duke of Newcastle, then
Secretary of State for the Colonies, transmitted to the Royal Society on
October 10, 18G2, accompanied by the expression of His Grace's assurance
that " the Royal Society would do whatever may be in their power for
encouraging science in the colony of Victoria."

the honour to preside, being of opinion that the project long entertained
of erecting in the Southern Hemisphere a telescope of much greater optical
power than that used by Sir John - Herschel at the Cape of Good Hope,

on the part of scientific men in England, has requested me to bring the
subject under Your Grace's notice, with a view to its being submitted for

Government      is not    applied for; but I need hardly say that even the
smallest donation from that quarter would much facilitate raising the neces
sary funds.
    I avail myself  of this opportunity to put Your Grace in possession of the
Second Annual Report of the Board of Visitors, from which it will be
found    that a commencement          has been made in the erection of the new

    Should it be possible, therefore, to add an equatorially mounted                tele

     I have the honour, by direction of the Board of Visitors to the Obser
 vatories, to forward       to Your Excellency the accompanying extract from
 the Minutes of a Meeting held yesterday, and to express a hope that you
 will comply with the request contained in it.
     Though entertaining        no doubt    of the importance of the results to be
 obtained by such a telescope as is recommended, er of the conspicuous
 and creditable position which Melbourne would consequently occupy in
 the eyes of all persons in Europe who take an interest in Science, the Board
 is desirous   of obtaining an expression of opinion from scientific men in
 England,    because   it is  due to those who may be asked to contribute towards
 its accomplishment        that   the importance of the object should be attested
 by higher scientific authority than the Board can lay claim to ; because
 also it considers that every means should be used to obtain, so far as funds
  will permit, the   best instrument      which modern skill and recent inventions
 render possible ; because, finally, the Board feel that, whether the cost of
  the instrument be defrayed wholly or partially by private contributions or
  a grant from the Legislature, public sympathy will be much more strongly
  enlisted in its favour by a statement of the interest taken in the matter in
  Europe, and by the approval of the Imperial Government, than by any
  representation which the Board can make.

                       Observatories,    held 15   July   1862.
  " The    attention   of the Board having     been    drawn to the following       cir
cumstances —
  "I.   .That,   as long             the facts brought to light by Lord
                            since as 1849
Bosse's Telescope were judged by the Boyal Society of London and the
British Association for the Advancement of Science to be so important as
to justify them in making an urgent appeal to the British Government for
the erection, at some suitable place in south latitude, of a telescope for the
examination of the multiple stars and the nebulae of the Southern Hemi
sphere, having greater optical power than that used by Sir John Herschel
at the Cape of Good Hope ; which appeal there is little doubt would have
been successful but for the Russian war and the consequent expenditure ;
   " II. That, since that time, Lord Bosse reports that he has discovered
systematic changes in some of the most important northern nebulae ;
  " III. That  the interest and scientific importance of the solution of the
problem of their physical structure, as well as the probability of its accom
plishment, are thus greatly increased ;
  " IV. That    some of the most important nebulae, and those presenting
the greatest variety of physical features in close proximity, can be observed
only in places having a considerable southern latitude ;
   '' V. That the
                   geographical position and clear atmosphere of Melbourne
render it peculiarly suitable for this work, and that the arrangements
already made for the establishment of an Astronomical Observatory on a
permanent footing offer great facilities for carrying it on ;
   " VI. That, independently of the especial object to which such telescope
would be applied, an Astronomical Observatory cannot be considered com
plete without an equatorially mounted telescope of large optical power :
  " It was Besolved, —
  " 1st. That, in the opinion of the Board,        the establishment   of such   a tele
scope in Melbourne would materially promote the advancement of science.
   " 2nd. That, before applying to the Colonial Government for any pecu
niary grant in aid of this object, His Excellency the Governor be requested
to obtain, through the Secretary of State for the Colonies, an expression of
opinion from scientific men in England as to the importance of the results
to be expected from      the most suitable construction of telescope for the
                           it,
purpose, both as to the optical part and the mounting, its probable cost,
and the time requisite for its completion."
   On the receipt of this communication from the Colonial Office,     corre a
spondence ensued, passing through myself as President of the Royal Society,
consisting of twenty-three letters, the writers being Mr. Lassell, Sir John
Herschel, the Earl of Rosse, Dr. Bobinson, Mr. Grubb, and Mr. De Rue,        la
which was printed for private circulation amongst the Fellows of the Royal
Society.   The correspondence led to and terminated iu the following Report
                                                                   2   a2

510                                 Anniversary Meeting.                       [Nov. 30,
from the President and Council addressed to the Duke of Newcastle, in
reply to His Grace's communication of October 10, 18C2 : —
" Report of the   President and Council of the Royal Society respecting the
   proposal of erecting in Melbourne a Telescope of greater optical power
   than any previously used in the Southern Hemisphere.
   " 1 . The President and Council learn with pleasure that the Board of
Visitors at the Melbourne Observatory have proposed resolutions, indica
ting their sense of the importance of erecting at Melbourne an equatorially
mounted Telescope of great optical power, and that the proposal is favour
ably regarded by Sir Henry Barkly, Governor of Victoria, and by His
Grace the Secretary for the Colonies.      In respect to the importance which
the President  and  Council  attach  to such  an undertaking, they need do no
more than refer to the fact that in the year 1850 the Royal Society and
the British Association for the Advancement of Science presented a joint
Memorial to Her Majesty's Government, in which they urged the establish
ment of such a telescope at some suitable place in the Southe'rn Hemi
sphere.    The scientific objects to be attained thereby are so clearly stated
in that Memorial, of which a copy is enclosed, and in the Resolutions of
the Board of Visitors of the Melbourne Observatory, in July 1862, that
the President and Council feel it unnecessary to do more than refer to these
documents.
   "2. Since the presentation of the Memorial of 1850, an equatorially
mounted telescope of greater optical power than that then recommended
has actually been constructed by Mr. Lassell, at his own expense, in Eng
land, and erected in Malta, where he is now occupied in making obser
vations with it    :   we have now, therefore,   in addition to our previous know
ledge, the benefit of his experience. In referring to Mr. LasseH's Telescope,
the President and Council wish       however, to be understood that they do
                                          it,
not conceive that     should necessarily be copied in all respects, and that
                         it
for the present they think     best to leave the details of construction in
                                     it
many respects open to further consideration.
   "3. When the subject was previously under consideration, letters were
written to some of the most eminent practical astronomers of Great Britain
and Ireland, requesting them to state their opinions as to the best mode of
construction   ;   and  correspondence ensued, of which
                         a                               printed copy
                                                                  a     sent      is
herewith.      After receiving the communication from the Colonial Office of
the 10th   of last October, the President wrote to the four gentlemen who
were appointed as     Committee on the former occasion to superintend the
                         a
construction of the instrument (in case the Government should accede to
the request), and also to Sir John Herschel, enclosing   copy of the former
                                                                  a
correspondence, and asking whether their views had in any way changed
in the interval.         The answers received from each have            been   circulated
among the others, as was done on the former occasion, and have in most
cases elicited additional remarks.
   "4. Availing        themselves    of the information    thus    so   kiudly afforded

    1865.]                          President's Address.                             511
   them, the President and Council have to recommend as follows               regarding
   the construction     of the instrument contemplated.
       "
         (a) That the telescope be a reflector, with an aperture of not less than
   four feet. This is essential, as no refractor would have the power required.
       "
         (b) That the large mirror be of speculum-metal.          Such mirrors can be
   constructed with certainty of success, and at a cost which can be foretold ;
   whereas the recently introduced plan of glass silvered by a chemical process
   has not yet been sufficiently tried on so large a scale as that contemplated.
       "
         (c) That the tube be constructed of open work, and of metal.              Lord
   Rosse has recently changed the tube of his three-foot altazimuth from a
   close to an open or skeleton one, and it is understood that he intends doing
  the same with his great telescope.           Mr. Lassell's tube is also an open one,
  which his experience leads him decidedly to prefer.
      "         The telescope should   be furnished  with  a clock-movement     in right
         (c?)
  ascension.
      "         Apparatus for repolishing    the speculum should be provided.
         (e)
      "
         (/)    With respect to the form of reflector     to be adopted, some differ
  ence   of opinion exists,   as the Newtonian     and Cassegraiuian have each some
  advantages not possessed by the other.              On this point further corre
  spondence appears        desirable ;  but  as the main  features of the scheme are
  the same in both cases, there does not appear to be any occasion to wait
  till this point shall have been finally decided.
      " 5. With respect to the cost, something must depend on the solidity of
  the construction and the perfection of the workmanship ; but if it be
  assumed that the workmanship shall be of the best description, and the
 instrument furnished, as seems desirable, with polishing apparatus, and a
 second speculum for using while the other is being polished, it is probable
 that the cost will not fall much short of ^65000.
      " 6. It is estimated that the construction of the instrument will occupy
 about eighteen months.
      "  7.   It seems  highly desirable that the future Observer should come to
 England during a part at least of the time occupied in the construction of
 the instrument, in order that he may become thoroughly acquainted with
 nil its details, and especially with the mode of repolishing ; and also that
 he may personally acquaint himself with the working arrangements followed
 at the Observatories of the Earl of Rosse and Mr. Lassell, who have
                                                                        x
 expressed their willingness to afford him every facility."
     This Report, accompanied by several copies of the Correspondence               ad
verted to, was transmitted in due course to Melbourne.
     In 1863 Mr. Lassell made the most liberal offer of freely presenting for
the observations at Melbourne his own 4-foot reflector, with which he had
been carrying on a series of observations at Malta, as jsoon as that series
should be completed, or in the course of a year or two.             The construction
of this telescope had        been largely considered and discussed in the corre
spondence already adverted to.           On Mr. Lassell-s    munificent   offer  beiug

612                           Anniversary Meeting.                     [Nov. 30,
transmitted      to Melbourne, the authorities there were at first disposed to
embrace it   ;  but  subsequently, on further consideration and correspondence,
they determined to revert to the original plan, of a telescope to be con
structed by Mr. Grubb expressly to meet in the most perfect attainable
manner all the special requirements of the case.         This plan is described in
a letter addressed to Dr. Robinson on the 3rd of December, 1862, being the
thirteenth letter in the printed Correspondence referred to. It seems scarcely
possible to doubt the wisdom, in every point of view, of the decision thus
arrived at. The alterations which would have been required in Mr. Lassell's
telescope would have demanded a large proportion of the time and the ex
pense needed for the construction of the new one ; and the result would have
been that    Europe would have lost all the services which Mr. Lassell's tele
scope may still perform — while Australia would have had a much less per
fect instrument, for the especial purposes in view, than it will now possess.
    In April 1864 a proposition for a grant of .£5000, to cover the expense
 of constructing a telescope, was submitted to the Colonial Legislature by
one of its members, Mr. Alexander John Smith, also a Member of the
Board of Visitors of the Observatory, who, previously to his residence in
Victoria, had been one of that band of highly-trained naval observers who,
under the command of Sir J. C. Ross, had accomplished, between the
years 1839 and 1843, the Magnetic Survey of the Antarctic regions, and
had subsequently become one of the officers employed with Capt. Kay in
the Magnetical and Meteorological Observatory at Hobarton.              This pro
position was successful ; and the notification received from Professor 1Wilson
is printed in the text of this Address, p. 483.

    The number of hourly tabulations from the photographic traces of
the bifilar magnetometer at Kew, between January 1, 1858, and December
31, 1864, is 60,491 : of these, the number in which the amount of dis
turbance from the normal of the same year, month, and hour equalled or
exceeded 0*150 division of the scale, or *0015 of the total horizontal
force at Kew, was 5932, being about one in ten of the whole number of
tabulated hourly values.        The aggregate value of the 5932 disturbed ob

                                        " Board of Trade, Whitehall, 25th July,  18G5.
   " Srn, — I am  directed by the Lords of the Committee of Privy Council
for Trade to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 25th May, and
its inclosed Memorandum, calling attention to the subject of the adjust
ment of compasses in iron vessels.
   " The Memorandum states that the subject of the deviation of com
passes is one which has hitherto been regarded as too intricate and obscure
to be made the subject of practical rules for seafaring men, but that recent
experience has placed the science on a sound basis, and has made it pos-
siblo to frame rules which there will be no practical difficulty in applying.
   " The Memorandum further intimates what those rules should be with
respect to the placing and adjustment of compasses, and suggests that mea
sures should be taken by the Board of Trade to enforce their observance.
It  also suggests that steps should be taken to compel Merchant Officers to
become acquainted with them ; and finally recommends that for the ac
complishment    of these purposes an Officer should      be appointed, whose     duty
it should be, in communication with the Compass Department of the Ad
miralty, to aid the Board of Trade in carrying it into effect.
                        * Published by order of  the Council.

1865.]              and on the Meteorological Department.
   " The Board of Trade desire      me  in reply to return their thanks to tho
Royal Society for calling attention to a subject which is of first-rate im
portance to the Mercantile Marine.        They have no doubt that the present
practice is far from satisfactory ; nor do they think that the steps taken
by the Board of Trade under the provisions of existing Acts are such as
to remedy the evil.      At   the samo time they can see considerable       diffi
culty in adopting all the suggestions made by the Royal Society.
   " The stcps which the Board of Trade now take are as follows : —
   " The Merchant Shipping Act        provides that the compasses   of passenger
steamers shall be adjusted to the satisfaction of the Board of Trade Sur
veyors, and according to regulations laid down by the Board of Trade.
This duty the Surveyors do as well as the means at their disposal enable
them to do, and according to regulations which will be found in para
                                           ' Instructions to
graphs 83 to 86 of the accompanying                          Surveyors.'
   " As regards the information of Masters and Mates, the Board of Trade
have circulated a pamphlet, prepared by Mr. Towson, of Liverpool, which
is, no doubt, known to the Royal Society, and have added a general ques
tion on the subject to the Examination-papers.
   " Under these circumstances it is to be considered whether the Board of
Trade can, and whether, if they can, they ought to do more than they d
either as regards the proper supply and adjustment of compasses, or as
regards tho diffusion of information on the subject.
    " As regards the first of these points, viz. the proper supply and adjust
ment of compasses, the Royal Society will, no doubt, concur with the
Board of Trade in thinking that it is very undesirable for the Legislature
or the Government, except under very exceptional circumstances, to take
upon themselves responsibilities which properly belong to shipowners and
insurers, or to dictate to those persons the mode in which they shall carry
on their business.      The proper supply and adjustment of compasses is a
matter so material to the safety and success of their undertakings, that
motives of self-interest are likely to effect much greater and much better
results  than could be hoped for by the compulsory interference of a Go
vernment Department.         These considerations will have to be very care
fully weighed before any attempt is made to obtain from the Legislature
further powers for the regulation of compasses in merchant ships. And
under the law, as it now stands, the Board of Trade do not see what effec
tual step they can take in the direction pointed out by the Royal Society.
    " In the first place, the powers under which they act only apply to pas
senger steamers, whilst the want which the Royal Society wish to meet is
felt just as much in the case of other iron vessels, which are becoming
more numerous every day.
   " In the second place, the powers of the Board of Trado only extend
to obtaining a Certificate ' that the compasses have been properly adjusted.'
They   do not enable the Board     of Trade or its Officers to see that the com
passes are good,   or to  require — what  the Royal Society appears to consider

518                      Correspondence       on Magnetism   of Ships,       [Nov. 30,
the most important condition of all — that there should he a Standard Com
pass (in addition to the Steering Compass) so placed as to he free from
local attraction.
  " This      Board      cannot, therefore, do what is wanted       under the present
Acts.
  " There       is,   however,     a  body, namely, Lloyd's Register Committee, whose
proper business         it   is   to see that ships classed by them are seaworthy, and
My Lords will refer this part of the subject to them, stating what they
hear upon the subject from the Royal Society.      This Board will also
gladly communicate to Lloyd's any practical rules which the Royal So
ciety can furnish as to the supply, placing, and adjustment of compasses,
and as to the effect upon them of different modes of construction of the
hull of the ship.
   "Secondly. As regards the diffusion of information on the subject of
compasses, especially among Merchant Officers, the first desideratum ap
pears to be a clear and intelligible Manual or set of directions upon the
subject, containing such practical rules as the present state of Science can
furnish, and such a statement of the principles as may be necessary for
the comprehension of those rules.     My Lords will be glad to be informed
by the Royal Society     they can put them in the way of obtaining such
                                  if                                                a
Manual. Any expense connected with its preparation will be readily de
frayed by the Board of Trade.
   " The next step to be taken would be to introduce the subject into places
of nautical education.   On this the Board of Trade can do nothing except
communicate with the Science and Art Department, which they will gladly
do on hearing from the Royal Society that such       Manual as above men
                                                             a
tioned   is   in preparation.
  " The third   step would be to introduce the subject more effectually into
Examinations in Navigation, and to have printed questions prepared for
the purpose.    On this point also the Board of Trade would be glad to know
whether the Royal Society can give them information or assistance.         One
difficulty which  will arise will be  the difficulty in finding  Examiners who
have given sufficient attention to the subject, and the first step must pro
bably bo to instruct the Examiners themselves.            For this purpose also
the suggested Manual will be of great importance.
   " The steps suggested above may be taken with the aid of the Royal
Society, without any such appointment by the Board of Trade of an addi
tional officer as the Royal Society suggest.
   " This disposes .of most of the important points referred to. There are
two which still require notice.    The Royal Society propose that the sug
gested new Officer of the Board of Trade shall assist at inquiries into
wrecks, where questions arise concerning tho deviation of the compass.
Though the Board of Trade are not prepared to appoint          special officer
                                                                         a
for this purpose, or to commit the inquiry to such an officer, they think
that  it would bo very useful        in the cases of future inquiries into
                                            if,

raised, a person thoroughly acquainted with the subject could attend and
give the Court the benefit of his opinion.             On this subject the Board will
 communicate with tho Admiralty.
    " Lastly,   the Royal Society refer to the possible improvement of tho
 science by means of farther observations.              As regards this, all the Board
 of Trade could do would be to obtain observations from Masters of mer
chant ships, in the manner originally proposed by tho Royal Society, when
 the Meteorological Department of this office was established.                The whole
 subject of that department is now under consideration, and this branch of
tho subject of the Royal Society's letter           will be considered in connexion
with the rest of that department.

   " Sib, — I  am directed by the Lords of the Committee of Privy Council
for Trade, to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 15th June last,
on the subject of the Meteorological Department of the Board of Trade,
and to thank yourself and the Council of the Royal Society for the valu
able information, advice, and suggestions which it contains.
    " The Council of the Royal    Society discuss the system of Weather Tele
graphy, and recommend that it shall be continued ; they approve of the
proposal to hand over to the Hydrographer to the Admiralty such part of
the observations collected in the Meteorological Department of the Board
of Trade as he can make use of in constructing Charts for the use of sea
faring men. And they discuss and recommend the adoption of a new
system of making and recording Meteorological Observations on land.
    " As regards, however, one branch of the subject, viz. Meteorological
Observations made at sea, which formed the original object of the Meteo
rological Department, and the chief subject of the letter from the Royal
Society of the 22nd February, 1855, the Board of Trade are not satisfied
that they fully understand the present views of the Royal Society.
    " Your letter says in answer to Question 1, contained in my letter of
 the 20th May last, asking ' Are the objects specified in the Royal Soci
 ety's letter of the 22nd February, 1855, still as important for the inte
 rests of Science and Navigation as they were then considered ?' that ' The
 President and Council are of opinion that the objects specified in the
 Royal Society's letter of 22nd February, 1855, are as important for the
interests of Science as they were then considered.'
    " And it further says in answer to Question 2, asking ' To what extent
have any of these objects been answered by what has already been done
 by the Meteorological Department ?' that ' Much has without doubt been
 accomplished in the collection of facts bearing on Marine Meteorology;
 but as no systematic publication of the results has yet been made, the
 President and Council are unable to reply more specifically.'              It is pro
 bably lor the reasons contained in this answer, that whilst the other sub

 522                 Correspondence     on Magnetism    of Ships,       [Nov. 30,
jecis above mentioned are fully discussed in your letter, the subject of
 these Meteorological      Observations at sea is scarcely referred to.
    " It is, however,     essential that the Board of Trade should be      rightly
 informed    upon this point before they can determine         what steps should
 be taken   with regard    to the Meteorological Department.     What is the value
 of the Observations at       sea already collected ? what steps should be taken
 to make them     useful  ?  and  whether any, and, if any, what further observa
 tions of the same kind should be collected, are questions which must be
 answered before any final arrangement can be made with respect to the
 other points mentioned in your letter. With the view of clearing up these
 points, the Board of Trade are disposed to suggest the appointment of a
 small Committee, consisting, say of three or four persons, to examine the
 whole   of the data already collected by the Meteorological Department;
 to inquire whether any, and what steps should be taken for digesting and
 publishing them ; and also to report whether it is desirable that observa
 tions of a similar kind shall still continue to be collected.       Such a Com
 mittee would also in all probability bo able to make valuable recommenda
 tions as to the mode in which the business of the Department (if continued)
 shall be conducted, and as to the form in which the daily weather reports
 (by whomsoever they may be made) should be published.
    " If  the Royal Society concur in this suggestion, the Board of Trade
 would ask them to appoint, as a member of the Committee, some gentleman
whose acquirements would enable him to give valuable advice on the scien
tific part of the subject, and they would also ask the Admiralty to appoint
another member.         The Board of Trade will feel much obliged if you will
favour them with the opinion of the President and Council on this sugges
tion.
    " With   reference to the subject of Meteorological Observations on land,
the Board of Trade do not clearly understand whether the Royal Society
think that they should be substituted for, or be in addition to the Meteoro
logical Observations at sea, which were originally suggested by the Royal
Society.     They are disposed to agree with tho Royal Society in thinking
that any observations of a scientific nature would be better conducted under
the authority and supervision of a scientific body such as the Royal Society,
or the British Association, than of a Government Department.             But they
do not see how they could advise the Government to sanction any plan
which would involve the establishment of two separate Offices for Meteo
rological purposes, one under the Board of Trade at Whitehall, and the
other at Kew.       It seems to them obvious that any assistance to be given
by Parliament for Meteorological          purposes will be more advantageously
employed if concentrated at one place, and in one set of hands, than it can
be  if distributed   among different Establishments.

                                   "Admiralty, Hydrographic   Department, September 1865.
      " Sir, — Having carefully          examined    the correspondence between the
  President and Council of the Royal Society and the Board of Trado on the
  Magnetism of Ships, together with tho Memorandum appended to the
  President's letter of the 18th May, and having also considered tho requi
  sitions made by the Board of Trade to the Admiralty, by letter of the 28th
 July, 1865, to bo furnished through the Compass Department with any
 information or suggestions on the subject,             I  have to submit the following
 for your consideration.
      " Tho   Memorandum         of the Royal Society is so comprehensive in its
 general views of the subject, that little remains to bo added to the argu
 ments and reasons therein advanced ; but in those matters of detail which
 would require attention in the event of action being taken on the recom
 mendations of that body, there are several suggestions which present them
 selves, and which possibly may be useful to the Board of Trade.                To these
I address myself.
     " To  clearly understand tho existing difference of administration, in com
pass-equipment and efficiency, between the Royal and Mercantile Marine,
it is necessary to point out the views the Board of Admiralt)7 entertained,
and the steps they deemed it necessary to take on the introduction of
steam machinery, and of so much iron in the general construction of ships
of the Royal Navy.
     " Passing over the investigations successively made under their auspices
by Flinders in 1814, Barlow in 1821, and Johnson in 1830 the Admiralty
in   1837, ' deeming     it necessary to apply     some remedy to an evil so pregnant
with mischief,' referring to the then defective state of the compasses sup
plied to Her Majesty's ships, ' have determined to have the subject fully in
vestigated     by a Committee         of Officers conversant with magnetic instru
ments.' Resulting from the labours of this Committee, which extended
     VOl. XIV.                                                              2 R

624                        Correspondence   on Magnetism    of Ships,         [Nov. 30,
over several years, -was not only the improvement  of the compass itself, but
the establishment of a system of compass-adjustment which has since been
uniformly followed in Her Majesty's Navy, t
   " The principal features of this system are the following : —
   " 1. The having in each ship a standard compass distinct from the steer
ing-compass, fixed in a position selected, not for the convenience of the
helmsman, but for the moderate and uniform amount of the deviation at
and around           it,
                  by which compass alone the ship           is
                                                        navigated.
   " 2. The requiring each ship to be swung, and to be navigated by      Table  a
of Errors.
   "The Admiralty further at this period (1842), to ensure the proper
manufacture and adjustment of the standard compass, especially the selec
tion of its position in the ship, and the general supervision of the swinging-
                                                                          '
of the ships of the Fleet, created          small Compass Department, and
                                               a
erected an Observatory and offices for the general examination of all the
compasses supplied to Her Majesty's ships.       As matter of opinion,
                                                           a              may  I
here express my belief that indirectly this latter establishment has tended
very much to the improvement of compasses generally.
   " The Admiralty           at this time also issued a small book of Rules, known
as the  Practical Rules for ascertaining and applying the deviations of
            '                    '
the compass these Rules have undergone revision and addition from time
                     ;
to time.        (The latest edition
                                appended.)
                                      is
   "General rules were also now laid down for guarding, in the equipment
of the ship, against the near proximity of iron to the compass extracts   :
embracing        the leading      features of these Rules   will be found in Appen
dix    1.
   " In
      1862, consequent on the increased use of iron in the construction
and armature of ships of war, there was issued for the service of the
Fleet, the Admiralty Manual of the Deviations of the Compass,'
                -'
                                                                     work      a

of the educated seaman the theory and general principles of the magnet
ism of ships, as also so much of the elements of terrestrial magnetism as
affected the navigator.
  " In      the Mercantile Marine, regulations      for the examination
                                                                and adjust
ment of the compasses are confined to sea-going passenger steamers.                 I
gather from the letter of the Board of Trade, in reply to the Royal Society,
as indeed   I        am aware from general     personal knowledge, that practically,
except perhaps in            the larger shipping companies, these regulations are
inoperative, or nearly so.
  " For example, there are no prescribed rules    as to the number, the posi
tion,  or the efficiency of the compasses, and there     no guarantee for the
                                                                 is
competency of the adjuster, in whose hands the whole arrangements are
 generally placed. In many ports, and especially that of London, there               is
inefficient provision for swinging the ships.
   " It appears unnecessary to remark, after what has just been
                                                                       briefly

   1865.]              and on the Meteorological Department.                   525
   stated, that the system adopted to ensure security of navigation in the Royal
   Navy has no counterpart in the Mercantile Marine. The assimilation in
  practice of the two services, so far as relates to the more essential points,
  would certainly be a desirable end to attain.
      " I have already briefly detailed the two leading features of the Admi
  ralty system : — The first of these (the navigating the ship by a standard
  compass) is in itself so simple, and has proved in practice so secure, and
  the neglect of    it in many   cases in merchant ships has been followed by
  such disastrous     consequences, that  I conceive there is no question that it
  should be enforced wherever there are the means of enforcement.          Indeed,
  were it rendered imperative by law, that every vessel making a long sea
  voyage, and every iron vessel, whether employed coasting or foreign, should
  be fitted with a standard compass,     I am of opinion   this measure would not
  only directly tend to their secure navigation, but would indirectly tend to
 foster that knowledge of compass-laws and action now found to have be
 come a necessity, when iron ships are the rule, and not the exception, as
 was the case some twenty years past.         On the assumption that a measure
 of this nature must eventually obtain,        I have appended a few short and
 simple    rules  (Appendix    II.),  which  perhaps might bo advantageously
 recommended by the authority of the Board of Trade, or Lloyd's Register
 Committee.
 .
     " With reference to the second leading   feature of the Admiralty system : — -
 .   " For many years in the Boyal Navy       the adjustment practised consisted
 in the careful selection of       a place for the standard compass, and the
 formation of a Table of Errors by the process of swinging the ship ; and
 this proved sufficient so long as the deviations were moderate in amount.
     " In many recent iron-built and iron-plated ships the amount of devia
 tion is, however, so large that the employment of magnets to reduco the
amount of deviation has become unavoidable ; but the correction by mag
nets, however perfect it may be, is not considered in the Royal Navy as
 superseding the obtaining a Table of Errors and navigating the ship by
that Table.
      " The benefits which have been derived       in the Royal Navy, both      as
regards the safety of ships, and the theoretical      and practical knowledge of
the subject we have thereby obtained, cannot,        I think, be over-estimated ;
and     I may add that    I  consider that no compass can be said to be ' pro
perly adjusted' of which, whether compensated by magnets or not, a
Table of Errors has not been obtained by the process of swinging the ship,
and that Table examined by a competent person.;
     " Closely connected with the subject is that of the construction of the
compass itself, as regards form and workmanship, magnetic power, and
adjustment.       This subject received much of the attention of the Committee
I   have referred to ; and the result of their labours was the production of
the 'Admiralty Standard Compass,' an instrument which has stood the
test of twenty-five years' use, with little modification introduced, and
                                                                  2 r2

526                  Cmrespondencc     on Magnetism    of Skips,       [Nov. 30,
which has been adopted in all countries which directed their attention to
this subject.
    " Although indirectly the introduction of this compass into the Royal
Navy has been the cause of much improvement in the compasses of the
Mercantile Marine, therois still room for improvement.           At present much
expcnso is incurred in matters which are merely ornamental, and in some
cases prejudicial.       Probably much advantage would be derived from a
model compass being fixed upon, which at a moderate price would supply
the Mercantile Marine with the great desideratum of a compass of suffi
cient delicacy and accuracy.        Considering that a few notes relating to the
efficient points of a compass may prove useful, these notes will be found as
Appendix      III.
    " There    are yet two features in the
                                              '

to me as being worthy of consideration in any system that may be con
 templated for assimilating the practice of the Mercantile Marine to that
 of the Royal Navy. These are, —
        " 1st. As to the efficiency of those who engage to perform the adjust
             ments.
        " 2nd. The   periods for examining the adjustments.
     " By constant practice, but without any very clear knowledge             of the
 principles of magnetism, several [skilful adjusters of compasses are to be
                                                                            '
 found at some of tho great mercantile ports.            These ' adjusters     must,
 from their practice, be now well known to the Board of Trade Surveyors.
 Tho registration of their names, and of the firms employing them, either
 by the local Marino Boards or by Lloyd's Committee, might be a desirable
 step to take as a preliminary measure.
     " The   arrangements    for swinging ships,   I have also heard, are either
 defective, or practically do not exist, at most of the mercantile ports    ; migbt
 not the Board      of Trade   Surveyors report upon the nature of         existing
 arrangements,     and the means generally adopted by tho ' adjusters      ?'
     " As to tho perieds for examining the adjustments,         the recommenda
 tions of the Liverpool Compass Committee (sec page 40, 3rd Report, 18G1)
 appear to me to fully meet the case, and have such an important bearing
 on the secure navigation      of iron ships, that I  gladly bring them again to
 notice.
     " ' There
                 appears sufficient  reason for requiring that a new iron     sailing
 ship or steamer should be       swung immediately before each of the first two
 or three     voyages  ;  that all iron vessels should be swung immediately
 before the first voyage following any considerable amount of repair, -when
  ever a change has been made in the position of the standard compass                ;
  when there is a change of Captain, unless the new Captain          had charge of
  tho vessel during the preceding voyage as Chief Officer.'
     " In conclusion   I   must observe that the present state and prospects of
  the science and practice of the correction of the compass make it impos
  sible to offer with confidence any complete set of suggestions as to the

  rated by careful and continued attention directed to the magnetic character
  of the ships of the Mercantile Marine, their compasses, and the capabilities
  of its officers  ; and  I think   it must be assumed that no system can        be ex
  pected to be satisfactory which does not gradually dcvelopo itself under
  proper supervision.

 Extracted from      the Queen's Regulations      and   the Admiralty Instructions  for

       " No iron of any kind    is to be placed nor suffered to remain within the
 distance of seven feet of the binnacle or standard compasses, when it is
 practicable, according to the size and construction of the vessel, to remove
 it  ;  and mixed metal or copper is to be substituted for iron in the bolts,
 keys, and dowels, in the scarphs of beams, coamings, and head-ledges, and
 also the hoops of the gaffs and booms and belaying-pins                  which   como
 within the distance of seven feet of the compasses.
      " The spindle and knees of the steering-wheels           which come within the
 distance of seven feet of the compasses         are  also to be of mixed metal.
      " Iron tillers, which work forward         from the rudder-head,      are not to
 range within seven feet of the compasses ; and in vessels which have iron
 tillers working abaft the rudder-head, the binnacles are to be placed as far
forward from the wheel as may be convenient for the helmsman to steer by.
      " The boats' iron davits are to be placed as far as may be practicable and
 convenient from the compasses.
     " All vertical iron stanchions, such as those for the support of the deck,
or for the awnings, &c., and likewise the arm-stands, arc to be kept beyond
the distanco of fourteen feet from the compasses in use, so far as the size of
the vessel will admit.
     " The binnacles for the steering-compasses are to be constructed upon a
given plan, with tops made to take off ; and in order to prevent improper
materials from being deposited therein, they are not to be fitted with
doors.
     " For the better preservation of the compasses, in every ship             a closet
is to     be constructed   in a  dry place, sufficiently large for the reception of
the ship's establishment of compasses, and it is to be appropriated to that
purpose exclusively, the key being kept by the Masters ; and in order that

tho sparo compass-cards may never bo kept with poles of the same name
nearest to each other, cases are supplied which will prevent the possibility
of their being packed improperly.
    " All ships are to be swung before sailing from the port whore they fit
out, and subsequently once in each year, for the purpose of ascertaining
the errors of the compasses, also immediately on their arrival on a Foreign
Station ; or if there has beon any great change in the ship's geographical
position since the errors were observed."

      Suggested Rules relating    to the Compasses   of Iron Merchant Ships.
    "1. It    is deemed a necessary equipment for every iron ship to be fitted
 with a Standard or navigating compass, in addition to one or more com
passes   for the use of the helmsman.
    " 2. That so far as the requirements         of the ship will permit, special
 arrangements be made in the course of construction for preparing a place
 for this compass.
    " 3. That the Steering-Compasses         being subordinate    in importance to
 tho Standard Compass, less strict precautions are required for their position ;
 but it would in all cases be desirable that these compasses (and of necessity
 tho steering-wheel) should not be placed within half the breadth of tho
ship from the stern-post, rudder-head, and screw-well.
    " 4. The Standard Compass to be placed at such a height from the deck
 (not less in any      case  than   five feet) as to command a clear view of
 the horizon     above the bulwarks, and to be out of the way of the sails,
 booms,   <fec.
    " 5.  In   ships built with their heads near the north, the Standard Com
 pass to bo placed as far forward as the requirements of the ship will
 permit.     In ships built with their heads near the south, this compass to
 bo placed as near the stern as convenient,        subject to the condition that it
 should not be within half the breadth of the ship from the rudder-head,
 stern-post,    or screw-well.
    " In  ships built near east and west, this compass should not be placed
 near cither extreme of tho ship.
    " 6. The Standard Compass to be as far as possible, and not less than
 ten feet, from the end of any elongated mass of iron, especially if vertical,
 such as iron stanchions, capstan-spindles,      steam- and stove-funnels, venti-
 lating-shafts, <fec. ; and no iron, subject to occasional removal, should be
 placed within fifteen feet of the Standard Compass, either on tho same
 dock or below it.
    " 7. The Standard
                           Compass to be placed as far as possible from trans
 verse iron bulkheads.
    -'8. It would be    an extremely desirable arrangement for the deck     imme

  1865.]              and on the Meteorological Department.                      529
  diately below the Standard Compass not to be of iron, but to be filled up
  with wood for a space which may be called the compass platform.                This
  space should not bo of less width than a hatchway (4 to 6 feet), and of as
  great length fore and aft as convenient, but the length not to be less than
  the width.     No transverse iron deckbeams to bo under the platform, but if
  necessary fore-and-aft iron stringers, on which the transverso beams out
  side the wooden surface may abut.
     " 9. It would   be a desirable arrangemont,      as far as could be carried out,
 that no   masses   of iron, such  as boilers, tanks, bulkheads,    should be placed
 immediately below the compass, or within 55° of the vertical line through
 the centre (the angle being drawn from the compass as centre to the centre
  of the mass).
     " 10. Where the Standard Compass is placed on a bridge, the foregoing
 requirements should be, as far as possible, complied with, the bridge should
 bo of wood, and should not have iron stanchions, or rails (especially if
 covered with brass) within 10 feet."
            The following   liuks are applicable    to Steering-Compasses.
     "1. Not to be within half the width of the ship from the stern-post,
 rudder-head, or screw-well.
     " 2. The spindle of the steering-wheel and the forward support in which
 it works, not to be of iron.
     " 3. Iron tillers working forward from tho rudder-head not to range
 within six to seven feet of the steering-compass.
     " 4. Not to be near the upper (or lower) end of elongated masses of
iron, especially if vertical, such as steam- and stove-funnels, capstan-
spindles, &c., and to be as far as possible from any transverse iron bulk
head."
           Special Points  for tJie consideration   of the Naval Architect.
    "  1. When arrangements are made for the compasses to be placed in the
after part of the ship, building the vessel head north would ensure exagge
rated errors both when upright and heeling.
    " With building-slips in a meridional direction, and with the above
arrangements, it would be desirable to build the ship head to the south.
    " 2. Every iron ship after launching, and during the process of first
equipment, should       as much as possible be      kept in a position   opposite to
that she occupied on the building-slip."

               Notes relating to the efficient points   of a Compass.
    " 1. The essential qualities of a good compass maybe considered to em
brace great sensibility and steadiness, with simplicity of construction.         By

 530                 Coirespondence     on Magnetism    of Ships,        [Nov. 30,
 sensibility and steadiness it is to be understood that the needle is freely to
 submit to the earth's magnetic force, with power sufficient to steadily obey
 that force under the varying motions of a ship, without the aid of friction
 or mechanical impediment, steadiness or rather sluggishness produced by
 the latter causes being obtained at the expense of accuracy.
    " Simplicity of    construction,   so that repairs can be effected by an ordi
 nary skilled mechanic, must be        deemed a qualification of merit.
    " 2. Tho chief points to be attended to in construction are, —
      "
         («) Great directive power of the needle, with little weight, and conse
            quently little friction on the point of suspension.
      "
         (6) Permanency of tho magnetic power of the needle.
       "
         (c) Accurate adjustment of the several parts of the compass.
             This comprises (1) the magnetic axis of the needle coinciding
             with the north and south points of the card. (2) The inter
            secting point of the axes of the jimbals of the bowl coinciding
             with the point of suspension of the card. (3) The accurate cen
             tering of the point of suspension within the bowl.       (4) The per
            fect impression of the card, so that the centering and marginal
            divisions are not distorted by shrinking or other causes.
   " 3. The advantages of a compound system of needles compared with a
single needle.
   " Theso arc, (1) greater directive power being obtained with the same
weight.     (2) The needles can be placed on their edge, whereby there can
be no alteration of their magnetic axes, a condition frequently found in
flat bar needles.       (3) By placing one (or two) pairs of equal parallel
                                                                    '
needles with their ends 00° (or 30°) apart, the ' wabbling motion com
mon to single bar needles is avoided ; and the following remarkable pro
perty also exists with this arrangement of the needles : —
   " 1When magnets or soft iron arc placed as correctors of the larger devia
tions due to the iron of the ship, unless the needle (where a single bar is
employed) be very short compared to the distance of the disturbing magnet
or iron, a deviation is introduced depending on the length of the needle.
This deviation disappears with the compound arrangement.
   " Proceeding     from general principles to details,     the following arc the
chief points to be attended to in the construction       of a Standard Compass.
   " 1. The bowl to be constructed of pure copper, of substantial thick
ness, and the part adjacent to the needle increased in solidity, by an extra
copper ring, the cuds of the needle being permitted to work as close to
tho ring as consistent with freedom of motion.
   " 2. The needles to be fitted on the compound system
                                                                    (one pair to be
deemed    sufficient),  and efficiently tempered and magnetized.
   "3. The sight- vane to be arranged so as to turn freely in azimuth
without moving tho compass-bowl or causing disturbance to the card.              It
should be attached to a graduated circle, so as to show the angle between
the ship's head and any celestial object as measured on tho horizon without

1865.]            and on the Meteorological Department.                        531
using the compass-card.       The sight-vane and graduated circle to he at
tached to the bowl.
    " 4. To he provided with   one spare card, two spare caps, aud      four spare
pivots.
    " 5. The caps to be fitted with rubies instead of agates. The pivots
to be of steel hardened and tempered to a dark straw-colour."

    " Sib, — have now laid before the Council of the Royal Society your
letter of the 25th of July, referring to the adjustment of the compasses
of iron ships, and a copy of my letter of the 28th of August, acknow
ledging its receipt and adverting to the inquiry you had made as to the
                   '        '
preparation of a Manual on the subject, together with your subsequent
letter of October 23rd, having reference to the same inquiry.
    " The President and Council are much disappointed by learning that the
Board of Trado are not prepared to give effect to the recommendation
that the system Avhich has been found to work so successfully in tho
Royal Navy, of combining official and competent superintendence with a
proper code of instruction, should be extended to the Mercantile Marine.
They consider such superintendence to be essential, not only to the general
introduction of a good and efficient mode of compass-correction into tho
Mercantile Marine, but even to the discharge of tho duties having respect
to the adjustment of the compasses of sea-going passenger-steamers with
which the Board of Trade is already charged by the Legislature.
    " In the Memorandum accompanying my letter of tho 15th of May, it
was stated that many recent losses of iron steamers have taken place in
which it is probable that compass-errors have occasioned the loss. The
President and Council think it right to call the attention of the Board of
Trade to the serious responsibility they incur in cases of loss of life and
property arising from the want of a proper system of compass-adjustment,
by declining to take the courso which is pointed out by the concurrent
opinion of all competent advisers, as not only the best, but the only method
of securing tho introduction of such a system. They cannot but look
forward to a time when tho necessity of a proper supervision will be forced
on the executive by public feeling, excited by some disastrous loss of human
life traceable to the want of such superintendence.           The question is one
which they feel to be of such vital importance, that they desire to submit
to the consideration of the Board of Trade the accompanying Memorandum,
replying in some detail to passages in your letter of July 25th, and which
makes it unnecessary to me to dwell further on the subject.

                                     Memorandum.
    " The letter of the Secretary of the Marine Department of the Board
 of Trade of the 25th of July, to the President, conveying the views of the
 Board of Trade on the President's letter of the 25th of May, and the
 Memorandum which accompanied                it,
                                       seem to require some detailed obser
 vations.
   " To     obviate the risk of misapprehensionof the scope and object of the
 Memorandum,         appears advisable to state that the main object which
                        it
 the  President and  Council had in view, was not to suggest that the objects
 desired might bo obtained by framing definite and positive rules and
enforcing their observance by penalties, but primarily to show the import
ance of some superintendence of the adjustment of the compasses, of at
least one important class of iron vessels, being entrusted to    department
                                                                      a
specially constituted   for  the purpose, and to point out some of the ad
vantages    which might    be  expected to flow directly and indirectly from
such   a department.   The appointment of an officer, with proper assistants,
 for the purpose indicated,     not,is    apprehended, beyond the existing
                                            it   is
 powers  of the Board  of  Trade, and  would not,     conceived, violate any
                                                        it   is
 sound principle of political economy.
    " The President and Council believo that, in considering the appoint
 ment of such an officer    matter of paramount importance, they are sup
                                a
 ported by the judgment of the persons most competent to form an
 independent opinion. They have in the former Memorandum referred to
 the opinion expressed by the Liverpool Compass Committee.        Since that
Memorandum was submitted to the Board of Trade, the Council have found
that   a similar opinion was expressed so long ago as the year 1839, by
the Astronomer Royal, who then addressed to the Admiralty         Memorial
                                                                      a
of formal character, of which one of the conclusions was,
  a                                                         —
    " That
    '         it expedient that the general superintendence of the compass
                   is
in iron ships, for several years at least, be entrusted to some person
appointed by the Government.'
  " The Admiralty     declined to appoint such an officer for the Mercantile
 Marine ;   but the very system recommended was introduced shortly after
wards into the Royal Navy, where experience has shown the very great
advantages to be derived from it, and that in        service in which, if
                                                             a
anywhere, obedience to positive rules without the intervention of  super  a
intendent might have been supposed attainable. The Astronomer Royal has
recently expressed his adherence to the opinion so expressed by him.
  " The President            and Council   in the former Memorandum   ventured   to
call attention to the duties in respect of tho adjustment of the compasses
of sea-going passenger-steamers, imposed by tho Legislature on the Board
of Trade, and to the imperfect mode in which those duties are at present
discharged.

1865.J               and on  the  Meteorological Department.                      533
   " The    Board of Trade in its answer recognizes the importance of tho
subject, and admits that ' the present practico is far from satisfactory,'
and that ' the steps taken by the Board of Trado under the provisions
of existing Acts are not such                                  '
                                    as to remedy the    evil ;   but states that the
Board see considerable difficulty      in adopting all tho suggestions made by
the Royal Society.
   " The difficulties   are stated to be, —
   " ' 1. That the     powers under which the Board acts apply only to pas
senger-steamers,      while tho want which tho Royal Society wish to meet
is felt just   as much   in tho  case of other iron vessels, which are becoming
more numerous every day.
   " ' 2. That the powers of tho Board of Trade only extend to obtaining a
Certificate that the compasses have been properly adjusted.              They do not
enable the Board of Trade or its officers to see that tho compasses are good,
or to require, what tho Royal Society appear to consider the most im
portant condition of all, that there should   be a Standard Compass       (in addition
to the Steering-Compass)       so placed as to be free from local attraction.'
    " With   regard to the first of these difficulties,  it cannot   be necessary to
suggest that the want of power as regards one class of vessels is no reason
for not exercising the powers and discharging the duties of the Board as to
another class of vessels.       There are, however, other considerations        which
tend to show that it is not necessary to wait for extended powers.             In tho
first place, on the establishment of a new department having new duties,
there are some advantages in those duties being confined to a limited
number of vessels.       Again, all the indirect, and these not tho least, advan
tages to be derived from such a department extend as much to vessels
which do not come within the direct operation of the department as to
those which do     ; and lastly, Shipowners and Underwriters, when the advan
tages of the department have been ascertained, may cause a voluntary sub
mission of many vessels to the supervision of tho Department.
   " It is thus quite possible that experience may show that it is not neces
sary to obtain any legislative extension of the class of vessels to which
 tho authority of the Board of Trade extends.             If, on tho other hand, it
shall hereafter appear desirablo to extend it, it is not to be anticipated
that the Legislature will refuse to give extended powers.
    "With regard to the second difficulty, it may be observed that the
Board of Trade appear to put an unnecessarily restricted interpretation on
the expression ' compasses properly adjusted' in the Morchant Shipping
Act, 1854,     Sec. 301.
   " It  is submitted with confidence that the expression in question enables
and requires the Board of Trade and its Officers to see that one compass
at least shall be in a position in which it is capable of being properly
adjusted — a condition not generally consistent with its being the Steer
ing-Compass     — and   therefore   to require a special Certificate     in the   case
of any Shipowner insisting on sending his ship to           sea  with only one   com

 pass, or in which the navigating-compass          does not fulfil the conditions
 prescribed.     The information which the Council possess induces them to
 think that, under the present system,        a large number   even of sea-going
 passenger-steamers      cannot be said to have their compasses ' properly
 adjusted — and that owing to the causes pointed out in the ' Memorandum.'
            '
 The President and Council do not apprehend that if the department recom
 mended were established, its action would be impeded for want of authority.
     "The President and Council therefore consider that even for the due
 discharge of the duties already imposed on the Board of Trade by the
 Legislature, some systematic superintendence on the part of the Board
is necessary.
    " With    regard to the offer of the Board of Trade to communicate          to
Lloyd's Eegister Committee any practical rules which the Royal Society
can furnish as to the supply, placing, and adjustment of compasses, and as to
the effect on them of different modes of construction of the hull of the ship,
the Board of Trade may be referred to the very valuable           paper by Staff-
Commander Evans, the Superintendent of the Compass Department of the
Royal Navy, in answer to an application of the Board of Trade to the
Admiralty,     as  containing    everything which the President and Council
could venture to suggest.        The whole of this paper is well worthy of the
most careful consideration ; but there are some passages in it which bear
so    directly on the present subject, that they may be more specifically
mentioned.      In one of these Captain Evans states that the rule of navi
gating a ship by a standard compass is in itself so simple, has proved
in practice so secure, and the neglect of it in many cases in merchant
ships has been followed by such disastrous consequences, that he considers
there is no question that it should bo enforced, wherever there are the
means of enforcement.         In another passage Captain Evans states that he
considers that no compass can be said to be ' properly adjusted,' of which,
whether corrected by magnets or not, a table of errors has not been
obtained by the process of swinging the ship, and that table examined
by a competent person.         In a third passage Captain Evans observes that
the present state and prospects of the science and practice of the cor
rection of the compass makes it impossible to offer with confidence any
complete set of suggestions as to the system to be adopted in the Mer
cantile Marine ; this could only bo elaborated by careful and continued
attention directed to the magnetic character of the ships of the Mer

that he thinks it must be assumed that no system can be expected to be
satisfactory which does not gradually devclopc itself under proper super
vision.     They trust that the communication of this important paper to
Lloyd's and its publication may be followed by beneficial results.
    '' The Board of Trade further
                                          say that, as regards the diffusion of
information     on the subject of compasses,        especially among Merchant

18G5.]              and on  the  Meteorological Department.                 535
Officers, the first desideratum appears to be a clear and intelligible manual,
or set of directions on the subject containing such practical rules as the
present state of Science can furnish, and such a statement of the prin
ciples as may be necessary for the comprehension of those rules ; and
inquiro whether the Royal Society can put them in the way of obtaining
such a manual, stating that any expense connected with its preparation
will be readily defrayed by the Board of Trade.
    " The President and Council do not consider the manual to bo the
first desideratum, but, on the contrary, they consider that, so long as
the present system continues, such a manual would have a very limited
and partial use.      It will   be remembered     that in the Memorandum     tho
Council itself suggested, as part of the general scheme proposed, that
notice might be given that after a certain period, say two or three years,
 a certain amount of knowledge will be required from Candidates, and
that in tho meantime a text-book containing the necessary amount of
information might be prepared and published ; and they conceive it would
be one of tho earliest duties of the proposed department to cause such
 a text-book to be prepared ; but the President and Council conceive that
it would be premature to prepare it until the system to be pursued has
 been decided on, and without the concurrence of the person to be charged
 with carrying it into effect.
    " As regards introducing the    subject of the deviation of the compass into
 Examinations in Navigation, tho President and Council will bo happy to
 give any information or assistance in their power.          They feel, however,
 as in the caso of the text-book they have referred to, that such examina
 tion should follow, not precede the appointment of a Superintendent, and
 should be under his direction.
    " As  regards inquiries into the causes of wrecks, the Council are happy
 to find that the Board of Trade are disposed to take some step in the direc
 tion indicated in the Memorandum.
    " In  the former Memorandum       attention was called to the importance, as
 regards the advancement of the science of the deviation of the compass,
 of observations of the deviations      of the same compass in the     same ship
 at different times and places being made and systematically reduced and
 discussed.     Trustworthy observations of this kind are now among tho
 principal desiderata in this science. As regards such observations, tho
 Board of Trade state that all they can do is to obtain observations from
 Masters of Merchant ships in the manner originally proposed by the
 Royal Society when the Meteorological Department of that office was
 established, and that the subject will come under tho consideration of
the Board, with tho whole subject of the Meteorological Department.
    " The proposal made by the Royal Society in the
                                                              year 1855, in con

Magnetism, not to the deviations of Iron Ships ; and they would
                                                                           observe,
as regards any observations of such deviations, that the
                                                                   whole scientific
value of such observations depends        on  their  being   made   in strict con
formity with corresponding observations made in the same vessel, and
under the same precise conditions at home.          No such conformity can be
expected or ensured unless with some system of supervision.                 It may
be further observed that the value of such observations depends on the
compass by which the observations are made being one fulfilling the
conditions recommended with reference to the navigating-compass.                For
the Meteorological Department to obtain and deal with such observations
it would be necessary that it should possess an Officer qualified to dis
charge,    and discharging,   many of the duties of such a Superintendent
as is recommended by the Council.            Finally it may be observed that
Shipmasters cannot be expected       to  make   or transmit such observations,
unless encouraged so to do, by knowing that the observations when made
 have a real value, and that they       will be appreciated, made      use  of, and
publicly acknowledged."

    " Sni, — I  have laid before the Council of the Royal Society your Letter
 of the 24th of October, in reference to the Meteorological Department,
 and am authorized to make the following reply : —
    " The President     and Council fully concur with the Board of Trade re
 garding    the importance of inquiries being made into the value of the
 observations obtained at sea under the direction and guidance of the Me
 teorological Department of the Board of Trade, and into the steps which
 should be taken to utilize the results, as well as the importance of the
 further question, whether any, and, if any, what future observations
 of the same or of a similar kind bearing on Ocean Statistics should be
 collected.     They will be quite ready to assist in this inquiry in the
 manner proposed, viz. by nominating one of their Fellows conversant with
 such subjects, as a member of the proposed Committee *.
     " In reference to the last paragraph of your letter of tho 24th~(Oetober,
 they are of opinion that systematic meteorological observations at a few
 selected land stations in the British Islands are desirable, in addition to
 the meteorological observations at sea, in order to complete a suitable
 contribution from this country to the meteorological investigations now
 in progress in the principal States of Europe and America, under the au
 thority of their respective Governments.
     " If, in the communication from the Royal Society to the Board of
  Trade of February 22, 1855, which preceded the establishment of Admira
      *
        [The Council nominated Mr. Francis^Galton, F.R.S., to serve on tho Commitleo
  referred to

 1865.]             and on the Meteorological Department.                      537
 FitzRoy's Office, the advantages to be derived from a continued and well-
 directed system of maritime observations were more particularly pressed,
 it was because at that time neither the instruments nor the modes of
 observation suitable for a well organized and efficient system of continuous
 land investigation were prepared.      This was well stated by Lieut. Maury
 in a letter addressed to the United States Government, dated November
 6, 1852, subsequently transmitted by that Government to the Earl of
 Clarendon, and printed in the papers which were presented to the House
 of Lords in February 1853.         This difficulty no longer exists, having
 been entirely obviated by the self-recording system of observation for which
 the necessary instruments have been devised and brought into use at
 the Kew Observatory.
    " The President and Council are not aware of any inconvenience          likely
 to arise from entrusting the scientific supervision of such a system as
 they have recommended to a Body such as the Kew Committee, acting under
 the authorization, and control in regard to expenditure, of a Public Depart
 ment.     Precedents for such a course are not wanting.

    " Sra, — I am directed by the Board of Trade to acknowledge the receipt
 of your letter of the 2nd instant, stating that the President and Council
                        '
of the Royal Society are much disappointed by learning that the Board of
 Trade are not prepared to givo effect to the recommendation that the
 system which has been found to work so successfully in the Royal Navy,
of combining official and competent superintendence with a proper code of
instructions, should be extended to the Mercantile Marine. They consider
 such superintendence to be essential, not only to the general introduction
of a good and efficient mode of compass-correction into the Mercantile
Marine, but even to the discharge of the duties having respect to the
 adjustment of the compasses of sea-going passenger-steamers, with which
the Board of Trade is already charged by the Legislature.'
    " The President and Council further proceed to call attention to tho
losses of Iron Steamers, and intimate that the responsibility for such
losses  will rest with this Board if they    do not   undertake   the superinten
dence of compasses in the mode suggested by the Royal Society.
                I
    " In reply am to state to you, in tho first place, that the Board of Trade
do not yield to the President and Council of the Royal Society in their
anxiety to prevent losses at sea, and they are ready with this object to
do everything which is within the proper and legitimate scope of their
functions as a Government department.
                                        ¦

 538                  Correspondence on Magnetism        of Ships,      [Nov. 30,
      " Whatthe scope of those functions is, and how they can be most usefully
 exercised, are questions on which they must form their own opinion, and
 they regret that the opinion they have thus formed is at variance with the
 views which the President and Council of the Royal Society have thought
 fit to urge.
    " As regards tho practice of the Admiralty to which you call atten
 tion, I am to point out in the first place, that there is a wide difference
 between the relation of the Board of Admiralty to Her Majesty's Navy,
 and that of the Board of Trade to the Mercantile Marine.    This difference
 appears to have been underrated, if not entirely overlooked by the Pre
 sident and Council of the Royal Society.
      " The Admiralty    are the owners, designers, and generally the builders
  of the Ships   of tho  Nation, and in these capacities are bound to use every
  means in their power to construct the National Ships in tho best manner,
  to provido them with the best equipments, and to dictate and enforce,
 upon all persons concerned in building, equipping or navigating them,
 such arrangements and regulations as the most advanced science and the
 latest experience can suggest.       On the other hand, the Board of Trade are
 not the owners, designers, or builders of Merchant Ships ; and if they
 were to take upon themselves the responsibility of regulating the con
 struction of every Merchant Ship, and of requiring her to be provided with
 what might appear to this Board to bo necessary and proper equipments,
 they would be usurping a power they do not possess, and which as a
 matter of policy they ought not to possess.        They would in so doing be
 taking upon themselves a function which belongs to the shipowner, and
 which it is his interest, as well as his duty, to perform efficiently. It can be
 no part of the functions of Government to put a stop to the free and healthy
 action of that self-interest, or to relieve the shipowner and his servants
 from his responsibility for the performance of that duty.
    " The result thus arising from Government interference would, the Board
of Trade are satisfied, be injurious to trade in the first instance, whilst
it would in the end be no less prejudicial to the safety of the public, and
to the advancement of science.
    " But     looking to certain precedents, the President and Council of the
             if,
Royal Society should still urge that in the special and exceptional case of
deviation of ship's compasses     it   the duty of the Government to depart
                                       is
from the principles generally admitted in this country, the Board of
Trade would reply that, so far as they can judge, the subject of compass-
deviation      one which in its present condition
              is                                    is peculiarly unfit for legis
lative or administrative interference.        Where  a    precautionary measure
is  capable  of  being  reduced to fixed, simple, and  intelligible rules of prac
tice,   itpossible, even though
             is                     may not be advisable, to enforce
                                       it                                      it
by legal and  administrative process.  But this subject          is,
                                                            so far as the
Board of Trade can judge, far from being in that condition.
     " It   appears from the papers submitted   to the Board     of Trade in this

1865.]               and on   the  Meteorological Department.                  539
case,  that the   causes   of deviation of the compass in each individual ship
are numerous and dissimilar,           and their effects proportionately    varied.
In addition to the variety of effects due to the variety of causes, these
effects seem also to vary according to the build of the ship, the nature
 and quality of the material of which she is built, and the direction of the
line of the keel during building, the nature, quantity, and stowage of tho
cargo, the ship's course for the time being, her position in the water for
the time being, the magnetic hemisphere in which she may bo, and the
varying distance of the ship from tho magnetic equator.                They vary,
too, it would seem, from time to time, according to the service on which
the ship may be or may have been employed, and with tho age of tho ship.
 Science has undoubtedly done much to ascertain the laws that govern these
numerous causes of error ; but it is obvious, even from the tentative and
 experimental process which the President and Council of the Royal Society
themselves suggest, and from the difficulty they find in preparing tho
 specific directions for which the Board of Trade have asked, that the remedy
is not capable of being reduced to fixed or simple rules, or of being enforced
without a large and experienced staff of scientific officers, or without an
 amount of minute arbitrary and indeterminate          supervision which would bo
intolerable   and impracticable.       Moreover, so far as the Board of Trade can
learn, tho highest      authorities   are not yet agreed as to the principle of
the remedy, the practice        of the Admiralty, which receives the approval
of the Royal Society, being founded in tho main on one principle, whilst
the practice of the Mercantile Marine is founded on another and different
principle, which is supported by no less an authority than the Astronomer
Royal.
    " In a letter from tho Admiralty to this Board, dated 14th September
last, are enclosed some memoranda by Commander Evans, R.N., of tho
Compass Department.           These memoranda       tho Royal Society indorse in
the printed memorandum enclosed          in their last letter. In them it is stated
that the principal features of the system followed in Her Majesty's Navy
are, ' 1. By having in each ship a standard compass distinct from tho
steering-compass        • • • by which compass alone the ship is navi
gated,'   and ' 2.   The requiring each ship to be swung and to be navigated
by   a Table  of  Errors.'
   " On the other hand, the Astronomer Royal, in his syllabus of a course
of lectures delivered this year to the Royal School of Naval Architecture
and Marine Engineering, states that he ' has no hesitation in giving his
own opinion that the compasses usod for directing the ship's course ought
to be corrected, and that the efforts of scientific men ought to be directed
mainly to the rendering this correction rigorously accurate and easy of
application.'
   " Tho Board of Trade have, as the President and Council of the Royal
Society are aware, already published and circulated Mr. Towson's work,
a work ' strongly recommendod to nautical men ' by the Astronomer Royal,
   VOl. XIT.                                                         2 S

Society are also aware, prepared to print and circulate amongst all persons
interested any practical hints or directions that the President and Council
of the Royal Society, the Admiralty, or the Astronomer Eoyal may be able
to furnish; and they are also prepared to procure the best scientific help
upon investigation into wrecks in any case in which it may appear that
a wreck may have been caused by compass-errors.
   " But the Board of Trade, for the reason above stated, are not pre
pared to assume the responsibility which would be involved in appointing
an officer or officers whose duty    it should be to superintend the compasses
of Merchant Ships, and to enforce upon shipowners and navigators com
pliance with what such officers may believe to be the latest requirements
of science.
   " In  coming to this conclusion, the Board of Trade believe that they
are doing what is most calculated to promote the free and healthy de
velopment of scientific results as applied to the Mercantile Marine, as well
as to furthor what are their own proper objects, viz. the benefit of trade
and the public safety.

III. " On the Existence                 of Glycogen in the Tissues of certain Entozoa."
           By Michael                 Foster,     M.B.          Communicated                        by    Professor
           Huxley.             Received November           4,   1865.
    Although glycogen has                 been    found by various             observers in the tissues
of many of the Invertebrata,                    no one, as far as         I    know, has noticed the
very remarkable amount which may be obtained from some of the Entozoa.
I first came across this fact while working upon     tape-worm    unfortu      a                         ;
nately    neglected to determine the quantity of glycogen
           I                                                obtained, and                 I
have not since had an opportunity of repeating the observation.  The fol
lowing remarks   apply only to the  round  worm   (Ascaris lumbricoidesl)
which dwells in the intestines of the common pig.

544                      Mr. Foster       on Glycogen in Entozoa.                     [Dec. 7,
    By mincing and boiling in water, with                a dropof dilute acetic acid, one
of these animals, a decoction is obtained                 which remains milky-looking
and opalescent after several filtrations, and therefore at once suggests the
idea of glycogen.    This milky fluid strikes a deep port-wine red with
iodine, the colour disappearing on the application of heat, and reappearing
on cooling, and gives no reduction when boiled with the alkaline copper-
solution.   When treated with saliva at 35° C. the opalescence disappears,
leaving a fluid either perfectly clear or exhibiting only a few flakes or a
slight cloudy deposit (of some albuminoid material), but containing much
sugar, as may be shown both by the copper and fermentation test.
    Ifthe original milky fluid be thrown into spirit, an abundant white
flaky precipitate is thrown down, consisting partly of some albuminoid
substance, but chiefly of a substance giving all the above reactions of
glycogen.        If   the fluid be thrown into glacial            acetic acid, a white flaky
precipitate is thrown down consisting of nearly pure glycogen.     The pre
sence  of  glycogen may also be shown by employing   the alcoholic  solution
of potash. From these facts we may infer that glycogen, and not dextrine
merely, does exist in the bodies of these animals.
                        I
   In no case have found this glycogen to be accompanied by anything more
than a mere doubtful trace of sugar — that is to say, a trace of some substance
giving    doubtful reduction of the copper-solution, and that by no means
          a
always.    Hence, seeing how difficult it is to obtain glycogen in so pure a
state that its quantity may be estimated directly by weighing,     have con     I
tented myself with determining the amount present in these animals by
exposing a decoction to the influence of saliva until all traces of glycogen
were lost, and then estimating by the copper process the amount of sugnr
produced.                         I
             In this way obtained from two ascarides weighing together,
when taken fresh from the pig and merely wiped, 10-2 grms., and from
three weighing together 10 grms., just 2-2 per cent, of sugar (on the wet
weight) in each case.   When this amount is compared with that produced
by the mammalian liver alone, it will be seen that it really     compara        is,
tively speaking, excessive.   For the sake of comparing the Ascaris with
other invertebrata,   may say that in
                        I                 caterpillar weighing about
                                                a                      grms.          6
I  obtained   hardly appreciable quantity
              a                            of glycogen,  which was contained
partly in the muscular parietes, and partly in the so-called "epiploon" or
" hepatic parenchyma." The quantity of glycogen that obtained from        I
a handful of common maggots was also hardly appreciable.
   In the Ascaris little or no glycogen     to be found in the intestine, a
                                                    is
small quantity in the generative apparatus, and   very considerable quantity
                                                             a
in the spongy visceral tissue by far the largest amount exists in the firmer
                                      ;
muscular parietes.          I   failed to detect with iodine any distinct histological
localization.
    It      singular that an animal, living
         seems                                  the midst of a fluid one of
                                                            in
whose chief functions   to change starch into sugar, should thus be found
                             is
amassing glycogen within its own body.      have satisfied myself, however.

  1865.]                 Mr. Foster    on Glycogen     in Entozoa.                   545
  that there is no sugar-forming ferment present in the tissues of the Ascaris.
  Portions of the tissues may he kept exposed to a temperature of 35° C. for
  many hours without any appreciable loss of glycogen or advent of sugar.
  The whole animal, too, may          be kept for days without any change of its
  glycogen being      observed.     I  also failed to extract from the tissues any
  ferment capable of acting upon starch.              The intestine alone seemed to
  have any power of the       kind, and that but in the very feeblest degree. This
  failure in the production of sugar is not due to the presence of any sub
  stance antagonistic to the action of a sugar-forming ferment ; for the addi
  tion of a small quantity of saliva to even the unboiled tissues very speedily
  brings about the conversion of the glycogen into sugar.                We may infer
  therefore that,   if the animal swallows the intestinal juices in which it lives,
  the sugar-forming ferment contained therein either does not pass through
 its intestinal wall into the visceral cavity, or, if it does pass, is at once de
  stroyed.    It is evident that the formation of glycogen in the Ascaris takes
 place under conditions very different from those under which glycogen is
 deposited in the mammalian liver, since in the latter case there is present
 a powerful    sugar-forming ferment belonging, as we have reason to believe,
 to the liver-substance itself, and not merely to the blood passing through
 the organ.
     The possible     use of this glycogen is      a matter   of interest.    Intestinal
 worms, inasmuch as they are animals and live, must needs consume oxygen.
 The amount of that        gas they find in the intestinal juices, however, is very
 small ; and, having a constant temperature secured to them by warmth
 external to themselves, they are the very last of creatures to need what
 has been called
                     " respiratory or calorifacient material." Whatever be the
 use
                                                                        "
       of sugar, starch, or glycogen in the mammalian body, no respiratory"
 use can be safely suggested for the large amount of glycogen occurring in
 the Ascaris.      Its abundance in the muscular parietes might suggest that
 it was material on its way to become muscle.              If so, since the animals I
 studied were adults and ova-producing, the analogy of their glycogen would
 be, not with the glycogen of the muscles of the early mammalian embryo,
 but with the-glycogen (or dextrine) occurring in smaller quantities in the
full-grown muscles (unless one were to push an idea, and say that the
tissues    of the lower animals were chemically homologous               with the   em
bryonic tissues of the higher ones) .
     It might be thought to be immature           chitin ; but why should it exist in
such quantities? and why is there so little in the caterpillar and the
maggot ? In the Taenia the glycogen could hardly he thought to have a
muscular future.         There it might be considered to be stored up for the
development of the ova. This idea is at first sight contradicted, as far as
the Ascaris is concerned, by the fact that very little glycogen can be ob
tained from the generative apparatus of that animal.                 But is it not pos
sible that, though stored up elsewhere, it may really be intended for the
ova and embryos         after all ?    The analogy between the Ascaris, with its

                                         (Abstract.)
    The chief object of this paper is to account in some degree for the suc
cessive appearance, in organic infusions, of what seem to be distinct
species of Protozoa rising in the developmental scale ; but the author com
mences with some general remarks on the origin of these animalcules, nnd
states, among other conclusions at which he has arrived, his disbelief in
spontaneous generation as it is understood by Pouchet and bis disciples.
    Proceeding to the immediate purpose of the paper, the author first refers
 to the well-known fact, that when an infusion of decaying organic matter
is exposed to the air, the types of Protozoa which first appear in it are
the so-called Monads, and occasionally the particles of organized protoplasm
known as Amoeba,          but that these in a few days in great part disappear, and
 are succeeded by       ciliated  infusoria, such as Kolpoda, Cyclidium, Glaucoma,
 and sometimes Vorticella — oftentimes followed in their turn by other
 types, as Oxytrichum, Euplotes, Kerona, &c.                This phenomenon, he re
marks, has been accounted for in different ways ; but his own observations
 and experiments justify, in his opinion, the conclusion that the monadine
 form which first appears is the earlier or larval stage of at least one, if
 not more of the ciliated infusoria, into which it becomes metamorphosed
 in the progress of development.             In the first place, he states that he and
 Dr. Balbiani have observed the regular occurrence of monads belonging
 to the species of Cercomonas fusiformis or acuminata of Dujardin, in pure
 distilled   water    which has      been   exposed some time to the atmosphere.
 These, or their zoospores, would seem to be wafted by the air along with
 particles of dust to which they cling.            They readily appear when dust is
 sifted   into   distilled    water,  and in this way have been obtained from
 different localities at home, and, along with other forms, in dust shaken
 from rags imported from various distant parts of the world. An experiment is
 then related, conducted by the author during the hot weather of last summer,
 in which    a comparison was made between the animalcules            which made their
  appearance in a vessel        of pure distilled water exposed to the air, and those
 successively appearing in distilled water to which extract of lettuce had
 been added.      In   both liquids Cercomonades speedily showed themselves; but
  whilst they remained unchanged in form in the pure water till near the
  end of the experiment (a period of about three weeks), they entirely dis
  appeared from the lettIce-infusion            in six or  seven   days, and were sue

ceeded by ciliated infusoria. The fusiform body of the Cercomonas bears
a long whip-like cilium at its anterior end, and a short hair-like caudal
process at the opposite extremity.     Now this characteristic figure was
retained by the monads in the distilled water; they continued to grow
larger during the progress of the observations, but without change of form ;
only, towards the end, some of them lost their caudal process, and fixed
themselves by their anterior cilium, and others, retaining both appendages,
became fixed by the caudal one as on a pedicle; finally, on exposure to undue
heat and light, they shrank up, and then sometimes their soft substance
was ejected from its enclosure and assumed the aspect and characters of an
Amoeba.    On the other hand, the Cercovionades of the lettuce-infusion
in                    appendages, and, changing their manner of swim
     a few days lost both
ming, began to move through the water like ordinary ciliated infusoria.
Moreover a few days later these animalcules, on being fed with indigo,
readily ingested        it,
                   whereas, although that substance was supplied freely
to the Cercomonades,   was never observed within their bodies.
                               it                               Figures
to illustrate these phenomena accompany the paper.
   From these observations, the author infers that the Cercomonades are
larvae    or earlier forms of the ciliated            which succeed them
                                                   animalcules                         ;
and he concludes his paper by remarking that, whilst he has confidence in
the general accuracy of his observations, and in the views deduced from
them, nevertheless, seeing the difficulties which attend such observations,
and their consequent liability to error, he should be pleased were the same
experiments repeated             by
                            others, in order to the confirmation or,   need      if
be, the correction of his statements.

   The principal object of this paper was to trace the relation between the
decrement of mean temperature and the increment of height above the
level of the sea in different regions of High Asia, to connect the va
riations observed from the general mean of the whole (390 feet increase of
height for diminution of 1° F. in mean temperature) with the variations

       John Hartnup,                 F.R.A.S., Director of the Liverpool                                        Ob

    The late Admiral Beechey, on looking over the records of the Liverpool
Observatory in 1854, was strongly impressed with the importance of some
systematic plan being adopted for testing the chronometers employed in
the Mercantile Marine.             He consulted many persons on the subject who
were interested in the security of navigation, but the difficulty which pre
sented itself at that time was the long period required for the test, five or
 six months at least being supposed to be necessary.
    About four years ago the Mersey Docks and Harbour Board gave me
permission to have constructed, for the purpose of testing chrouometers, a
hot-air apparatus on a more convenient principle, and on a much larger
scale, than the one which I had heretofore employed ; and the arrange
ments are now so perfect that chronometers can be tested efficiently in
five weeks.     It appears that chronometers in the Merchant service, when
at sea, are   generally exposed to temperatures ranging from about 55° to
85° of Fahrenheit, and that for most practical purposes it is sufficient for
the shipmaster to know the rate in the three definite temperatures 55°, 70°,
and 85°.     The following examples, taken from our records, will illustrate
the method     I  have devised to supply this information.                                The temperature
is changed 15° on Saturday                mornings.           No comparisons                 being made on
Sundays, the rate for Monday in each week is the mean                                     of two days.

  The preceding examples have not been selected to show the large errors
in a ship's longitude which might result from the use of very bad instru
ments, but rather that in what are considered good and carefully regulated
chronometers errors may, with adequate means for testing, be detected,
and tables             of corrections supplied to the mariner.
     Examples            1    and 2, Table            I.,
                                                 show how nearly       possible to com        it   is
pensate for change of                   temperature between 55° and 85°.  Some chrono
meters so compensated, when exposed to      temperature of 40°, change        a
their rates very much, while in others the alteration of rate compara                                               is
tively small.
   On ascertaining the chronometrical difference of longitude between the
Liverpool Observatory and the Observatory at Cambridge, Massachusetts,
the late Professor W. C. Bond at the commencement employed twelve
marine chronometers which had been used previously on several occasions
for obtaining differences of longitude.  During the voyages between Liver
pool and Boston, in the summer months, the sea and shore rates of these
chronometers were sensibly the same     but during the winter months they
                                                                ;
differed considerably.    On testing these instruments in 40° and 60°, the
following results were obtained —                       :

 Dent, and used by him for finding the longitudes of several observatories
 in this country.
    On testing 100 chronometers         in succession as they passed through the
 Observatory, the average alteration of daily rate caused by changing the
 temperature from 40° to 60° was 7S,0 ; and in ten per cent, of the hundred
 the average change was 30a-6.
    The chronometer- room at the new Observatory now being erected at
 Bidston by the Mersey Docks and Harbour Board will be provided with
 the means of testing simultaneously between two and three hundred chro
 nometers in the way shown by the examples in Table I.                 It is not neces
 sary  to test chronometers     in this  elaborate way   on every  occasion   that they
 arrive in port, as the corrections        for change of temperature        remain   the
 same for a long period.      The rate may change, as in example         2,  Table  IV.,
 while the thermal correction remains sensibly the          same.
    1When   the Greenwich     mean time is communicated          from an authorized
 establishment,    as is now generally the case     in our large sea-ports, the rates
 of chronometers in the temperature that prevails at the time can be easily
 ascertained.    At present these rates are used on the assumption that the
 thermal adjustments are perfect.          The corrections for change of tempera
ture in Table II. show the improvement which might be effected by testing
all chronometers when new, and supplying mariners with Tables of such
corrections as may be found to exist.             These corrections would require
verifying periodically, as in cleaning and repairing timekeepers the thermal
adjustment is sometimes altered.

I. " On    the Expansion     of Water and Mercury."           By A. Matthiessen,
                     F.R.S.      Received December 7, 1865.
                                      (Abstract.)
    Before commencing a research into the expansion of the metals and their
alloys, it was necessary to prove that the method             I intended to employ,
namely    that  of  weighing   the  metal   or alloy in water at different tempera
tures, would yield good and reliable results.
   To check, therefore, the method, I was led to determine the coefficient
of expansion of mercury, and, basing my calculations on Kopp's coefficients
of expansion of water, I expected to obtain Regnault's coefficient of expansion
of mercury. The coefficient deduced from experiments did not agree with
Regnault's ; and being unable to discover any source of error in the method
of experimenting, I determined to reinvestigate the matter.
   The memoir is divided into four parts.

      I. On the determination of the coefficients of the linear expansion of cer
   tain glass rods.
      These rods (1825 millims. long and of 20 millims. diameter) were kindly
  made for these experiments by Mr. F. Osier.            The method used for the
  determination   of their increment in length was that of measuring it with      a
  micrometer-screw,    with which    a length  could be measured with accuracy
  to 0 001 millim.
      The rod was placed in     a long   trough, the one end of the rod resting
  against a fixed glass tube capped with zinc, the other against another glass
  tube the other end of which rested against the micrometer-screw.          Water
  was allowed to flow through these glass tubes during the time of observa
  tion.    The trough being filled with water at ordinary temperature and the
  position of the screw read off, the water was heated to boiling and another
 reading taken.
      The mean of sixteen observations gave for the linear expansion      of these

     II.  On the method employed for the determination of the cubical expan
 sion of water and mercury.
     This part of the paper contains a full description of the apparatus em
 ployed, and the precautions taken.
     The method consists of weighing the substances in water at different
 temperatures, and from the loss of weight in water deducing its volume.
 For this deduction, the expansion of water at different temperatures is
 required.
     III.  On the redeterminations    of the coefficients of expansion of water.
     To determine these, pieces of the glass rods (the linear expansion of which
 had to be determined), ground to the shape of a double wedge, were weighed
in water of different temperatures.      Three pieces of glass were used (making
three Series), the weighings being made at temperatures between 0° and 1 00°,
the whole number      of observations being thirty-two.
     From these it was found that the expansion of water between 4° and 100°
          -
may conveniently be expressed between         4° and 32° by the formula
V,= 1       0-0000025300    (f-4) + 0-0000083890       (t— 4)a- 0000000071 73    (f- 4
and between 32° and 100° by
V(=0-999695 + 0-0000054724^-0-00000001 1260<".
     The values calculated from these formulae for the volume occupied by
water at different temperatures are given in Table I. from degree to degree
together with the differences for each degree.

   IV. On     the redetermination of the coefficient of expansion of mercury.
   The pure mercury was weighed in a bucket in the water at different
temperatures.        The glass bucket was made from the end of a test-tube (its
length being about 20 millims. and width 15 millims.).                   The expansion of
this sort of glass was found to         be
                                V-=VoU+0           00002566<).
   Five  series were made         with mercury ; and its expansions, deduced from
the water-expansions given in Table I, were

    Kopp, Despretz, and Pierre used the same method for their determi
 nations — that of determining the expansion of water in glass vessels (dilato-
 meters). Hagen employed the weighing process, but at high temperatures
 employed no special precautions to prevent the steam condensing on his fine
 wire ; hence his values at 90° and 100° fall below mine.
    It  will be   seen   from the foregoing Table that Kopp's values are lower
 than the others     ; and bearing in mind that the coefficient of expansion of
 mercury,    when deduced by means of these, falls below that obtained by
 Regnault, but when deduced from Despretz's or my own agrees closely
 with Regnault's, we are led to conclude that Kopp's values must be some
 what incorrect.

     The crystals        are remarkable      for the very unequal extension of the faces
  of the same simple form,            and   at first sight look as if they belonged to the
 oblique system.             The breadth and thickness of one of the largest cry stab
 were 1*1 and 0 055 millimetre respectively; and of two adjacent faces of
 the form       101, one        was about eleven     times the breadth of the other. The
 distribution of the large and small faces did not appear to be subject to any
 law ; so that these crystals cannot be regarded as combinations of large and
 small hemihedral            forms.

    An attempt was made to determine the optical constants of the crystal
by observing the minimum deviation of light refracted through a face of
the form 110 and one of the opposite faces of the form 10 0; the latter
were, however, so small that the observation could not be made with much
accuracy.          It appeared that for the ordinary ray polarized in a plane
parallel    to the line 0 0         1,  the indices     of refraction   of red light, of the
brightest part of the spectrum, and of violet light were about                  2* 1 1 5, 2- 1 59,
and 2*314         respectively, and that, for the extraordinary ray polarized in
the plane 0 0 1, the indices of refraction of red light, the brightest part of
the spectrum, and of violet light were about 1*890, 1*973, and 2*143 re
spectively.

   The   faces which have been observed are all in one zone, and exhibit a
symmetry which is compatible with either the prismatic or the oblique
system.     The crystals probably belong to the prismatic system. They are
aggregated in such a manner as to render it very difficult to isolate a single
crystal, or to determine the faces which belong to the different individuals of
a group of crystals.

   Twins. Twin      face   110.     One individual is generally united to     each of
two others, in this respect resembling the twins of            cerussite,  aragonite,
glaserite, and chrysoberyl.
   A cleavage has been observed probably parallel to the faces of the form
1 10; it may, however, be parallel to the faces of the form 1 0 0, the com
plexity of the twin crystals being such that it could not be ascertained
whether the cleavages observed belonged to one crystal or to two different
crystals.
   I am indebted to     Mr. Crookes, the discoverer of thallium, for the crystals
of nitrate,  sulphocyanide, and carbonate of thallium, above described.

          OBITUARY NOTICES OF FELLOWS DECEASED
                Between 30th Nov. 1863 and 30th Nov. 1864.
     Capt.  William Allen          entered the Navy in 1805.        At the passage of
 the Dardanelles,        by Sir John Duckworth, he served on board 'The
               '
 Standard ;        and afterwards took part in the expedition against Java.           He
 was engaged in the Niger exploration under Capt. Trotter in 1841, and in
 1848 published an account of the Voyage, in two volumes.                 In 1855 he
 brought    out    another work   on the   "  Dead Sea,  and the  Overland Communi
 cation with the East," in which he recommended the cutting of a canal from
 the Mediterranean to the Dead Sea. He was au active member of the Royal
 Geographical Society, and was elected into the Royal Society in 1844. He
 died in January, aged seventy-one.
     In the Rev. Dr.    William Cureton,          Canon of Westminster,    ancient lite
rature has lost one     of the ablest of Syriac scholars. His 'Corpus Ignatianum,'
 an edition of an    ancient Syriac version of the Epistles of St. Ignatius, with
 commentaries, published in 1845, established his reputation as an Orien
 talist, and became the occasion of a spirited controversy which was carried
on for some years among students of ancient texts.               This was followed by
an edition of a palimpsest       of portions of Homer, discovered in      a convent in
the Levant, and in 1855                '
                                  by     Spicilegium Syriacum,' in both of which
Dr. Cureton exhibited profound and accurate scholarship.                 He was con
tinuing    his   researches  into  old   Syriac versions  of St. Matthew's   Gospel at
the time of his decease ; and, considering how valuable were the services he
rendered to that department of literature, the accident by which those
services were interrupted is the more to be deplored.
    Dr. Cureton was born in 1808. About two years before his death,
which took place at Westhury, Shropshire, on June 17, 1864, he sustained
so severe a shock from an accident to a railway-train in which he was tra
velling, that his health remained permanently impaired.              He was educated
at Christ Church, Oxford, and was ordained a priest in 1834 ; in 1847 he
was appointed Chaplain in Ordinary to the Queen, and in 1849 was pre
ferred to a canonry of Westminster, and therewith to the rectorship of
St. Margaret's. Besides these ecclesiastical employments, he held for a
short time the place of Sublibrarian to the Bodleian Library ; in 1837 he
became Assistant-keeper         of the MSS. in the British Museum, and was
afterwards appointed one of the Trustees of the Museum on the part of
the Crown.          He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1838.
    Joseph Henry Green was born in London, on the                   1st of November,
1791, and died at Hadley, Middlesex, on the 13th of December, 1863.
    Mr. Green's father was a merchant of high standing in the City of Lon
don, and his mother was a sister of Mr. Cline, the eminent surgeon.                His
school education       was begun in this country, but completed in Germany,
where, accompanied by his mother, he spent three years, chiefly in Hanover.
   vol. xiv.                                                               b

                                             ii
At the    age of eighteen he was apprenticed to his uncle, Mr. Cline, and en
tered on the study of medicine at St. Thomas's Hospital, of which Mr.
Cline was surgeon.         In   1813 he married       Miss Amie Eliza Hammond.
This lady, who survives him, was the daughter of Mr. Hammond, surgeon
at Southgate, and sister of an early friend and fellow student.
     In 1815 Mr. Green became a member of the College of Surgeons, and
was soon afterwards appointed Demonstrator of Anatomy at St. Thomas's
                                                         '
 Hospital. While in this office he published a Dissector's Manual,' which
bore advantageous comparison with the books of the same kind then in use.
 In the meantime Mr. Cline had retired from St. Thomas's, and was sue-
 ceeded by his son Mr. Henry Cline, on whose early death, in 1820, Mr.
 Green was appointed Surgeon to that Hospital, and Lecturer on Surgery in
 the Medical School, in conjunction with Sir Astley Cooper, who withdrew
 from the joint office in 1825.
     The advantageous position in which Mr. Green was now placed, and his
 own merit, speedily gained for him the confidence of his profession aud the
 public.     In   1824   he was appointed Professor of Anatomy to the Royal
 College of Surgeons ; in 1825 he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society
  (in later years he served on the Council). Also in 1 825 he received the
 appointment of Professor of Anatomy to the Royal Academy, and in the
 latter part of that year delivered the first of a long succession of annual
 courses on Anatomy in its relation to the Fine Arts.             Ere now, too, he had
 acquired a considerable and increasing share in the private practice            of his
profession.
     Respecting the Lectures at the College of Surgeons, which formed one
 comprehensive course distributed over four years, Professor Owen, who
 heard them delivered, thus writes to Mr. Simon* : — " For the first time in
 England the comparative anatomy of the whole animal kingdom was de
 scribed, and illustrated by such a series of enlarged and coloured diagranCt
 as had never before been seen.         The vast array of facts was linked by refer
 ence to the underlying Unity, as it had been advocated by Oken and Carus.
 The Comparative Anatomy of the latter was the text-book                of the Course.
           Green illustrated, in his grand course, Carus rather than Hunter ;
the dawning philosophy of Anatomy in Germany, rather than the teleology
 which Abernethy and Carlisle had previously given as Hunterian, not
knowing their master."
     Of Mr.   Green's lectures at the Royal Academy (where he retained hit
professorship till 1852), Mr. Simon, who attended several of the courses,
                                "
 thus expresses himself: — His teaching at the Royal Academy, like all his
teaching, was characterized by a very deep-going and comprehensive treat
 ment of his subject.       He recognized, of course, that the details of auntomv
    * The facts, and in some places the language, of this notice have been taken from a
biographical memoir prefixed to Mr. Green's posthumous work (to be afterwards referred
to) by its editor, John Simon, Esq., F.R.S., Mr. Green's friend and pupil.  The passage*
in inverted commas are taken from that source.

                                      iii
(even of mere artistic surface-anatomy) could not be adequately spoken of,
much less conveyed, in the six formal lectures which he had annually to
deliver           Not indeed that he omitted to survey, or surveyed other
wise than admirably, the composition and mechanism of the human body ;
and perhaps no mere anatomist ever taught more effectively than he what
are the bodily materials and arrangement which represent the aptitude for
strength,equipoise, and grace, or what respective shares are contributed
by bone, muscle, and tegument to the various visible phenomena of form
and gesture, attitude and action. But to this he did not confine himself.
Specially in the one or two introductory or closing lectures of each course,
but at times also by digression in other lectures, he set before his hearers
that which to them, as artists, was" matter of at least equal concern — the
science of interpreting human expression and appreciating human beauty.
His discourses   on these subjects were very deeply considered.    Necessarily
they were of wide philosophical    range.   And they were enriched with num
berless illustrative references to the history of Art, and to the master-works
of ancient and modern sculpture and painting."
   On the establishment of King's College in 1830, Mr. Green was nomi
nated Professor of Surgery, and continued to hold the Professorship till
1836, when he resigned it (on retiring to live in the country), and was
elected a Member of the Governing Council of the institution.            Of his
surgical lectures it is stated on the best authority that the technical instruc
tion imparted, perfect as it was, was by no means their sole excellence ;
they had also a moral aim, and were admirably fitted to exert a favourable
influence on the habits of thought and future professional character of his
young hearers.
   In 1 835 Mr. Green was elected on the Council of the College of Surgeons,
and in 184G appointed to the Court of Examiners.      In 1840 and 1847 he
delivered the Hunterian Oration ; in 1849-50 and again in 1858-59 he was
President; in 1853 he exchanged his post of Surgeon to St. Thomas's for
the honorary appointment (then first made) of Consulting Surgeon to that
institution; and on the creation, by the Medical Act of 1858, of the
General   Council of Medical Education and Registration, he was chosen by
the College of Surgeons to be its representative in the new body.    Two
years later, when the post of President of the Medical Council became
vacant by the retirement of Sir Benjamin Brodie, the Council unanimously
elected Mr. Green to the office ; and he continued in    with the warmest
                                                          it,
Tegard and confidence   of its members,  for the remaining three years of
his life.
   Mr. Green thus attained to the foremost rank in his profession, and came
to occupy with universal assent its highest public offices but the contem

quate notion of his intrinsic mental tendencies and  pursuits, and the scope
of his intellectual activity. From his early years he had bent towards the
                                                            a
study of abstract philosophy in its largest and highest   sense   ;   and to gratify
                                                                      b2

                                         iv
this inclination he, in the summer of 1817, found time to spend a few
months in Berlin to go through a private course of reading on philosophy
with Professor Solger, on whom, as well as on Ludwig Tieek whom he
had met in London, his amiable disposition and "noble eagerness for
knowledge"       made a most favourable      impression.    Probably about this
time also he became acquainted       with Coleridge, and contracted an admi
ration of his philosophy ; soon afterwards,          at any rate, a close inti
macy grew up        between  them,  which   continued  during the rest of Cole
ridge's life.
                 " Invariably he spent with Coleridge — they two alone at
their work — many hours of every week, in talk of pupil and master.         And
bo year after year,1 he sat at the feet     of his Gamaliel,  getting more and
more insight     of the teacher's beliefs and aspirations, till, in 1834, two
events occurred which determined        the remaining course of his life.    On
the one    hand, his father died, and he became possessed of amply sufficient
means for his profession to be no longer needful to his maintenance.         On
the other hand, Coleridge himself died.         And the language of Coleridge's
last will and testament, together no doubt with verbal communications
which had passed, imposed on Mr. Green what he accepted as an obliga
tion    to devote, so far as necessary, the whole remaining strength and
earnestness of his life to the one task of systematizing, developing, and
establishing the doctrines of the Coleridgian philosophy."
    Influenced by these circumstances he withdrew from private practice and
resigned his professorship at King's College.         Then, too, he gave up his
London house and retired to reside at Hadley ; and although he did not
relinquish his interest in the practical aspects of his profession or his care
for the amendment of its institutions, continuing still to take an active
share in the government of the College of Surgeons, and finally presiding
in the Medical Council, yet all such occupations and objects then became
secondary in his mind to the one object of his philosophical studies and the
fulfilment of the task he had undertaken.
    With this purpose Mr. Green entered upon the widest possible range of
study ; for he deemed it necessary to test the applicability of the Colerid
gian system to all branches of methodized human knowledge.          Accordingly,
in the twenty-seven years of life that remained to him, " Theology, Ethics,
Politics and Political History, Ethnology, Language, ^Esthetics, Psycho
 logy, Physics and the Allied Sciences, Biology, Logic, Mathematics, Pa
 thology — all were thoughtfully studied by him in at least their basial
principles and metaphysics, and most were elaborately written of as though
for the divisions of   some vast encyclopaedic   work."
     Mr. Green took advantage of the public discourses which on more than
 one occasion he was called on to deliver, to make known his opinions on
 the relation of the Coleridgian philosophy to the study of science and the
 learned professions.     Of these there have appeared in print his Address on
 the opening of the Medical Session at King's College in 1832, the Hun-
  terian Oration for 1840, entitled    "Vital Dynamics,"     and that for 1847,

                                         V
 with the    title  "Mental Dynamics."       But as years advanced, certain
 threatening bodily   ailments  warned   him that it was time to utilize in a
 systematic and communicable form, at least a part of the fruits of his
vast preparatory labour ; and he accordingly determined to complete a work,
 which should give in system the doctrines, especially the theological aud
 ethical doctrines, which he deemed most distinctively Coleridgian ; and to
 this he devoted what in effect proved to be the whole available remainder
 of his life. The result is a work in two volumes published under the
editorship of Mr. Simon.        The first volume is devoted to the general
principles of philosophy, while the second is entirely theological, and espe
cially aims at vindicating H priori (on principles for which the first volume
has contended), the essential doctrines of Christianity.
    The mental qualities and character of Mr. Green will be found ably de
lineated in Mr. Simon's memoir; suffice it here to say that his life, both
private and public, was a life   of benevolence, probity, truth, and honour.
    Mr. Hudson Gurney, who died at the advanced age of ninety-five, was
one of the well-known Norfolk family of that name, members of the Society
of Friends, and through his wife was connected with the Barclays of Ury.
He was for many years a leading Member of the House of Commons, dis
tinguished by the favour he showed to men of letters, and the literary and
art collections which he formed.        In 1811 he published a poem, 'Cupid
and Psyche,' based on the Golden Ass of Apuleius.           He was elected a
Fellow of the Royal Society in 1818.
     Leonard Horner,       the third and youngest son of Mr. John Horner,
linen-merchant in Edinburgh, was born on the 17th of January, 1785. It
was but natural that with an early enthusiasm for science he should have
become a geologist ; for in Edinburgh at that time Button, Hall, Playfair,
and a band of zealous followers, by observation in the field and by experi
ment in the workshop, were gathering materials for a new philosophy of
geology, and were waging a keen warfare with the partizans of Werner.
The year of       Mr. Horner's birth was that in which Button's famous
excursion to the granite of Glen    Tilt was made. He was three years old
when that philosopher unfolded       his new theory to the Royal Society of
Edinburgh, and he had grown up to be a High School boy of ten years of
age when the immortal      'Theory of the Earth' was published.       Al that
time, indeed, according to his own confession, he was a thoughtless youth
with no special liking for study, and a vague passion for the sea. But these
scientific discussions had not come to a close when he grew up to be able to
understand and take an interest in them, and their influence is to be traced
throughout his life.     He entered the University of Edinburgh in 1 799, and
 lttended the lectures of Playfair on Mathematics.     In 1802 he was study-
  ng moral   philosophy under Dugald Stewart, and chemistry with Hope ;
  -ml it was when fairly launched into these studies that his mind took that

bent towards natural science by which it was marked during the rest of his
life. " From that time," he writes, " began a new state of mind.     took  I
an interest in the subject, bought apparatus, made experiments, and de
stroyed  many of my mother's towels.        I took a particular interest in
mineralogy, began  to make  a collection of  specimens, cultivated acquaint-
ence with some fellow students who had the same turn, and read Playfair's
'
  Illustrations of the Huttonian Theory,' of which I became a worshipper,
having heard it well expounded by Dr. Hope." He was too young to have
personal intercourse with Hut ton, though he tells how he used to hear
much in his own family of the
                                      " ingenuity, acuteness, and even light-
hearted playfulness" of that philosopher.       But he became attached to the
Professor of Mathematics, to whom sixty years afterwards he referred from
the chair of the Geological Society as his " venerable friend the able and
eloquent Play fair."
    At the age of nineteen Mr. Horner left Edinburgh to become partner in
a branch of his father's business, which it was proposed to carry on in
London. His elder brother Francis was already rising to eminence in the
House of Commons ; so that Mr. Horner soon found himself in the midst of
a large circle of friends, among whom were not a few of note in science and
literature.    Two years afterwards he married Miss Lloyd, daughter of a
landed proprietor in Yorkshire, and took a house in London.          His love for
geology, however, was not quenched by the claims of business, for we find
him, the year after his marriage, joining the newly-founded Geological
Society.     Nor did he become an inactive member. In 1810, the second
year after his election, he was chosen one of the Secretaries of the Society,
and from that time down almost to the very day of his death, he continued
one of its most zealous and unwearying members.
     In 1815 he found himself under the necessity of returning to Edinburgh
 to take a personal superintendence of his business there. Two years after
 wards his brother Francis, with whom he had journeyed to Italy in a vain
 search for health, died full of promise.    When Mr. Horner had recovered
 from the blow of this sad loss, his active mind sought new scope for itself
 in the organization of political meetings, wherein the young Whiggism was
 developed, for which Edinburgh afterwards came to be so noted.           In this,
 as in many other features of his life, Mr. Horner showed the practical and
 methodical character of his mind, as well as his social disposition ; for these
 meetings were not arranged without exciting much keen opposition and
 political feeling.  His residence in Edinburgh was marked by the success of
 anotherproject   — one of themost widely useful of all his schemes for the benefit
 of his fellow-men.     In March 1821, happening to observe some watch
makers at work,  he was led to inquire whether they ever received any
mathematical education. On being told that they did not, and that, though
anxious to obtain such instruction, they could not afford to pay for    the it,
idea occurred to him to found       school for the training of mechanics in
                                    a
 those branches of science which would aid them in their daily work. Hence

                                          vii
arose the Edinburgh School of Arts.           Mr. Horner laboured hard for the
success of this scheme, and he lived to see it completely successful.          He
acted as Secretary of the School for the first six years ; and during all the
rest of his life, even though no longer resident in Edinburgh, he continued
to take an active interest in the institution and in its prominent students.
He several times gave donations of books to the library, and in 1858 in
vested a sum    of money for an annual prize of three guineas.        The useful
ness  of this school has    been great.     About  seven hundred  young men are
entered annually as students in mathematics, chemistry,         or natural philo
sophy, and receive at small cost instruction which would otherwise         lie be
yond their reach.       Several of the foremost engineers of the present day
have been students there. It was in remembrance of this and similar kinds
of philanthropic activity, that Lord Cockburn styled Mr. Horner " one of
the most useful citizens Edinburgh ever possessed."
    Mr. Horner left Edinburgh in the year 1827 to assume the office              of
Warden in the University of London, a post at which he laboured for four
years, until his failing health led him to seek a retreat with his family on
the banks of the Rhine.        At Bonn he had leisure to renew his old love for
mineralogical and physical geology ; and in making himself acquainted with
the geological structure of the district, he at the same time formed a life
long friendship with some of the most eminent men of science and learning
there.    On his return to England in 1833 he was appointed one of a
 Commission to inquire into the employment of children in the factories of
 Great Britain. The Report of this Commission gave rise to the Factory Act,
under which Mr. Horner was made one of the Inspectors of Factories, an
office which, through good and ill report, he laboriously and conscien
 tiously filled for nearly thirty years.        His zeal for the interests of the
women and children in the factories often placed him in conditions of great
delicacy, yet, notwithstanding opposition and disparagement, he continued
his exertions, and earned the gratitude of the workers, while he was at the
same time rewarded by finding an ever-increasing number of millowners
who acknowledged the benefits of the Act which it was his duty to enforce.
    During these busy years, however, he never lost or relinquished his
 interest in the progress of science, and more especially of Geology. No face
 was more constantly seen at the Meetings of the Royal and Geological
 Societies than that of Mr. Horner.         He had become a Fellow of the Royal
 Society in 1813, and in various years served on the Council.          In 1845 he
 took an active part in the reform of the Society, whereby the mode of
 Election of new Members was modified.            In the year 1857 he was nomi
 nated Vice-President.        In the Geological Society he took a still more
 prominent part.        Besides reading papers at its Meetings, he became
 in 1846 its President, an office which he again filled in 1860.           He was
 unremitting    in  his  attention  to  all  that might  in any way    further  the
 interests or usefulness of the Society.        He worked with his own hands in
  the Museum, arranging and cataloguing its stores of specimens ; and he

                                         viii
 carried on this task at intervals up to within a short period of his death,
 labouring often to the verge of his physical strength. To his suggestion is
 due the publication of the Quarterly Journal of Papers read at the Society's
 Meetings,   one of the most important undertakings of this Society.
    When Mr. Horner at last resigned the office of Inspector of Factories,
 although now seventy-five years of age, he still remained so full of youthful
 energy, that he looked forward hopefully to spend yet a few years in more
undivided attention to his favourite science. Unable longer for the toils of
out-of-door geology, he resumed with fresh zeal the arrangement of the
 Geological Society's Museum, anxious that its stores of rock-specimens
 should be classified in such a form as in the end to afford a comparative
series of the different rocks throughout the globe.        The failing health    of
his wife interrupted this task, and induced him to spend the winter              of
 1861-62 at Florence.     There,   as at Bonn, he found a ready welcome into
the cultivated and learned society of that city. While there, he occupied
himself with translating from the Italian Villari's ' Life of Savonarola,' and
published it in England a few months afterwards.          Mrs. Horner's health,
however, which had continued     a source of anxiety to him, at last gave way, and
she died as the family  was on the  point of returning to England. When M r
Horner came back to London, his friends saw with concern that this great
sorrow had told only too plainly upon his health.         His strength began to
fail, but his energy seemed as fresh as ever.       He returned to his labours
among the collections of the Geological Society, and day after day he was
found poring over dusty specimens, describing and cataloguing them with
the same perseverance and even enthusiasm which he had shown from the
beginning.     A few months after his return from Italy, viz. during the
summer of 1862, he paid his last visit to his native city.         Never was his
welcome warmer.       He came at the time when the schools were passing
through their public examination previous to dismissal for the autumn
holydays — the High School where he himself had been educated, and the
Academy which, with Lord Cockburn, he had founded.              He attended the
examinations, addressed the boys, presented some of the prizes, and showed
at the end of his long life the same deep interest in education and in the
pursuits of youth. His old Edinburgh friends, too —now a yearly de
creasing number   —vied with    each other in their attention to the venerable
philanthropist.
    Returning from Scotland to London, he fixed upon the 1 5th of March,
1864, as the day when he should leave England to revisit the grave of
his wife at Florence.     But before that day came round a told seized
him,   followed  by extreme weakness, and he died calmly on the 5th             of
March.
    Physical geology was the branch of science to which Mr. Horner more
specially devoted himself.     The influence of his early acquaintance with
Playfair and the Huttonian geologists at Edinburgh is visible throughout
his scientific course.   He began the study imbued with the prevailing

                                        ix
ideas  regarding the importance of mineralogical geology ; and his first
papers — that on the Malvern Hills, and that on Somersetshire — may he
taken as characteristic   specimens of the mineralogical system of treatment
hy which the geology of the early part of this century was marked.            But
though from the     state of the  science at that time  (1811-1815) it was not
to be expected that he should succeed in unravelling the complicated geo
logical relations of the different rocks, it is yet interesting to mark how he
carried with him the spirit of careful observation in which Playfair had
trained him, and how readily he saw among the hills of England proofs of
the truth of the Huttonian system.         During his active life he had few
opportunities of doing much in field-geology.          When he found a little
leisure in his retreat at Bonn, he at once reverted to his favourite science,
and the results of his sojourn were given to the Geological Society in a
paper on the Geology of the Environs of that town.              During the same
interval  of rest he was led, in the true spirit of the Huttonian school, to
institute a series of experiments on the quantity of solid matter suspended
in the water of the Rhine, with the view of arriving at some " measure of
the amount of abraded stone transported to the sea, there to constitute the
materials of new strata now in progress of formation."           These researches
have become classic in the history of geology. Fifteen years later a similar
kind of inquiry greatly interested him when Lepsius called attention to
certain sculptured marks in the valley of the Nile ; and in 185 1 he obtained
from the Royal Society a grant of money for the purpose of excavations to
be made in the Nile alluvium.        To link together the earliest human with
the latest geological history seemed to him an object worthy of earnest
prosecution.     After four years of exploration, carried on according to a
plan drawn up and sent out by him to Egypt, Mr. Horner published the
results of his researches in the 'Philosophical Transactions' for 1855.       His
presidential addresses to the Geological Society were devoted to a survey
of the progress of geology. They are remarkable for the sympathy which
they show for views far in advance of those in which he had himself been
trained.
   But it is not by the number or character of his writings that Mr.
Horner's influence among the scientific men of his day is to be estimated.
His age and experience, his association with the early days of British
geology, his political connexions, his sound judgment and careful business
habits, joined to his excellent social qualities, gave him a position which
none can now fill. And he retained his influence in no small measure from
the singular fervour and youthfulness of his mind.         Instead of clinging to
old methods and beliefs as one of his years and early predilections might
have been expected to do, he was found ever ready to receive and sympa
thize with new developments of truth, and to uphold the cause of progress
in all departments of science. Even at the last, when he read his final
address to the Geological Society, he pleaded boldly for the high antiquity
of the human race in opposition to popular nreindipo                 mW"t »nH

                                         X
claimed for the speculations    of Mr. Darwin the thoughtful consideration
of all lovers of truth.      Mr. Horner's death severed          a link elosely and
visibly connecting the geologists of today with the early masters of the
science in this country, and closed a long and honourable life, full of all
kindliness, and ever devoted to the welfare      of his fellow men.
     Luke Howard       was born in London in      1 772, a date which carries    us
back to the early years of the reign of George        III.,  and opens a long vista
of history in which great political changes         are   rivalled  by the grandest
discoveries   of modern science.
    Luke Howard's parents, members of the Society of Friends, sent their
son to a country school in North Oxfordshire, where, as he was accus
tomed to say in after life, " he learnt too much of Latin grammar and too
little of anything else."    But having even then an observing eye, he began
to notice the appearances of the sky and forms of clouds ; and his inclina
tion towards meteorology appears to have been fixed by his impressions of
the remarkable atmospheric and meteoric phenomena which, as those ac
quainted with the history of meteorology       will remember, characterized the
year 1783.
     From school young Howard went as apprentice to a chemist at Stock
 port, which was then a quiet country town.           In this situation he devoted
 his spare hours to the course of self-improvement which he had already
 begun, and acquired that knowledge of French, botany, and the principles
 of chemistry, which were    so useful to  him in after years. The quickening
 effect produced on his mind by the works of Lavoisier he described as
 " like sunrise after morning moonlight," an effect which has been felt by
 many a student.
     In 1798 he entered into partnership with William Allen, whose repu
 tation as a manufacturing chemist has long been recognized.              This con
 nexion, however, was brought to an amicable close a few years later,
 and Howard, taking as his portion the laboratory at Plaistow, applied
 himself to the business therewith connected, and to his favourite scien
 tific pursuits.   Making use of his observations of natural phenomena, he
 wrote a paper " On the Modifications of Clouds," and read it at a meeting
 of the Askesian Society, of which he and his friend Allen were members.
 This paper, as he himself tells us, " the result of his early boyish musings,
 enriched by the observations of many a walk or ride, morning and evening,
 to or from his day's work at the laboratory," was published in 1803, and
 made known the author's name and ability to a wider circle.              The Aske
 sian was not    a  publishing Society ;   otherwise Luke        Howard might have
 been better known than he is as a pioneer      in departments of science besides
 meteorology.
                   " I know,"  writes one    of his friends, " that     one  or more
 of his papers related to atmospheric electricity, and another was an antici
 pation of the cell-theory, as regards the structure and functions of plants,
 founded on microscopic investigations."

                                            xi
    Many,   if not all, the articles on meteorology in ' Rees's Cyclopaedia,' were
written by Luke Howard.              He contributed a series of papers to the
 '
   Athenaeum,' embodying the results of his meteorological observations
from the year 1806; and these he published in two volumes (1818-20),
under the title " Climate of London, deduced from Meteorological Observa
tions made in the Neighbourhood."               This, republished in 1833, in three
volumes, has become one of our standard works on meteorology.
    Luke Howard was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1821.
From that time his reputation as a meteorologist increased, and eminent
persons in many parts of the world opened a correspondence with him,
which, in some instances, became the initiation of a lasting friendship.
 Although the increasing perfection of philosophical apparatus has super
seded some     of his methods of observation, there can be no doubt that his
labours imparted more of a scientific character to meteorology than it had
ever received before.        His classification of the clouds is the one still recog
nized at all observatories, and remains an evidence of the quick eye he had
for form and colour, and of the daily labour which was to him a labour of
love.    One who knew him well in the latter part of his life, says,
                                                                               " Those
who lived with him will not soon forget his interest in the appearance of
the sky.     1Whether at morning, noon, or night, he would go out to look
around on the heavens, and notice the changes going on.                 His intelligent
remarks and pictorial descriptions gave a character                to the scene never
before realized by some.         A beautiful sunset was a real and intense delight
to him ; he would stand at the window, change his position, go out of
doors, and watch it to the last lingering ray ; and long after he ceased,
from failing memory, to name the 'cirrus,' or 'cumulus,' he would derive a
mental    feast from      the gaze, and seem to recognize old friends          in their
outlines."
    Sharing in the active beneficence so characteristic of the Society of
Friends, Luke Howard readily aided endeavours for the religious and
moral as well as the material welfare of the community.                 Not least im
portant among these was the seeking to mitigate by pecuniary means the
sufferings of the Germans during the campaigns immediately preceding the
first abdication of Napoleon.          In Ackworth School — a well-known esta
blishment of the Friends — he took a lively interest ; and to participate
the more directly therein, as well as to offer hospitality to the annual
visitors to the school, he bought the Ackworth Villa estate in 1823,
making it his summer residence, and Tottenham his winter residence,
during the greater part of his life.
    In 1796 Luke Howard married Mariabella Eliot, a member of the same
Society with which he was himself connected.                Of their family of seven
children two sons only survived their parents.              About his eightieth year
he was much enfeebled by alarming              attacks  of illness  ; and the death of
his wife following,      after a union     of fifty-six years, added sorrow to his

                                         xii
weakness.     Henceforward   his life was a subdued waiting for the end.      He
died at Tottenham on the 21st March, 1864.
   A portrait of Luke Howard, bequeathed to one of his friends, is even
tually to be added to the Royal Society's        collection.  Besides the works
above mentioned, he published      — Essay    on the Modifications     of Clouds,
1832 ; Seven Lectures on Meteorology, 1837 ; a Cycle of Eighteen Years
in the Seasons of Britain, &c., 1842 ; Barometrographia — Twenty Years'
Variation of the Barometer in the Climate of Britain, 1847 ; Papers on
Meteorology, 1850-54 ; and The Yorkshireman, a religious and literary
Periodical, in  5 vols., 1833-37.
    William Chadwell Mylne             was born in London, on the 6th of    April,
 1781, and died on the 25th         of December,     1863.   His father, Robert
Mylne, F.R.S., a     native of Edinburgh, and the representative of a long
line of Scotch architects, commenced his career in London in 1759 by
building Blackfriars Bridge, and held the appointment of Engineer to the
New River Water Works, to which his son, the subject of this notice, suc
ceeded in 1810.
    Mr. Mylne may be said to have been from his cradle bred          an engineer.
When a boy only     sixteen  years   of age  he was   engaged with  the  younger
Mr. Golborne in the Fen country in staking out the lands for his father's
great scheme of the Eau Brink Cut, an undertaking which, through oppo
sing interests, was defeated at that time, but was eventually carried out by
Mr. Rennie in 1817.       Subsequently he was occupied on his father's well-
known    project, the  Gloucester   and Berkeley Ship Canal, seventy feet in
width  ; and he was generally engaged in assisting his father in the largest
professional practice of that day.
    Succeeding at thirty years of age to the sole conduct      of the New River
Works, Mr. Mylne had before him an arduous and responsible office. The
supply of water to London had hitherto been solely derived from the New
River and London Bridge Works ; but the rapid extension of the metro
polis led to the establishment of new companies, which gave rise to serious
contests, and for some years involved them in a ruinous competition.          Mr.
Mylne's ability and energy were soon tried in carrying out extensive changes
in the New River Works.        The old wooden main pipes, which up to 1810
were the principal conduits for the passage of water, were found insuffi
cient to stand the requisite pressure, and it was deemed expedient to sub
stitute pipes of cast iron.     This improvement was effected at a cost of
nearly half a million sterling ; and the whole was satisfactorily accom
plished under Mr. Mylne's judicious management.
    Notwithstanding the constant and unremitting engagements of the New
River business, Mr. Mylne was occupied in considerable engineering prac
tice, particularly in the Fen country, carrying out Sandys Cut, with several
other important drainage works.         Combining also the hereditary profes
sion of an Architect, he was engaged in bridge-building, and in the alte

                                        xiii
rations and extensions of many private mansions.          Among his works, the
single-arched   iron bridge  over   the River  Cam, at St. John's College, Cam
bridge, has been much admired ; and the church of St. Mark's, Clerken-
well, met with considerable      approval   at the period of its erection, forty
years since.
   Mr. Mylne in later years was much occupied in Government references,
and acted as surveyor for fifty years to the Stationers' Company, having
succeeded his father in that office.         He was also extensively engaged
before Parliamentary Committees on Water, Dock, and Drainage Works,
and was consulted in continental works of similar character.
   From the date of his entering on the direction of the New River Works
to his retirement, two years before his death — a period of fifty years — he
had the satisfaction to witness a very great advance in the income of the
Company, and a great extension of their works, consequent on the increased
demand     caused  by the further growth of the metropolis and awakened
attention   to its salubrity.    In 1852 new works were undertaken to the
extent of three quarters of a million sterling, and executed by him, with
the assistance of his son, R. W. Mylne, F.R.S.
   Mr. Mylne     was a man   of  a peculiarly kind and conciliatory disposition,
a peace-maker in all professional strife, of strict integrity and high honou
rable feeling.    He was for many years the guiding hand, as Treasurer, to the
Society   of Engineers styled " Smeatonians," in which,      as in all other Asso
ciations,  he won the respect, esteem, and almost affection of those with
whom     he was connected.      His retiring disposition caused him seldom to
take part in scientific discussions ; but he took a keen interest in all ques
tions of progress, and during his long career judiciously availed himself
of the opportunities offered him of adopting the new inventions of the age.
   Mr. Mylne was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society on the 16th of
March, 1826.
   Major-General Joseph Ellison Portlock, son of Captain Nathaniel
Portlock, a distinguished officer of the Royal Navy, was born at Gosport
in September 1794. He received his early education at a school in his
native town and at Tiverton, from which he went to the Royal Military
Academy at Woolwich.          In 1813 he took his first commission in the
Royal Engineers, and     was   sent in the  following year to Canada, where he
remained actively employed in military service or exploring expeditions
until 1822. He was present at the siege of Fort Erie ; and, on the retire
ment of the troops, he constructed the lines and bridge-head at Chippewa,
at which Sir Gordon Drummond made his successful stand, and saved
Upper Canada.
   In  1 824,  on the extension    of the Ordnance Survey to Ireland, Lieut.
Portlock was one of the officers first selected by Colonel Colby to take part
in the work ; and his earliest duty in connexion therewith, conjointly with
Lieuts. Drummond and Larcom, lay in working out the preliminaries of

                                         xiv
 what has since grown into first-rate importance as the Topographical
  Department.     The task at that time was beset by difficulties, which the
 progress of physical and mechanical science has since removed : the pre
 paration of the base-apparatus, the construction of astronomical and other
 surveying-instruments,    the contriving of signals by lamp and heliostat, and
 the training of sapper* for their special duties had to be undertaken under
 the disadvantage of newness.        But at that time the Duke of Wellington
 was Master-General of the Ordnance ; and supported by him, Colonel Colby
 carried out his plans in full efficiency.
     In 1825 the first detachments were removed to Ireland, and the first
 trigonometrical   station  was  taken up on Divis Mountain, near Belfast.
 There the first signals     and observations with lamp and heliostat were
 attempted,    and, to the satisfaction  of the originators, proved completely
 successful.   This was Lieut. Portlock's start on the trigonometrical branch
 of the survey, of which he shortly became the senior, and eventually sole
 officer.
     In addition to scientific skill and accuracy, great personal endurance
 was required in carrying on the observations.       In 1826 the camp on Slieve
 Donard, 2800 feet above the sea, was more than once blown down by the
 violence of the wind.     Colonel Colby was seriously injured by a fall while
 climbing from the observatory to his tent ; and communication with the
 country below involved both difficulty and danger.        Yet " Portlock," we
 are told,  " held out to the last.    For some weeks he was the only officer
 remaining ; but he struggled on, and brought the operations to a successful
 close."
    In the following year, while Colonel Colby was measuring the base on
 the shore of Lough Foyle, Lieut. Portlock, with Lieut. Larcom, carried
 out the observations at seven hill-stations, regardless of season and weather.
 In   1828, and for some    years afterwards, he performed the work single-
 handed, observing with the great theodolite from mountain after mountain
till the principal network of triangulation was complete, and the Irish
system was, by means of the lamp and heliostat signals, united to that of
Britain. In addition, care had to be taken for the direction of the secondary
triangulation for the details of the survey, and for the rectification of
errors and the discrepancies that were sure to occur at the junction of the
separate districts.     For this the whole had to be combined under one
general system ; and this additional labour Lieut. Portlock undertook
while still on the mountains.      He carried it on afterwards at his office in
Dublin ; and so well did he direct these secondary operations, that, after
the parties became used to the work, the surveying went on at the rate of
three million acres a year.
    The horizontal survey involved the necessity of an elaborate vertical
survey and calculations for altitude.       The altitudes were deduced at first
from the sea, by actual levelling from it to bases of altitude, and from them
transferred, by angles of elevation and depression, to the summit of every

                                        XV
bill and station, at distances averaging a mile asunder ; and on tins the
minor levelling of the detail survey depended. This also was ultimately
generalized into a system by Lieut. Portlock, and by him furnished regu
larly and rapidly. In fulfilling this purpose, he personally carried a line
of levelling across the island from the coast of Down to the coast of
Donegal, and caused several lines to be observed in other places.           In this
way a more general and homogeneous          system    of altitudes was obtained
than had ever before been attempted.         It supplied the data for the paper
                                                                   '
on Tides     by the Astronomer Royal,       published in the         Philosophical
Transactions.'
   In all this  we see a character conspicuous    alike for ability and energetic
perseverance ; but among its other elements, there was one which may be
properly noticed here — the praiseworthy example he set to the men under
his command.       They felt that with him they were in the hands of some
thing superior to themselves in intellect and acquirements, and they im
proved in a marked degree in the duties of the survey, in intelligence, and
the habit of obedience.
                             " They  needed only encouragement, no coercion,
and they rapidly acquired knowledge; to all of which I can testify,"
writes one of Portlock's brother officers ;
                                                 " and I am sure it is the expe
rience of the whole corps, more perhaps than any other in the army, that
when officers study the characters of their men, and use in governing them
the knowledge so acquired,       they are amply rewarded by the result, and
need no coarser discipline."      Sergeant Manning, who worked under Lieut.
Portlock through the whole period of his service on the Irish survey, was
chosen as the non-commissioned officer best fitted to take charge of a party
sent in 1848 to the Cape of Good Hope, to verify, under direction of Mr.
(now Sir Thomas) Maclear, the base measured by Lacaille nearly a century
before.
   Of the great value of the Irish survey in connexion with the geology,
archaeology, statistics, and industrial resources of Ireland, this is not the
place to speak.     Suffice it to say that when the time came for drawing up a
Report on the subject, Lieut. Portlock proved himself not less able as a
geological than as a geodetical observer.          His separate Report on the
Geology    of  Londonderry   has been  pronounced by high authority to be " a
perfect model for fidelity of observation and minute attention to pheno
mena." It is safe to affirm that the name of Portlock will ever be most
honourably associated with the history of the Ordnance Survey of Ireland.
   In 1843 Captain Portlock was ordered to Corfu on the ordinary duties
of his corps. In the comparative leisure which he then enjoyed he wrote
papers on the geology and natural history of the island, and on professional
subjects.     Some of these were published in the Reports of the British
Association, the Annals of Natural History, and Journal of the Geological
Society.    The Association voted him a grant " for the Exploration of the
Marine Zoology of Corfu," the results of which he embodied in two papers
subsequently published.       In these again we have evidence of his activity
of mind and accuracy of observation.

                                         zvi
    Recalled   to England in 1847, Major Portlock was stationed first at
 Portsmouth, and afterwards, as Lieut. -Colonel, at Cork.      From this time
 the literature of his profession and scientific study engaged much of his
 attention.    The annual volumes published by the British Association con
 tain papers from his pen ; and besides contributions to the Professional
 Papers of the corps, he wrote the articles
                                              " Geology and Geodesy," " Gal
 vanism," "Heat," " Palaeontology," andan Appendix on Gun-Cotton for the
Aide-mtmoire,     and the Treatise ou Geology in Weale's Rudimentary Series.
Others of his papers appear in the Journal of the Geological Society of
 Dublin, of which Society he was four times President.
    In  1851  Lieut.-Col. Portlock was appointed Inspector of Studies at the
Royal Military Academy, Woolwich, in which place he helped forward
measures for improving the scientific character of the system of education,
and increasing its efficiency generally ; and during this period he wrote the
articles " Cannon," " Fort," " Gunuery," and revised the article " War" for
the 8th edition of the ' Encyclopaedia Britannica,' besides translating for the
new series of Professional Papers a work on Gunpowder (from the French),
aud a treatise on Strategy (from the Italian).      He wrote also a memoir of
his former chief, Major-Geueral Colby, a publication honourable alike to
the subject and the author.       To all this must be added the two Addresses
delivered by him as President of the Geological Society in 1857 and 1858,
which, in the words of an eminent authority, are characterized by " faithful
and elaborate research."
    After resigning his appointment at Woolwich, and holding the command
for a few months at Dover, Major-General Portlock became in 1857 a
Member of the Council of Military Education, in whose proceedings, as
might have been expected, he took an active and earnest part.          His sen
timents with regard to the objects in view may be gathered from a memo
randum drawn up by one of his colleagues, who writes, " General Port-
lock's opinions on the questions presented to him as a Member of the
Council were in all cases those of the most forward advocates of educa
tion.    He looked upon competition as the great principle upon which
public appointments should be made, nor did he shrink from the inevi
table social results which such a change would involve.              Education,
combined with good morals, he regarded as constituting a paramount
claim to the rank of gentleman.        He was therefore a warm advocate of
the system of open competition as applied to the elections into the Royal
Military Academy of Woolwich; nor did he share the apprehension, which
has been very frequently expressed, of a consequent lowering of the social
position of the officers of the two great scientific corps.
    The weakness and infirmities of advancing years were borne by General
Portlock with a spirit not less calm and patient than that which animated
him through the hardships of the Ordnance Survey.           He retired to Lota,
a pleasant spot near Dublin, and there died on the 14th February, 1864.
He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in June 1837, and was a
member      of other metropolitan   and provincial Societies.   The honorary

                                          xvii
degree    of Doctor of Laws was conferred on him by Trinity College,
Dublin, in 1857."
    This brief notice of one who was for twenty-seven years an hononr to
the Society, may be fittingly closed with a few words of affectionate testi
mony by a brother officer, to whose Memoir we are indebted for much of
the foregoing.         " The characteristics which shone forth in Fortlock
during his well-spent life," writes Major-General Sir Thomas Larcom,
"whether as a soldier, a geographer, or a geologist, were — undaunted
courage in facing difficulties, Spartan endurance and invincible perse
verance in overcoming them.            Endowed, when in the zenith of his career,
with a frame and nerves of iron, he exhibited such a vast power of con
tinuous labour, that he achieved every object he had in view ; while great
 ability, and a pure love of knowledge, were in him guided and governed by
 the highest sense of honour and moral rectitude."
    Dr.  Archibald Robertson             was born at Cockburnspath in Scotland,
on the 3rd of December,         1 789.   He studied medicine at Edinburgh, and in
 1808 entered the Naval Medical             Service.  After some years of active
 employment in Europe and America, he on the termination of the war
 resorted again to Edinburgh for the further prosecution of study, and took
 his degree of M.D. in that University in 1817.              He then settled as a
 physician in Northampton ; and although for more than a twelvemonth
 he did not receive the encouragement of a single fee, he held on to the
 position he had taken, and was soon rewarded by large and lucrative
 employment,      his success being promoted and assured by his being in 1 820
 elected Physician to the Northampton Infirmary.            After a long and pros
 perous professional career, and the acquisition of a handsome independence
 honourably earned, he in 1853 resolved to withdraw himself from the
 labour of active practice.         He accordingly left Northampton, and passed
 the rest of   his life in retirement in the west of England.
     Dr. Robertson was a man of considerable literary accomplishment, and,
 before his time became engrossed by practice, he was in the habit of writing
 literary articles in some of the journals and reviews of the day. He con
 tributed two short articles on professional subjects to Forbes's 'Cyclopaedia
 of Medicine.' He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society on the
  11th  of February, 1836.
     Both   as a physician     and as a member of society, Dr. Robertson was
 highly   esteemed.      His death took place at Clifton, on the 1 9th of October,
  1864.
v- Giovanni Antonio Amedeo Plana, descended from an ancient and
 distinguished family of Guarene in Piedmont, was born at Voghera, on the
 8th of November, 1781.            In 1800 he entered the Polytechnic School of
 Paris, where he      so greatly distinguished   himself that, on the 23rd of May,
  1803, he was appointed Professor         in the Artillery School of Alessandria.

On the 28th of November, 1809, he presented to the Academy of Turin a
paper, entitled "Equation de la courbe formee par une lame elastique
quelles que soient les forces qui agissent sur la lame," the first of a series
of papers offered to the             far too numerous to be recorded in
                           same Academy,
the present notice. On the 15th of March, 1811, on the recommendation
of Lagrange, he obtained the Professorship of Astronomy in the Uni
versity of Turin,   and on the 5th of March, 1813, became Director of the
Observatory.     After the Restoration, the king, Victor Emmanuel I., who
took a personal interest in the progress of astronomy and frequently sent
for Plana to explain various celestial phenomena, augmented the income of
the Observatory, and transferred it from the house of the Academy to a
better situation on the west tower of the north face of the Palazzo Ma-
dama.    During the years 1821, 1822, 1823 he was associated with Carlini
in the operation of measuring an arc of parallel in Savoy and Piedmont.
The results were published in 1825, under the title "Observations geode*-
siques et astronomiques pour la mesure d'un arc de parallele moyen." In
1828 the authors received from the Institute the Lalande prize for the
astronomical part of their joint work.   In 1832 he published his ' Theorie
du mouvement de la Lune,' in three large quarto volumes.       This he re
garded as the most important of all the labours of his life. For this work
the Copley Medal was awarded to him in 1834, and the Gold Medal of
the Astronomical Society in 1840.      In announcing the latter award, Sir
John Herschel, President of the Society, made the following quotation
from the " Discours preliminaire
                                   " of the ' Theorie de la Lune ' — " Je
n'ai pu me faire aider par personne ; j'ai du traverser aeul cette longue
chaine des calculs, etil n'est pas e*tonnant    par inadvertence, j'ai omis

                                    " When we look at the work itself there
seems something awful      in this announcement."
   In1822, on the occasion of the appearance of his " Me'moire sur les
mouvements des fluides qui recouvrent une spheroide peu pres spherique,"
                                                       a

                 a                  Member of the Institute, and in 1860 one of
the eight Foreign Associates.       In December 1851 he became President of
the Royal Academy of Turin.          He was elected Foreign Member of the
Royal Society in 1827. He received from his own king the title of Baron,
and was created  a    Senator on the formation of the Senate in 1848.
   He delighted    in  the classic poets, and was not more remarkable for the
accuracy and elegance of his mathematical investigations than for the pre
cision of his style in writing.    He was in the habit,
                                                      it   issaid, of bestowing
extraordinary care on the composition and correction of his works.
  On the 6th of January, 1864, he read paper before the Royal Academy
                                           a
of Turin, entitled   " M6moire   sur les formules du mouvement circulaire, et
du mouvement elliptique libre autour d'un point excentrique par l'action
d'une force centrale."  This was his last work. He died at Turin on the
20th of January, 1864, leaving  widow (Lagrange's niece) and
                                 a                            daughter.

       Heinrich Rose was        born on the 6th of August, 1795, at Berlin, where
    his father, son of the discoverer of the fusible alloy known by his name, was
    Pharmacist and Assessor of the Superior Medical College.               His father
    died in 1807, leaving behind him a widow and four young boys.            H. Rose
   studied Pharmacy     first in  Dantzic,   where  he experienced the horrors of a
   siege, and nearly lost his life by    typhus fever.    He served in the campaign
   of 1815, together with his three brothers, of whom one is Professor
   Gustav Rose, the distinguished Mineralogist of Berlin.          On the conclusion
   of the war he continued his studies in Berlin, working in Klaproth's labo
   ratory during the summer of 1816. In September 1816 he entered the
   Pharmacy of Dr. Bidder of Mitau.            About the end of 1819 he went to
   Stockholm, where he worked        for  a year and a half in the laboratory of Ber-
   zelius, who recommended him to devote himself to the teaching of che
   mistry as a profession.      On quitting Stockholm he resided for some time
   at Kiel, where he wrote his Dissertation " de Titanio ej usque connubio
   cum oxygenio et sulphure," and took the Degree of Doctor of Philosophy.
   In the summer of 1822 he obtained the sanction to become a private
   teacher in the University of Berlin, and began a course of lectures on prac
   tical analytical chemistry in the autumn of the same year.             He was ap
   pointed   Extraordinary    Professor  in  1823,  and Ordinary   Professor of Che
  mistry in 1835. He was elected a Member of the Berlin Academy in
   1832, Foreign Member of the Royal Society in 1842, Corresponding Mem
  ber of the Institute in 1843, and was invested with the Prussian order of
 pour le mtrite.
      His memoirs on inorganic chemistry and chemical analysis,         a department
  in which he stood unrivalled,       to the number of nearly, if not quite, two
  hundred, are contained principally in Gilbert's and PoggendorfFs ' Annalen.'
  The results of his researches in analytical chemistry are embodied in his
  ' Handbuch der analytischen Chemie,' which came out in one volume in
   1829.    A  second edition, in two volumes, was published in 1831, a fourth
  in 1838, a fifth in 1850, the sixth (so thoroughly revised that it should be
  regarded as a new work) was published in French, at Paris, in 1861.             In
  forming    an estimate   of the labour expended in preparing this voluminous
  treatise, it must  be  remembered     that each precept is the result of an expe
 riment (frequently of a series of experiments) made by the author.           During
 the last years of his life he was engaged in writing an elementary treatise
 on analytical chemistry, about thirty sheets of which were printed during
 his lifetime.    For this work also a large number of experiments were made
 in his laboratory.     His activity and industry increased with advancing age.
 A year before his death he was heard to exclaim, " I have at most only a
 few years to live, and so much remains            to be done!"    During the latter

                                        XX
part of his life his only recreation was a long walk taken late in the evening,
in all weathers, throughout the year.       He was the first person in all Ger
many who established a class of working pupils.          He received them in hie
private laboratory without fee, providing at his own cost most of the appa
ratus and all the reagents they required.
    He was spared the pain of feeling the approach of bodily and mental
infirmity.     He lectured in full possession of all his faculties only eight clays
before his death, and he was confined to his bed only seven days.          On the
27th of January, 1864, he asked for writing-materials to correct some proof
sheets, saying that he felt well, and that he could now leave his bed.        That
afternoon he died, of inflammation of the lungs.           He left behind him a
widow, his third wife, and a grandchild, the daughter of Professor Karsten.
Her mother, H. Rose's only child, died some years since.
    Friedrich Georg Wilhelm Struve                was born at Altona on the
 15th  of April, 1793. He was the fourth son of Dr. Jacob Struve, Direc
tor of the High School of Altona.        His mother was the danghter of Pas
tor Stinde, Chaplain to Peter III., Emperor of Russia.           In order to avoid
the French conscription, he went in 1808 to the University of Dorpat,
 where his elder brother Carl was a Classical Lecturer. At first he devoted
himself to Philology, a study in which he delighted to the end of his life.
 He supported himself partly by private tuition in the family of M. de
 Berg, and partly on some pecuniary assistance afforded him by the Uni
versity on the recommendation of the elder Parrot, who had discovered
Struve's promise of future eminence.        In 1811, after taking his first de
gree in Philology, he commenced the study of Astronomy under Huth,
 who permitted him the free use of the few instruments contained in the
 Observatory at that time ; and in August of that year he verified by obser
vation the conclusions of Sir William Hcrschel respecting the angular mo
 tion of the two stars composing Cas or.       In the autumn of 1813 he took
 the degree of Doctor of Philosophy, the title of his thesis on that oceasipn
 being
         " De geographica speculao Dorpatensis positione." In November
 1813 he was appointed Extraordinary Professor of Mathematics and
 Astronomy, and, after the death of Huth, Ordinary Professor, and Director
of the Observatory.       During the years 1816-19 he surveyed and mapped
 Livonia at the request of the Economical Society of that Province, the
 only   instrument  employed    by him in the survey being a 10-inch sextant
by Troughton.
    In 1821 the Observatory of Dorpat was supplied with a meridian-circle
by Reichenbach and Ertel, and in 1824 with an equatorially mounted re
 fractor,  of 9 Paris inches aperture and 160 Paris inches focal length, by
 Fraunhofer. The principal results of the observations made by Struve at
 Dorpat during the years 1814-1838 are given in the works entitled "Ob-
servationes astronomicae institute; in specula Dorpatensi, 1817-1839,"
 " Catalogus    795  stellarum  duplicium, 1822," " Catalogus novus stella-
rum    duplicium et multiplicium, 1827 " [in the introduction to this

   work it is incidentally noticed that on one occasion he had observed unin

  Dorpater Sternwarte angestellt, 1839."
      In the spring of 1839 he left Dorpat to assume the Directorship of the
  Observatory of Pulkowa, built in accordance with his own plans, and fur
  nished with instruments contrived and executed under his own directions.
  An account of the building and instruments is given in his " Description de
  l'Observatoire central de Pulkowa, 1845."              In 1843 he published his
  " Catalogue de 514 etoiles doubles et multiples, &c., et Catalogue de 256
  etoiles   doubles principales    ou la distance   des composantes est de 32" a
  2'  &c.," and " Sur le coefficient constant dans l'aberration       des etoiles fixes
  deduit   des observations  qui ont  iti executees  a l'observatoire   de Poulkova."
  In 1847 he published      "  Etudes d'Astronomie stellaire."
      Struve devoted a portion of the summer for many years to the vast un
  dertaking of measuring an arc of the meridian of 25° 20' from Fuglenaes
  on the Arctic Ocean, lat. 70° 40', to Ismail on the Danube, lat. 45° 20'.
  This work      may be considered the principal labour of his life : he
  was assisted in it by General Tenner and the astronomers Selander and
  Hansteen.      It lasted thirty-seven years, and was completed in 1853. An
 account of the measurement is given by Struve in " Breitengradmessung in
 den Ostseeprovinzen       Russlands ausgefuhrt und bearbeitet in den Jahren
  1821 bis 1831," in "Expose* historique des travaux execute* jusqu'a la fin
 de l'annee 1851, pour la mesure de l'arc du meridien, &c., I860," and in
 " Arc    du meridien de 25° 20' entre le Danube et la mer Glaciale,         1860."
     Besides the works already mentioned, he is the author of many separate
 treatises, and of papers in Bode's ' Jahrbuch,' the ' Zeitschrift ' of von
 Lindcnau and Bohnenberger, von Zach's ' Correspondence Astronomique,'
                                             '
 and the ' Bulletins' and ' Memoires of the Imperial Academy of St.
 Petersburg.
     In 1858 he was attacked by a severe illness, for which rest from work and
travelling were prescribed.        These remedies, however, failed to remove the
consequences of his malady. In 1862 he retired from the post of Director
of the Pulkowa       Observatory, and was succeeded by his son O. W. Struve.
He then went to live with his family in St. Petersburg, occupying the
remainder of his life with the subject of double stars.                On the 4th of
November he felt indisposed ; his strength failed rapidly           ; and he died on
the morning of November the 23rd, 1864.
     lie  was elected   Foreign Member of the Royal Society in 1827, and in
                                                                                '
the same year one of the Royal Medals was awarded to him for his Cata-
logus novus Stellarum duplicium.'           He received the Gold Medal of the
                          Society in 1826,
                                            " for his important    researches on the
Royal Astronomical

                                       XXII
subject of multiple stars."      His name appears in the list of Associates
in the first volume of the     ' Memoirs of the Astronomical Society.'      In
 1833 he was elected Corresponding Member of the Institute.
   Struve married twice   ; he had twelve children by his first wife, of whom
eight  survive, and eight by his second wife, now his widow, of whom four
survive.
   Much of the present notice has been derived from a very comprehensive
sketch  of Struve's life and labours in the Proceedings of the Astronomical
Society, by the Rev. C. Pritchard.
